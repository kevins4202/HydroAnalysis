paper also evaluated the groundwater salinity variations with bore well depth thus we now provide important information of groundwater salinity variations at spatio temporal depth levels in the rohtak district haryana india 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the rohtak district of haryana in india has a geographical area of 1745 km2 of which 1365 km2 occupies a basin with an elevation from 216 to 275 m kaushik et al 2018 the rohtak district is located between 28 40 46 n and 29 06 08 n latitude and between 76 12 40 e and 76 52 00 e longitudes rohtak is a subtropical semi arid region with an annual average rainfall of 529 mm kumar et al 2016 the groundwater serves as the primary source of freshwater in the district the study area has hot and dry summers and cold winters while the monsoon lasts for a shorter period july to september the district is divided into an old alluvium and a fluvio aeolian plain the old alluvial plain has a gentle slope in the northern and central parts while the fluvio aeolian plain is present in the southern and south western parts of the district kaushik et al 2018 the district s soil is a part of indo gangetic alluvium and is mainly derived from a heterogeneous structure with calcareous layers of sand silt kankar and gravels at shallow depths majority of these heterogenous sediments are derived from the himalayan rivers and have frequent presence of calcareous layers kumar et al 2013 angular barriers occur largely at depth greater than 150 cm the presence of small quartzite outcrops typically indicate hard rock exposure in the district kumar et al 2016 the soil from the districts has a dry brown color low to moderate organic carbon low to moderate available phosphorus low available nitrogen and medium to high available potash the borehole data from the study area showed the dominance of clay formation with a 370 m bed rock depth cgwb 2013 the northern area of the district is at higher altitude and slopes towards the southern and eastern regions at the rate of 19 cm km fig 1 a ridges were also present in south central and western regions of the district fig 1a the district s drainage pattern showed the drains running from the north to east west and south fig 1b the district has poor drainage patterns with water logging conditions occurring toward the central depression region resulting in water logging and salinization kaushik et al 2018 sahu 2014 the sand and gravel acts as the main water bearing formations in the district the aquifers in the district are classified into aquifer 1 ground surface 150 m aquifer 2 150 450 m and aquifer 3 450 900 m kaushik et al 2019 the aquifer 1 is mainly characterized by coarser sand and gravel of fluvial origin with average transmissivity lateral conductivity and a specific yield of 1500 m2 day 15 m day 20 respectively under unconfined and semi confined conditions aquifer 2 has mixed clay with sand at average transmissivity of 500 m2 day lateral conductivity of 8 m day and specific yield of 10 in confined or semiconfined conditions the first and second aquifers are separated by thick horizons of clay lenses aquifer 3 is clay dominated with intermittent sand and gravel deposits the average transmissivity lateral conductivity and specific yield of aquifer 3 are 300 m2 day 2 m day and 5 respectively kaushik et al 2019 the entire district has a very shallow water depth at 5 m below ground level kaushik et al 2018 all 5 blocks kalanaur lakhan majra meham rohtak and sampla of the district were covered for the groundwater sampling fig 2 2 2 sample collection analytical methodology and data interpretation a total of 620 groundwater samples were collected from 82 villages in rohtak district of haryana by the simple randomization method fig 1 groundwater sample collection transportation and analysis were carried out following standard protocols with proper qas and qcs as recommended by apha 2005 the sampling was performed for four consecutive seasons december 2017 june 2018 december 2018 and june 2019 a total of 155 groundwater samples were collected from 102 hand pumps 47 bore wells and 6 dug wells government has provided at least one bore well in every village study area to supply drinking water to majority of the households for consecutive seasons the samples were collected from the same sites to minimize sampling variations in the results the samples were collected in pre cleaned 1 l polyethylene bottles each hand pump was run for 10 min to remove stagnant water and the sample bottles were rinsed with sample water thrice before the sample collection sample altitude latitude and longitude were recorded using a calibrated gps model garmin 12 hand pump bore well and dug well depths were also recorded at the sample site the average depth of different sources varies with dug well bore well and hand pump are 7 21 m 48 79 m and 8 6 m respectively the groundwater salinity tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured using a multi ion meter model 5 star thermo orion to ensure reproducibility all samples were analyzed in triplicate along with blanks and thermo orion standards the multi ion meter was calibrated with thermo orion standards for ec tds and salinity the standards were also evaluated as known samples after every 20 samples to ensure high replicability the data has been analyzed and plotted using statistical package r software version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 and microsoft excel 2013 arcgis ver 10 5 software is used for spatial analysis and parameter mapping on the basis of the inverse distance weighted idw method using a spatial analyst tool the seismotectonic framework of the study site was identified through digitization using the editor tool of arcgis 10 5 a seismotectonic atlas of india s base map was used for the digitization of the maps in the study the elevation and drainage map of the study site were prepared using the hydrology tool of arc gis 10 5 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm having 90 m resolution satellite dataset was used to extract the digital elevation data 3 results and discussion the statistical summary of salinity tds and electrical conductivity ec for both the pre and post monsoon seasons of two consecutive year samplings are presented in table 1 parameter ranges and mean values with standard deviation from all the blocks of rohtak district are presented the salinity of the groundwater in the district ranges between 0 2 and 8 0 ppt for all seasons table 1 this wide range in salinity can be due to differences in subsurface geology rate of evaporated salts dissolution and rate of evaporation from water tables abu alnaeem et al 2018 argamasilla et al 2017 tds and ec concentrations of the groundwater range between 189 and 13 387 mg l and 210 14 874 μs cm over all seasons in the district respectively the highest salinities tds and ec concentrations were shown in post monsoon 2018 and pre monsoon 2019 table 1 the kalanaur block exhibited highest salinity 0 4 8 0 ppt tds 388 13 387 mg l and electrical conductivity 431 14 874 μs cm values table 1 the mean salinity graph of all the blocks and rohtak district is presented in fig 3 the salinity trend follows the order lakhan majra meham rohtak sampla kalanaur blocks fig 3 post monsoon seasons always gave higher salinities as compared to pre monsoon seasons with the lowest salinity observed in pre monsoon 2018 fig 3 the increasing salinity observed on a yearly basis illustrated the continuous deterioration of the groundwater sources in the area the highest salinity observed in sampla and kalanaur blocks can be due to water logging high residence time for aquifer dissolution and low water levels this clearly correlates with the low altitude area existing in the eastern and western regions occupied by the blocks in the district fig 2 a previous study also indicated the salinity prone conditions due to water logging on 60 of the land area in rohtak district kaushik et al 2018 total dissolved solids tds in the groundwater range from 204 2 to 7651 for post monsoon 2017 121 to 7242 for pre monsoon 2018 231 9 to 8615 for post monsoon 2018 and 230 to 5631 pre monsoon 2019 respectively table 1 in general post monsoon mean tds concentrations were higher than pre monsoon samples high post monsoon tds values suggested the role of leaching and infiltration of rain or recharge water through aquifer sediments krishan et al 2021 misra and mishra 2007 seasonal variation of groundwater tds values across all four seasons is summarized in table 2 according to the todd and mays classification 2004 according to this classification water samples can be divided into types i iv on the basis of their tds concentration type i with a tds 1000 mg l is classified as freshwater type ii waters have tds values between 1000 and 10 000 mg l and are classified as brackish type iii and type iv waters have tds values between 10 000 100 000 and 100 000 respectively and are classified as saline and brine table 2 none of the groundwater samples were type iii saline or type iv brine in rohtak district across all seasons only 35 42 36 and 28 groundwater samples in post monsoon 2017 pre monsoon 2018 post monsoon 2018 and pre monsoon 2019 respectively were type i i e freshwater table 2 the remaining 66 58 64 and 72 of these samples were type ii and brackish in nature table 2 electrical conductivity values of the groundwater samples ranged between 0 21 and 14 87 ms cm for all seasons in the rohtak district table 1 mean electrical conductivity ec values of the groundwater samples during post monsoon 2017 pre monsoon 2018 post monsoon 2018 and pre monsoon 2019 were 2 66 2 41 2 78 and 2 85 ms cm respectively table 1 water samples can also be classified on the basis of their electrical conductivity thus the rhoades and richards classifications rhoades et al 1992 were used for groundwater samples classification table 3 according to rhoades rhoades et al 1992 water can be classified into six types ec 0 70 ms cm falls under type i and is characterized as non saline water ec values between 0 70 and 2 00 ms cm represent slightly saline type ii water while ec values between 2 00 and 10 00 ms cm classifies water as type iii for moderately saline water type iv waters have ec values between 10 00 and 25 00 ms cm and are characterized as highly saline water type v is very high salinity water with ec values from 25 00 to 45 00 ms cm and water having an ec 45 00 ms cm type vi is considered brine groundwater samples of the rohtak district fall under the first four categories only with most of the samples falling under type iii i e moderately saline table 3 thus the majority of groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking as well as irrigation purposes under these classifications table 3 another classification by richards categorizes water quality into excellent 0 25 good 0 25 0 75 fair medium 0 75 2 25 and poor bad 2 25 for irrigation purposes richards 1954 less than 10 of the rohtak district s groundwater samples are considered good water quality using this classification table 3 the remaining rohtak groundwater samples are of only medium and poor type for all seasons table 3 obviously water quality of rohtak is unsuitable for drinking domestic and agricultural purposes according to the richards classification richards 1954 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution the spatial and temporal distribution of ec tds and salinity of the rohtak district s groundwater samples were analyzed and represented in fig sm1 fig 4 and fig 5 respectively fig sm1 summarize the spatial mapping of the ec from the district the spatial maps showed the high ec values correlated with the presence of surface water bodies as represented in fig 2 similarly high tds concentrations were found along the surface water bodies fig 4 this illustrates the role of anthropogenic activities coupled with surface water intrusion as the main source of contamination the western part of the district displayed the highest ec tds and salinity concentrations for all seasons fig sm1 fig 4 and fig 5 the central part of rohtak district is a lowland area and is a recharge zone with low mineral concentrations and shorter residence times in the aquifer kaushik et al 2018 weert et al 2009 this led to the low ec tds and salinity concentrations in the central region of the district as compared to its adjacent areas fig sm1 fig 4 and fig 5 therefore the central part of the rohtak district exhibited lower salinity than the adjoining area 3 2 correlation between groundwater salinity and aquifer depth the groundwater samples from the study area were collected from hand pump water dug well water and bore well water sources the majority of waters from hand pumps are unsuitable for drinking due to its bitter taste almost the entire rohtak district population depends on drinking supply water mean salinity values for all four seasons and aquifer depth were plotted to evaluate the drinking water suitability fig 6 hand pump water samples 102 samples average of all four seasons presented as red dots with low aquifer depths up to 20 m represent the highest salinity range from 0 2 to 7 0 ppt as compared to groundwater from other sources this wide range of salinity can occur because of variations in subsurface geology evaporation rate and dissolution of evaporated salts from the shallow water tables of the hand pumps abu alnaeem et al 2018 argamasilla et al 2017 presence of calcium carbonate layers at shallow depths result in high salinity in the shallow groundwater of the district kaushik et al 2018 the bore well water samples 47 samples average of all four seasons presented by green squares displayed low salinity 2 ppt due to deep depth of the bore well fig 6 thus salinity dropped with increase in aquifer depth higher salinity occurs in low depth water sources because shallow aquifers are more prone to a higher dissolution of aquifer material through the action of recharge water lorenzen et al 2012 thus government or private bodies have developed water stations by constructing deep bore wells for freshwater supply for the majority of the population dug well water samples 6 samples average of all four seasons presented by blue triangles contained less salinity even at low aquifer depth fig 6 this is because the collected open well water samples were located in meham and lakhan majra blocks this correlates with low salinity tds and ec concentrations in other water sources from these blocks further the rohtak district vertical salinity variation profiles in each block were also plotted fig 7 the average salinity of the rohtak district decreased with increase in aquifer depth with the highest salinity of 1 71 ppt found at a depth of 10 m below ground level fig 7a the presence of calcium carbonate layers at shallow depths in the district soil within the old alluvial plain and the fluvio alluvial plain aeolian sand deposits result in high salt concentrations in the shallow groundwater kaushik et al 2018 the rohtak block exhibited a similar salinity depth profile with small changes in the deep aquifer to the rohtak district fig 7b salinity values in the rohtak block abruptly changes after 50 m depth this can be correlated with the presence of bga 50 mgal in the region fig 2b the salinity values in the rohtak district decreased as the depth increased from 60 to 70 m and then increased again with increase in depth to 80 m fig 7b the meham block total samples 136 showed a massive decline in salinity from 1 7 ppt at 20 m depth to 0 5 ppt at 30 m and then remain unchanged fig 7c huge variations in groundwater salinity up to 30 m depth in meham block may be due to the presence of a neotectonic fault in the region as represented in fig 2b the presence of bga bouguer gravity anomaly 40 mgal in the region can also increase the variations in groundwater salinity in the block the sampla block contained a high salinity of 2 0 ppt up to the 40 m depth then the mean salinity decreased rapidly to 1 0 ppt between 40 and 60 m depth this rapid change can be because of the presence of bga 50 mgal in the block fig 2b further increasing the depth from 60 to 80 m depth increased the salinity fig 7d a possible reason for this abrupt change can be the presence of a mahendragarh dehradun fault as well as the presence of minor lineament fig 1b such subsurface faults can lead to deep and shallow aquifer mixing resulting in abrupt pattern changes in salinity dissolved ion concentrations the vertical profile of mean salinity values in lakhan majra occurs in a narrow range from 1 13 ppt to 0 75 ppt fig 7e the consistency in the mineral dissolution in lakhan majra groundwaters at different aquifer depths could cause this narrow salinity range the location of the lakhan majra block in the high altitude areas of the northern district also provides good drainage system this promotes proper discharge and reduced water logging conditions also contributing toward the constant vertical salinity profile in the kalanaur block the maximum value of mean salinity was 2 26 ppt at a 20 m depth this increase in depth from 20 to 30 40 m showed rapid decline in salinity which correlates with the presence of bga 40 mgal in the region a further increase in depth caused abrupt changes in the vertical salinity profile with mean salinity values 0 5 ppt below 70 m depth fig 7f thus deep drilling 70 m deep is favorable for drawing good drinking water in kalanaur 3 3 pearson correlation matrix the pearson correlation matrix of aquifer depth salinity electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds with each other is provided in fig 8 very high positive correlations 0 99 between salinity electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were achieved for all water source types fig 8 almost equivalent aquifer depth correlations with salinity 0 39 electrical conductivity 0 40 and total dissolved solids 0 40 were achieved this is because ec tds and salinity are highly interdependent parameters among all sources the bore well water showed least positive correlation hand pump and dug well waters showed negative correlations the negative correlation indicates an inverse proportionality between salinity concentration and aquifer depth fig 8 3 4 base exchange index groundwater samples were classified using the base exchange index r1 given by soltan 1998 1999 the base exchange index equation given below 1 base exchange index r 1 n a c l s o 4 2 all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the r1 1 values represent groundwater sources of the na so4 2 type and r1 1 represents na hco3 type groundwaters bikundia and mohan 2014 soltan 1998 1999 most of the groundwater samples from both pre and post monsoon seasons fall under na so4 2 type water with r1 values 1 fig 9 3 5 meteoric genesis index meteoric genesis index is also used to categorize groundwater based upon its percolation depth into the subsurface soltan 1998 1999 the meteoric genesis index r2 can be calculated using equation 2 2 meteoric genesis index r 2 na k cl so 4 2 here ionic na k cl and so4 2 concentrations are expressed in meq l the value of r2 1 categorizes groundwater sources as deep meteoric water percolation types while r2 1 categorizes groundwater as a shallow meteoric water percolation type soltan 1998 1999 about 95 of groundwater samples from the study area belong to the deep meteoric water percolation type the remaining 5 of groundwater samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type in both pre and post monsoon seasons fig 10 3 6 chadha diagram chadha s diagram showed the majority of the samples lying on the negative x and y axes fig 11 therefore majority of the water samples fall within sub field 6 fig 11 the subfield 6 represents samples where the alkaline earth metals are exceeding alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions bikundia and mohan 2014 such a water type is characterized by permanent hardness and it does not deposit residual sodium carbonates during irrigation the positions of the data points in the proposed diagram represent ca2 mg2 cl type ca2 mg2 dominant cl type or cl dominant ca2 mg2 type waters bikundia and mohan 2014 a small number of samples also falls under sub field 7 fig 11 in subfield 7 alkali metals exceed alkaline earth metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions such water type generally create salinity problems both in irrigation and drinking use the positions of data points in the proposed diagram represent na cl type na2so4 2 type na dominant cl type or cl dominant na type waters bikundia and mohan 2014 kut et al 2019 3 7 bivariate analysis the bivariate analysis of groundwater samples was conducted using molar ratios of different ions in groundwater fig 12 sunkari et al 2021 the bivariate analysis curves confirmed the dominance of ion exchange processes in groundwater hydro geochemistry fig 12 the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 plot shows the dominance of silicate weathering fig 12a all samples in the plot lies in right side of the plot showed the presence of excess hco3 so4 2 in the groundwater samples fig 12a further plots of mg2 vs ca2 mg2 and ca2 vs ca2 so4 2 also showed shifting to the right and indicated less involvement of dolomite and gypsum weathering respectively fig 12b and c the na vs cl plot also confirms ion exchange dominates the groundwater geochemistry with little halite dissolution fig 12d further silicate weathering with less evaporite dissolution was confirmed by mg2 na vs ca2 na and hco3 na vs ca2 na plots fig 12 e and f thus bivariate analysis confirmed the role of forward ion exchange processes with silicate weathering in the groundwater hydro geochemistry of the rohtak district 4 groundwater salinity management strategies the people of this area depend upon groundwater and government supply water treated groundwater mainly thus groundwater salinity management strategies are necessary groundwater management strategies could include both in situ and ex situ strategies gupta and misra 2018 ex situ strategies for groundwater treatment include coagulation electrocoagulation membrane filtration precipitation and adsorption using red mud activated alumina and mud pots gupta and misra 2018 in situ strategies include dilution of groundwater aquifers through artificial groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting gupta and misra 2018 the kalanaur block showed highest salinity due to water logging conditions thus providing proper drainage facilities and groundwater recharging facilities could be a solution water conservation and management strategies can improve groundwater quality and groundwater table depletion extensive development of groundwater recharge structures such as water recharge shafts surface ponds recharge dams and rooftop harvesting are recommended restricting groundwater exploitation by controlling the digging of new wells is also recommended to reduce stress on the aquifer and for giving time for recharging abulibdeh et al 2021 all these management strategies together with strict policy framework are recommended for improving groundwater quality and minimizing salinity issue in rohtak district 5 conclusions a total of 620 groundwater samples were collected across 4 seasons in 2 consecutive years from all five blocks of the rohtak district of haryana india hand pumps n 102 bore well n 47 and dug well water n 6 samples were collected for groundwater assessment the study evaluates the ec tds and salinity values to assess the groundwater suitability for drinking domestic and agricultural purposes the area showed maximum ec tds and salinity values of 14 874 μs cm 13 387 mg l and 8 0 ppt respectively mean groundwater salinity parts per thousands trend of the rohtak s regional land blocks followed the order lakhan majra meham rohtak sampla kalanaur high altitude and proper drainage led to low groundwater salinity in the lakhan majra block the kalanaur block showed the highest salinity due to water logging a constant rise in ec tds and salinity concentrations was observed in subsequent samplings with higher values in second year this is consistent with a rapid groundwater quality decline and further recommends the need of long term continuous monitoring studies in the rohtak district a vertical salinity profile displaying maximum groundwater salinity occurred at depths above 20 m for most samples low depth 20 m hand pumps in the area showed the highest ec tds and salinity concentrations higher salinity in post monsoon sampling was consistently observed compared to pre monsoon samples this suggests the dissolution and mixing of aquifer materials into groundwater after the monsoon the study recommends using deep bore well depths for drinking domestic and

district haryana india 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the rohtak district of haryana in india has a geographical area of 1745 km2 of which 1365 km2 occupies a basin with an elevation from 216 to 275 m kaushik et al 2018 the rohtak district is located between 28 40 46 n and 29 06 08 n latitude and between 76 12 40 e and 76 52 00 e longitudes rohtak is a subtropical semi arid region with an annual average rainfall of 529 mm kumar et al 2016 the groundwater serves as the primary source of freshwater in the district the study area has hot and dry summers and cold winters while the monsoon lasts for a shorter period july to september the district is divided into an old alluvium and a fluvio aeolian plain the old alluvial plain has a gentle slope in the northern and central parts while the fluvio aeolian plain is present in the southern and south western parts of the district kaushik et al 2018 the district s soil is a part of indo gangetic alluvium and is mainly derived from a heterogeneous structure with calcareous layers of sand silt kankar and gravels at shallow depths majority of these heterogenous sediments are derived from the himalayan rivers and have frequent presence of calcareous layers kumar et al 2013 angular barriers occur largely at depth greater than 150 cm the presence of small quartzite outcrops typically indicate hard rock exposure in the district kumar et al 2016 the soil from the districts has a dry brown color low to moderate organic carbon low to moderate available phosphorus low available nitrogen and medium to high available potash the borehole data from the study area showed the dominance of clay formation with a 370 m bed rock depth cgwb 2013 the northern area of the district is at higher altitude and slopes towards the southern and eastern regions at the rate of 19 cm km fig 1 a ridges were also present in south central and western regions of the district fig 1a the district s drainage pattern showed the drains running from the north to east west and south fig 1b the district has poor drainage patterns with water logging conditions occurring toward the central depression region resulting in water logging and salinization kaushik et al 2018 sahu 2014 the sand and gravel acts as the main water bearing formations in the district the aquifers in the district are classified into aquifer 1 ground surface 150 m aquifer 2 150 450 m and aquifer 3 450 900 m kaushik et al 2019 the aquifer 1 is mainly characterized by coarser sand and gravel of fluvial origin with average transmissivity lateral conductivity and a specific yield of 1500 m2 day 15 m day 20 respectively under unconfined and semi confined conditions aquifer 2 has mixed clay with sand at average transmissivity of 500 m2 day lateral conductivity of 8 m day and specific yield of 10 in confined or semiconfined conditions the first and second aquifers are separated by thick horizons of clay lenses aquifer 3 is clay dominated with intermittent sand and gravel deposits the average transmissivity lateral conductivity and specific yield of aquifer 3 are 300 m2 day 2 m day and 5 respectively kaushik et al 2019 the entire district has a very shallow water depth at 5 m below ground level kaushik et al 2018 all 5 blocks kalanaur lakhan majra meham rohtak and sampla of the district were covered for the groundwater sampling fig 2 2 2 sample collection analytical methodology and data interpretation a total of 620 groundwater samples were collected from 82 villages in rohtak district of haryana by the simple randomization method fig 1 groundwater sample collection transportation and analysis were carried out following standard protocols with proper qas and qcs as recommended by apha 2005 the sampling was performed for four consecutive seasons december 2017 june 2018 december 2018 and june 2019 a total of 155 groundwater samples were collected from 102 hand pumps 47 bore wells and 6 dug wells government has provided at least one bore well in every village study area to supply drinking water to majority of the households for consecutive seasons the samples were collected from the same sites to minimize sampling variations in the results the samples were collected in pre cleaned 1 l polyethylene bottles each hand pump was run for 10 min to remove stagnant water and the sample bottles were rinsed with sample water thrice before the sample collection sample altitude latitude and longitude were recorded using a calibrated gps model garmin 12 hand pump bore well and dug well depths were also recorded at the sample site the average depth of different sources varies with dug well bore well and hand pump are 7 21 m 48 79 m and 8 6 m respectively the groundwater salinity tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured using a multi ion meter model 5 star thermo orion to ensure reproducibility all samples were analyzed in triplicate along with blanks and thermo orion standards the multi ion meter was calibrated with thermo orion standards for ec tds and salinity the standards were also evaluated as known samples after every 20 samples to ensure high replicability the data has been analyzed and plotted using statistical package r software version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 and microsoft excel 2013 arcgis ver 10 5 software is used for spatial analysis and parameter mapping on the basis of the inverse distance weighted idw method using a spatial analyst tool the seismotectonic framework of the study site was identified through digitization using the editor tool of arcgis 10 5 a seismotectonic atlas of india s base map was used for the digitization of the maps in the study the elevation and drainage map of the study site were prepared using the hydrology tool of arc gis 10 5 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm having 90 m resolution satellite dataset was used to extract the digital elevation data 3 results and discussion the statistical summary of salinity tds and electrical conductivity ec for both the pre and post monsoon seasons of two consecutive year samplings are presented in table 1 parameter ranges and mean values with standard deviation from all the blocks of rohtak district are presented the salinity of the groundwater in the district ranges between 0 2 and 8 0 ppt for all seasons table 1 this wide range in salinity can be due to differences in subsurface geology rate of evaporated salts dissolution and rate of evaporation from water tables abu alnaeem et al 2018 argamasilla et al 2017 tds and ec concentrations of the groundwater range between 189 and 13 387 mg l and 210 14 874 μs cm over all seasons in the district respectively the highest salinities tds and ec concentrations were shown in post monsoon 2018 and pre monsoon 2019 table 1 the kalanaur block exhibited highest salinity 0 4 8 0 ppt tds 388 13 387 mg l and electrical conductivity 431 14 874 μs cm values table 1 the mean salinity graph of all the blocks and rohtak district is presented in fig 3 the salinity trend follows the order lakhan majra meham rohtak sampla kalanaur blocks fig 3 post monsoon seasons always gave higher salinities as compared to pre monsoon seasons with the lowest salinity observed in pre monsoon 2018 fig 3 the increasing salinity observed on a yearly basis illustrated the continuous deterioration of the groundwater sources in the area the highest salinity observed in sampla and kalanaur blocks can be due to water logging high residence time for aquifer dissolution and low water levels this clearly correlates with the low altitude area existing in the eastern and western regions occupied by the blocks in the district fig 2 a previous study also indicated the salinity prone conditions due to water logging on 60 of the land area in rohtak district kaushik et al 2018 total dissolved solids tds in the groundwater range from 204 2 to 7651 for post monsoon 2017 121 to 7242 for pre monsoon 2018 231 9 to 8615 for post monsoon 2018 and 230 to 5631 pre monsoon 2019 respectively table 1 in general post monsoon mean tds concentrations were higher than pre monsoon samples high post monsoon tds values suggested the role of leaching and infiltration of rain or recharge water through aquifer sediments krishan et al 2021 misra and mishra 2007 seasonal variation of groundwater tds values across all four seasons is summarized in table 2 according to the todd and mays classification 2004 according to this classification water samples can be divided into types i iv on the basis of their tds concentration type i with a tds 1000 mg l is classified as freshwater type ii waters have tds values between 1000 and 10 000 mg l and are classified as brackish type iii and type iv waters have tds values between 10 000 100 000 and 100 000 respectively and are classified as saline and brine table 2 none of the groundwater samples were type iii saline or type iv brine in rohtak district across all seasons only 35 42 36 and 28 groundwater samples in post monsoon 2017 pre monsoon 2018 post monsoon 2018 and pre monsoon 2019 respectively were type i i e freshwater table 2 the remaining 66 58 64 and 72 of these samples were type ii and brackish in nature table 2 electrical conductivity values of the groundwater samples ranged between 0 21 and 14 87 ms cm for all seasons in the rohtak district table 1 mean electrical conductivity ec values of the groundwater samples during post monsoon 2017 pre monsoon 2018 post monsoon 2018 and pre monsoon 2019 were 2 66 2 41 2 78 and 2 85 ms cm respectively table 1 water samples can also be classified on the basis of their electrical conductivity thus the rhoades and richards classifications rhoades et al 1992 were used for groundwater samples classification table 3 according to rhoades rhoades et al 1992 water can be classified into six types ec 0 70 ms cm falls under type i and is characterized as non saline water ec values between 0 70 and 2 00 ms cm represent slightly saline type ii water while ec values between 2 00 and 10 00 ms cm classifies water as type iii for moderately saline water type iv waters have ec values between 10 00 and 25 00 ms cm and are characterized as highly saline water type v is very high salinity water with ec values from 25 00 to 45 00 ms cm and water having an ec 45 00 ms cm type vi is considered brine groundwater samples of the rohtak district fall under the first four categories only with most of the samples falling under type iii i e moderately saline table 3 thus the majority of groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking as well as irrigation purposes under these classifications table 3 another classification by richards categorizes water quality into excellent 0 25 good 0 25 0 75 fair medium 0 75 2 25 and poor bad 2 25 for irrigation purposes richards 1954 less than 10 of the rohtak district s groundwater samples are considered good water quality using this classification table 3 the remaining rohtak groundwater samples are of only medium and poor type for all seasons table 3 obviously water quality of rohtak is unsuitable for drinking domestic and agricultural purposes according to the richards classification richards 1954 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution the spatial and temporal distribution of ec tds and salinity of the rohtak district s groundwater samples were analyzed and represented in fig sm1 fig 4 and fig 5 respectively fig sm1 summarize the spatial mapping of the ec from the district the spatial maps showed the high ec values correlated with the presence of surface water bodies as represented in fig 2 similarly high tds concentrations were found along the surface water bodies fig 4 this illustrates the role of anthropogenic activities coupled with surface water intrusion as the main source of contamination the western part of the district displayed the highest ec tds and salinity concentrations for all seasons fig sm1 fig 4 and fig 5 the central part of rohtak district is a lowland area and is a recharge zone with low mineral concentrations and shorter residence times in the aquifer kaushik et al 2018 weert et al 2009 this led to the low ec tds and salinity concentrations in the central region of the district as compared to its adjacent areas fig sm1 fig 4 and fig 5 therefore the central part of the rohtak district exhibited lower salinity than the adjoining area 3 2 correlation between groundwater salinity and aquifer depth the groundwater samples from the study area were collected from hand pump water dug well water and bore well water sources the majority of waters from hand pumps are unsuitable for drinking due to its bitter taste almost the entire rohtak district population depends on drinking supply water mean salinity values for all four seasons and aquifer depth were plotted to evaluate the drinking water suitability fig 6 hand pump water samples 102 samples average of all four seasons presented as red dots with low aquifer depths up to 20 m represent the highest salinity range from 0 2 to 7 0 ppt as compared to groundwater from other sources this wide range of salinity can occur because of variations in subsurface geology evaporation rate and dissolution of evaporated salts from the shallow water tables of the hand pumps abu alnaeem et al 2018 argamasilla et al 2017 presence of calcium carbonate layers at shallow depths result in high salinity in the shallow groundwater of the district kaushik et al 2018 the bore well water samples 47 samples average of all four seasons presented by green squares displayed low salinity 2 ppt due to deep depth of the bore well fig 6 thus salinity dropped with increase in aquifer depth higher salinity occurs in low depth water sources because shallow aquifers are more prone to a higher dissolution of aquifer material through the action of recharge water lorenzen et al 2012 thus government or private bodies have developed water stations by constructing deep bore wells for freshwater supply for the majority of the population dug well water samples 6 samples average of all four seasons presented by blue triangles contained less salinity even at low aquifer depth fig 6 this is because the collected open well water samples were located in meham and lakhan majra blocks this correlates with low salinity tds and ec concentrations in other water sources from these blocks further the rohtak district vertical salinity variation profiles in each block were also plotted fig 7 the average salinity of the rohtak district decreased with increase in aquifer depth with the highest salinity of 1 71 ppt found at a depth of 10 m below ground level fig 7a the presence of calcium carbonate layers at shallow depths in the district soil within the old alluvial plain and the fluvio alluvial plain aeolian sand deposits result in high salt concentrations in the shallow groundwater kaushik et al 2018 the rohtak block exhibited a similar salinity depth profile with small changes in the deep aquifer to the rohtak district fig 7b salinity values in the rohtak block abruptly changes after 50 m depth this can be correlated with the presence of bga 50 mgal in the region fig 2b the salinity values in the rohtak district decreased as the depth increased from 60 to 70 m and then increased again with increase in depth to 80 m fig 7b the meham block total samples 136 showed a massive decline in salinity from 1 7 ppt at 20 m depth to 0 5 ppt at 30 m and then remain unchanged fig 7c huge variations in groundwater salinity up to 30 m depth in meham block may be due to the presence of a neotectonic fault in the region as represented in fig 2b the presence of bga bouguer gravity anomaly 40 mgal in the region can also increase the variations in groundwater salinity in the block the sampla block contained a high salinity of 2 0 ppt up to the 40 m depth then the mean salinity decreased rapidly to 1 0 ppt between 40 and 60 m depth this rapid change can be because of the presence of bga 50 mgal in the block fig 2b further increasing the depth from 60 to 80 m depth increased the salinity fig 7d a possible reason for this abrupt change can be the presence of a mahendragarh dehradun fault as well as the presence of minor lineament fig 1b such subsurface faults can lead to deep and shallow aquifer mixing resulting in abrupt pattern changes in salinity dissolved ion concentrations the vertical profile of mean salinity values in lakhan majra occurs in a narrow range from 1 13 ppt to 0 75 ppt fig 7e the consistency in the mineral dissolution in lakhan majra groundwaters at different aquifer depths could cause this narrow salinity range the location of the lakhan majra block in the high altitude areas of the northern district also provides good drainage system this promotes proper discharge and reduced water logging conditions also contributing toward the constant vertical salinity profile in the kalanaur block the maximum value of mean salinity was 2 26 ppt at a 20 m depth this increase in depth from 20 to 30 40 m showed rapid decline in salinity which correlates with the presence of bga 40 mgal in the region a further increase in depth caused abrupt changes in the vertical salinity profile with mean salinity values 0 5 ppt below 70 m depth fig 7f thus deep drilling 70 m deep is favorable for drawing good drinking water in kalanaur 3 3 pearson correlation matrix the pearson correlation matrix of aquifer depth salinity electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds with each other is provided in fig 8 very high positive correlations 0 99 between salinity electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were achieved for all water source types fig 8 almost equivalent aquifer depth correlations with salinity 0 39 electrical conductivity 0 40 and total dissolved solids 0 40 were achieved this is because ec tds and salinity are highly interdependent parameters among all sources the bore well water showed least positive correlation hand pump and dug well waters showed negative correlations the negative correlation indicates an inverse proportionality between salinity concentration and aquifer depth fig 8 3 4 base exchange index groundwater samples were classified using the base exchange index r1 given by soltan 1998 1999 the base exchange index equation given below 1 base exchange index r 1 n a c l s o 4 2 all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the r1 1 values represent groundwater sources of the na so4 2 type and r1 1 represents na hco3 type groundwaters bikundia and mohan 2014 soltan 1998 1999 most of the groundwater samples from both pre and post monsoon seasons fall under na so4 2 type water with r1 values 1 fig 9 3 5 meteoric genesis index meteoric genesis index is also used to categorize groundwater based upon its percolation depth into the subsurface soltan 1998 1999 the meteoric genesis index r2 can be calculated using equation 2 2 meteoric genesis index r 2 na k cl so 4 2 here ionic na k cl and so4 2 concentrations are expressed in meq l the value of r2 1 categorizes groundwater sources as deep meteoric water percolation types while r2 1 categorizes groundwater as a shallow meteoric water percolation type soltan 1998 1999 about 95 of groundwater samples from the study area belong to the deep meteoric water percolation type the remaining 5 of groundwater samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type in both pre and post monsoon seasons fig 10 3 6 chadha diagram chadha s diagram showed the majority of the samples lying on the negative x and y axes fig 11 therefore majority of the water samples fall within sub field 6 fig 11 the subfield 6 represents samples where the alkaline earth metals are exceeding alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions bikundia and mohan 2014 such a water type is characterized by permanent hardness and it does not deposit residual sodium carbonates during irrigation the positions of the data points in the proposed diagram represent ca2 mg2 cl type ca2 mg2 dominant cl type or cl dominant ca2 mg2 type waters bikundia and mohan 2014 a small number of samples also falls under sub field 7 fig 11 in subfield 7 alkali metals exceed alkaline earth metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions such water type generally create salinity problems both in irrigation and drinking use the positions of data points in the proposed diagram represent na cl type na2so4 2 type na dominant cl type or cl dominant na type waters bikundia and mohan 2014 kut et al 2019 3 7 bivariate analysis the bivariate analysis of groundwater samples was conducted using molar ratios of different ions in groundwater fig 12 sunkari et al 2021 the bivariate analysis curves confirmed the dominance of ion exchange processes in groundwater hydro geochemistry fig 12 the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 plot shows the dominance of silicate weathering fig 12a all samples in the plot lies in right side of the plot showed the presence of excess hco3 so4 2 in the groundwater samples fig 12a further plots of mg2 vs ca2 mg2 and ca2 vs ca2 so4 2 also showed shifting to the right and indicated less involvement of dolomite and gypsum weathering respectively fig 12b and c the na vs cl plot also confirms ion exchange dominates the groundwater geochemistry with little halite dissolution fig 12d further silicate weathering with less evaporite dissolution was confirmed by mg2 na vs ca2 na and hco3 na vs ca2 na plots fig 12 e and f thus bivariate analysis confirmed the role of forward ion exchange processes with silicate weathering in the groundwater hydro geochemistry of the rohtak district 4 groundwater salinity management strategies the people of this area depend upon groundwater and government supply water treated groundwater mainly thus groundwater salinity management strategies are necessary groundwater management strategies could include both in situ and ex situ strategies gupta and misra 2018 ex situ strategies for groundwater treatment include coagulation electrocoagulation membrane filtration precipitation and adsorption using red mud activated alumina and mud pots gupta and misra 2018 in situ strategies include dilution of groundwater aquifers through artificial groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting gupta and misra 2018 the kalanaur block showed highest salinity due to water logging conditions thus providing proper drainage facilities and groundwater recharging facilities could be a solution water conservation and management strategies can improve groundwater quality and groundwater table depletion extensive development of groundwater recharge structures such as water recharge shafts surface ponds recharge dams and rooftop harvesting are recommended restricting groundwater exploitation by controlling the digging of new wells is also recommended to reduce stress on the aquifer and for giving time for recharging abulibdeh et al 2021 all these management strategies together with strict policy framework are recommended for improving groundwater quality and minimizing salinity issue in rohtak district 5 conclusions a total of 620 groundwater samples were collected across 4 seasons in 2 consecutive years from all five blocks of the rohtak district of haryana india hand pumps n 102 bore well n 47 and dug well water n 6 samples were collected for groundwater assessment the study evaluates the ec tds and salinity values to assess the groundwater suitability for drinking domestic and agricultural purposes the area showed maximum ec tds and salinity values of 14 874 μs cm 13 387 mg l and 8 0 ppt respectively mean groundwater salinity parts per thousands trend of the rohtak s regional land blocks followed the order lakhan majra meham rohtak sampla kalanaur high altitude and proper drainage led to low groundwater salinity in the lakhan majra block the kalanaur block showed the highest salinity due to water logging a constant rise in ec tds and salinity concentrations was observed in subsequent samplings with higher values in second year this is consistent with a rapid groundwater quality decline and further recommends the need of long term continuous monitoring studies in the rohtak district a vertical salinity profile displaying maximum groundwater salinity occurred at depths above 20 m for most samples low depth 20 m hand pumps in the area showed the highest ec tds and salinity concentrations higher salinity in post monsoon sampling was consistently observed compared to pre monsoon samples this suggests the dissolution and mixing of aquifer materials into groundwater after the monsoon the study recommends using deep bore well depths for drinking domestic and

11821,rural communities in africa consistently lack access to safe drinking water free from chemical contaminants and pathogens one of the approaches to improve access to drinking water in these areas is point of use treatment using household water treatment devices the objective of this work is to demonstrate the applicability of plant xylem filtration as a water treatment device for households in rural africa pine xylem acted both as a physical filter and a cation exchanger removing suspended contaminants and positively charged chemicals for example escherichia coli bacteria e coli was completely attenuated during xylem filtration whereas waterborne viruses i e t4 could not be removed due to the small size of viruses removal of inorganic anion contaminants i e fluoride and nitrate was ineffective as was the removal of negatively charged arsenate removed by merely 40 on the other hand removal of six positively charged toxic metals was in the range of 70 100 cadmium copper lead chromium cobalt and nickel treatment of natural water was successful principally for groundwaters which contained low level of suspended material and dissolved organic matter in this case filtration could produce 5 l of treated water for xylem of 1 5 cm diameter enough to supply the minimum daily consumption required for one person for survival in conclusion pine xylem can serve as an effective household treatment device for groundwater contaminated with bacteria and toxic metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords water filtration plant xylem groundwater africa safe water 1 introduction the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs adopted in 2015 guide development to improve equity and health around the world https www un org sustainabledevelopment two sdgs the third and the sixth relate directly to clean water availability they emphasize the importance of access to clean water and sanitation for all and the need to prevent deaths of infants and children under 5 years of age despite these sdgs adequate access to safe drinking water continues to be a challenge in most developing countries notably in rural areas of africa and asia world health organization 2019 rakotomanana et al 2020 in sub saharan africa a quarter of the population does not have access to safe drinking water armah et al 2018 common drinking water sources in rural africa include shallow boreholes groundwater wells springs rivers and other local reserves armah et al 2018 these provide water for the majority of the population in uganda for example where 80 of the population live in rural communities and informal settlements access to piped treated water remains low nayebare et al 2014 treated water supplied by the ugandan national water and sewerage corporation is found predominantly in urban areas only available to approximately 17 of the population nayebare et al 2014 zerbo et al 2020 local unprotected water sources in uganda and elsewhere in africa are often contaminated with bacteria and other pathogenic organisms as a result of poor sanitation facilities fewtrell and colford jr 2004 waterborne pathogens cause diarrheal diseases which lead to the death of more than 800 000 people globally each year many of them children under the age of 5 world health organization 2019 and are a major factor in undernutrition in low and middle income countries swinburn et al 2019 in east africa for example improved water sanitation has been associated with improved growth in young children rakotomanana et al 2020 in uganda waterborne diseases specifically diarrheal diseases are the sixth leading cause of death center for disease control and prevention 2019 in addition to microorganisms natural water often contains different inorganic contaminants such as nitrate no3 fluoride f and toxic metals originating from natural and anthropogenic sources yabe et al 2010 fernández luqueño et al 2013 akhtar et al 2021 fisher et al 2021 owamah et al 2021 unlike pathogenic microorganisms which causes acute illness exposure to inorganic contaminants through drinking water mostly leads to chronic illnesses biney et al 1994 fu and xi 2020 analysis of drinking water in southwestern uganda found contamination with multiple metals including lead iron and cadmium kasozi et al 2019 one of the approaches to improve access to drinking water in rural africa is point of use treatment using household water treatment devices fewtrell and colford jr 2004 the main advantage of this approach is its low cost availability and the prevention of contamination taking place during collection transport and storage clasen and cairncross 2004 clasen et al 2004 lantagne et al 2006 clasen 2015 point of use approaches have gained popularity since 2003 with the foundation of the international network to promote household water treatment and safe storage hwts under the who aiming to promote hwts among vulnerable populations and reduce waterborne disease world health organization 2019 some widespread hwts options include on site chlorination filtration and solar disinfection who 2012 their use in conjunction with hygiene education and sanitation is considered an intermittent solution until the infrastructure to reliably deliver safe water to the entire rural population is created a successful implementation of a household treatment technology largely depends on the availability and cost of materials a technology that is based on a local available and cheap material is likely to provide a long term sustainable solution a typical example for an effective product is the widely distributed ceramic filter the potters for peace pfp filter lantagne 2001 which is produced in nicaragua from native materials and distributed to local houses by ngos the pfp showed to be effective in removing waterborne bacteria but could not remove viruses due to their smaller size no other water contaminants were tested in addition filtration rate decreased markedly over time especially in turbid waters filtration devices in general are an attractive option for household treatment since they can make use of locally available and inexpensive porous media they are simple and easy to use and can potentially remove bacteria and other contaminants lantagne 2001 one of the porous material previously proposed for household water filtration is plant xylem boutilier et al 2014 xylem is a porous tissue material composed of a variety of specialized tube like cells responsible for water conduction in plants the diameter of these closed end parallel conduits is often too large for an effective water filtration 10 μm however conduits are connected to adjacent conduits via pits covered with membranes with pores in the range of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers depending on the species of plants suitable for attenuating many water contaminants employing plant xylem for household water treatment is highly advantageous as it is a local and cheap material easily available in many rural areas a filtration system based on xylem involves forcing of water through the cross section of a cut plant stem as water flows through the xylem it crosses the pits membranes which may attenuate pathogens and other contaminants boutilier et al 2014 ahmad ansari et al 2019 the potential of this filtration method was demonstrated earlier by boutilier et al 2014 who used pine xylem to filtrate contaminated deionized water the researchers found that the specific xylem could effectively attenuate dead bacteria and thus has high potential as a household treatment device still large amounts of data are missing for the full scale application of this treatment method notably i filtration effectivity of live bacteria which may differ from dead ones due to for example the production of extracellular polysaccharide substances ii data on filtration with xylem from different tree types since confining the method to pine highly limits its geographical application iii filtration effectivity of other important water contaminants such as toxic metals and waterborne viruses and most importantly iv data on xylem filtration of natural waters containing large amount of background constituents such as organic matter and suspended material the hypothesis of the present study is that plant xylem from a variety of trees can be used to remove key contaminants from natural waters providing safe drinking water for at least one person per day subsequently the general goal of the study was to determine the applicability of plant xylem as a household treatment device through a the analysis of the effectiveness of different xylems in removing live waterborne bacteria and viruses and relevant toxic metals and ions and b examine filtration of natural waters from different sources 2 material and methods 2 1 materials branches for filtration tests were taken from different trees table 1 located on private properties in israel escherichia coli e coli atcc 35218 used as model bacteria was purchased from hy labs rehovot israel as well as the luria bertani lb medium used to grow and maintain the bacterial culture t4 bacteriophage atcc 11303 b4 used as a model for waterborne viruses was a donation from the pharmaceutical engineering laboratory azrieli college of engineering jerusalem sodium fluoride sodium nitrate cadmium chloride copper sulfate lead bromide chromium nitrate cobalt chloride and nickel chloride all with 99 purity were from sigma aldrich rehovot israel deionized di water was taken from a direct q3 uv system millipore all chemicals were used as obtained 2 2 filtration setup and procedure in a typical filtration experiment a 2 cm long section was cut from a branch the bark was peeled off and the piece was inserted into a plastic threaded adapter reducer nipple the nipple was tightened to a 2 l plastic pipe which served as a feed container the xylem was sealed with rubber bands to avoid leaks the water solution was spiked with the tested contaminant and placed inside the feed container which was sealed and pressurized using a nitrogen tank connected to its upper side at approximately 5 psi 34 5 kpa filtrate was collected from the bottom in glass vials for e coli filtration bacteria were first grown in 50 ml liquid lb medium to optical density od600 of approximately 1 corresponding to approximately 108 colony forming units per ml cfu ml a predetermined volume from the concentrated stock was then added to the tested water to achieve the desired initial concentration for t4 filtration the bacteriophage was first propagated using e coli as the host in nutrient broth acumedia following propagation the solution was centrifuged 10 min 8000 g and filtered through a 0 45 μm low protein binding filter pes stericup filter millipore to remove cellular debris a few ml of the t4 stock were added to the water solution to achieve the initial concentration of approximately 106 plaque forming units pfu ml filtration of ions and toxic metals was done by adding the contaminants to tap water and measuring their concentrations before and after filtration 2 3 analytical methods e coli were enumerated by the drop plate method chen et al 2003 in brief samples were serially diluted in saline water and 20 μl of the diluted sample was dropped onto mfc agar plates in triplicates plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c the e coli colonies were counted to determine bacterial concentration t4 samples were enumerated by the double agar layer method wolf et al 2018 metals in the water were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes spectro genesis kleve germany analytical quality control included weekly analysis of a certified reference standard fluka analytical 90243 for icp and replicate analysis of samples and blanks prior to analysis samples were acidified with 2 3 drops of 70 nitric acid each sample was analyzed three times and

water quality parameters were analyzed using standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration with xylem from different types of trees different types of trees have differently structured xylem which may affect their filtration capabilities for example angiosperms flowering plants have relatively large and long xylem vessels centimeters to meters in length compared to gymnosperms conifers which have thin and short tracheid less than 1 cm in length separation of contaminants during xylem filtration is effectively done by pit membranes connecting the parallel xylem conduits which have pore sizes in the nanometers to hundred nanometers range consequently gymnosperms will have a larger number of pits in a 2 cm long wood as compared to angiosperms and are expected to filtrate water contaminants much more effectively boutilier et al 2014 to test this hypothesis we used several angiosperms and gymnosperms for water filtration all abundant in africa table 1 gessesse and teklu 2004 lantschner et al 2017 gandji et al 2018 www cabi org isc experiments in this section were done using 1 5 cm diameter brunches filtrating 200 ml saline solution 0 9 nacl spiked with e coli bacteria at initial concentration of approximately 1000 cfu ml two key parameters were tested removal of bacteria and filtration flow rate surprisingly many of the examined angiosperms removed more than 90 of e coli bacteria complete removal was achieved for pine a conifer and populus an angiosperm whereas eucalyptus and moringa had the lowest removal 7 and 13 removal respectively filtration flow rates varied between trees from 12 ml min for almond to 20 25 ml min for moringa in general trees with the highest filtration rates had lowest removal of bacteria eucalyptus and moringa indicative of large xylem conduits with little pit membranes our results imply that some species of angiosperms may nevertheless be suitable for water filtration this observation is significant since angiosperms are much more abundant than conifers in africa kalema and hamilton 2020 based on our results and a previous study boutilier et al 2014 pine tree was selected for further analysis 3 2 correlation between filtration area and volume of water filtered the maximum volume of water that can be filtered mvf is a crucial parameter in designing a household filtration device since it can limit the system s applicability or the mode of application filtration flow rate is not a suitable parameter in this case since it gradually decreases during filtration of large volumes the mvf was calculated herein as the filtered volume of water passed through the xylem until filtration rate is decreased by 50 filtration in this section was done using saline water spiked with e coli clearly increasing filtration area increased the mvf fig 1 in general one piece of 9 61 cm2 equivalent to 3 5 cm in diameter can supply a daily water consumption of approximately 3 l which is considered by the who as the minimum required for one person for survival who 2013 in cases where higher capacity is required a larger piece should be applied or the piece can be replaced during filtration it is noteworthy that first e coli removal remained 100 throughout filtration and second the average filtration rate was approximately 8 ml min resulting in a filtration time of 6 h for 3 l 3 3 filtration of waterborne viruses while pathogenic bacteria are the principal contaminants of concern in developing countries other microorganisms may also pose a significant threat to human health and water availability viruses such as rotavirus are a leading cause of acute diarrhea in young children in many african countries magana arachchi and wanigatunge 2020 it is therefore important to further determine the capabilities of xylem filtration in removing these harmful water contaminants unlike e coli bacteria t4 viruses tested in 0 9 saline were only marginally removed during xylem filtration fig 2 this outcome was unexpected as previous studies estimated that pit membranes are dense enough to filtrate viruses based on filtration tests of inorganic particles in the range of 20 200 nm choat et al 2003 2008 the t4 virus is about 200 nm long and 90 nm wide and is in the upper range of viruses size thus it is safe to say that other waterborne pathogenic viruses will unlikely be attenuated by the xylem filter most waterborne viruses are in the 40 100 nm range see magana arachchi and wanigatunge 2020 3 4 filtration of inorganic contaminants high levels of ions such as no3 and f in drinking water may adversely affect the health of mainly young children causing fluorosis and methemoglobinemia whereas toxic metals such as arsenic and lead may lead to long term neurological effects rocha and trujillo 2019 fu and xi 2020 both group of contaminants are frequently detected at high levels in groundwater wells in africa bgs british geological survey 2001 gamar et al 2021 subsequently experiments in this section aimed to a determine the capability of xylem to remove no3 f and relevant toxic metals from water and b identify the impact of no3 f concentration on the removal of toxic metals fig 3 presents filtration results of 200 ml tap water spiked with no3 5 mg l n f 1 mg l f and different toxic metals at initial concentration of 1 mg l each while concentration of no3 and f only marginally decreased following filtration metals were removed by 70 with the exception of arsenic notably chromium and copper were removed by 99 below detection limit additional filtration experiments were carried out with varying concentrations of no3 and f from zero to 10 mg l n and 5 mg l f and constant concentrations of metals to test the impact of the ions on metals removal concentration range of no3 and f was selected to cover typical groundwater concentrations in africa nayebare et al 2014 removal of no3 and f was negligeable in all experiments whereas removal of metals remained constant at approximately 70 arsenic 40 and was not affected by the concentration of no3 and f see fig s2 in supporting information a large number of publications already demonstrated the use of low cost biomass based adsorbents for metals removal from water e g bilal et al 2022 however these studies commonly employ pretreated biomass material grinded chemically or thermally treated in a batch treatment configuration this is the first time an intact xylem material was applied using a flow through system configuration xylem comprises of highly lignified cell walls that provide mechanical support to the plant lignin is a complex phenolic polymer consisting of a large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups these negatively charged functional groups may bind to metallic ions through ion exchange mechanism fig 4 and are likely responsible for the high sorption capacity of the xylem ge and li 2018 arsenic appears in natural water as arsenous or arsenic acid guma et al 2021 which are either neutral or negatively charged hence its low removal rate by lignin and subsequently by the xylem the negligible removal and effect of no3 and f strengthen the ion exchange hypothesis since these ions are negatively charged and do not compete with metals of sorption sites 3 5 filtration of natural water in the last stage of this study we examined the applicability of xylem filtration in treating natural water samples taken from different sources in israel springs and groundwaters these types of water represent a wide range of natural waters often encountered in places like rural africa mainly with respect to the concentration of organic matter suspended solids and salts two samples were collected from recreational ponds receiving their water from different tributaries sw 1 and 2 table 3 groundwater samples were collected from two different aquifer basins in israel gw 1 was from a carbonate aquifer in the upper galilee and gw 2 was taken from an interbedded carbonate and basalt layers aquifer in the golan heights the samples were analyzed for key quality parameters table 2 and spiked with e coli bacteria prior to filtration none of the samples contained fluoride or any of the toxic metals tested in the previous section while removal of bacteria was complete for all water samples filtration rate and mvf varied significantly table 3 the two surface waters exhibited extremely low filtration rate resulting in low mvf on the other hand filtration rate of groundwater samples was relatively high even compared to that recorded for saline solution table 1 leading to high mvf of 5 l the reason for the low filtration rate of surface water is most likely the relatively high content of suspended solids and organic matter table 2 which clog the filtration matrix in an attempt to overcome clogging we added 5 cm of sea sand on top of the xylem piece as prefiltration to remove suspended solids the flow rate slightly increased to 4 ml min compared to 1 ml min without sand however the sand was quickly clogged and the mvf remained low at around 0 5 l results not presented the high filtration rate for groundwater as compared to saline water is probably the result of the water s low salinity and low osmotic pressure which leads to the expansion of the xylem and the conduits within filtration of saline water leads to the narrowing of the conduits and a reduced filtration flow the obtained mvf for groundwater easily covers both who and the food and nutrition board recommendation for daily adequate intakes ai of water 3 7 l for man and 2 7 l for woman institute of medicine iom 2008 3 6 proposed filtration device prototype to meet the need for improved water quality a point of use water filtration device was developed and prototyped this device was designed to be low cost and low maintenance to constitute appropriate technology for the rural african user communities of focus bellizzi and kozlovsky 2020 the device consists of two principal subsystems that work in tandem i a holder for the plant xylem sample and ii a pressure supply system the first sub system is designed to ensure sealing of the plant sample and filtration of the entire flow of water through the sample cross section the sealing mechanism comprise of three components two machined plastic parts and a single rubber cone washer fig 5 the top threaded connection piece consists of a primarily cylindrical piece of plastic featuring external threads cut into the top and bottom of the part the center is conically shaped on the outside with the base of the cone closest to the top of the part a bore exists through the center of the entire part with the edge of the bore at the bottom of the part featuring an angled cut the tapped bottom piece consists of a cylindrical piece of plastic featuring a hole drilled all the way through the part this hole is smaller in diameter than the intended xylem samples this part also features a bore that extends about three quarters of the way through the part and a larger internally threaded bore that extends about halfway down the part prior to the assembly of this subsystem a sample of plant xylem must be prepared by clipping off a branch from the desired species cutting the branch to size with respect to length about 2 cm and peeling the bark off the sample the rubber cone washer serves as the casing into which the plant xylem sample is inserted for proper sealing via this subsystem the sample must be snugly fit into the center of the cone washer the cone washer can be compressed by hand into the hole in the bottom of the top threaded connection piece this tightens the seal between the walls of the inner diameter of the cone washer and the sample of plant xylem the compression is facilitated by the angled cut around the edge of the bore at the bottom of the top threaded connection piece designed to match the taper of the cone washer for a tight fit the external bottom threads of the top threaded connection piece can then be fastened into the top internal threads of the tapped bottom piece as the parts are threaded together the cone washer and bottom of the sample of plant xylem bottom out on the ledge present inside the tapped bottom piece created by the bore further compressing the walls of the inner diameter of the cone washer around the sample of plant xylem this results in the formation of a tight seal around the sample the bottom hole serves as the outlet through which water can exit this subsystem post filtration the second sub system is designed to provide a pressure of approximately 0 5 bar to the water to force it through the plant xylem this can be done by multiple methods for example by using an elevation head or with pressure provided by a weight in the first option the xylem holder is connected via a flexible pipe to a container placed on the rooftop of the house at 5 m height the second option makes use of a piston cylinder system comprised of a pvc pipe corresponding hub cap and hand machined plunger fig s1 in supporting information when fitted with the hubcap the pvc pipe serves as a feed container into which water can be poured a large o ring is incorporated between the bottom of the cylinder and the inner face of the hub cab to prevent leakage between the two components at this connection point the total cost of the system was estimated at approximately us 45 this number is based on the cost of all parts for the first and second sub systems two assumptions were made to translate the number to a monthly cost first the piston cylinder and tapped bottom piece of the sealing mechanism may last for several years if properly maintained second the more sensitive parts the piston including the two o rings and the other parts of the sealing mechanism should be replaced every 6 months and their cost is approximately us 8 8 using these assumptions the total monthly cost of the systems would be approximately us 1 47 it is noteworthy that a the cost of pieces is based on their retail price in the u s and b the proposed design was not cost optimized and the system can be redesigned in future iterations to make use of less expensive materials 4 conclusions providing inexpensive and easy to use household water treatment devices can play an important role in improving water quality and availability in rural africa improved water quality integrated with community based changes has been recently proposed as an effective intervention to decrease the burden of preventable diarrheal diseases and improve health in the present study we show the applicability of plant xylem as a household treatment device xylem from different trees presented effective filtration of e coli bacteria with pine exhibiting the highest potential in addition pine xylem could remove a large number of toxic metals but was ineffective in removing t4 viruses and inorganic anions during surface water filtration xylem was quickly clogged by suspended solids and organic matter whereas filtration of groundwater could produce a large volume of filtered water altogether pine xylem and potentially other trees can be used for household water treatment in cases of bacteria and toxic metals contamination of groundwater or other water with low suspended and dissolved material nonetheless when evaluating the applicability of the system some additional points should be kept in mind i final filtration tests should be conducted with local abundant trees to ensure the suitability the specific plant type ii other harmful contaminants may be present in the water such as pesticides which were not tested and iii producing 1 l of drinkable water may take more than an hour which means that the method cannot be used for immediate drinking

11821,rural communities in africa consistently lack access to safe drinking water free from chemical contaminants and pathogens one of the approaches to improve access to drinking water in these areas is point of use treatment using household water treatment devices the objective of this work is to demonstrate the applicability of plant xylem filtration as a water treatment device for households in rural africa pine xylem acted both as a physical filter and a cation exchanger removing suspended contaminants and positively charged chemicals for example escherichia coli bacteria e coli was completely attenuated during xylem filtration whereas waterborne viruses i e t4 could not be removed due to the small size of viruses removal of inorganic anion contaminants i e fluoride and nitrate was ineffective as was the removal of negatively charged arsenate removed by merely 40 on the other hand removal of six positively charged toxic metals was in the range of 70 100 cadmium copper lead chromium cobalt and nickel treatment of natural water was successful principally for groundwaters which contained low level of suspended material and dissolved organic matter in this case filtration could produce 5 l of treated water for xylem of 1 5 cm diameter enough to supply the minimum daily consumption required for one person for survival in conclusion pine xylem can serve as an effective household treatment device for groundwater contaminated with bacteria and toxic metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords water filtration plant xylem groundwater africa safe water 1 introduction the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs adopted in 2015 guide development to improve equity and health around the world https www un org sustainabledevelopment two sdgs the third and the sixth relate directly to clean water availability they emphasize the importance of access to clean water and sanitation for all and the need to prevent deaths of infants and children under 5 years of age despite these sdgs adequate access to safe drinking water continues to be a challenge in most developing countries notably in rural areas of africa and asia world health organization 2019 rakotomanana et al 2020 in sub saharan africa a quarter of the population does not have access to safe drinking water armah et al 2018 common drinking water sources in rural africa include shallow boreholes groundwater wells springs rivers and other local reserves armah et al 2018 these provide water for the majority of the population in uganda for example where 80 of the population live in rural communities and informal settlements access to piped treated water remains low nayebare et al 2014 treated water supplied by the ugandan national water and sewerage corporation is found predominantly in urban areas only available to approximately 17 of the population nayebare et al 2014 zerbo et al 2020 local unprotected water sources in uganda and elsewhere in africa are often contaminated with bacteria and other pathogenic organisms as a result of poor sanitation facilities fewtrell and colford jr 2004 waterborne pathogens cause diarrheal diseases which lead to the death of more than 800 000 people globally each year many of them children under the age of 5 world health organization 2019 and are a major factor in undernutrition in low and middle income countries swinburn et al 2019 in east africa for example improved water sanitation has been associated with improved growth in young children rakotomanana et al 2020 in uganda waterborne diseases specifically diarrheal diseases are the sixth leading cause of death center for disease control and prevention 2019 in addition to microorganisms natural water often contains different inorganic contaminants such as nitrate no3 fluoride f and toxic metals originating from natural and anthropogenic sources yabe et al 2010 fernández luqueño et al 2013 akhtar et al 2021 fisher et al 2021 owamah et al 2021 unlike pathogenic microorganisms which causes acute illness exposure to inorganic contaminants through drinking water mostly leads to chronic illnesses biney et al 1994 fu and xi 2020 analysis of drinking water in southwestern uganda found contamination with multiple metals including lead iron and cadmium kasozi et al 2019 one of the approaches to improve access to drinking water in rural africa is point of use treatment using household water treatment devices fewtrell and colford jr 2004 the main advantage of this approach is its low cost availability and the prevention of contamination taking place during collection transport and storage clasen and cairncross 2004 clasen et al 2004 lantagne et al 2006 clasen 2015 point of use approaches have gained popularity since 2003 with the foundation of the international network to promote household water treatment and safe storage hwts under the who aiming to promote hwts among vulnerable populations and reduce waterborne disease world health organization 2019 some widespread hwts options include on site chlorination filtration and solar disinfection who 2012 their use in conjunction with hygiene education and sanitation is considered an intermittent solution until the infrastructure to reliably deliver safe water to the entire rural population is created a successful implementation of a household treatment technology largely depends on the availability and cost of materials a technology that is based on a local available and cheap material is likely to provide a long term sustainable solution a typical example for an effective product is the widely distributed ceramic filter the potters for peace pfp filter lantagne 2001 which is produced in nicaragua from native materials and distributed to local houses by ngos the pfp showed to be effective in removing waterborne bacteria but could not remove viruses due to their smaller size no other water contaminants were tested in addition filtration rate decreased markedly over time especially in turbid waters filtration devices in general are an attractive option for household treatment since they can make use of locally available and inexpensive porous media they are simple and easy to use and can potentially remove bacteria and other contaminants lantagne 2001 one of the porous material previously proposed for household water filtration is plant xylem boutilier et al 2014 xylem is a porous tissue material composed of a variety of specialized tube like cells responsible for water conduction in plants the diameter of these closed end parallel conduits is often too large for an effective water filtration 10 μm however conduits are connected to adjacent conduits via pits covered with membranes with pores in the range of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers depending on the species of plants suitable for attenuating many water contaminants employing plant xylem for household water treatment is highly advantageous as it is a local and cheap material easily available in many rural areas a filtration system based on xylem involves forcing of water through the cross section of a cut plant stem as water flows through the xylem it crosses the pits membranes which may attenuate pathogens and other contaminants boutilier et al 2014 ahmad ansari et al 2019 the potential of this filtration method was demonstrated earlier by boutilier et al 2014 who used pine xylem to filtrate contaminated deionized water the researchers found that the specific xylem could effectively attenuate dead bacteria and thus has high potential as a household treatment device still large amounts of data are missing for the full scale application of this treatment method notably i filtration effectivity of live bacteria which may differ from dead ones due to for example the production of extracellular polysaccharide substances ii data on filtration with xylem from different tree types since confining the method to pine highly limits its geographical application iii filtration effectivity of other important water contaminants such as toxic metals and waterborne viruses and most importantly iv data on xylem filtration of natural waters containing large amount of background constituents such as organic matter and suspended material the hypothesis of the present study is that plant xylem from a variety of trees can be used to remove key contaminants from natural waters providing safe drinking water for at least one person per day subsequently the general goal of the study was to determine the applicability of plant xylem as a household treatment device through a the analysis of the effectiveness of different xylems in removing live waterborne bacteria and viruses and relevant toxic metals and ions and b examine filtration of natural waters from different sources 2 material and methods 2 1 materials branches for filtration tests were taken from different trees table 1 located on private properties in israel escherichia

millipore all chemicals were used as obtained 2 2 filtration setup and procedure in a typical filtration experiment a 2 cm long section was cut from a branch the bark was peeled off and the piece was inserted into a plastic threaded adapter reducer nipple the nipple was tightened to a 2 l plastic pipe which served as a feed container the xylem was sealed with rubber bands to avoid leaks the water solution was spiked with the tested contaminant and placed inside the feed container which was sealed and pressurized using a nitrogen tank connected to its upper side at approximately 5 psi 34 5 kpa filtrate was collected from the bottom in glass vials for e coli filtration bacteria were first grown in 50 ml liquid lb medium to optical density od600 of approximately 1 corresponding to approximately 108 colony forming units per ml cfu ml a predetermined volume from the concentrated stock was then added to the tested water to achieve the desired initial concentration for t4 filtration the bacteriophage was first propagated using e coli as the host in nutrient broth acumedia following propagation the solution was centrifuged 10 min 8000 g and filtered through a 0 45 μm low protein binding filter pes stericup filter millipore to remove cellular debris a few ml of the t4 stock were added to the water solution to achieve the initial concentration of approximately 106 plaque forming units pfu ml filtration of ions and toxic metals was done by adding the contaminants to tap water and measuring their concentrations before and after filtration 2 3 analytical methods e coli were enumerated by the drop plate method chen et al 2003 in brief samples were serially diluted in saline water and 20 μl of the diluted sample was dropped onto mfc agar plates in triplicates plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c the e coli colonies were counted to determine bacterial concentration t4 samples were enumerated by the double agar layer method wolf et al 2018 metals in the

and filtration of the entire flow of water through the sample cross section the sealing mechanism comprise of three components two machined plastic parts and a single rubber cone washer fig 5 the top threaded connection piece consists of a primarily cylindrical piece of plastic featuring external threads cut into the top and bottom of the part the center is conically shaped on the outside with the base of the cone closest to the top of the part a bore exists through the center of the entire part with the edge of the bore at the bottom of the part featuring an angled cut the tapped bottom piece consists of a cylindrical piece of plastic featuring a hole drilled all the way through the part this hole is smaller in diameter than the intended xylem samples this part also features a bore that extends about three quarters of the way through the part and a larger internally threaded bore that extends about halfway down the part prior to the assembly of this subsystem a sample of plant xylem must be prepared by clipping off a branch from the desired species cutting the branch to size with respect to length about 2 cm and peeling the bark off the sample the rubber cone washer serves as the casing into which the plant xylem sample is inserted for proper sealing via this subsystem the sample must be snugly fit into the center of the cone washer the cone washer can be compressed by hand into the hole in the bottom of the top threaded connection piece this tightens the seal between the walls of the inner diameter of the cone washer and the sample of plant xylem the compression is facilitated by the angled cut around the edge of the bore at the bottom of the top threaded connection piece designed to match the taper of the cone washer for a tight fit the external bottom threads of the top threaded connection piece can then be fastened into the top internal threads of the tapped bottom piece as the parts are threaded together the cone washer and bottom of the sample of plant xylem bottom out on the ledge present inside the tapped bottom piece created by the bore further compressing the walls of the inner diameter of the cone washer around the sample of plant xylem this results in the formation of a tight seal around the sample the bottom hole serves as the outlet through which water can exit this subsystem post filtration the second sub system is designed to provide a pressure of approximately 0 5 bar to the water to force it through the plant xylem this can be done by multiple methods for example by using an elevation head or with pressure provided by a weight in the first option the xylem holder is connected via a flexible pipe to a container placed on the rooftop of the house at 5 m height the second option makes use of a piston cylinder system comprised of a pvc pipe corresponding hub cap and hand machined plunger fig s1 in supporting information when fitted with the hubcap the pvc pipe serves as a feed container into which water can be poured a large o ring is incorporated between the bottom of the cylinder and the inner face of the hub cab to prevent leakage between the two components at this connection point the total cost of the system was estimated at approximately us 45 this number is based on the cost of all parts for the first and second sub systems two assumptions were made to translate the number to a monthly cost first the piston cylinder and tapped bottom piece of the sealing mechanism may last for several years if properly maintained second the more sensitive parts the piston including the two o rings and the other parts of the sealing mechanism should be replaced every 6 months and their cost is approximately us 8 8 using these assumptions the total monthly cost of the systems would be approximately us 1 47 it is noteworthy that a the cost of pieces is based on their retail price in the u s and b the proposed design was not cost optimized and the system can be redesigned in future iterations to make use of less expensive materials 4 conclusions providing inexpensive and easy to use household water treatment devices can play an important role in improving water quality and availability in rural africa improved water quality integrated with community based changes has been recently proposed as an effective intervention to decrease the burden of preventable diarrheal diseases and improve health in the present study we show the applicability of plant xylem as a household treatment device xylem from different trees presented effective filtration of e coli bacteria with pine exhibiting the highest potential in addition pine xylem could remove a large number of toxic metals but was ineffective in removing t4 viruses and inorganic anions during surface water filtration xylem was quickly clogged by suspended solids and organic matter whereas filtration of groundwater could produce a large volume of filtered water altogether pine xylem and potentially other trees can be used for household water treatment in cases of bacteria and toxic metals contamination of groundwater or other water with low suspended and dissolved material nonetheless when evaluating the applicability of the system some additional points should be kept in mind i final filtration tests should be conducted with local abundant trees to ensure the suitability the specific plant type ii other harmful contaminants may be present in the water such as pesticides which were not tested and iii producing 1 l of drinkable water may take more than an hour which means that the method cannot be used for immediate drinking

11822,sustainable groundwater management is becoming a priority in the context of significant changes in groundwater use patterns particularly with continuously increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population expansion of irrigation area and economic progress this research contributed to the integration of gis rs and a fuzzy technique to delineate groundwater prospective zones for surat district india in this study nine different fuzzy membership layers of influencing parameters were overlaid using the fuzzy gamma operator to generate the prospective zones the result indicates that 62 53 area of the district falls under the high prospective zone sensitivity analysis reveals that lineament density rainfall distribution and geomorphology were the most important parameters influencing the region s groundwater potentiality the rs gis based fuzzy method is proficient and efficient and can be applied anywhere on the earth to identify and delineate groundwater prospective zones graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater influencing parameters gis groundwater prospective zone sensitivity analysis fuzzy membership 1 introduction in the list of vital natural resources groundwater is known as an essential natural resource its uses in different industries have made it a significant component of the living things on earth the availability of groundwater varies temporally and geographically domestic agricultural and industrial uses account for approximately 36 percent 42 percent and 27 percent respectively of total groundwater production globally patra et al 2018 in the countries like india many rural populations 90 as well as the urban population 30 depend on groundwater to compete for their essential needs agarwal and garg 2016 however shortages and extensive exploitation of groundwater resources without proper engineered planning are all too common rodell et al 2009 many areas of india have seen dramatic declines in groundwater levels due to increased extraction over the last two decades cwc and cgwb 2016 groundwater potential estimation is a difficult task because it necessitates the precise evaluation of all recharge and discharge parameters the application of remote sensing rs with geographical information systems gis has brought new possibilities for analysing massive amounts of geospatial data and accurately mapping various natural resources gandhi and patel 2019 traditional groundwater data collection methods take a lot of time money and personnel automated techniques like rs and gis have emerged as effective platforms to understand the numerous groundwater challenges it provides a systematic synoptic rapid and excellent configuration for handling massive and complicated satellite data yeh et al 2016 the availability of diverse satellite data makes it easy to efficiently and adequately research the baseline information on groundwater as a result geospatial methods have become an essential tool for groundwater mapping in recent decades the delineation of the groundwater prospective area is a paradigm that may build strategies for the long term utilization of groundwater resources various researchers have delineated groundwater potential zones gpzs using various techniques such as gis based mcdm arabameri et al 2019 ahp process banerjee and kumartilak 2021 fuzzy logic ahmad et al 2020 woa murasingh et al 2018 multi influencing factors magesh et al 2012 das and pardeshi 2018 fuzzy ahp method jesiya and gopinath 2020 some studies combined a gis and rs methodology with multi criteria decision making mcda analysis adimallataloor 2020 mcdm is a concept that allows choosing the best option from a set of options by weighing them against various criteria kilic and kaya 2015 alternatives are successfully ranked using mcdm techniques which are categorized as conventional and fuzzy in terms of linguistic uncertainty traditional mcdm techniques are deemed insufficient kahraman et al 2014 the fuzzy inference systems can function in the presence of a large number of variables and has the ability to manage linguistic attributes without losing the crucial part of the concepts jesiya and gopinath 2019 therefore it is better to use mcdm techniques with fuzzy sets to deal with uncertainty in decision making moreover the fuzzy technique enables to obtain more precise findings kaya et al 2019 in the last few years the fuzzy integrated geospatial approach was a supportive tool in assessing many worldwide problems according to the study the gis fuzzy technique provides flood prone zones with higher accuracy of approximately 91 6 malik et al 2020 moreover the study on groundwater quality using this tool is carried out and analysed the preferable potable water site in the asalem region of iran mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 surat the district of gujarat state india has problems regarding groundwater storm water and agricultural water management according to the census of india 2011 the population of surat district is almost 61 8 lakhs the value of the study area is due to the fact that surat city is the fastest growing city in the world on the banks of the river tapi also known as the diamond and silk city of india the diverse industrial development sustainable agricultural yield and other small medium commercialization have enhanced the economic growth of the city however the city had suffered from large tangible and intangible damages in past years the primary sources of irrigation in the district are groundwater and canals and no area is irrigated by tanks and ponds cgwb 2013 the district s groundwater development is primarily focused on meeting irrigational and residential needs hence it is essential to pay close attention to the groundwater conservation and replenishment plan proper understanding of influencing parameters to groundwater potentials may lead to an appropriate action strategy for groundwater resource management in order to achieve better significant accuracy the current study has performed gpzs in the study region utilising 9 thematic layers despite all of the aforementioned studies very few have employed the innovative gis fuzzy technique to decipher the gpzs moreover there is no attempt has been made to demarcate the gpzs in the study area a map removal sensitivity analysis is carried out to better understand the impact of various thematic layers the validation of the research s findings is the most important component of any hydrological or hydro geological investigation usually the validation includes the comparison of output with different mathematical models or ground truth in the studies affiliated with the groundwater according to the different literature studies on groundwater potentiality numerous methods applied for validation are based on the curvature of the region groundwater well yield or existing groundwater level data however the present study has utilized the method that intersect the natural drainage and lineament considering all of this the current study has the potential to play an important role in groundwater management in the study region by accurately defining gpzs the objectives of the study include the demarcation of the gpzs in the study area by utilising the integrated gis fuzzy approach application of sensitivity analysis to identify the more sensitive thematic layers and the validation of the identified gpzs thus the research will be beneficial in the management of local groundwater resources policy development and reducing the region s groundwater vulnerability 2 study area surat is a district in gujarat state india fig 1 geographically the district is located in south gujarat the arabian sea is on the west side of the district moreover bharuch navsari dang and tapi districts are surrounded by north south south east and east the district covers a total size of 4418 km2 and is located between 20 30 21 35n and 72 35 74 20e the district is on the western coast of the deccan peninsula although the major sahyadri scarp is beyond the district s eastern limits it is responsible for its landscape geographic characteristics and drainage pattern the area includes four main zones hilly areas piedmont slopes alluvial plains and coastal plains cgwb 2012 the tapi is a major river perennial in nature that runs through the district s central part and flows towards the west a majority portion of the district approximate 71 is occupied by agricultural land sugarcane and paddy as the predominant crops of the region moreover the other major crops cultivated are jawar wheat groundnut banana vegetables etc nabard 2016 17 surat has a tropical savanna climate that is moderated by the gulf of cambay and the arabian sea early march marks the beginning of summer which lasts until june the hottest months are april and may with average maximum temperatures of 37 c moreover the monsoon season starts in late june and lasts until the end of september with temperatures averaging 32 c the monsoon retreats in october and november bringing high temperatures back until late november the average rainfall in the monsoon season is approximate 1143 mm winter lasts from december to late february with average mean temperatures of around 23 c and little rain the most extensive aquifers in the district are the deccan trap which can be found in the district s north eastern eastern and south eastern areas cgwb 2012 3 data and methods 3 1 factors selection and their significance the behaviour and movement of underground water are influenced by numerous variables including earth characteristics meteorological factors etc their influence varies by region so accurate delineation of the groundwater prospective zone necessitates careful selection the research interest natural attributes of the area and their availability play a role in their selection in this research work nine parameters including soil texture geomorphology land use land cover lulc relief rainfall slope drainage density lineament density and existing groundwater depth were considered these parameters are based on the extensive literature study verma and patel 2021 tomer et al 2019 thapa et al 2018 doke et al 2021 prasad et al 2008 das and pal 2019 maity and mandal 2019 nature of the study area and experts opinions groundwater occurrence and spatial distribution are strongly influenced by local geology and hydrogeology the subsurface movement of groundwater is governed by geomorphology muralitharan and palanivel 2015 kumar and pramod krishna 2020 soil properties such as soil type and texture play a significant role in groundwater spatial variation mehra et al 2016 water percolates downward through lineaments which serve as conduits a permeable zone is usually indicated by its presence because of the high percolation rate an area near lineaments and their intersection points are an ideal place to store groundwater mukherjee and singh 2020 as a result areas with a higher density of lineaments have a greater influence on groundwater potentials and vice versa the relief of a region reflects the ruggedness of the terrain and is used to demarcate potential groundwater zones the rate of infiltration and surface runoff is controlled by the slope gradient high surface runoff and slope stiffness generate less recharge than mild gentle slopes allowing more time for rainwater to infiltrate ghosh et al 2020 lulc has an impact on groundwater recharge and infiltration and soil moisture in a given area due to low permeability and high surface runoff barren lands rocky surfaces and built up land are poor groundwater occurrence repositories moreover the amount of rainfall has a direct impact on groundwater recharge long duration low intensity rainfall is ideal for groundwater recharge because it produces little surface runoff and allows water to percolate down slowly the balance between the rate of surface runoff and groundwater infiltration is evaluated by drainage density the depth of the water table is one of the most important factors in determining the thickness of material that a contaminant must pass through before reaching the aquifer tomer et al 2019 the different sources of the utilized data are listed in table 1 each groundwater potential zone influencing factors and their sub classes of the study area were first investigated by the groundwater experts such as professors field engineers and scientist in accordance with their relative significance on groundwater occurrence a suitable ranking system on the scale of 1 10 was assigned to the factors sub class the subjective judgment used for rating assignment was done in such a way that the larger the relevance of groundwater potentiality the higher the rating assigned to the features sub class and vice versa arcgis 10 6 was used to create the reclassified thematic maps for all of the criteria fig 2 specifics of the methodology used 3 2 influencing parameters standardization using fuzzy membership function fuzzy logic is a method for converting expert semantic descriptions into a numerical spatial model that can estimate the location of something of interest the potential zone map was created in a gis environment using the fuzzy geospatial approach a two step process involves calculating fuzzy membership fm values for all parameters using the appropriate fm function and overlaying fm built layers in the gis platform using the appropriate operator parameter standardization using the fuzzy membership function is a first stage in the fuzzy suitability model several fuzzy membership functions are available in the arcgis version 10 6 software s fuzzy logic extension which produces a sigmoid shape of membership commonly used in many fuzzy logic applications esri 2012 according to mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 applying any of these functions is based on the midpoint and spread factors next is selection of the fuzzification membership function for each criterion s identity importance and relationship to the objective it is the user s task to choose the optimal function for modeling the fuzzy concept a linear fm function is utilized to generate fm values for all nine controlling factors in this study the fuzzy linear function establishes the linear relationship between the user s minimum and maximum inputs singha et al 2021 linear transformations are widely employed in the fuzzification of deterministic criteria fisher and binkley 2000 to convert raw input values to a membership scale of 0 1 a transformation function developed by the expert s opinion is used to assign fuzzy values the area with values closer to 1 have more groundwater potentiality while the area closer to 0 have less a positive slope linear transformation with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 is represented by the green line in fig 3 a zero will be allocated to any value less than 3 and 1 will be assigned to any value more than 8 a negative linear relationship a negative slope is formed when the minimum is greater than the maximum a negative slope linear transformation is shown by the orange line a 1 will be assigned to any number less than 3 and a 0 to any value more than 8 the transition zone is defined by the slope of the line which is either increasing or decreasing between 3 and 8 in fig 3 adopted from esri arcgis 1 μ p 0 i f p m i n μ p 1 i f p m a x o t h e r w i s e μ p p m i n m a x m i n where the min and max are user inputs the fm values of all nine groundwater influencing factors are assigned based on the control in groundwater occurrence in the present study the kriging interpolation technique creates all of the specified factors fm spatial layers as it is the most widely used linear unbiased estimator webster and oliver 2007 the weighted moving average of known values is used in the kriging method to estimate unknown values 3 3 fuzzy overlay after standardizing all components the authors integrated all elements that influence the gpzs to determine groundwater availability as a result the fuzzy inference network employs fuzzy operators the following section describes five major operators used in the fuzzy inference network to combine the factors and or algebraic product algebraic sum and gamma the fuzzy or operation is equivalent to the union set and extracts the highest degree of membership and combined uses using this operation between two membership functions the maximum value of a membership function has been selected 2 μ p m a x μ 1 p μ 2 p μ n p where μ1 μ2 μn the membership weights n the number of parameter layers used the intersection set which extracts the minimum degree of membership is equivalent to the fuzzy and operation it means that the minimum values weight per pixel were extracted from all of the membership functions and included in the final map esri 2012 as per equation 6 3 μ p m i n μ 1 p μ 2 p μ n p each function is multiplied together in a fuzzy product operation as a result the suitability value is lower than any single input and the pixel value in the final map tends to be zero as a result there are fewer pixels in the excellent groundwater potential category therefore this operator is extremely sensitive to the location esri 2012 the mathematical expression is given by equation 7 4 μ p i 1 i n μ i as the inputs are linearly combined by the fuzzy sum function the combined possibility is more important as a result unlike fuzzy product the pixel value in the final map leads to be 1 therefore more pixels are classified as having excellent groundwater potential moreover this operator applies a low degree of sensitivity to the location esri 2012 5 μ p 1 i 1 i n 1 μ i where μi pixel s membership value for the parameter i the fuzzy gamma operator is used in the current study to overlay the groundwater control factors fm layers the gis fuzzy overlay tool was used to overlay the fm maps to create the final gpz map of the study region 6 μ p f u z z y s u m γ f u z z y p r o d u c t 1 γ 3 4 sensitivity analysis using map elimination the uncertainty or fluctuation in the output findings derived from models applied is evaluated by sensitivity analysis sa saltelli et al 2008 in a broader sense it assesses the model output s robustness when input variables are adjusted estimating the change in output map with each change in inputs helps to understand the influence of various input parameters on the model s output several researchers looked into the effect of input parameters on model output which is influenced by multiple factors including the number of input parameters input inaccuracy weights and ranks allocated and the nature of the overlay conducted heuvelink et al 1989 sensitivity analysis was used in this study to discover significant factors among the nine groundwater regulating elements concerning the groundwater potentiality of the current research area the analysis identifies the sensitivity of groundwater potential by removing one or more layers of fuzzy membership maps of influencing parameters at a time and was calculated using equation 10 for each superimposed map the lowest highest average and standard deviation sd values of groundwater prospective indices were calculated 7 s i p n p x i n where s

number of total factors used in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 3 5 validation of potential zone validation of the groundwater potential zone includes the intersection of lineament and drainage line of the study area the intersection locations have maximum recharge capacity as it allows water to percolate into the ground to proceed with this the flow line and the lineament on the surface intersect using the intersect tool in arcgis the output from the intersect tool will be in point format with latitude and longitude in arcmap these points will be validated with google earth pro and a few validated locations with the site visit 4 results and discussion this section discusses the significance of selected parameters on groundwater occurrence and their fuzzy values factor removal sensitivity analysis and the validation of the result table 2 indicates the groundwater occurrence controlling factors their classification and ranking according to their potential to groundwater occurrence 4 1 relief r the existence of groundwater is also influenced by ground elevation and is governed by lithological meteorological and land surface degradation among other factors pourghasemi et al 2012 in the region the area has ground relief values ranging from 6 to 376 m and that was divided into three sub classifications 6 53 53 161 and 161 376 m fig 4 a groundwater flows from a higher relief to a lower allowing for greater rainfall to runoff as a result areas with relief less than 53 m obtained a relatively higher ranking table 2 within the study area the spatial distribution map of elevation fm revealed a range of values from 0 18 to 0 83 respectively fig 4b 4 2 drainage density dd the infiltration and underlying lithology are determined by drainage density which is a crucial indication of hydrological landscapes murmu et al 2019 the drainage network density ranges from 0 to 4 5 km km2 in the region hence the whole study area was divided into five sub categories such as 0 0 56 0 56 1 64 1 64 2 91 2 91 4 5 and 4 5 km km2 respectively fig 4c a substantial majority of the study area falls within the range of 0 0 56 km km2 covering over 2905 km2 while drainage density values 4 5 km km2 covered the smallest area 98 69 km2 table 2 except for a few places on the western and eastern sides of the study region a drainage density of 4 5 km km2 was usually found in the central region within the research area the highest and least fm values were 0 12 and 0 79 respectively fig 4d 4 3 geomorphology gm the distributed geomorphological pattern represents the land formation and topography of a specific area the geomorphological formations of the district are categories into six significant units fig 4e and ranked according to their relative importance for the tendency of surface water infiltration into groundwater storage such as alluvial plain 8 pedi plain 7 and plateau 6 have obtained relatively higher ratings than the other geomorphological segments table 2 in terms of alluvial plain 2012 27 62 km2 covers more than 47 percent of the study region trailed by pedi plain 1416 15 km2 plateau 372 74 km2 built up canal river waterbody 285 57 km2 coastal plain 186 63 km2 and structural hills 0 31 km2 fig 4f the fuzzy membership values ranged from 0 26 to 0 88 with higher values in the central and north western parts of the study area as the highest ranked alluvial plain found there 4 4 groundwater depth gw the hydraulic gradient of any region is expressed by the presence of water table depth of that area andualem and demeke 2019 it is significant for identifying the area of groundwater potentiality therefore areas with a shallow water table were given higher ratings and vice versa in this study the data from the average water table depth was used for the modeling the average water table depth ranged from 2 to 10 m so the district area was divided into four sub categories 2 5 5 7 7 10 and 10 m fig 4g the maximum area was found below the groundwater table depth of 5 7 m 1773 46 km2 followed by 2 5 m 1525 94 km2 7 10 m 1042 86 km2 and 10 m 46 29 km2 table 2 the values range from 0 14 to 0 85 for the fm spatial distribution of gw fig 4h 4 5 land use land cover lulc the infiltration and permeability processes are controlled by land use patterns land use and land cover have a substantial impact on water percolation into the ground among the different groundwater regulating parameters waterbodies wetland 3 66 agricultural land 71 24 forest land 11 01 built up area wastelands 8 85 and other class 5 24 are the five sub category units based on the land use pattern fig 5 a the water bodies including river tapi 156 41 km2 in surat district hold a significant amount of water in almost all seasons thus water bodies had been given the highest ranking as it was expected that these water units would influence recharge and raise groundwater levels in proximity to them agricultural land covered a large area of the district 3046 35 km2 which was distributed throughout the district with the exception of the central portion which s where the city is located as a result the area has developed into a built up activity groundwater recharge is better on agricultural land than on built up areas wasteland and other unidentified classes as loose soils influence water infiltration to the subsurface agricultural land is assigned a higher ranking after waterbodies natural vegetation and scrub forests abound in the district s northeast corner moreover a few patches are located near the arabian sea on the western side and in the southern part of the district covering a reasonable area of 470 91 km2 since dense forest has a higher capacity for water storage and augmenting the recharge process a higher ranking is given to forest cover after agricultural land the lulc fuzzy membership values are ranging from 0 20 to 0 80 in the surat district fig 5b 4 6 rainfall rf the rainfall distribution in the district ranged from 1044 to 1469 mm year and the entire area was divided into five categories 1044 1150 1150 1257 1257 1363 1363 1469 and 1469 mm year table 2 sub class ratings were assigned based on rainfall with higher rainfall equalling a higher possibility of water percolation and vice versa the distribution of rainfall fig 5c revealed that a few patches in the central and upper northern parts of the study regions 1469 mm year received significantly more rainfall than other regions earning a higher rating 10 for the present research table 2 the maximum area i e 1529 km2 which is located in the central and northern regions has a rainfall of 1257 1363 mm year the rainfall fm values in the study region ranged from 0 10 to 0 70 fig 5d 4 7 slope s high runoff and steep slopes are prone to less water recharge while a lower slope generates more water recharge in the surat district about 2191 km2 50 51 of the total area has a very gentle slope 0 2 35 fig 5e groundwater occurrence is favored by gentle slopes so these areas were given a high ranking the gentle slope 2 35 5 49 percent with moderate deep soils describes slightly less suitable groundwater soil accounting for 36 71 percent of the total area except for the north western part of the district these two slope categories are evenly distributed throughout the district as groundwater percolation is slower on a moderate slope than on a very gentle slope we assigned the gentle slope a lower ranking than the very gentle slope regions moderately potential land is approximately 422 30 km2 for groundwater due to moderate slopes 5 49 10 98 and moderate runoff this category is assigned by intermediate ranking approximately 108 73 km2 of the total area is unsuitable for groundwater recharge due to steep to extremely steep slopes because of its high runoff and low infiltration rate an area with a slope of more than 21 17 was deemed unsuitable for groundwater occurrence and a least ranking was assigned slope fm values are ranging from 0 31 to 0 85 in the region fig 5f 4 8 soil texture st a variety of soil textures was observed in the study area divided into three sub classes black clayey loam fine clay and very fine clay fig 5g the clayey loam is found in a 1009 km2 area in the district s higher elevation area on the northeast side however fine clay covers the majority of the area 60 72 which is distributed across the area except in the northeast the district s northwest and southwest regions 14 12 percent have a very fine clay cover the clayey loam was given a maximum rating of 5 based on the permeability of the soil whereas very fine clayey soil distribution was given a minimum rating of 3 table 2 the soil texture fm values for the maximum and minimum soil texture were 0 22 and 0 83 respectively fig 5h 4 9 lineament density ld according to the fractures available in litho logical strata a lineament density map was prepared the rose diagram depicts that lineament is mostly found in the region s southwest and northeast portion the majority of these lineaments run east southeast west and southwest fig 6 the district area was divided into five sub categories based on the lineament density ranging from 0 to 0 56 km km2 the categories are 0 0 11 0 11 0 22 0 22 0 34 0 34 0 45 and 0 45 0 56 km km2 fig 7 a higher lineaments feature densities correlated positively with potential groundwater zone magowe and carr 1999 according to this theory lineaments were given a ranking the fm values observed for the lineament density map are 0 09 as lowest and 0 65 as highest fig 7b 4 10 discussion on groundwater prospective zones the fuzzy overlay tool of arcgis 10 6 was used to integrate all of the considered groundwater occurrence influencing parameter fm layers which were created using the kriging interpolation technique to create the prospective map of the district for groundwater the gamma operator with a value of 0 9 was used fig 8 a with a mean and standard deviation sd of 0 23 and 0 29 the calculated indices ranged from 0 0004 to 0 7872 using the gis platform the entire district was divided into three sub categories based on the computed indices low 0 0004 0 2456 moderate 0 2456 0 5649 and high 0 5649 0 7872 prospective zones according to the result the area covered by the alluvial plain and pedi plain has maximum changes of high groundwater potentiality moreover the area of drainage density is higher 0 0 56 km km2 in the central portion which increases the potentiality in the central part of the district in addition the majority area of the district falls under the slope categories of 0 2 35 and 2 35 5 49 categories which can retain water which may be the reason to find the high potential zone into the central part the north eastern part of the district is occupied by the higher elevation which might be the cause for the moderate and lower potentiality of groundwater in that area in the context of lineament density the highest potentiality of the region is subjected to the lineament density range of 0 11 0 22 km km2 which covers almost each area of the district except a few patches in central parts additionally the built up area is in the western part of the district as it is a city area and that causes the low potentiality for groundwater on the contrary the maximum area of the district has an agricultural field which may lead to a high prospective zone in the other part the distribution of clayey loam and fine clayey soil in the district has increased the high potentiality of groundwater the rainfall varies from 1044 to 1469 mm year which may increase the chances of groundwater potentials moreover the maximum area of the district is covered with 2 7 m groundwater depth which can also increase the groundwater potential in the district 4 11 model sensitivity map removal method during the prospective zone computing process a model sensitivity study was applied by eliminating each governing parameter one by one from the underlying operation in the gis environment table 3 shows a significant variance in the selected factors based on statistical analysis the most important factors influencing the region s groundwater potentiality according to sensitivity analysis are lineament density sd 0 0072 rainfall distribution sd 0 0062 and geomorphology sd 0 0056 a higher sd value indicates a higher spatial variation of factors in the study area however the lower sd values were observed for slope sd 0 0019 and lulc sd 0 0017 during the removal of these factors compared to the removal of other factors from the map overlay process table 4 4 12 validation and artificial recharge to validate the groundwater prospective zones authors have intersected the natural drainage and lineament on the earth surface under the study area the result shows that 154 points were found in the surat district as a recharge point among all the points the maximum point 73 29 was found in the high groundwater prospective zone fig 8b all the points are checked with google earth pro software and it is found that 97 points have a recharge structure on them table a 1 it includes pond canal check dam etc moreover there are 57 points on which it can be suggested to build groundwater recharge structures table 4 depicts the recharge structures that can be proposed at a particular point when the location is found on the edge of the farm we have suggested farm pond almost 43 points suites the farm pond structure if the location is found on tributaries or small streams it is suggested to build a check dam structure which helps to percolate water into the ground moreover farmers can take direct advantage of the water if the farm falls under the catchment area of the check dam almost seven check dams are suggested in the study area additionally the authors have suggested seven suitable sites for gabian structure on the small watercourse gabian structures are advisable when the purpose is not to stop the water but to increase the retention time of water this may elevate the percolation of water inside the ground 5 conclusions the present research shows the application of an integrated gis rs based fuzzy approach to model groundwater prospective zones in surat district india in the gis environment a total of nine thematic layers were created each thematic layer and its sub classes were first investigated by groundwater experts in the study area according to their relative importance on groundwater existence a suitable rating system from 1 to 10 scales was assigned to the factors the fuzzy overlay tool in the gis platform was used to overlaid each layer with its fuzzy logic membership values the result indicates that approximately 62 53 2630 63 km2 of the area has a high groundwater potential zone in the surat district the high potential zone is spread everywhere in the district though approximately 38 of the area of surat district falls under the moderate to low potential zone including eastern and western parts due to the land use pattern higher elevation etc additionally the result of sensitivity analysis indicates that lineament density rainfall distribution and geomorphology are the most influencing parameters to groundwater prospective zones furthermore the groundwater prospective zones are validated with the intersection of natural drainage and lineament on the earth surface indicating the maximum recharge sites 73 29 found under high groundwater prospective zones it exhibits that the approach applied in the study area is showing high accuracy the authors have observed enough existing recharge structures in high prospective zones via google earth pro few recharge structures are also proposed according to the actual ground condition on the site the present research will be useful for government authorities scientists and policymakers for sustainable groundwater management as some of the parts of the district still possess the moderate to low potentiality of groundwater all in all this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic tool in defining groundwater prospective zones and shows that it

11822,sustainable groundwater management is becoming a priority in the context of significant changes in groundwater use patterns particularly with continuously increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population expansion of irrigation area and economic progress this research contributed to the integration of gis rs and a fuzzy technique to delineate groundwater prospective zones for surat district india in this study nine different fuzzy membership layers of influencing parameters were overlaid using the fuzzy gamma operator to generate the prospective zones the result indicates that 62 53 area of the district falls under the high prospective zone sensitivity analysis reveals that lineament density rainfall distribution and geomorphology were the most important parameters influencing the region s groundwater potentiality the rs gis based fuzzy method is proficient and efficient and can be applied anywhere on the earth to identify and delineate groundwater prospective zones graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater influencing parameters gis groundwater prospective zone sensitivity analysis fuzzy membership 1 introduction in the list of vital natural resources groundwater is known as an essential natural resource its uses in different industries have made it a significant component of the living things on earth the availability of groundwater varies temporally and geographically domestic agricultural and industrial uses account for approximately 36 percent 42 percent and 27 percent respectively of total groundwater production globally patra et al 2018 in the countries like india many rural populations 90 as well as the urban population 30 depend on groundwater to compete for their essential needs agarwal and garg 2016 however shortages and extensive exploitation of groundwater resources without proper engineered planning are all too common rodell et al 2009 many areas of india have seen dramatic declines in groundwater levels due to increased extraction over the last two decades cwc and cgwb 2016 groundwater potential estimation is a difficult task because it necessitates the precise evaluation of all recharge and discharge parameters the application of remote sensing rs with geographical information systems gis has brought new possibilities for analysing massive amounts of geospatial data and accurately mapping various natural resources gandhi and patel 2019 traditional groundwater data collection methods take a lot of time money and personnel automated techniques like rs and gis have emerged as effective platforms to understand the numerous groundwater challenges it provides a systematic synoptic rapid and excellent configuration for handling massive and complicated satellite data yeh et al 2016 the availability of diverse satellite data makes it easy to efficiently and adequately research the baseline information on groundwater as a result geospatial methods have become an essential tool for groundwater mapping in recent decades the delineation of the groundwater prospective area is a paradigm that may build strategies for the long term utilization of groundwater resources various researchers have delineated groundwater potential zones gpzs using various techniques such as gis based mcdm arabameri et al 2019 ahp process banerjee and kumartilak 2021 fuzzy logic ahmad et al 2020 woa murasingh et al 2018 multi influencing factors magesh et al 2012 das and pardeshi 2018 fuzzy ahp method jesiya and gopinath 2020 some studies combined a gis and rs methodology with multi criteria decision making mcda analysis adimallataloor 2020 mcdm is a concept that allows choosing the best option from a set of options by weighing them against various criteria kilic and kaya 2015 alternatives are successfully ranked using mcdm techniques which are categorized as conventional and fuzzy in terms of linguistic uncertainty traditional mcdm techniques are deemed insufficient kahraman et al 2014 the fuzzy inference systems can function in the presence of a large number of variables and has the ability to manage linguistic attributes without losing the crucial part of the concepts jesiya and gopinath 2019 therefore it is better to use mcdm techniques with fuzzy sets to deal with uncertainty in decision making moreover the fuzzy technique enables to obtain more precise findings kaya et al 2019 in the last few years the fuzzy integrated geospatial approach was a supportive tool in assessing many worldwide problems according to the study the gis fuzzy technique provides flood prone zones with higher accuracy of approximately 91 6 malik et al 2020 moreover the study on groundwater quality using this tool is carried out and analysed the preferable potable water site in the asalem region of iran mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 surat the district of gujarat state india has problems regarding groundwater storm water and agricultural water management according to the census of india 2011 the population of surat district is almost 61 8 lakhs the value of the study area is due to the fact that surat city is the fastest growing city in the world on the banks of the river tapi also known as the diamond and silk city of india the diverse industrial development sustainable agricultural yield and other small medium commercialization have enhanced the economic growth of the city however the city had suffered from large tangible and intangible damages in past years the primary sources of irrigation in the district are groundwater and canals and no area is irrigated by tanks and ponds cgwb 2013 the district s groundwater development is primarily focused on meeting irrigational and residential needs hence it is essential to pay close attention to the groundwater conservation and replenishment plan proper understanding of influencing parameters to groundwater potentials may lead to an appropriate action strategy for groundwater resource management in order to achieve better significant accuracy the current study has performed gpzs in the study region utilising 9 thematic layers despite all of the aforementioned studies very few have employed the innovative gis fuzzy technique to decipher the gpzs moreover there is no attempt has been made to demarcate the gpzs in the study area a map removal sensitivity analysis is carried out to better understand the impact of various thematic layers the validation of the research s findings is the most important component of any hydrological or hydro geological investigation usually the validation includes the comparison of output with different mathematical models or ground truth in the studies affiliated with the groundwater according to the different literature studies on groundwater potentiality numerous methods applied for validation are based on the curvature of the region groundwater well yield or existing groundwater level data however the present study has utilized the method that intersect the natural drainage and lineament considering all of this the current study has the potential to play an important role in groundwater management in the study region by accurately defining gpzs the objectives of the study include the demarcation of the gpzs in the study area by utilising the integrated gis fuzzy approach application of sensitivity analysis to identify the more sensitive thematic layers and the validation of the identified gpzs thus the research will be beneficial in the management of local groundwater resources policy development and reducing the region s groundwater vulnerability 2 study area surat is a district in gujarat state india fig 1 geographically the district is located in south gujarat the arabian sea is on the west side of the district moreover bharuch navsari dang and tapi districts are surrounded by north south south east and east the district covers a total size of 4418 km2 and is located between 20 30 21 35n and 72 35 74 20e the district is on the western coast of the deccan peninsula although the major sahyadri scarp is beyond the district s eastern limits it is responsible for its landscape geographic characteristics and drainage pattern the area includes four main zones hilly areas piedmont slopes alluvial plains and coastal plains cgwb 2012 the tapi is a major river perennial in nature that runs through the district s central part and flows towards the west a majority portion of the district approximate 71 is occupied by agricultural land sugarcane and paddy as the predominant crops of the region moreover the other major crops cultivated are jawar wheat groundnut banana vegetables etc nabard 2016 17 surat has a tropical savanna climate that is moderated by the gulf of cambay and the arabian sea early march marks the beginning of summer which lasts until june the hottest months are april and may with average maximum temperatures of 37 c moreover the monsoon season starts in late june and lasts until the end of september with temperatures averaging 32 c the monsoon retreats in october and november bringing high temperatures back until late november the average rainfall in the monsoon season is approximate 1143 mm winter lasts from december to late february with average mean temperatures of around 23 c and little rain the most extensive aquifers in the district are the deccan trap which can be found in the district s north eastern eastern and south eastern areas cgwb 2012 3 data and methods 3 1 factors selection and their significance the behaviour and movement of underground water are influenced by numerous variables including earth characteristics meteorological factors etc their influence varies by region so accurate delineation of the groundwater prospective zone necessitates careful selection the research interest natural attributes of the area and their availability play a role in their selection in this research work nine parameters including soil texture geomorphology land use land cover lulc relief rainfall slope drainage density lineament density and existing groundwater depth were considered these parameters are based on the extensive literature study verma and patel 2021 tomer et al 2019 thapa et al 2018 doke et al 2021 prasad et al 2008 das and pal 2019 maity and mandal 2019 nature of the study area and experts opinions groundwater occurrence and spatial distribution are strongly influenced by local geology and hydrogeology the subsurface movement of groundwater is governed by geomorphology muralitharan and palanivel 2015 kumar and pramod krishna 2020 soil properties such as soil type and texture play a significant role in groundwater spatial variation mehra et al 2016 water percolates downward through lineaments which serve as conduits a permeable zone is usually indicated by its presence because of the high percolation rate an area near lineaments and their intersection points are an ideal place to store groundwater mukherjee and singh 2020 as a result areas with a higher density of lineaments have a greater influence on groundwater potentials and vice versa the relief of a region reflects the ruggedness of the terrain and is used to demarcate potential groundwater zones the rate of infiltration and surface runoff is controlled by the slope gradient high surface runoff and slope stiffness generate less recharge than mild gentle slopes allowing more time for rainwater to infiltrate ghosh et al 2020 lulc has an impact on groundwater recharge and infiltration and soil moisture in a given area due to low permeability and high surface runoff barren lands rocky surfaces and built up land are poor groundwater occurrence repositories moreover the amount of rainfall has a direct impact on groundwater recharge long duration low intensity rainfall is ideal for groundwater recharge because it produces little surface runoff and allows water to percolate down slowly the balance between the rate of surface runoff and groundwater infiltration is evaluated by drainage density the depth of the water table is one of the most important factors in determining the thickness of material that a contaminant must pass through before reaching the aquifer tomer et al 2019 the different sources of the utilized data are listed in table 1 each groundwater potential zone influencing factors and their sub classes of the study area were first investigated by the groundwater experts such as professors field engineers and scientist in accordance with their relative significance on groundwater occurrence a suitable ranking system on the scale of 1 10 was assigned to the factors sub class the subjective judgment used for rating assignment was done in such a way that the larger the relevance of groundwater potentiality the higher the rating assigned to the features sub class and vice versa arcgis 10 6 was used to create the reclassified thematic maps for all of the criteria fig 2 specifics of the methodology used 3 2 influencing parameters standardization using fuzzy membership function fuzzy logic is a method for converting expert semantic descriptions into a numerical spatial model that can estimate the location of something of interest the potential zone map was created in a gis environment using the fuzzy geospatial approach a two step process involves calculating fuzzy membership fm values for all parameters using the appropriate fm function and overlaying fm built layers in the gis platform using the appropriate operator parameter standardization using the fuzzy membership function is a first stage in the fuzzy suitability model several fuzzy membership functions are available in the arcgis version 10 6 software s fuzzy logic extension which produces a sigmoid shape of membership commonly used in many fuzzy logic applications esri 2012 according to mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 applying any of these functions is based on the midpoint and spread factors next is selection of the fuzzification membership function for each criterion s identity importance and relationship to the objective it is the user s task to choose the optimal function for modeling the fuzzy concept a linear fm function is utilized to generate fm values for all nine controlling factors in this study the fuzzy linear function establishes the linear relationship between the user s minimum and maximum inputs singha et al 2021 linear transformations are widely employed in the fuzzification of deterministic criteria fisher and binkley 2000 to convert raw input values to a membership scale of 0 1 a transformation function developed by the expert s opinion is used to assign fuzzy values the area with values closer to 1 have more groundwater potentiality while the area closer to 0 have less a positive slope linear transformation with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 is represented by the green line in fig 3 a zero will be allocated to any value less than 3 and 1 will be assigned to any value more than 8 a negative linear relationship a negative slope is formed when the minimum is greater than the maximum a negative slope linear transformation is shown by the orange line a 1 will be assigned to any number less than 3 and a 0 to any value more than 8 the transition zone is defined by the slope of the line which is either increasing or decreasing between 3 and 8 in fig 3 adopted from esri arcgis 1 μ p 0 i f p m i n μ p 1 i f p m a x o t h e r w i s e μ p p m i n m a x m i n where the min and max are user inputs the fm values of all nine groundwater influencing factors are assigned based on the control in groundwater occurrence in the present study the kriging interpolation technique creates all of the specified factors fm spatial layers as it is the most widely used linear unbiased estimator webster and oliver 2007 the weighted moving average of known values is used in the kriging method to estimate unknown values 3 3 fuzzy overlay after standardizing all components the authors integrated all elements that influence the gpzs to determine groundwater availability as a result the fuzzy inference network employs fuzzy operators the following section describes five major operators used in the fuzzy inference network to combine the factors and or algebraic product algebraic sum and gamma the fuzzy or operation is equivalent to the union set and extracts the highest degree of membership and combined uses using this operation between two membership functions the maximum value of a membership function has been selected 2 μ p m a x μ 1 p μ 2 p μ n p where μ1 μ2 μn the membership weights n the number of parameter layers used the intersection set which extracts the minimum degree of membership is equivalent to the fuzzy and operation it means that the minimum values weight per pixel were extracted from all of the membership functions and included in the final map esri 2012 as per equation 6 3 μ p m i n μ 1 p μ 2 p μ n p each function is multiplied together in a fuzzy product operation as a result the suitability value is lower than any single input and the pixel value in the final map tends to be zero as a result there are fewer pixels in the excellent groundwater potential category therefore this operator is extremely sensitive to the location esri 2012 the mathematical expression is given by equation 7 4 μ p i 1 i n μ i as the inputs are linearly combined by the fuzzy sum function the combined possibility is more important as a result unlike fuzzy product the pixel value in the final map leads to be 1 therefore more pixels are classified as having excellent groundwater potential moreover this operator applies a low degree of sensitivity to the location esri 2012 5 μ p 1 i 1 i n 1 μ i where μi pixel s membership value for the parameter i the fuzzy gamma operator is used in the current study to overlay the groundwater control factors fm layers the gis fuzzy overlay tool was used to overlay the fm maps to create the final gpz map of the study region 6 μ p f u z z y s u m γ f u z z y p r o d u c t 1 γ 3 4 sensitivity analysis using map elimination the uncertainty or fluctuation in the output findings derived from models applied is evaluated by sensitivity analysis sa saltelli et al 2008 in a broader sense it assesses the model output s robustness when input variables are adjusted estimating the change in output map with each change in inputs helps to understand the influence of various input parameters on the model s output several researchers looked into the effect of input parameters on model output which is influenced by multiple factors including the number of input parameters input inaccuracy weights and ranks allocated and the nature of the overlay conducted heuvelink et al 1989 sensitivity analysis was used in this study to discover significant factors among the nine groundwater regulating elements concerning the groundwater potentiality of the current research area the analysis identifies the sensitivity of groundwater potential by removing one or more layers of fuzzy membership maps of influencing parameters at a time and was calculated using equation 10 for each superimposed map the lowest highest average and standard deviation sd values of groundwater prospective indices were calculated 7 s i p n p x i n where s

number of total factors used in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 3 5 validation of potential zone validation of the groundwater potential zone includes the intersection of lineament and drainage line of the study area the intersection locations have maximum recharge capacity as it allows water to percolate into the ground to proceed with this the flow line and the lineament on the surface intersect using the intersect tool in arcgis the output from the intersect tool will be in point format with latitude and longitude in arcmap these points will be validated with google earth pro and a few validated locations with the site visit 4 results and discussion this section discusses the significance of selected parameters on groundwater occurrence and their fuzzy values factor removal sensitivity analysis and the validation of the result table 2 indicates the groundwater occurrence controlling factors their classification and ranking according to their potential to groundwater occurrence 4 1 relief r the existence of groundwater is also influenced by ground elevation and is governed by lithological meteorological and land surface degradation among other factors pourghasemi et al 2012 in the region the area has ground relief values ranging from 6 to 376 m and that was divided into three sub classifications 6 53 53 161 and 161 376 m fig 4 a groundwater flows from a higher relief to a lower allowing for greater rainfall to runoff as a result areas with relief less than 53 m obtained a relatively higher ranking table 2 within the study area the spatial distribution map of elevation fm revealed a range of values from 0 18 to 0 83 respectively fig 4b 4 2 drainage density dd the infiltration and underlying lithology are determined by drainage density which is a crucial indication of hydrological landscapes murmu et al 2019 the drainage network density ranges from 0 to 4 5 km km2 in the region hence the whole study area was divided into five sub categories such as 0 0 56 0 56 1 64 1 64 2 91 2 91 4 5 and 4 5 km km2 respectively fig 4c a substantial majority of the study area falls within the range of 0 0 56 km km2 covering over 2905 km2 while drainage density values 4 5 km km2 covered the smallest area 98 69 km2 table 2 except for a few places on the western and eastern sides of the study region a drainage density of 4 5 km km2 was usually found in the central region within the research area the highest and least fm values were 0 12 and 0 79 respectively fig 4d 4 3 geomorphology gm the distributed geomorphological pattern represents the land formation and topography of a specific area the geomorphological formations of the district are categories into six significant units fig 4e and ranked according to their relative importance for the tendency of surface water infiltration into groundwater storage such as alluvial plain 8 pedi plain 7 and plateau 6 have obtained relatively higher ratings than the other geomorphological segments table 2 in terms of alluvial plain 2012 27 62 km2 covers more than 47 percent of the study region trailed by pedi plain 1416 15 km2 plateau 372 74 km2 built up canal river waterbody 285 57 km2 coastal plain 186 63 km2 and structural hills 0 31 km2 fig 4f the fuzzy membership values ranged from 0 26 to 0 88 with higher values in the central and north western parts of the study area as the highest ranked alluvial plain found there 4 4 groundwater depth gw the hydraulic gradient of any region is expressed by the presence of water table depth of that area andualem and demeke 2019 it is significant for identifying the area of groundwater potentiality therefore areas with a shallow water table were given higher ratings and vice versa in this study the data from the average water table depth was used for the modeling the average water table depth ranged from 2 to 10 m so the district area was divided into four sub categories 2 5 5 7 7 10 and 10 m fig 4g the maximum area was found below the groundwater table depth of 5 7 m 1773 46 km2 followed by 2 5 m 1525 94 km2 7 10 m 1042 86 km2 and 10 m 46 29 km2 table 2 the values range from 0 14 to 0 85 for the fm spatial distribution of gw fig 4h 4 5 land use land cover lulc the infiltration and permeability processes are controlled by land use patterns land use and land cover have a substantial impact on water percolation into the ground among the different groundwater regulating parameters waterbodies wetland 3 66 agricultural land 71 24 forest land 11 01 built up area wastelands 8 85 and other class 5 24 are the five sub category units based on the land use pattern fig 5 a the water bodies including river tapi 156 41 km2 in surat district hold a significant amount of water in almost all seasons thus water bodies had been given the highest ranking as it was expected that these water units would influence recharge and raise groundwater levels in proximity to them agricultural land covered a large area of the district 3046 35 km2 which was distributed throughout the district with the exception of the central portion which s where the city is located as a result the area has developed into a built up activity groundwater recharge is better on agricultural land than on built up areas wasteland and other unidentified classes as loose soils influence water infiltration to the subsurface agricultural land is assigned a higher ranking after waterbodies natural vegetation and scrub forests abound in the district s northeast corner moreover a few patches are located near the arabian sea on the western side and in the southern part of the district covering a reasonable area of 470 91 km2 since dense forest has a higher capacity for water storage and augmenting the recharge process a higher ranking is given to forest cover after agricultural land the lulc fuzzy membership values are ranging from 0 20 to 0 80 in the surat district fig 5b 4 6 rainfall rf the rainfall distribution in the district ranged from 1044 to 1469 mm year and the entire area was divided into five categories 1044 1150 1150 1257 1257 1363 1363 1469 and 1469 mm year table 2 sub class ratings were assigned based on rainfall with higher rainfall equalling a higher possibility of water percolation and vice versa the distribution of rainfall fig 5c revealed that a few patches in the central and upper northern parts of the study regions 1469 mm year received significantly more rainfall than other regions earning a higher rating 10 for the present research table 2 the maximum area i e 1529 km2 which is located in the central and northern regions has a rainfall of 1257 1363 mm year the rainfall fm values in the study region ranged from 0 10 to 0 70 fig 5d 4 7 slope s high runoff and steep slopes are prone to less water recharge while a lower slope generates more water recharge in the surat district about 2191 km2 50 51 of the total area has a very gentle slope 0 2 35 fig 5e groundwater occurrence is favored by gentle slopes so these areas were given a high ranking the gentle slope 2 35 5 49 percent with moderate deep soils describes slightly less suitable groundwater soil accounting for 36 71 percent of the total area except for the north western part of the district these two slope categories are evenly distributed throughout the district as groundwater percolation is slower on a moderate slope than on a very gentle slope we assigned the gentle slope a lower ranking than the very gentle slope regions moderately potential land is approximately 422 30 km2 for groundwater due to moderate slopes 5 49 10 98 and moderate runoff this category is assigned by intermediate ranking approximately 108 73 km2 of the total area is unsuitable for groundwater recharge due to steep to extremely steep slopes because of its high runoff and low infiltration rate an area with a slope of more than 21 17 was deemed unsuitable for groundwater occurrence and a least ranking was assigned slope fm values are ranging from 0 31 to 0 85 in the region fig 5f 4 8 soil texture st a variety of soil textures was observed in the study area divided into three sub classes black clayey loam fine clay and very fine clay fig 5g the clayey loam is found in a 1009 km2 area in the district s higher elevation area on the northeast side however fine clay covers the majority of the area 60 72 which is distributed across the area except in the northeast the district s northwest and southwest regions 14 12 percent have a very fine clay cover the clayey loam was given a maximum rating of 5 based on the permeability of the soil whereas very fine clayey soil distribution was given a minimum rating of 3 table 2 the soil texture fm values for the maximum and minimum soil texture were 0 22 and 0 83 respectively fig 5h 4 9 lineament density ld according to the fractures available in litho logical strata a lineament density map was prepared the rose diagram depicts that lineament is mostly found in the region s southwest and northeast portion the majority of these lineaments run east southeast west and southwest fig 6 the district area was divided into five sub categories based on the lineament density ranging from 0 to 0 56 km km2 the categories are 0 0 11 0 11 0 22 0 22 0 34 0 34 0 45 and 0 45 0 56 km km2 fig 7 a higher lineaments feature densities correlated positively with potential groundwater zone magowe and carr 1999 according to this theory lineaments were given a ranking the fm values observed for the lineament density map are 0 09 as lowest and 0 65 as highest fig 7b 4 10 discussion on groundwater prospective zones the fuzzy overlay tool of arcgis 10 6 was used to integrate all of the considered groundwater occurrence influencing parameter fm layers which were created using the kriging interpolation technique to create the prospective map of the district for groundwater the gamma operator with a value of 0 9 was used fig 8 a with a mean and standard deviation sd of 0 23 and 0 29 the calculated indices ranged from 0 0004 to 0 7872 using the gis platform the entire district was divided into three sub categories based on the computed indices low 0 0004 0 2456 moderate 0 2456 0 5649 and high 0 5649 0 7872 prospective zones according to the result the area covered by the alluvial plain and pedi plain has maximum changes of high groundwater potentiality moreover the area of drainage density is higher 0 0 56 km km2 in the central portion which increases the potentiality in the central part of the district in addition the majority area of the district falls under the slope categories of 0 2 35 and 2 35 5 49 categories which can retain water which may be the reason to find the high potential zone into the central part the north eastern part of the district is occupied by the higher elevation which might be the cause for the moderate and lower potentiality of groundwater in that area in the context of lineament density the highest potentiality of the region is subjected to the lineament density range of 0 11 0 22 km km2 which covers almost each area of the district except a few patches in central parts additionally the built up area is in the western part of the district as it is a city area and that causes the low potentiality for groundwater on the contrary the maximum area of the district has an agricultural field which may lead to a high prospective zone in the other part the distribution of clayey loam and fine clayey soil in the district has increased the high potentiality of groundwater the rainfall varies from 1044 to 1469 mm year which may increase the chances of groundwater potentials moreover the maximum area of the district is covered with 2 7 m groundwater depth which can also increase the groundwater potential in the district 4 11 model sensitivity map removal method during the prospective zone computing process a model sensitivity study was applied by eliminating each governing parameter one by one from the underlying operation in the gis environment table 3 shows a significant variance in the selected factors based on statistical analysis the most important factors influencing the region s groundwater potentiality according to sensitivity analysis are lineament density sd 0 0072 rainfall distribution sd 0 0062 and geomorphology sd 0 0056 a higher sd value indicates a higher spatial variation of factors in the study area however the lower sd values were observed for slope sd 0 0019 and lulc sd 0 0017 during the removal of these factors compared to the removal of other factors from the map overlay process table 4 4 12 validation and artificial recharge to validate the groundwater prospective zones authors have intersected the natural drainage and lineament on the earth surface under the study area the result shows that 154 points were found in the surat district as a recharge point among all the points the maximum point 73 29 was found in the high groundwater prospective zone fig 8b all the points are checked with google earth pro software and it is found that 97 points have a recharge structure on them table a 1 it includes pond canal check dam etc moreover there are 57 points on which it can be suggested to build groundwater recharge structures table 4 depicts the recharge structures that can be proposed at a particular point when the location is found on the edge of the farm we have suggested farm pond almost 43 points suites the farm pond structure if the location is found on tributaries or small streams it is suggested to build a check dam structure which helps to percolate water into the ground moreover farmers can take direct advantage of the water if the farm falls under the catchment area of the check dam almost seven check dams are suggested in the study area additionally the authors have suggested seven suitable sites for gabian structure on the small watercourse gabian structures are advisable when the purpose is not to stop the water but to increase the retention time of water this may elevate the percolation of water inside the ground 5 conclusions the present research shows the application of an integrated gis rs based fuzzy approach to model groundwater prospective zones in surat district india in the gis environment a total of nine thematic layers were created each thematic layer and its sub classes were first investigated by groundwater experts in the study area according to their relative importance on groundwater existence a suitable rating system from 1 to 10 scales was assigned to the factors the fuzzy overlay tool in the gis platform was used to overlaid each layer with its fuzzy logic membership values the result indicates that approximately 62 53 2630 63 km2 of the area has a high groundwater potential zone in the surat district the high potential zone is spread everywhere in the district though approximately 38 of the area of surat district falls under the moderate to low potential zone including eastern and western parts due to the land use pattern higher elevation etc additionally the result of sensitivity analysis indicates that lineament density rainfall distribution and geomorphology are the most influencing parameters to groundwater prospective zones furthermore the groundwater prospective zones are validated with the intersection of natural drainage and lineament on the earth surface indicating the maximum recharge sites 73 29 found under high groundwater prospective zones it exhibits that the approach applied in the study area is showing high accuracy the authors have observed enough existing recharge structures in high prospective zones via google earth pro few recharge structures are also proposed according to the actual ground condition on the site the present research will be useful for government authorities scientists and policymakers for sustainable groundwater management as some of the parts of the district still possess the moderate to low potentiality of groundwater all in all this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic tool in defining groundwater prospective zones and shows that it can be successfully applied elsewhere with necessary changes declaration of submission and verification this paper has not been published previously declaration of competing interest the authors

11823,in managing groundwater demand pricing system reform plays an important role however changing water price faces political and social resistance for optimal pricing it is necessary to calculate accurately the cost of water from wells the present study aimed to calculate the actual cost of water from underground resources for various uses and study the impact of electricity price subsidies liberalization on it in addition the impact of choosing engineering economics and accounting methodologies on actual cost outcomes was examined this study was conducted in kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province iran in 2019 with data obtained from information on the annual budgets of provincial water companies the results indicated that the actual cost of water for agricultural drinking and industrial uses was 1613 2555 and 4739 rials m3 respectively calculated with engineering economics methods and 877 2111 and 2848 rials m3 respectively calculated with accounting methodologies furthermore costs were found to be far different from the current tariffs received for water liberalizing electricity price subsidies for agricultural uses and their calculation based on public electricity tariffs increased actual water costs by 63 and could reduce water use by about 21 therefore it is suggested that a policy of gradually reducing electricity subsidies along with price discrimination among various uses be considered in order to provide consumers with an opportunity to reform and update water use technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords water actual cost of water engineering economics accounting electricity subsidy iran 1 introduction a glance at the world s water resources and water supply methods and comparing them with past practices indicate that some changes have been made toward constraining water resources decreasing water resources increasing populations and the development of industrial and agricultural activities has led to a reduction in the quantity and quality of water thus there has been a fierce competition for this scarce resource for many years resulting in violence and even military action globally groundwater makes up about 96 of the non frozen freshwater that is accessible for human consumption it contributes from 60 to 100 of the water supplied to arid and semi arid regions of the world groundwater has been the backbone of socio economic development in both urban and rural areas in africa asia and latin america and developing countries account for 71 of the global abstraction of groundwater rajeevan and kumarmishra 2020 in a study titled the water crisis and the feasibility of connecting north south water zones conducted in 2017 the falkenmark index showed that iran in 2016 was in a water stress phase with 1450 m3 renewable water per capita according to this index the water stress phase is when the annual water supply per capita is 1700 m3 and an annual water supply per capita of 1000 m3 is considered a water shortage in addition according to the united nations commission on sustainable development s benchmark for determining the water crisis index based on the harvesting percentage of each country s renewable water resources the middle east and iran are facing a severe water crisis with coefficients of 55 and 72 3 respectively cdfr ibpo 2017 iran is located in arid and semi arid regions of the earth the country s groundwater resources are currently in critical condition due to overexploitation and recent droughts the decline in groundwater aquifer levels has led to serious restrictions in more than 404 of 609 plains and to a cumulative storage deficit in groundwater resources of around 130 billion cubic meters recent droughts have reduced the average long term rainfall from 254 mm to about 240 mm per year equivalent to one third of the global average and less than half of the continental rainfall in asia samani 2021 therefore it is necessary to address the management of exploitation of underground aquifers especially by using economic tools in this regard salem et al 2018 concluded that the impact of climate change induced fluctuations in groundwater levels is much less on crop production costs than other costs but it may be significant in locations where groundwater levels are declining fast the concept of water as an economic commodity came up during preparatory meetings for the earth summit in rio de janeiro of 1992 considering water as such concerns making informed choices about its use conservation and allocation water having a price will give a clear signal to users that it is indeed a scarce good that should be used sparingly der and savenije 2006 estimating the actual cost of water and determining the appropriate water pricing system are clearly emphasized in high level documents from a global perspective one of these documents is article a clause 3 of the targeted subsidies law in iran which emphasizes the pricing of water for different uses depending on the quality and production process which is equivalent to the actual cost of water according to article 33 of the iranian fair water distribution act the ministry of energy is obliged to determine the price of water for urban agricultural industrial and other uses depending on its consumption for each use and receiving it after approval by the economic council in addition based on articles 4 and 6 of the long term development strategies of iran s water resources article c clause 17 of the fourth economic and social development plan of the country and article 59 of this law calculating the economic value of water is considered one of the tasks of the water sector during the program and calculating the actual cost is the inevitable first step toward balancing the economic value and full cost of water ataie et al 2016 this issue is also emphasized in the world food and agriculture organization fao the world bank s policies and the world conference on environment and development s document 1992 center for presidential strategic studies 2016 based on global experience economic foundations and upstream legal documents one of the best tools for managing water demand and helping to eliminate resource and consumption imbalances is an efficient pricing system najafi alamdarloo et al 2013 found that raising water prices leads to a reduction in groundwater extraction and improving water balance portoghese et al 2021 believe that water pricing has been identified as a generally valid water supply policy to help solve problems of water scarcity and competition to achieve such a system the price of the supply side and that of the demand side must be determined to aid achieving this goal in iran the current study has calculated the cost of water for different uses and with different computational methods to prepare supporting documents for the reformation of the water pricing system many studies have been conducted on water pricing and the impact of such a policy on water resource management tahamipour zarandi 2017 evaluated the economic value of water for basic chemical industries other than fertilizers and nitrogen compounds 2411 and found that allocating each cubic meter of water to such industrial activities creates a value equivalent to 37071 rials which is far from the cost of purchasing each cubic meter of water in this industrial code about 5685 rials therefore water tariffs can be raised as a policy of price discrimination between industrial codes along with water demand management ren et al 2018 calculated the price of agricultural irrigation water extracted from surface and groundwater sources on both the small and large scale as well as the cost effective cost for the three main crops of corn rice and soybeans for farmers in the heilongjiang region of china their results indicated that the price of large scale agricultural irrigation water is 1 023 yuan per cubic meter which shows that the current price of agricultural irrigation water does not reflect the value of water resources groundwater prices for corn rice and soybeans range from 0 317 to 0 507 from 0 131 to 0 210 and from 0 211 to 0 337 yuan per cubic meter respectively asadi et al 2016 estimated the actual cost per cubic meter of agricultural wells in gorgan city for irrigation water at interest rates of 10 15 and 20 was 1270 1540 and 1820 rials respectively they suggested that any water pricing policy should be accompanied by policies to improve the irrigation system and supply subsidies to farmers for developing their farm irrigation systems ataie et al 2016 found that the average actual cost per cubic meter of surface and underground water resources in fars province is 860 and 544 rials respectively while each cubic meter of water for the agricultural production in fars province leads to a maximum 350 rials net benefit watto and mugera 2016 reported that farmers extract more groundwater than needed for cultivated crops and allocate land to different crops based on their profitability rather than their water needs abdelhafidh and bachta 2016 concluded that the average summer demand for groundwater in tunisia is about 250 higher than the winter demand however the demand price for both seasons is the same as the average price is 0 11 t d m 3 they indicated that raising the price 11 15 in winter and 50 75 in summer would result in an 11 reduction in annual consumption and a 2 increase in social surplus banovec and domadenik 2016 found that the actual price of water covering fixed and variable costs is 17 m3 variable costs increase and the price reaches 23 7 cents if the environmental costs are covered while the latest cross border water service price from slovenia to italy was set at 0 25 cents per cubic meter of water well below the actual water price shahroudi 2014 calculated the actual water price for rice and citrus products of mazandaran province from surface and underground sources in the three basins of shahid rajai dam at sari zamzam dam at ghaemshahr and alborz dam at babol as 2540 2421 and 2511 rials respectively and as 2417 rials for underground resources of rice and 3825 rials for citrus cultivations in addition they found that the actual price of water is higher than that of the current consumer price and that price for underground sources is higher than that of the surface water rahmani and ansari 2013 determined the average water price in mashhad plain while calculating the compensation cost based on the actual price of surface projects and artificial recharge and estimated the water price to be 2627 and 99773 rials m3 at 15 simple interest and 30 inflation rates nahman and lange 2012 found that the value of industrial water for south african industries is calculated at a total of 369 south african rands per kilometer in addition the estimated value of water is higher than that of the water tariff in south africa therefore there is a range for raising water prices for industrial water consumers ahmadpour and sabouhi 2009 obtained the actual price of groundwater per cubic meter for farmers in the dashtestan region as 85 rials huang et al 2006 revealed the huge gap between water value and water cost for many areas the simulation results indicated that raising water prices will have a negative impact on crop production and crop revenue indicating that complementary policies should be used to compensate farmers the results of the studies indicated that the tariffs paid by consumers do not cover the actual price of water and the gap between these figures is huge therefore most suggestions emphasize increasing water tariffs to cover the actual cost of water one of the indirect ways to reform water tariffs based on the cost of groundwater extraction is to change the price of electricity in developing countries energy subsidies are significant totaling over 220 billion in 2005 for the largest 20 non oecd countries nearly half of these subsidies are directed at rural households primarily as electricity subsidies the rationale is that agricultural electricity subsidies stimulate agricultural production through enhanced groundwater irrigation benefitting poor rural households and stabilizing food prices badiani magnusson and jessoe 2019 subsidies on power for pumping groundwater are thought to play a central role in the indian groundwater crisis ram et al 2016 prolonged droughts and depleted groundwater resources have been a serious challenge to the economy of the balochistan province pakistan proliferation of tube wells incentivized by government policy interventions and continued subsidies for electric tube wells for agriculture and choice for high water consumption crops have led to a steep decline in water tables rizwan et al 2021 energy is an important input needed to extract groundwater for irrigation in the high plains aquifer pfeiffer and lin 2014 the importance of energy subsidies in groundwater extraction has also been considered in other studies dumler et al 2009 estimated that the energy cost of extracting irrigation water represents approximately 10 of the costs for growing corn in western kansas which is a slightly greater share of costs than land rent badiani and katrina 2013 empirically analyzed the impact of electricity subsidies on groundwater extraction and agricultural production in india other studies have used interviews or survey data to analyze the relationship between energy and groundwater extraction in india and or mexico birner et al 2007 fan et al 2008 kumar 2005 scott and shah 2004 because of the importance of water pricing and the role of water cost calculations a large number of studies have considered surface and groundwater resources separately seyedan and ghadami firouzabadi 2018 investigated the pricing of groundwater resources at hameda plain and calculated the average cost of water as 650 rials and the value of final production of water as 2040 rials the value of the marginal production of water was more than that of the cost per cubic meter of water furthermore they found that farmers paid a far less amount than the value of its marginal production thus the purpose of this study is determining the actual cost of water from groundwater resources wells of kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province for agricultural drinking and industrial consumption separately using engineering economics and accounting approaches another purpose of this study is to investigate the liberalization of agricultural electricity subsidy prices and the effect that will have on the cost of water in the pricing system the innovation in the current study is that water tariff will change by reforming the price of electricity and changing its subsidies and this indirect influence can reduce social impacts and political resistance in the continuation of the article first the scope of studies is introduced then how to calculate the cost of water with engineering economics and accounting methods was explained finally the results of the two methods have been calculated and compared separately for water resources allocated to agriculture drinking and industry 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province in western iran despite the high long term average rainfall this province often faces water shortages the average annual rainfall and the total volume of rainfall in kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province during the last 5 years has decreased by about 22 compared to long term figures and the air temperature has increased by about 1 table 1 the groundwater level of the province in the water year 2017 18 decreased by 14 3 million cubic meters this figure for the long term annual average was 0 47 therefore based on its water resources and uses the province is facing a severe water imbalance that will worsen due to drought over time and needs to rely on various tools including economic policies to help manage its water resources kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province is located in 4 s degree catchments of karun hendijan jarahi maharloo bakhtegan and east and west helleh it has seven major river branches named bashar kabkian and marbar the main branch of karun river marun the main branch of jarahi river khairabad and zohreh branches of hindijan and sameh rivers in addition it has two operational dams and five hydroelectric power plants producing 16 8 mw according to the report of the regional water company of the province by the end of 2018 there were 4536 wells in the province of which 3398 were authorized and 1134 were unauthorized wells the number of unauthorized wells identified since 2007 is 1 005 which shows a sharp upward trend table 2 displays the status of drainage and harvesting of the province s underground resources by wells springs and aqueducts and the total harvest in the province in 1977 as shown 204 06 million m3 were harvested out of 2575 wells and 905 56 million m3 were harvested out of the 6287 underground sources in the province including wells springs and aqueducts the greatest consumption is related to the agriculture sector which is about 100 million m3 drinking water and industry consumption accounts for about 3 million m3 of water from wells the excessive consumption of well water and the low efficiency of the agricultural sector estimated at around 30 are considered the most important causes of the province s groundwater level decline center for presidential strategic studies 2016 fig 1 shows the study area studied in this study 2 2 methods cost benefit analysis cba is a decision making tool for obtaining the economic and or social profitability of a public investment policy or initiative by means of a comparison among costs and benefits resulting from proposed measures rupérez moreno et al 2017 based on the cost benefit structure and recognizing the different cost components the cost of extracting water from piped wells for different uses for kohkiluyeh and boyer ahmad province in iran was calculated in this study the actual cost of water was calculated from two general accounting and engineering economics approaches the most important difference between the two approaches is the temporal value of money which is not considered in the accounting approach the average cost method is used to evaluate the actual cost of water extracted from underground resources lund et al 2006 and the handbook for the economic analysis of water supply projects 2002 for this purpose a sample well was selected based on the technical information related to the wells through averaging then the equivalent annual investment and extraction costs for the selected well e g drilling costs costs of equipping and dismantling the plant drilling wells pipe preparation and installation field testing and operations and stipendiary works costs of the well fixtures and installations pump and electromotor power panel cable wellhead branch and other miscellaneous costs repair and maintenance costs and annual electricity costs were estimated separately by different uses and then divided into the amount of water annually extracted from the well to obtain the cost per cubic meter of water for each consumption separately by fixed and variable costs as well as the actual total cost in rials 2 2 1 engineering economics method engineering economics are calculated at a discount rate of 8 calculating the discount rate has many complexities and requires a separate study but not many studies have explored calculating the discount rate in iran among the most important available studies are shirdel et al 2017 abdoli 2009 and daneshmand et al 2018 which calculated the discount rate for iran at 5 12 7 2 and 5 80 respectively in these studies the social discount rate was calculated at the level of the whole community not the water sector therefore the only study on the economic feasibility of water projects is presidential instruction no 258 which states that the discount rate for water projects is 8 12 and this reference is used in the present study instructions for economic studies of water resources development projects 2012 these items are also calculated by considering various electricity tariffs such as agricultural public and industry electricity sensitivity analysis and the actual cost of water consumed from underground resources separately by different consumptions extracting groundwater includes the costs of drilling and equipping wells operation and maintenance costs of wells and consumed electricity costs well drilling involves operations such as drilling piping gravel packing developing experimental pumping etc and has a life span of 20 years therefore the costs of this activity have a capital nature the equivalent cost of this operation is shown as h 1 well equipping activities include installing chamber operations as well as preparing and installing electrical and mechanical equipment and measuring devices the cost of these operations is shown by h 2 and has a capital nature with a life span of 10 years the total of these operations is the cost of drilling activities and well equipping as mentioned all components of these costs can be considered as capital and their annual equivalent should be calculated in the total annual groundwater extraction costs the repair and maintenance activities of well installations are repeated annually and the related costs i e current h 3 are calculated in addition the cost of consumed electricity h 4 which is part of the operation and maintenance costs is repeated annually as the annual equivalent of the costs of drilling and equipping wells well operation and maintenance and consumed electricity are aggregated the annual costs of groundwater extraction are calculated from the following equation 1 h h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 i 1 i t 1 i t 1 considering this equation the equivalent annual total costs related to groundwater extraction activities is equal to h rials if the investment process for drilling and equipping activities takes more than one year and generally t years the present value of the costs of drilling and equipping wells and operating and maintaining electricity consumption in the base year can be calculated from the following equations 2 p k 1 t h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 1 1 i t 3 a p i 1 i t 1 i t 1 thus 4 h 3 0 025 h 1 h 2 5 h 4 d h t t where t represents the year i shows the discount rate p is the total investment a indicates the annual depreciation expense d is considered as the number of annual operation days h t is the number of annual operation hours and t is regarded as the electricity tariff for different levels of consumption as mentioned above h 3 is the well repair and maintenance costs considered to be equivalent to 2 5 of the total cost of drilling installations and equipment based on the standards iran water and power development company 2017 rupérez moreno et al 2017 the average production is calculated based on the extraction costs by dividing the equivalent annual cost obtained by equation 3 into the volume of water consumed per year 6 a c a w v where a c represents the average cost of groundwater extraction and w v is the total annual water discharge volume 2 2 2 accounting method in this approach the total annual investment and the operation and maintenance costs are divided into the annual discharge volume of water and the average actual cost of consumed water is calculated in this approach the computational model of the cost of the extracted water from the wells is as follows 7 a c a h m v where ac is the average cost of water a is the annual depreciation of fixed costs obtained from equation 8 and v is the annual discharge volume of water 8 a h 1 h 2 l where h 1 is drilling costs h 2 is the installations and equipment costs and l is the well s service life also h m is the annual operation and maintenance costs obtained from the total operation and maintenance costs h 3 and the cost of consumed electricity h 4 in eq 9 9 h m h 3 h 4 2 2 3 simulated scenarios well drilling permits in iran classify wells into three categories shallow 0 100 m semi deep 100 200 m and deep more than 200 m therefore based on the available data three scenarios are considered separately for well depth the cost of water extraction from the well in each of these scenarios is calculated and compared with both engineering economics and accounting methods electricity cost discharge volume and well depth are parameters that affect the cost therefore in these scenarios the effect of these cases as well as the type of methodology on the cost of well water is investigated the flowchart for calculating the cost is provided below fig 2 2 2 4 data data comprised the number of wells annual water discharge rate and water use for agricultural drinking and industrial sectors the technical information on wells in the province such as depth of wells discharge of wells and some technical characteristics such as pump and electromotor type diameter of wellbore electromotor power etc was obtained from information recorded in the census of wells by the iran water resources management company in 2019 furthermore investment and extraction costs such as drilling well installation and maintenance and repair and maintenance costs were extracted from the list of prices of the base unit for well string published by the president deputy of strategic planning and control and the annual electricity costs from the ministry of energy website 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of engineering economics method as shown in table 3 estimating the actual cost of one cubic meter of water consumed for agricultural use with the engineering economics method and a discount rate of 8 indicated that the equivalent annual costs at depths of 0 100 200 100 and 300 300 m are 341 435 and 615 million rials respectively in addition the actual cost of one cubic meter of water is 3775 2274 and 1058 rials respectively of which 40 42 and 44 respectively are related to the costs of operating and maintaining the well and the rest are fixed investment costs drilling installations and equipment another important point is that the actual cost of water was found to be less than that of the expected amount despite increasing costs as well depth increases because of the increased annual volume of water discharge see table 4 fig 3 displays the actual fixed and variable costs at different depths for agricultural consumption the highest costs are related to investment costs at 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 depths respectively which is the same for the operation and maintenance costs therefore the actual cost of water decreases when water depth increases the sensitivity analysis of the public and industrial electricity tariff rates and their effects on agricultural consumption indicated that changes in the electricity tariff rate lead to changes in operation maintenance costs variable costs and equivalent annual costs and consequently the actual cost of operation maintenance and the total actual cost of one cubic meter of water however fixed costs such as drilling equipment and installation costs do not change the actual cost of water with agricultural electricity tariffs was estimated to be 3775 2274 and 1058 rials for depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m respectively with industrial electricity tariffs these costs were 4129 2689 and 1325 rials and with public electricity tariffs they were 4794 3466 and 1825 rials respectively the actual cost of water has a direct relationship with the electricity tariff rate and an inverse relationship with well depth it should be noted that the cost of electricity is part of the annual variable costs and increases in it lead to increases in the annual equivalent of costs as well as the cost per cubic meter of water however as the depth of the well increases the amount of discharge increases and as the denominator of the fraction increases the cost per unit of water decreases the results of table 3 indicated that the equivalent annual costs at depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 were 768 1 627 and 1 892 million rials respectively the actual cost of one cubic meter of water is 3146 2389 and 2514 rials respectively of which 71 81 and 81 is related to operation and maintenance costs of the well and the rest are fixed investment costs such as drilling installations and equipment it is also worth noting that the annual volume of water discharge is considerably higher for drinking water than that of agricultural and industrial wells the operation and maintenance costs for drinking water use are higher than those of investment costs fig 4 displays the actual fixed and variable costs at different depths of drinking water use most costs are related to the depth of 0 100 and the operation and maintenance costs the results shown in table 5 and fig 4 indicate that the equivalent annual costs for wells with industrial consumption at depths of 0 100 and 100 200 m are 376 and 524 million rials respectively the actual cost of one cubic meter of water is estimated to be 7191 and 3807 rials respectively of which 46 and 51 are associated with operation and maintenance costs of the well respectively while the rest are investment costs drilling installations and equipment based on the available data the greatest depth of industry consumption wells is 200 m thus no calculation or analysis was performed for the depth of 200 300 m fig 5 displays the actual fixed and variable costs at different depths of wells for industry consumption most of the costs are related to the depth of 0 100 m and operation and maintenance costs 3 2 results of accounting approach method as shown in table 6 with the accounting approach the total cost of one cubic meter of water for agricultural consumption was calculated at 2042 1245 and 574 rials for depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m respectively of which 36 38 and 40 account for operation and maintenance costs and 64 62 and 60 are related to investment costs respectively a change in the electricity tariff will lead to changes in operation and maintenance costs variable costs equivalent annual costs and consequently the actual cost of operation and maintenance and the actual total cost of one cubic meter of water therefore in addition to analyzing sensitivity to industrial and general electricity tariffs the results indicated that the actual cost of one cubic meter of water with industrial electricity tariffs for depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m is 2396 1659 and 840 rials and with public electricity tariffs 3061 2437 and 1340 rials respectively the actual cost of water has a direct relationship with the electricity tariff rate and an inverse relationship with well depth in fact an increase in costs leads to a decrease in electricity tariffs however costs decrease when well depth increases based on the results in table 7 the total actual cost of one cubic meter of water at depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m is 2426 2998 and 2112 rials respectively of which 78 87 and 87 is related to operation and maintenance costs and 22 13 and 13 are related to investment costs respectively as shown in table 8 the total actual cost of one cubic meter of water at depths of 0 100 and 100 200 m is 4171 and 2339 rials respectively of which 45 and 35 are related to operation and maintenance costs and 55 and 47 are related to investment costs respectively 4 discussion the prices obtained for one cubic meter of water are lower than those obtained in the engineering economics method because the temporal value of money does not consider the accounting method and the incurred costs rely solely on the construction time fig 6 displays the weighted mean of costs separately by different consumptions using both the engineering and accounting economic approaches to make it possible to compare the results of this study with other studies in the world the results of calculations in us dollars are presented in table 9 as shown the mean cost of water for agriculture drinking and industry consumption as calculated using the accounting approach is respectively 54 83 and 52 of the actual cost per cubic meter of water as calculated using the engineering economic approach therefore choosing a computational method in which there is no expert consensus in iran impacts the results and pricing of groundwater however this distinction differs as related to various consumptions and the least difference is related to drinking water due to the actual costs of electrical energy the literature on the application of full cost accounting to water utilities is very limited there is a gap in the literature and practice on the full cost per unit of sanitation services such as drinking water wastewater and sewage treatment and municipal solid waste management louis and siriwadana 2002 according to studies conducted louis and siriwadana 2002 renzetti and kushner 2004 and fortin et al 2001 the accounting method for calculating the cost of water has many shortcomings compared to the economic method first the price paid for an input may not reflect its opportunity cost to society for example some inputs purchased by water and sewage utilities may also be valued incorrectly from a social point of view for example utilities purchase electricity and natural gas to power their pumps a substantial body of evidence demonstrates that the prices of electricity and natural gas do not reflect their social marginal costs the reasons for this mirror the reasons for incorrect cost accounting by water and sewage utilities renzetti and kushner 2004 second occurs when a firm has access to an input for free for example sewage treatment plants may dispose of certain substances into lakes and rivers without cost to themselves in each of these cases the market price of the input does not accurately reflect the cost of its use to society third there may be accounting guidelines set out in government regulations which dictate the way in which costs are recorded for example utilities may be prevented from assigning a competitive rate of return as part of the opportunity cost of its capital goods forth a water utility may receive subsidies from other agencies these could include direct subsidies such as capital grants from senior levels of government or indirect subsidies as might occur if a municipal water utility were to receive services from the city s legal department without charge all external costs such as environmental damages and the opportunity cost of raw water supplies must be included this is the position reflected in the european union s water framework directive cf the discussion in chave 2002 so although the cost of water in the accounting method is much lower than in the engineering economics method and may be better accepted by the owners of tubular wells in terms of pricing as mentioned it has many shortcomings that in the long run it will reduce the welfare of society and future generations therefore in the first stage choosing the right method to calculate the cost of water is very important secondly addressing energy prices is important in calculating the cost of water because it can indirectly help manage groundwater extraction by creating less sensitivities in other words as strand 2010 emphasized when a groundwater basin is exploited by a large number of farmers acting independently each farmer has little incentive to practice conservation that would primarily benefit other farmers this can lead to excessive groundwater extraction when farmers pay less than the full cost of electricity used for groundwater pumping this problem can be worsened while the problem can be somewhat relieved by rationing the electricity supply few studies have been performed to calculate the cost of groundwater extraction table 10 compares the results of some of them based on the results shown in table 10 the cost of water extraction in the present study is reasonable and comparable with other areas of course it is necessary to consider the fact that well depth discharge rate and operating hours affect the results and can be the reason for the slight difference between the computational numbers in different studies it is worth noting that agricultural consumption accounts for about 90 of water use in iran and generously subsidizing electrical energy for the agricultural sector has resulted in a switch to using electrical motors for almost all agricultural water wells instead of diesel engines furthermore the amount of water extracted for the agricultural sector is more than enough such that currently there is an annual negative groundwater balance in iran of approximately 6 billion m3 according to the tariffs announced by the ministry of energy of iran the price per kilowatt hour of electricity for agricultural consumption in the year of this study was 123 rials and for public use it was 1832 rials about 14 times greater experts and managers have always been questioned on how this important issue can be achieved taking the political and social resistance to reform into consideration and directly increasing the price of underground water for consumption in answer to this question the results of this study indicated that the actual cost per cubic meter of irrigation water for agricultural consumption at depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m were estimated as 3775 2274 and 1058 rials respectively however the prices related to the public electricity tariff were 4794 3466 and 1825 rials in other words reforming the electricity tariff for the aforementioned depths would increase the price of water by 27 52 and 72 and on average weight with discharge volume 63 respectively according to qureshi et al 2003 energy pricing policies play an important role in controlling over exploitation of groundwater government should formulate a pricing policy which help farmers pump groundwater to meet the water demand for their crops but can restrict unnecessary exploitation of groundwater tahamipour zarandi et al 2006 indicated that the price elasticity of water demand for groundwater in the agriculture sector ranges from 0 24 to 0 43 average 0 34 therefore a 63 increase in water prices for agricultural consumption through reforming energy prices can reduce water use from 9 to 25 average 21 one study reported this percentage to be 63 pfeiffer and lin 2014 there are thus several contextual nuances to the utility of metered tariffs for effecting groundwater conservation the argument that increasing the price of metered power is an effective tool to control groundwater use breaks down when power prices are stretched beyond a certain point saleth 1997 for instance when tariffs metered at that time were raised in the state of uttar pradesh in 1975 many farmers replaced their electric motors with diesel engines later as the cost of power came down with the introduction of flat tariffs in 1982 most farmers switched back to electric motors to summarize the effect of metered tariffs on farmer behavior is dependent on multiple factors like the prevalence of water markets and power subsidies overall utility of groundwater to the farmer and other options available to the farmer for accessing the aquifers sidhu et al 2020 although the results of pfeiffer and lin 2014 show that energy prices have an important effect on both the intensive and extensive margin increasing energy prices would affect crop selection decisions crop acreage allocation decisions and the demand for water by farmers they indicated that an increase in the natural gas futures contract price of 1 cent 1000 btu would decrease water extraction by an individual framer by 102 88 acre feet per year which is approximately 63 of the average amount pumped in a year by a farmer but badiani magnusson and jessoe 2019 show that subsidy induced increases in groundwater extraction led to an increase in the value of water intensive agricultural production and the area on which these crops are grown for this reason it should be noted that energy price reform especially in the case of agricultural consumption cannot happen easily and is accompanied by a lot of resistance because the agricultural sector mainly aims to increase production not to reduce water extraction 5 conclusion according to asaadi et al 2019 excessive groundwater extraction for intense agricultural activity has created a water scarce irrigation district in the west of iran which has faced a serious water crisis during the last decade in addition the findings underscore that in a situation where the price of irrigation water is low due to the low elasticity of water demand in the agriculture sector formulating economic instruments such as rising water prices does not solely suffice to achieve sustainable water resource management however mixed scenarios emphasize that water distribution policies should be aligned with increases in water costs therefore in addition to adjusting water prices it is necessary to consider reforming energy subsidies the most important policy recommendation of the present study emphasizes the accurate calculation of the cost of groundwater resources for reforming water pricing for different uses attention must also be given to the significant differences that can exist between computational methods based on previous experience increasing water prices can lead to reduced extraction and better management of groundwater resources for which there are two policy paths first direct increase in water prices and second increase in energy prices reduction of energy price subsidies the present study proposes the second option be used which will be associated with less social and political consequences and resistance the energy pricing policies have shown to play an important role in controlling over exploitation of groundwater therefore government should formulate a pricing policy which help farmers to pump groundwater to meet the water demand for their crops but can restrict un necessary exploitation of groundwater sidhu et al 2020 believe that improved power tariffs have the potential to help countries to attain multiple sustainable development goals both directly through water and electricity conservation and indirectly through fiscal savings for other social development programs of course the first proposal namely the reform of groundwater prices can also be effective in situations where the tariff is determined based on the volume of water consumed in order to make metered tariff implementation viable the metering and collection agencies must have the authority to deal with the deviant behavior of the tubewell owners and must have proper incentives to enforce metered tariff flat tariff does not suite small land holders they prefer metered tariff without any attached fixed cost because they will only pay on need basis irrigation in this regard shah et al 2017 and 2018 proposed combination of flat and metered tariff strategy for water rich states like west bengal where increasing groundwater use has been recommended as a viable option for supporting marginal farmers the proportions of the flat and metered rates can be tweaked to encourage competitive rates for water buyers through the flat component while simultaneously discouraging excessive exploitation of groundwater resources by adjusting the metered component therefore government might need to prepare pricing packages separately for small and large land holders to safeguard the interests of whole farming community to safeguard the interests of whole farming community furthermore as reported by aidam 2015 improving the technology of agricultural irrigation systems results in improving water efficiency and savings as well as incurring fewer costs for the farmers and increasing their income therefore it is suggested that the price of electrical energy for agricultural wells be gradually reformed to achieve the actual price of water in addition some discounts should be considered for farmers who develop irrigation systems on their farms and support the people who reform the technology of water use through other supportive policies such as subsidies and higher premiums declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11823,in managing groundwater demand pricing system reform plays an important role however changing water price faces political and social resistance for optimal pricing it is necessary to calculate accurately the cost of water from wells the present study aimed to calculate the actual cost of water from underground resources for various uses and study the impact of electricity price subsidies liberalization on it in addition the impact of choosing engineering economics and accounting methodologies on actual cost outcomes was examined this study was conducted in kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province iran in 2019 with data obtained from information on the annual budgets of provincial water companies the results indicated that the actual cost of water for agricultural drinking and industrial uses was 1613 2555 and 4739 rials m3 respectively calculated with engineering economics methods and 877 2111 and 2848 rials m3 respectively calculated with accounting methodologies furthermore costs were found to be far different from the current tariffs received for water liberalizing electricity price subsidies for agricultural uses and their calculation based on public electricity tariffs increased actual water costs by 63 and could reduce water use by about 21 therefore it is suggested that a policy of gradually reducing electricity subsidies along with price discrimination among various uses be considered in order to provide consumers with an opportunity to reform and update water use technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords water actual cost of water engineering economics accounting electricity subsidy iran 1 introduction a glance at the world s water resources and water supply methods and comparing them with past practices indicate that some changes have been made toward constraining water resources decreasing water resources increasing populations and the development of industrial and agricultural activities has led to a reduction in the quantity and quality of water thus there has been a fierce competition for this scarce resource for many years resulting in violence and even military action globally groundwater makes up about 96 of the non frozen freshwater that is accessible for human consumption it contributes from 60 to 100 of the water supplied to arid and semi arid regions of the world groundwater has been the backbone of socio economic development in both urban and rural areas in africa asia and latin america and developing countries account for 71 of the global abstraction of groundwater rajeevan and kumarmishra 2020 in a study titled the water crisis and the feasibility of connecting north south water zones conducted in 2017 the falkenmark index showed that iran in 2016 was in a water stress phase with 1450 m3 renewable water per capita according to this index the water stress phase is when the annual water supply per capita is 1700 m3 and an annual water supply per capita of 1000 m3 is considered a water shortage in addition according to the united nations commission on sustainable development s benchmark for determining the water crisis index based on the harvesting percentage of each country s renewable water resources the middle east and iran are facing a severe water crisis with coefficients of 55 and 72 3 respectively cdfr ibpo 2017 iran is located in arid and semi arid regions of the earth the country s groundwater resources are currently in critical condition due to overexploitation and recent droughts the decline in groundwater aquifer levels has led to serious restrictions in more than 404 of 609 plains and to a cumulative storage deficit in groundwater resources of around 130 billion cubic meters recent droughts have reduced the average long term rainfall from 254 mm to about 240 mm per year equivalent to one third of the global average and less than half of the continental rainfall in asia samani 2021 therefore it is necessary to address the management of exploitation of underground aquifers especially by using economic tools in this regard salem et al 2018 concluded that the impact of climate change induced fluctuations in groundwater levels is much less on crop production costs than other costs but it may be significant in locations where groundwater levels are declining fast the concept of water as an economic commodity came up during preparatory meetings for the earth summit in rio de janeiro of 1992 considering water as such concerns making informed choices about its use conservation and allocation water having a price will give a clear signal to users that it is indeed a scarce good that should be used sparingly der and savenije 2006 estimating the actual cost of water and determining the appropriate water pricing system are clearly emphasized in high level documents from a global perspective one of these documents is article a clause 3 of the targeted subsidies law in iran which emphasizes the pricing of water for different uses depending on the quality and production process which is equivalent to the actual cost of water according to article 33 of the iranian fair water distribution act the ministry of energy is obliged to determine the price of water for urban agricultural industrial and other uses depending on its consumption for each use and receiving it after approval by the economic council in addition based on articles 4 and 6 of the long term development strategies of iran s water resources article c clause 17 of the fourth economic and social development plan of the country and article 59 of this law calculating the economic value of water is considered one of the tasks of the water sector during the program and calculating the actual cost is the inevitable first step toward balancing the economic value and full cost of water ataie et al 2016 this issue is also emphasized in the world food and agriculture organization fao the world bank s policies and the world conference on environment and development s document 1992 center for presidential strategic studies 2016 based on global experience economic foundations and upstream legal documents one of the best tools for managing water demand and helping to eliminate resource and consumption imbalances is an efficient pricing system najafi alamdarloo et al 2013 found that raising water prices leads to a reduction in groundwater extraction and improving water balance portoghese et al 2021 believe that water pricing has been identified as a generally valid water supply policy to help solve problems of water scarcity and competition to achieve such a system the price of the supply side and that of the demand side must be determined to aid achieving this goal in iran the current study has calculated the cost of water for different uses and with different computational methods to prepare supporting documents for the reformation of the water pricing system many studies have been conducted on water pricing and the impact of such a policy on water resource management tahamipour zarandi 2017 evaluated the economic value of water for basic chemical industries other than fertilizers and nitrogen compounds 2411 and found that allocating each cubic meter of water to such industrial activities creates a value equivalent to 37071 rials which is far from the cost of purchasing each cubic meter of water in this industrial code about 5685 rials therefore water tariffs can be raised as a policy of price discrimination between industrial codes along with water demand management ren et al 2018 calculated the price of agricultural irrigation water extracted from surface and groundwater sources on both the small and large scale as well as the cost effective cost for the three main crops of corn rice and soybeans for farmers in the heilongjiang region of china their results indicated that the price of large scale agricultural irrigation water is 1 023 yuan per cubic meter which shows that the current price of agricultural irrigation water does not reflect the value of water resources groundwater prices for corn rice and soybeans range from 0 317 to 0 507 from 0 131 to 0 210 and from 0 211 to 0 337 yuan per cubic meter respectively asadi et al 2016 estimated the actual cost per cubic meter of agricultural wells in gorgan city for irrigation water at interest rates of 10 15 and 20 was 1270 1540 and 1820 rials respectively they suggested that any water pricing policy should be accompanied by policies to improve the irrigation system and supply subsidies to farmers for developing their farm irrigation systems ataie et al 2016 found that the average actual cost per cubic meter of surface and underground water resources in fars province is 860 and 544 rials respectively while each cubic meter of water for the agricultural production in fars province leads to a maximum 350 rials net benefit watto and mugera 2016 reported that farmers extract more groundwater than needed for cultivated crops and allocate land to different crops based on their profitability rather than their water needs abdelhafidh and bachta 2016 concluded that the average summer demand for groundwater in tunisia is about 250 higher than the winter demand however the demand price for both seasons is the same as the average price is 0 11 t d m 3 they indicated that raising the price 11 15 in winter and 50 75 in summer would result in an 11 reduction in annual consumption and a 2 increase in social surplus banovec and domadenik 2016 found that the actual price of water covering fixed and variable costs is 17 m3 variable costs increase and the price reaches 23 7 cents if the environmental costs are covered while the latest cross border water service price from slovenia to italy was set at 0 25 cents per cubic meter of water well below the actual water price shahroudi 2014 calculated the actual water price for rice and citrus products of mazandaran province from surface and underground sources in the three basins of shahid rajai dam at sari zamzam dam at ghaemshahr and alborz dam at babol as 2540 2421 and 2511 rials respectively and as 2417 rials for underground resources of rice and 3825 rials for citrus cultivations in addition they found that the actual price of water is higher than that of the current consumer price and that price for underground sources is higher than that of the surface water rahmani and ansari 2013 determined the average water price in mashhad plain while calculating the compensation cost based on the actual price of surface projects and artificial recharge and estimated the water price to be 2627 and 99773 rials m3 at 15 simple interest and 30 inflation rates nahman and lange 2012 found that the value of industrial water for south african industries is calculated at a total of 369 south african rands per kilometer in addition the estimated value of water is higher than that of the water tariff in south africa therefore there is a range for raising water prices for industrial water consumers ahmadpour and sabouhi 2009 obtained the actual price of groundwater per cubic meter for farmers in the dashtestan region as 85 rials huang et al 2006 revealed the huge gap between water value and water cost for many areas the simulation results indicated that raising water prices will have a negative impact on crop production and crop revenue indicating that complementary policies should be used to compensate farmers the results of the studies indicated that the tariffs paid by consumers do not cover the actual price of water and the gap between these figures is huge therefore most suggestions emphasize increasing water tariffs to cover the actual cost of water one of the indirect ways to reform water tariffs based on the cost of groundwater extraction is to change the price of electricity in developing countries energy subsidies are significant totaling over 220 billion in 2005 for the largest 20 non oecd countries nearly half of these subsidies are directed at rural households primarily as electricity subsidies the rationale is that agricultural electricity subsidies stimulate agricultural production through enhanced groundwater irrigation benefitting poor rural households and stabilizing food prices badiani magnusson and jessoe 2019 subsidies on power for pumping groundwater are thought to play a central role in the indian groundwater crisis ram et al 2016 prolonged droughts and depleted groundwater resources have been a serious challenge to the economy of the balochistan province pakistan proliferation of tube wells incentivized by government policy interventions and continued subsidies for electric tube wells for agriculture and choice for high water consumption crops have led to a steep decline in water tables rizwan et al 2021 energy is an important input needed to extract groundwater for irrigation in the high plains aquifer pfeiffer and lin 2014 the importance of energy subsidies in groundwater extraction has also been considered in other studies dumler et al 2009 estimated that the energy cost of extracting irrigation water represents approximately 10 of the costs for growing corn in western kansas which is a slightly greater share of costs than land rent badiani and katrina 2013 empirically analyzed the impact of electricity subsidies on groundwater extraction and agricultural production in india other studies have used interviews or survey data to analyze the relationship between energy and groundwater extraction in india and or mexico birner et al 2007 fan et al 2008 kumar 2005 scott and shah 2004 because of the importance of water pricing and the role of water cost calculations a large number of studies have considered surface and groundwater resources separately seyedan and ghadami firouzabadi 2018 investigated the pricing of groundwater resources at hameda plain and calculated the average cost of water as 650 rials and the value of final production of water as 2040 rials the value of the marginal production of water was more than that of the cost per cubic meter of water furthermore they found that farmers paid a far less amount than the value of its marginal production thus the purpose of this study is determining the actual cost of water from groundwater resources wells of kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province for agricultural drinking and industrial consumption separately using engineering economics and accounting approaches another purpose of this study is to investigate the liberalization of agricultural electricity subsidy prices and the effect that will have on the cost of water in the pricing system the innovation in the current study is that water tariff will change by reforming the price of electricity and changing its subsidies and this indirect influence can reduce social impacts and political resistance in the continuation of the article first the scope of studies is introduced then how to calculate the cost of water with engineering economics and accounting methods was explained finally the results of the two methods have been calculated and compared separately for water resources allocated to agriculture drinking and industry 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province in western iran despite the high long term average rainfall this province often faces water shortages the average annual rainfall and the total volume of rainfall in kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province during the last 5 years has decreased by about 22 compared to long term figures and the air temperature has increased by about 1 table 1 the groundwater level of the province in the water year 2017 18 decreased by 14 3 million cubic meters this figure for the long term annual average was 0 47 therefore based on its water resources and uses the province is facing a severe water imbalance that will worsen due to drought over time and needs to rely on various tools including economic policies to help manage its water resources kohgiluyeh and boyer ahmad province is located in 4 s degree catchments of karun hendijan jarahi maharloo bakhtegan and east and west helleh it has seven major river branches named bashar kabkian and marbar the main branch of karun river marun the main branch of jarahi river khairabad and zohreh branches of hindijan and sameh rivers in addition it has two operational dams and five hydroelectric power plants producing 16 8 mw according to the report of the regional water company of the province by the end of 2018 there were 4536 wells in the province of which 3398 were authorized and 1134 were unauthorized wells the number of unauthorized wells identified since 2007 is 1 005 which shows a sharp upward trend table 2 displays the status of drainage and harvesting of the province s underground resources by wells springs and aqueducts and the total harvest in the province in 1977 as shown 204 06 million m3 were harvested out of 2575 wells and 905 56 million m3 were harvested out of the 6287 underground sources in the province including wells springs and aqueducts the greatest consumption is related to the agriculture sector which is about 100 million m3 drinking water and industry consumption accounts for about 3 million m3 of water from wells the excessive consumption of well water and the low efficiency of the agricultural sector estimated at around 30 are considered the most important causes of the province s groundwater level decline center for presidential strategic studies 2016 fig 1 shows the study area studied in this study 2 2 methods cost benefit analysis cba is a decision making tool for obtaining the economic and or social profitability of a public investment policy or initiative by means of a comparison among costs and benefits resulting from proposed measures rupérez moreno et al 2017 based on the cost benefit structure and recognizing the different cost components the cost of extracting water from piped wells for different uses for kohkiluyeh and boyer ahmad province in iran was calculated in this study the actual cost of water was calculated from two general accounting and engineering economics approaches the most important difference between the two approaches is the temporal value of money which is not considered in the accounting approach the average cost method is used to evaluate the actual cost of water extracted from underground resources lund et al 2006 and the handbook for the economic analysis of water supply projects 2002 for this purpose a sample well was selected based on the technical information related to the wells through averaging then the equivalent annual investment and extraction costs for the selected well e g drilling costs costs of equipping and dismantling the plant drilling wells pipe preparation and installation field testing and operations and stipendiary works costs of the well fixtures and installations pump and electromotor power panel cable wellhead branch and other miscellaneous costs repair and maintenance costs and annual electricity costs were estimated separately by different uses and then divided into the amount of water annually extracted from the well to obtain the cost per cubic meter of water for each consumption separately by fixed and variable costs as well as the actual total cost in rials 2 2 1 engineering economics method engineering economics are calculated at a discount rate of 8 calculating the discount rate has many complexities and requires a separate study but not many studies have explored calculating the discount rate in iran among the most important available studies are shirdel et al 2017 abdoli 2009 and daneshmand et al 2018 which calculated the discount rate for iran at 5 12 7 2 and 5 80 respectively in these studies the social discount rate was calculated at the level of the whole community not the water sector therefore the only study on the economic feasibility of water projects is presidential instruction no 258 which states that the discount rate for water projects is 8 12 and this reference is used in the present study instructions for economic studies of water resources development projects 2012 these items are also calculated by considering various electricity tariffs such as agricultural public and industry electricity sensitivity analysis and the actual cost of water consumed from underground resources separately by different consumptions extracting groundwater includes the costs of drilling and equipping wells operation and maintenance costs of wells and consumed electricity costs well drilling involves operations such as drilling piping gravel packing developing experimental pumping etc and has a life span of 20 years therefore the costs of this activity have a capital nature the equivalent cost of this operation is shown as h 1 well equipping activities include installing chamber operations as well as preparing and installing electrical and mechanical equipment and measuring devices the cost of these operations is shown by h 2 and has a capital nature with a life span of 10 years the total of these operations is the cost of drilling activities and well equipping as mentioned all components of these costs can be considered as capital and their annual equivalent should be calculated in the total annual groundwater extraction costs the repair and maintenance activities of well installations are repeated annually and the related costs i e current h 3 are calculated in addition the cost of consumed electricity h 4 which is part of the operation and maintenance costs is repeated annually as the annual equivalent of the costs of drilling and equipping wells well operation and maintenance and consumed electricity are aggregated the annual costs of groundwater extraction are calculated from the following equation 1 h h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 i 1 i t 1 i t 1 considering this equation the equivalent annual total costs related to groundwater extraction activities is equal to h rials if the investment process for drilling and equipping activities takes more than one year and generally t years the present value of the costs of drilling and equipping wells and operating and maintaining electricity consumption in the base year can be calculated from the following equations 2 p k 1 t h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 1 1 i t 3 a p i 1 i t 1 i t 1 thus 4 h 3 0 025 h 1 h 2 5 h 4 d h t t where t represents the year i shows the discount rate p is the total investment a indicates the annual depreciation expense d is considered as the number of annual operation days h t is the number of annual operation hours and t is regarded as the electricity tariff for different levels of consumption as mentioned above h 3 is the well repair and maintenance costs considered to be equivalent to 2 5 of the total cost of drilling installations and equipment based on the standards iran water and power development company 2017 rupérez moreno et al 2017 the average production is calculated based on the extraction costs by dividing the equivalent annual cost obtained by equation 3 into the volume of water consumed per year 6 a c a w v where a c represents the average cost of groundwater extraction and w v is the total annual water discharge volume 2 2 2 accounting method in this approach the total annual investment and the operation and maintenance costs are divided into the annual discharge volume of water and the average actual cost of consumed water is calculated in this approach the computational model of the cost of the extracted water from the wells is as follows 7 a c a h m v where ac is the average cost of water a is the annual depreciation of fixed costs obtained from equation 8 and v is the annual discharge volume of water 8 a h 1 h 2 l where h 1 is drilling costs h 2 is the installations and equipment costs and l is the well s service life also h m is the annual operation and maintenance costs obtained from the total operation and maintenance costs h 3 and the cost of consumed electricity h 4 in eq 9 9 h m h 3 h 4 2 2 3 simulated scenarios well drilling permits in iran classify wells into three categories shallow 0 100 m semi deep 100 200 m and deep more than 200 m therefore based on the available data three scenarios are considered separately for well depth the cost of water extraction from the well in each of these scenarios is calculated and compared with both engineering economics and accounting methods electricity cost discharge volume and well depth are parameters that affect the cost therefore in these scenarios the effect of these cases as well as the type of methodology on the cost of well water is investigated the flowchart for calculating the cost is provided below fig 2 2 2 4 data data comprised the number of wells annual water discharge rate and water use for agricultural drinking and industrial sectors the technical information on wells in the province such as depth of wells discharge of wells and some technical characteristics such as pump and electromotor type diameter of wellbore electromotor power etc was obtained from information recorded in the census of wells by the iran water resources management company in 2019 furthermore investment and extraction costs such as drilling well installation and maintenance and repair and maintenance costs were extracted from the list of prices of the base unit for well string published by the president deputy of strategic planning and control and the annual electricity costs from the ministry of energy website 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of engineering economics method as shown in table 3 estimating the actual cost of one cubic meter of water consumed for agricultural use with the engineering economics method and a discount rate of 8 indicated that the equivalent annual costs at depths of 0 100 200 100 and 300 300 m are 341 435 and 615 million rials respectively in addition the actual cost of one cubic meter of water is 3775 2274 and 1058 rials respectively of which 40 42 and 44 respectively are related to the costs of operating and maintaining the well and the rest are fixed investment costs drilling installations and equipment another important point is that the actual cost of water was found to be less than that of the expected amount despite increasing costs as well depth increases because of the increased annual volume of water discharge see table 4 fig 3 displays the actual fixed and variable costs at different depths for agricultural consumption the highest costs are related to investment costs at 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 depths respectively which is the same for the operation and maintenance costs therefore the actual cost of water decreases when water depth increases the sensitivity analysis of the public and industrial electricity tariff rates and their effects on agricultural consumption indicated that changes in the electricity tariff rate lead to changes in operation maintenance costs variable costs and equivalent annual costs and consequently the actual cost of operation maintenance and the total actual cost of one cubic meter of water however fixed costs such as drilling equipment and installation costs do not change the actual cost of water with agricultural electricity tariffs was estimated to be 3775 2274 and 1058 rials for depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m respectively with industrial electricity tariffs these costs were 4129 2689 and 1325 rials and with public electricity tariffs they were 4794 3466 and 1825 rials respectively the actual cost of water has a direct relationship with the electricity tariff rate and an inverse relationship with well depth it should be noted that the cost of electricity is part of the annual variable costs and increases in it lead to increases in the annual equivalent of costs as well as the cost per cubic meter of water however as the depth of the well increases the amount of discharge increases and as the denominator of the fraction increases the cost per unit of water decreases the results of table 3 indicated that the equivalent annual costs at depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 were 768 1 627 and 1 892 million rials respectively the actual cost of one cubic meter of water is 3146 2389 and 2514 rials respectively of which 71 81 and 81 is related to operation and maintenance costs of the well and the rest are fixed investment costs such as drilling installations and equipment it is also worth noting that the annual volume of water discharge is considerably higher for drinking water than that of agricultural and industrial wells the operation and maintenance costs for drinking water use are higher than those of investment costs fig 4 displays the actual fixed and variable costs at different depths of drinking water use most costs are related to the depth of 0 100 and the operation and maintenance costs the results shown in table 5 and fig 4 indicate that the equivalent annual costs for wells with industrial consumption at depths of 0 100 and 100 200 m are 376 and 524 million rials respectively the actual cost of one cubic meter of water is estimated to be 7191 and 3807 rials respectively of which 46 and 51 are associated with operation and maintenance costs of the well respectively while the rest are investment costs drilling installations and equipment based on the available data the greatest depth of industry consumption wells is 200 m thus no calculation or analysis was performed for the depth of 200 300 m fig 5 displays the actual fixed and variable costs at different depths of wells for industry consumption most of the costs are related to the depth of 0 100 m and operation and maintenance costs 3 2 results of accounting approach method as shown in table 6 with the accounting approach the total cost of one cubic meter of water for agricultural consumption was calculated at 2042 1245 and 574 rials for depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m respectively of which 36 38 and 40 account for operation and maintenance costs and 64 62 and 60 are related to investment costs respectively a change in the electricity tariff will lead to changes in operation and maintenance costs variable costs equivalent annual costs and consequently the actual cost of operation and maintenance and the actual total cost of one cubic meter of water therefore in addition to analyzing sensitivity to industrial and general electricity tariffs the results indicated that the actual cost of one cubic meter of water with industrial electricity tariffs for depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m is 2396 1659 and 840 rials and with public electricity tariffs 3061 2437 and 1340 rials respectively the actual cost of water has a direct relationship with the electricity tariff rate and an inverse relationship with well depth in fact an increase in costs leads to a decrease in electricity tariffs however costs decrease when well depth increases based on the results in table 7 the total actual cost of one cubic meter of water at depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m is 2426 2998 and 2112 rials respectively of which 78 87 and 87 is related to operation and maintenance costs and 22 13 and 13 are related to investment costs respectively as shown in table 8 the total actual cost of one cubic meter of water at depths of 0 100 and 100 200 m is 4171 and 2339 rials respectively of which 45 and 35 are related to operation and maintenance costs and 55 and 47 are related to investment costs respectively 4 discussion the prices obtained for one cubic meter of water are lower than those obtained in the engineering economics method because the temporal value of money does not consider the accounting method and the incurred costs rely solely on the construction time fig 6 displays the weighted mean of costs separately by different consumptions using both the engineering and accounting economic approaches to make it possible to compare the results of this study with other studies in the world the results of calculations in us dollars are presented in table 9 as shown the mean cost of water for agriculture drinking and industry consumption as calculated using the accounting approach is respectively 54 83 and 52 of the actual cost per cubic meter of water as calculated using the engineering economic approach therefore choosing a computational method in which there is no expert consensus in iran impacts the results and pricing of groundwater however this distinction differs as related to various consumptions and the least difference is related to drinking water due to the actual costs of electrical energy the literature on the application of full cost accounting to water utilities is very limited there is a gap in the literature and practice on the full cost per unit of sanitation services such as drinking water wastewater and sewage treatment and municipal solid waste management louis and siriwadana 2002 according to studies conducted louis and siriwadana 2002 renzetti and kushner 2004 and fortin et al 2001 the accounting method for calculating the cost of water has many shortcomings compared to the economic method first the price paid for an input may not reflect its opportunity cost to society for example some inputs purchased by water and sewage utilities may also be valued incorrectly from a social point of view for example utilities purchase electricity and natural gas to power their pumps a substantial body of evidence demonstrates that the prices of electricity and natural gas do not reflect their social marginal costs the reasons for this mirror the reasons for incorrect cost accounting by water and sewage utilities renzetti and kushner 2004 second occurs when a firm has access to an input for free for example sewage treatment plants may dispose of certain substances into lakes and rivers without cost to themselves in each of these cases the market price of the input does not accurately reflect the cost of its use to society third there may be accounting guidelines set out in government regulations which dictate the way in which costs are recorded for example utilities may be prevented from assigning a competitive rate of return as part of the opportunity cost of its capital goods forth a water utility may receive subsidies from other agencies these could include direct subsidies such as capital grants from senior levels of government or indirect subsidies as might occur if a municipal water utility were to receive services from the city s legal department without charge all external costs such as environmental damages and the opportunity cost of raw water supplies must be included this is the position reflected in the european union s water framework directive cf the discussion in chave 2002 so although the cost of water in the accounting method is much lower than in the engineering economics method and may be better accepted by the owners of tubular wells in terms of pricing as mentioned it has many shortcomings that in the long run it will reduce the welfare of society and future generations therefore in the first stage choosing the right method to calculate the cost of water is very important secondly addressing energy prices is important in calculating the cost of water because it can indirectly help manage groundwater extraction by creating less sensitivities in other words as strand 2010 emphasized when a groundwater basin is exploited by a large number of farmers acting independently each farmer has little incentive to practice conservation that would primarily benefit other farmers this can lead to excessive groundwater extraction when farmers pay less than the full cost of electricity used for groundwater pumping this problem can be worsened while the problem can be somewhat relieved by rationing the electricity supply few studies have been performed to calculate the cost of groundwater extraction table 10 compares the results of some of them based on the results shown in table 10 the cost of water extraction in the present study is reasonable and comparable with other areas of course it is necessary to consider the fact that well depth discharge rate and operating hours affect the results and can be the reason for the slight difference between the computational numbers in different studies it is worth noting that agricultural consumption accounts for about 90 of water use in iran and generously subsidizing electrical energy for the agricultural sector has resulted in a switch to using electrical motors for almost all agricultural water wells instead of diesel engines furthermore the amount of water extracted for the agricultural sector is more than enough such that currently there is an annual negative groundwater balance in iran of approximately 6 billion m3 according to the tariffs announced by the ministry of energy of iran the price per kilowatt hour of electricity for agricultural consumption in the year of this study was 123 rials and for public use it was 1832 rials about 14 times greater experts and managers have always been questioned on how this important issue can be achieved taking the political and social resistance to reform into consideration and directly increasing the price of underground water for consumption in answer to this question the results of this study indicated that the actual cost per cubic meter of irrigation water for agricultural consumption at depths of 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 m were estimated as 3775 2274 and 1058 rials respectively however the prices related to the public electricity tariff were 4794 3466 and 1825 rials in other words reforming the electricity tariff for the aforementioned depths would increase the price of water by 27 52 and 72 and on average weight with discharge volume 63 respectively according to qureshi et al 2003 energy pricing policies play an important role in controlling over exploitation of groundwater government should formulate a pricing policy which help farmers pump groundwater to meet the water demand for their crops but can restrict unnecessary exploitation of groundwater tahamipour zarandi et al 2006 indicated that the price elasticity of water demand for groundwater in the agriculture sector ranges from 0 24 to 0 43 average 0 34 therefore a 63 increase in water prices for agricultural consumption through reforming energy prices can reduce water use from 9 to 25 average 21 one study reported this percentage to be 63 pfeiffer and lin 2014 there are thus several contextual nuances to the utility of metered tariffs for effecting groundwater conservation the argument that increasing the price of metered power is an effective tool to control groundwater use breaks down when power prices are stretched beyond a certain point saleth 1997 for instance when tariffs metered at that time were raised in the state of uttar pradesh in 1975 many farmers replaced their electric motors with diesel engines later as the cost of power came down with the introduction of flat tariffs in 1982 most farmers switched back to electric motors to summarize the effect of metered tariffs on farmer behavior is dependent on multiple factors like the prevalence of water markets and power subsidies overall utility of groundwater to the farmer and other options available to the farmer for accessing the aquifers sidhu et al 2020 although the results of pfeiffer and lin 2014 show that energy prices have an important effect on both the intensive and extensive margin increasing energy prices would affect crop selection decisions crop acreage allocation decisions and the demand for water by farmers they indicated that an increase in the natural gas futures contract price of 1 cent 1000 btu would decrease water extraction by an individual framer by 102 88 acre feet per year which is approximately 63 of the average amount pumped in a year by a farmer but badiani magnusson and jessoe 2019 show that subsidy induced increases in groundwater extraction led to an increase in the value of water intensive agricultural production and the area on which these crops are grown for this reason it should be noted that energy price reform especially in the case of agricultural consumption cannot happen easily and is accompanied by a lot of resistance because the agricultural sector mainly aims to increase production not to reduce water extraction 5 conclusion according to asaadi et al 2019 excessive groundwater extraction for intense agricultural activity has created a water scarce irrigation district in the west of iran which has faced a serious water crisis during the last decade in addition the findings underscore that in a situation where the price of irrigation water is low due to the low elasticity of water demand in the agriculture sector formulating economic instruments such as rising water prices does not solely suffice to achieve sustainable water resource management however mixed scenarios emphasize that water distribution policies should be aligned with increases in water costs therefore in addition to adjusting water prices it is necessary to consider reforming energy subsidies the most important policy recommendation of the present study emphasizes the accurate calculation of the cost of groundwater resources for reforming water pricing for different uses attention must also be given to the significant differences that can exist between computational methods based on previous experience increasing water prices can lead to reduced extraction and better management of groundwater resources for which there are two policy paths first direct increase in water prices and second increase in energy prices reduction of energy price subsidies the present study proposes the second option be used which will be associated with less social and political consequences and resistance the energy pricing policies have shown to play an important role in controlling over exploitation of groundwater therefore government should formulate a pricing policy which help farmers to pump groundwater to meet the water demand for their crops but can restrict un necessary exploitation of groundwater sidhu et al 2020 believe that improved power tariffs have the potential to help countries to attain multiple sustainable development goals both directly through water and electricity conservation and indirectly through fiscal savings for other social development programs of course the first proposal namely the reform of groundwater prices can also be effective in situations where the tariff is determined based on the volume of water consumed in order to make metered tariff implementation viable the metering and collection agencies must have the authority to deal with the deviant behavior of the tubewell owners and must have proper incentives to enforce metered tariff flat tariff does not suite small land holders they prefer metered tariff without any attached fixed cost because they will only pay on need basis irrigation in this regard shah et al 2017 and 2018 proposed combination of flat and metered tariff strategy for water rich states like west bengal where increasing groundwater use has been recommended as a viable option for supporting marginal farmers the proportions of the flat and metered rates can be tweaked to encourage competitive rates for water buyers through the flat component while simultaneously discouraging excessive exploitation of groundwater resources by adjusting the metered component therefore government might need to prepare pricing packages separately for small and large land holders to safeguard the interests of whole farming community to safeguard the interests of whole farming community furthermore as reported by aidam 2015 improving the technology of agricultural irrigation systems results in improving water efficiency and savings as well as incurring fewer costs for the farmers and increasing their income therefore it is suggested that the price of electrical energy for agricultural wells be gradually reformed to achieve the actual price of water in addition some discounts should be considered for farmers who develop irrigation systems on their farms and support the people who reform the technology of water use through other supportive policies such as subsidies and higher premiums declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11824,groundwater accounts for 50 80 of all domestic water use and 45 50 of all irrigation in india with a projected 300 million people to be added to its urban population by 2050 cities will have a significant role on groundwater status in india therefore this study examined the long term trends in station level groundwater and the role of land use land cover change lulcc in mumbai city we utilized station level groundwater depth data for six stations and lulc from satellite images from 1991 to 2018 the results revealed significant increase in groundwater depths across different seasons particularly during the dry season steeper rates of decline were clustered around the northern interior of the city which have experienced the maximum increase in urban impervious surfaces some of the stations located in the southern part of mumbai experienced decreasing trends in groundwater depths during the wet season this can be attributed to the low elevation and proximity to the seawaters resulting in saltwater intrusion groundwater exploitation from deeper aquifers and guided engineered recharge to the top aquifers are the sustainable solutions the results are particularly relevant for large urban agglomerations in the global south experiencing similar rates of rapid urbanization and population increase graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater depletion land use land cover change lulcc mumbai urbanization 1 introduction groundwater resources account for 90 of the global accessible freshwater due to their wider distribution and ubiquity compared to surface water shiklomanov and rodda 2003 the dominance of groundwater as a source of freshwater is evident from the fact that it accounts for 50 80 of all domestic water use and 45 50 of all irrigation in india specifically the area under irrigation has nearly tripled between 1970 and 1999 in india briscoe 2005 kumar et al 2005 mall et al 2006 for instance the rate of population increase is particularly significant in the large urban areas in india the population has increased more than 8 times since the turn of the century the growth rate of urban population 3 1 is significantly higher than the national growth rate 2 of india one of the main reasons for this manifold increase in urban population is the rural urban migration in search of better economic opportunities urbanization related processes result in widespread land use land cover changes lulcc along with higher density of population some of the typical lulcc include the loss of vegetation manifold increase in percentage of impervious surfaces mainly consisting of urban built up structures and change of natural flow of storm water runoff directly to stream channels cao and sen roy 2020 all of these processes result in greater proportion of precipitation as surface runoff leading to lower infiltration and recharge this directly impacts the groundwater depletion and recharge rates in addition there is reduced lag time between precipitation and runoff resulting in lower groundwater recharge finally groundwater quality is degraded by effluent discharges shaw 1994 for instance analyses of district level groundwater samples collected in bangladesh indicated the sources of contamination from geogenic weathering and geochemical alteration of source rock sources followed by anthropogenic source agrogenic domestic sewage etc bhuiyan et al 2016 islam et al 2018 in major cities of india the population growth has been fastest in the peripheries which extend much beyond the official administrative boundaries of the cities therefore the rapid rate of urbanization in india has accelerated the over utilization and deterioration of the quality of groundwater in the densely populated urban areas groundwater is increasingly becoming the main source of water throughout the year to fulfill the daily needs of the urban population particularly during the dry summer months groundwater is also the main source of drinking water for the urban population it is estimated that out of a total population of 1 2 billion about 400 million people live in urban areas in india with a significant number concentrated in larger urban centers in addition to population pressure these mega cities are also characterized by rapid changes in lulc which include deforestation and widespread increase in impervious surfaces these trends have been attributed to increased proportion of impervious surfaces and storm water runoff rose and peters 2001 in addition to the issues highlighted with lulcc associated with urbanization affecting groundwater recharge there is also acute water shortage due to the burgeoning demands of a rapidly increasing population most of the major cities in india experience pressure from the peri urban areas due to reduced rural income and poor infrastructure there is huge rural urban migration who settle down in peri urban areas without any buffer zone often these peri urban areas become bigger than the main urban area the local city planning institutions do not take into consideration the crucial hydrogeological parameters for instance the upstream and down streams for groundwater flow are neither known nor examined further the problem of poor infrastructure and unmanaged sanitation leads to further deterioration of groundwater quality and quantity in addition it is also quite common due to rapid expansion of the city area the old industrial zones become urbanized without the scrutiny of the underlying groundwater both municipal and industrial pollution deteriorates the groundwater quality beyond remediation making it unusable although many industries later move out of the city areas the dilution of the groundwater is an extremely slow process accompanied with increased sewage pollution due to poor and old infrastructure and population increase all of this has led to a steep decline in the level of groundwater table in megacities of india like delhi and mumbai furthermore the role of pollution loads and discharge from urban activities have compromised the groundwater supplies posing risks to human health the detrimental effects of groundwater contamination on vulnerable populations have been widely documented for coastal areas talukder et al 2016 islam et al 2021 hence it is particularly critical to examine the role of urbanization related process including widespread changes in lulc and high density of population on groundwater status at the local level for instance the analysis of long term data from groundwater monitoring stations in delhi indicates significant decline in groundwater recharge because of urbanization and increasing demands of a growing population sen roy et al 2020 similar results of detrimental role of anthropogenic activities on the declining trends of groundwater levels have also found in tamil nadu india islam et al 2022 however it is noteworthy that there are a limited number of studies examining the long term role of urbanization at the local level on the status of groundwater in the coastal megacities of india such as mumbai this is particularly critical in view of its location coupled with rapid urbanization related to increasing population and industrial activities which have led to massive withdrawals of groundwater to meet the demands of the local population furthermore due to its coastal location the excessive withdrawal of groundwater has resulted in widespread saltwater intrusion resulting in above permissible concentrations of chloride 23 4000 lts in the groundwater haque et al 2013 several reports published by the central groundwater board cgwb and the brihanmumbai municipal corporation bmc highlight spatial variations in the levels of salinity and pollutants in the groundwater gupta 2009 some of the main sources of pollutants in the groundwater are from industrial activities including effluents from various oil refineries and reactors as well as fertilizer residues sabnis 1984 zingde and sabnis 1989 in this regard a substantial number of studies have examined the hydro geochemistry of mumbai naik et al 2007 tirumalesh et al 2010 kamble and vijay 2011 and utilized geospatial analysis to reveal the spatial variations in the wider area anbazhagan and nair 2004 shankar and mohan 2006 moreover the varied local level hydrogeological formations mainly inhibit groundwater recharge rani et al 2015 this is particularly significant since mumbai normally receives very heavy rainfall during the monsoon months and still experiences severe water shortages during the rest of the year this is due to the high rainfall run off resulting from a higher proportion of impervious surfaces in most of the indian cities including mumbai however there are no clear groundwater regulations or monitoring the usage of groundwater across the city despite the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater due to widespread high rise residential and commercial building constructions in addition there is no systematic record of private borewells and dug wells around the city it is noteworthy that one of the priority areas identified in the recently released mumbai climate action plan highlights the need to formalize groundwater connections for monitoring water quality for distribution in low income settlements at the monthly scale mumbai climate action plan 2022 however there are no extensive study examining the ling term trends and changes in groundwater levels in mumbai therefore it is critical to examine the local level impacts of urbanization related processes on the long term trends in groundwater levels in mumbai which typifies coastal megacities thus the objective of this study is to examine the long term trends in seasonal groundwater level depths at the station level across mumbai urban agglomeration in addition the role of changes in local land use land cover has been examined across the study area 2 study area mumbai 18 53 n 72 48 e is located on the west coast of india state capital of the western state of maharashtra and also known as the financial capital of india fig 1 a it is the most populous city in india and the eighth most populous city in the world with an estimated city population of 20 7 million the total area is approximately 603 km2 including the suburbs beyond the actual city limits of 69 km2 the average elevation ranges between 10 and 5m amsl with a maximum elevation of 450m amsl gupta 2009 it is bounded by the arabian sea in the south and west and several creeks in the east thane creek and north vasai creek that separate it from the mainland the general physical layout of mumbai consists of ridges along its western and eastern sections running in a north south direction with broad intervening lowlands the underlying rocks consist of various volcanic rock formations including amygdaloidal basalt on the eastern edge and stratified coarse grained acid tuff on the western edge rani et al 2015 the volcanic flows in the district consist of highly vesicular layer consisting of closely spaced horizontal joints and less thickness these vesicles are generally filled with secondary minerals and green earths and thus do not serve as an aquifer however some of the vesicular zones are weathered in most part of the area thus making them moderately permeable in areas where the vesicles are not filled they provide highly permeable aquifers the simple and compound volcanic flow in this region includes a basal vesicular zone middle relatively massive portion followed by a vesicular top gupta 2013 these vesicles are generally not interconnected which leads to wide variations in water holding capacity from the base to the top of the flow the main water bearing formations consist of basalt and river or marine alluvium sand and gravel haque et al 2013 the ground water exists in fractures joints vesicles and in weathered zone of the underlying basalt which is indicative of low storativity and transmissivity of the aquifers in this area thus the occurrence and circulation of ground water is controlled by vesicular unit of lava flows and through secondary porosity and permeability developed due to weathering jointing fracturing etc in general the ground water occurs under phreatic semi confined and confined conditions generally the phreatic aquifer range down to depth of 10 m bgl gupta 2013 in the deeper aquifers leaky confined conditions are observed the yields of the groundwater is determined by the permeability and transmissivity of the aquifers which varies with location climatologically mumbai has a tropical wet and dry climate with average temperatures ranging between 16 3 c and 32 2 c and average total annual rainfall between 1800mm and 2400 mm at the seasonal scale the rainfall occurring during the summer southwest monsoon season june to september constitutes 96 of the total annual rainfall followed by 0 8 during pre monsoon march may 3 during post monsoon october november and 0 1 during winter december february seasons specifically at the monthly scale july is the highest 36 of annual rainfall followed by june 23 august 23 and september 13 of the annual rainfall rana et al 2012 during the summer monsoon season it usually rains uniformly over the city resulting in severe flooding in many parts after extended durations of rainfall ranging from 30 min to 120 min and in some cases they can be as long as 3 4 hours daily rainfall amounts of up to 250 mm are common during the summer monsoon season rana et al 2012 one of the unique features of mumbai city is the sanjay gandhi national park sgnp located in the north which has significant historical and environmental value fig 1a with a total area of 104 km2 it is one of the largest forest reserves in the world carved out amidst dense residential settlements it has a rich biodiversity in the form of 254 species of birds 40 species of mammals 78 species of reptiles and amphibians 150 species of butterflies and more than 1300 species of plants maharashtra government 2021 this park plays an important role as a carbon sink for the dense and congested city of mumbai with no buffer zone or protective wall around it the national park has been steadily encroached upon over the years by migrants from neighboring states land sharks commercial establishments and finally by slums in the 1990s with most of mumbai s land being either occupied or encroached upon the last wave of poor immigrants into the city in the early 1990s found their home and hearth along its unprotected boundaries nivara hakk 2021 mumbai which houses asia s largest slum has experienced large scale redevelopment in the past few decades the housing choice in the rental market is not affordable for the city s poor who constitute about 42 of mumbai s population kshetrimayum et al 2020 an estimated 5 2 million people live in urban informal settlements or slums corburn and sverdlik 2019 according to government of india census records 49 38 of greater mumbai are slum population census of india 2021 the predominant sources of the water supply in mumbai are from nearby reservoirs and lakes located in the north which include lakes vihar tulsi vaitarna and bhatsa nallathiga et al 2005 the majority of the water demand in mumbai is for domestic followed by industrial purposes however there is an increasing gap between water demand and supply which needs to be addressed on a priority basis 3 data and methods 3 1 groundwater data there are 23 groundwater monitoring stations monitored by the state level groundwater surveys and development agency gsda across the metropolitan area all of these monitoring stations are dug wells each station level data series were checked for completeness and outliers during the entire study period a substantial period of at least 11 years of reasonably complete data less than 3 missing values for any season during the study period was established as the threshold for analysis in this study based on the preliminary data quality analysis only six stations with the most complete data were selected for this study fig 1a furthermore each of the monitoring stations were physically visited to assess the local level land use land cover in the area as well as meeting with the local officials at the cgwb these six stations are well spread across mumbai representing the different land uses which include dahisar suburban 1990 2019 a m c colony suburban 1969 2019 mahroli chemur suburban 1990 2019 mahim urban 2000 2019 bombay church gate urban 1989 2019 and colaba dandi urban 1990 2019 additionally the elevation of these stations ranged between 9 mamsl at mahim in the south to 45 2 mamsl at a m c colony in the north fig 1b these stations are monitored four times a year to capture the annual seasonal variations which include january post monsoon rabi may pre monsoon august monsoon and november post monsoon kharif 3 2 lulc data multi temporal landsat satellite data sets tm etm and oli tirs of 1991 2001 2011 and 2018 were used for preparing lulc pattern and changes across the city for making lulc there are various classification techniques e g supervised maximum likelihood classifier mlc k means clustering random forest rf artificial neural network ann fuzzy artmap support vector machine svm etc talukdar et al 2020 in this study supervised mlc technique is used for the lulc mapping and change analysis of mumbai city we used national remote sensing centre classification scheme nrsc 1995 to classify land use land cover class to make lulc maps we choose mlc because mlc gives good lulc output map of any area when we use 30 m resolution landsat tm data it is assumed that with the increase in the built up land concretization and increase in the impervious surface the ground water shall further go down six lulc classes were identified based on national remote sensing centre classification scheme nrsc 1995 it is assumed that with the increase in the built up land concretization and increase in the impervious surface the ground water shall further go down erdas image software was utilized to analyze the spatial pattern of lulc change during 1991 2018 fig 4 buffer analysis was done in arcgis software around six groundwater monitoring stations used in this study four concentric buffer zones each of 1 km were made to measure the lulc change and its relationship with the long term groundwater trends the accuracy assessment was done to see the overall accuracy and kappa k statistics it is seen that the overall accuracy of lulc was 87 20 85 80 92 80 and 93 0 in 1991 2001 2011 and 2022 respectively at the same time the k statics calculated was 0 88 0 87 0 94 and 0 96 in 1991 2001 2011 and 2022 respectively this clearly shows that classified lulc maps had very good accuracies 3 3 socio demographic data socio demographic data at the ward level for the censuses of 2001 and 2011 were downloaded from the office of registrar general and census commissioner india census of india 2020 a total of 24 census wards cover mumbai city boundary and we analyzed the change in the number of households population density and literacy levels mumbai has experienced a steady increase in population during the latter half of the 20th century however it experienced a decline in population in the northernmost and southernmost wards while the central part of mumbai consisting of andheri goregaon powai and kandivali neighborhoods the highest population densities in 2011 were concentrated along the national highway 48 in the south colaba and bandra and in the center andheri dadar and powai fig 2 a the spatial distribution of the number of households revealed the highest concentrations greater than 100 000 in central mumbai over the last three decades mainly due to the intensive construction of high rise apartment buildings such as observed in powai andheri and kandivali to name a few fig 2b similarly the spatial distribution of working population mostly overlapped with that of the number of households in andheri powai and kandivali fig 2c one of the important aspects of the urban layout of mumbai is the presence of slums across the entire city fig 2d the number of people living in slums is about 104 million 9 of the total population of india the percentage of people living in slums is estimated to be as high as 41 84 in greater mumbai which mean about 9 million people live in these areas dharavi is the largest slum in mumbai and the second largest in asia it is estimated that one million people live in dharavi which spans just 535 acres and has a total population of 1million world population review 2021 the city has experienced substantial growth rate during last five decades due to high level of industrial development and growth in the suburban areas of greater mumbai deshmukh 2013 according to the 2001 census mumbai slum population was 54 5 which declined to 41 84 in the 2011 census census of india 2020 4 results and discussion the results and discussion section are divided into two parts the first section includes a discussion of the long term trends in groundwater levels across the six selected stations in mumbai the second section examines the role of surrounding lulcc and evidence from field observations on the observed trends in groundwater levels 4 1 spatial patterns of trends in groundwater levels the spatial patterns of station level long term trends in groundwater levels depths at the seasonal scale are shown in fig 3 in general the spatial patterns were similar across the different seasons with a north south gradient in the levels of groundwater depletion specifically the highest trends were observed in dahisar the northernmost station while the lowest trends negative during all seasons were observed in colaba seasonally the lowest trends were observed for all the stations during august monsoon season representing the rainiest period of the year conversely the highest rates of groundwater depletion were observed during the direr seasons pre monsoon may and post monsoon kharif november particularly during the pre monsoon season all the stations experienced increasing trends in the depths of groundwater levels including statistically significant trends at half of the stations dahisar a m c colony and colaba fig 3b in addition dahisar the northernmost station experienced the highest and statistically significant rates of depletion during all the seasons the location of the groundwater monitoring station in dahisar is surrounded by dense urban built up high rise multi residential apartment buildings two of the southernmost stations colaba and bombay churchgate located at the tip of the island constitute the older part of the city consisting of predominantly low rise buildings the observed negative rates at these stations can also be attributed to seawater intrusion in view of their proximity to the arabian sea moreover a finer analysis of decadal level trends in the groundwater levels across the different stations revealed higher depletion trends since the mid 1990s particularly in the northern interior stations of dahisar mahorli chemur and a m c colony all of these stations overlap with the highest population density and number of households coinciding with the construction of high rise multi residential buildings to house the growing population according to moghadam and helbich 2013 future urban expansion will keep occurring more toward the north along the major transportation networks 4 2 role of lulcc on the trends in groundwater levels given the distinct spatial patterns of increasing trends at all the stations across the study area we next examine the role of lulcc on these trends the total area of mumbai is 603 65 km2 with six predominant lulc types consisting of water bodies dense vegetation scrubland built up area cropland areas and open land fig 4 among these different lulc types the largest increase was observed for urban built up land use type from 173 34 km2 in 1991 to 344 4 km2 in 2018 table 1 specifically since 2001 there was a steeper increase in built up areas in mumbai on the contrary dense vegetation type experienced the largest decrease from 215 5 km2 in 1991 to 128 7 km2 in 2018 most of the dense vegetation was limited to the sgnp in the northern most part of the city the decrease in dense vegetation is a result of both encroachment by developers and slum dwellers as well as environmentally destructive activities such as tree felling by local residents in the sgnp zérah 2007 the adjacent neighborhoods around the park are some of the fastest increasing areas of population and urban development it was followed by a decrease in agricultural croplands from 36 67km2 in 1991 to 10 32 km2 in 2018 the areas in all other lulc types experienced a moderate to slight decrease between 1991 and 2018 the large scale conversion from natural to dense built up land uses implies an increase in paved impervious surfaces which inhibit groundwater recharge the availability of infrastructure reinforced by the national and local government has accelerated the economic prosperity making mumbai a foremost economic and financial center in the process bhagat 2011 this has resulted in rapid urban sprawl from the analysis of lulcc it is also evident that most of the urban expansion occurred in the northern parts of the city which also overlaps with the highest population densities and number of households this is in conformity with the results of previous studies that mention a direct link between urban growth and population growth basawaraja et al 2011 bagan and yamagata 2012 specifically the total population in mumbai increased from 12 7 million in 1991 to almost 20 million in 2018 in this context it is noteworthy that a large proportion of the built up areas consist of multi residential high rise apartment buildings to accommodate the rapidly growing population resulting in increased water demand and consumption which ultimately results in groundwater depletion the results of our analysis are in conformity with results of previous research examining the role of population increase in mumbai haque et al 2013 rani et al 2015 given the larger proportion of growth in urban built up areas from 2001 to 2018 we analyzed the change in lulc types in the immediate surroundings of the six stations table 2 the change analysis revealed the largest increase in built up area around three stations a m c colony dahisar and mahroli chemur for all buffer zones table 2 specifically the increase in urban built up areas for these three stations were greater than 3 5 km 2 km 1 5 km and 0 5 km within the 4 km 3 km 2 km and 1 km buffer zones respectively thus it is evident that the stations that recorded the steepest increase in groundwater

and groundwater levels have been found in other large megacities foster 2001 kalhor and emaminejad 2019 mishra et al 2014 sharp 2010 it is evident from the above analysis that the area is extremely fragile for groundwater depletion and recharge specifically shallow groundwater is subjected to severe pollution from sewage effluents from industrial wastes and saltwater intrusion due to high building density and older buildings there is limited space for rainwater harvesting despite above average rainfall therefore the following recommendations are made based on the results of our study

11824,groundwater accounts for 50 80 of all domestic water use and 45 50 of all irrigation in india with a projected 300 million people to be added to its urban population by 2050 cities will have a significant role on groundwater status in india therefore this study examined the long term trends in station level groundwater and the role of land use land cover change lulcc in mumbai city we utilized station level groundwater depth data for six stations and lulc from satellite images from 1991 to 2018 the results revealed significant increase in groundwater depths across different seasons particularly during the dry season steeper rates of decline were clustered around the northern interior of the city which have experienced the maximum increase in urban impervious surfaces some of the stations located in the southern part of mumbai experienced decreasing trends in groundwater depths during the wet season this can be attributed to the low elevation and proximity to the seawaters resulting in saltwater intrusion groundwater exploitation from deeper aquifers and guided engineered recharge to the top aquifers are the sustainable solutions the results are particularly relevant for large urban agglomerations in the global south experiencing similar rates of rapid urbanization and population increase graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater depletion land use land cover change lulcc mumbai urbanization 1 introduction groundwater resources account for 90 of the global accessible freshwater due to their wider distribution and ubiquity compared to surface water shiklomanov and rodda 2003 the dominance of groundwater as a source of freshwater is evident from the fact that it accounts for 50 80 of all domestic water use and 45 50 of all irrigation in india specifically the area under irrigation has nearly tripled between 1970 and 1999 in india briscoe 2005 kumar et al 2005 mall et al 2006 for instance the rate of population increase is particularly significant in the large urban areas in india the population has increased more than 8 times since the turn of the century the growth rate of urban population 3 1 is significantly higher than the national growth rate 2 of india one of the main reasons for this manifold increase in urban population is the rural urban migration in search of better economic opportunities urbanization related processes result in widespread land use land cover changes lulcc along with higher density of population some of the typical lulcc include the loss of vegetation manifold increase in percentage of impervious surfaces mainly consisting of urban built up structures and change of natural flow of storm water runoff directly to stream channels cao and sen roy 2020 all of these processes result in greater proportion of precipitation as surface runoff leading to lower infiltration and recharge this directly impacts the groundwater depletion and recharge rates in addition there is reduced lag time between precipitation and runoff resulting in lower groundwater recharge finally groundwater quality is degraded by effluent discharges shaw 1994 for instance analyses of district level groundwater samples collected in bangladesh indicated the sources of contamination from geogenic weathering and geochemical alteration of source rock sources followed by anthropogenic source agrogenic domestic sewage etc bhuiyan et al 2016 islam et al 2018 in major cities of india the population growth has been fastest in the peripheries which extend much beyond the official administrative boundaries of the cities therefore the rapid rate of urbanization in india has accelerated the over utilization and deterioration of the quality of groundwater in the densely populated urban areas groundwater is increasingly becoming the main source of water throughout the year to fulfill the daily needs of the urban population particularly during the dry summer months groundwater is also the main source of drinking water for the urban population it is estimated that out of a total population of 1 2 billion about 400 million people live in urban areas in india with a significant number concentrated in larger urban centers in addition to population pressure these mega cities are also characterized by rapid changes in lulc which include deforestation and widespread increase in impervious surfaces these trends have been attributed to increased proportion of impervious surfaces and storm water runoff rose and peters 2001 in addition to the issues highlighted with lulcc associated with urbanization affecting groundwater recharge there is also acute water shortage due to the burgeoning demands of a rapidly increasing population most of the major cities in india experience pressure from the peri urban areas due to reduced rural income and poor infrastructure there is huge rural urban migration who settle down in peri urban areas without any buffer zone often these peri urban areas become bigger than the main urban area the local city planning institutions do not take into consideration the crucial hydrogeological parameters for instance the upstream and down streams for groundwater flow are neither known nor examined further the problem of poor infrastructure and unmanaged sanitation leads to further deterioration of groundwater quality and quantity in addition it is also quite common due to rapid expansion of the city area the old industrial zones become urbanized without the scrutiny of the underlying groundwater both municipal and industrial pollution deteriorates the groundwater quality beyond remediation making it unusable although many industries later move out of the city areas the dilution of the groundwater is an extremely slow process accompanied with increased sewage pollution due to poor and old infrastructure and population increase all of this has led to a steep decline in the level of groundwater table in megacities of india like delhi and mumbai furthermore the role of pollution loads and discharge from urban activities have compromised the groundwater supplies posing risks to human health the detrimental effects of groundwater contamination on vulnerable populations have been widely documented for coastal areas talukder et al 2016 islam et al 2021 hence it is particularly critical to examine the role of urbanization related process including widespread changes in lulc and high density of population on groundwater status at the local level for instance the analysis of long term data from groundwater monitoring stations in delhi indicates significant decline in groundwater recharge because of urbanization and increasing demands of a growing population sen roy et al 2020 similar results of detrimental role of anthropogenic activities on the declining trends of groundwater levels have also found in tamil nadu india islam et al 2022 however it is noteworthy that there are a limited number of studies examining the long term role of urbanization at the local level on the status of groundwater in the coastal megacities of india such as mumbai this is particularly critical in view of its location coupled with rapid urbanization related to increasing population and industrial activities which have led to massive withdrawals of groundwater to meet the demands of the local population furthermore due to its coastal location the excessive withdrawal of groundwater has resulted in widespread saltwater intrusion resulting in above permissible concentrations of chloride 23 4000 lts in the groundwater haque et al 2013 several reports published by the central groundwater board cgwb and the brihanmumbai municipal corporation bmc highlight spatial variations in the levels of salinity and pollutants in the groundwater gupta 2009 some of the main sources of pollutants in the groundwater are from industrial activities including effluents from various oil refineries and reactors as well as fertilizer residues sabnis 1984 zingde and sabnis 1989 in this regard a substantial number of studies have examined the hydro geochemistry of mumbai naik et al 2007 tirumalesh et al 2010 kamble and vijay 2011 and utilized geospatial analysis to reveal the spatial variations in the wider area anbazhagan and nair 2004 shankar and mohan 2006 moreover the varied local level hydrogeological formations mainly inhibit groundwater recharge rani et al 2015 this is particularly significant since mumbai normally receives very heavy rainfall during the monsoon months and still experiences severe water shortages during the rest of the year this is due to the high rainfall run off resulting from a higher proportion of impervious surfaces in most of the indian cities including mumbai however there are no clear groundwater regulations or monitoring the usage of groundwater across the city despite the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater due to widespread high rise residential and commercial building constructions in addition there is no systematic record of private borewells and dug wells around the city it is noteworthy that one of the priority areas identified in the recently released mumbai climate action plan highlights the need to formalize groundwater connections for monitoring water quality for distribution in low income settlements at the monthly scale mumbai climate action plan 2022 however there are no extensive study examining the ling term trends and changes in groundwater levels in mumbai therefore it is critical to examine the local level impacts of urbanization related processes on the long term trends in groundwater levels in mumbai which typifies coastal megacities thus the objective of this study is to examine the long term trends in seasonal groundwater level depths at the station level across mumbai urban agglomeration in addition the role of changes in local land use land cover has been examined across the study area 2 study area mumbai 18 53 n 72 48 e is located on the west coast of india state capital of the western state of maharashtra and also known as the financial capital of india fig 1 a it is the most populous city in india and the eighth most populous city in the world with an estimated city population of 20 7 million the total area is approximately 603 km2 including the suburbs beyond the actual city limits of 69 km2 the average elevation ranges between 10 and 5m amsl with a maximum elevation of 450m amsl gupta 2009 it is bounded by the arabian sea in the south and west and several creeks in the east thane creek and north vasai creek that separate it from the mainland the general physical layout of mumbai consists of ridges along its western and eastern sections running in a north south direction with broad intervening lowlands the underlying rocks consist of various volcanic rock formations including amygdaloidal basalt on the eastern edge and stratified coarse grained acid tuff on the western edge rani et al 2015 the volcanic flows in the district consist of highly vesicular layer consisting of closely spaced horizontal joints and less thickness these vesicles are generally filled with secondary minerals and green earths and thus do not serve as an aquifer however some of the vesicular zones are weathered in most part of the area thus making them moderately permeable in areas where the vesicles are not filled they provide highly permeable aquifers the simple and compound volcanic flow in this region includes a basal vesicular zone middle relatively massive portion followed by a vesicular top gupta 2013 these vesicles are generally not interconnected which leads to wide variations in water holding capacity from the base to the top of the flow the main water bearing formations consist of basalt and river or marine alluvium sand and gravel haque et al 2013 the ground water exists in fractures joints vesicles and in weathered zone of the underlying basalt which is indicative of low storativity and transmissivity of the aquifers in this area thus the occurrence and circulation of ground water is controlled by vesicular unit of lava flows and through secondary porosity and permeability developed due to weathering jointing fracturing etc in general the ground water occurs under phreatic semi confined and confined conditions generally the phreatic aquifer range down to depth of 10 m bgl gupta 2013 in the deeper aquifers leaky confined conditions are observed the yields of the groundwater is determined by the permeability and transmissivity of the aquifers which varies with location climatologically mumbai has a tropical wet and dry climate with average temperatures ranging between 16 3 c and 32 2 c and average total annual rainfall between 1800mm and 2400 mm at the seasonal scale the rainfall occurring during the summer southwest monsoon season june to september constitutes 96 of the total annual rainfall followed by 0 8 during pre monsoon march may 3 during post monsoon october november and 0 1 during winter december february seasons specifically at the monthly scale july is the highest 36 of annual rainfall followed by june 23 august 23 and september 13 of the annual rainfall rana et al 2012 during the summer monsoon season it usually rains uniformly over the city resulting in severe flooding in many parts after extended durations of rainfall ranging from 30 min to 120 min and in some cases they can be as long as 3 4 hours daily rainfall amounts of up to 250 mm are common during the summer monsoon season rana et al 2012 one of the unique features of mumbai city is the sanjay gandhi national park sgnp located in the north which has significant historical and environmental value fig 1a with a total area of 104 km2 it is one of the largest forest reserves in the world carved out amidst dense residential settlements it has a rich biodiversity in the form of 254 species of birds 40 species of mammals 78 species of reptiles and amphibians 150 species of butterflies and more than 1300 species of plants maharashtra government 2021 this park plays an important role as a carbon sink for the dense and congested city of mumbai with no buffer zone or protective wall around it the national park has been steadily encroached upon over the years by migrants from neighboring states land sharks commercial establishments and finally by slums in the 1990s with most of mumbai s land being either occupied or encroached upon the last wave of poor immigrants into the city in the early 1990s found their home and hearth along its unprotected boundaries nivara hakk 2021 mumbai which houses asia s largest slum has experienced large scale redevelopment in the past few decades the housing choice in the rental market is not affordable for the city s poor who constitute about 42 of mumbai s population kshetrimayum et al 2020 an estimated 5 2 million people live in urban informal settlements or slums corburn and sverdlik 2019 according to government of india census records 49 38 of greater mumbai are slum population census of india 2021 the predominant sources of the water supply in mumbai are from nearby reservoirs and lakes located in the north which include lakes vihar tulsi vaitarna and bhatsa nallathiga et al 2005 the majority of the water demand in mumbai is for domestic followed by industrial purposes however there is an increasing gap between water demand and supply which needs to be addressed on a priority basis 3 data and methods 3 1 groundwater data there are 23 groundwater monitoring stations monitored by the state level groundwater surveys and development agency gsda across the metropolitan area all of these monitoring stations are dug wells each station level data series were checked for completeness and outliers during the entire study period a substantial period of at least 11 years of reasonably complete data less than 3 missing values for any season during the study period was established as the threshold for analysis in this study based on the preliminary data quality analysis only six stations with the most complete data were selected for this study fig 1a furthermore each of the monitoring stations were physically visited to assess the local level land use land cover in the area as well as meeting with the local officials at the cgwb these six stations are well spread across mumbai representing the different land uses which include dahisar suburban 1990 2019 a m c colony suburban 1969 2019 mahroli chemur suburban 1990 2019 mahim urban 2000 2019 bombay church gate urban 1989 2019 and colaba dandi urban 1990 2019 additionally the elevation of these stations ranged between 9 mamsl at mahim in the south to 45 2 mamsl at a m c colony in the north fig 1b these stations are monitored four times a year to capture the annual seasonal variations which include january post monsoon rabi may pre monsoon august monsoon and november post monsoon kharif 3 2 lulc data multi temporal landsat satellite data sets tm etm and oli tirs of 1991 2001 2011 and 2018 were used for preparing lulc pattern and changes across the city for making lulc there are various classification techniques e g supervised maximum likelihood classifier mlc k means clustering random forest rf artificial neural network ann fuzzy artmap support vector machine svm etc talukdar et al 2020 in this study supervised mlc technique is used for the lulc mapping and change analysis of mumbai city we used national remote sensing centre classification scheme nrsc 1995 to classify land use land cover class to make lulc maps we choose mlc because mlc gives good lulc output map of any area when we use 30 m resolution landsat tm data it is assumed that with the increase in the built up land concretization and increase in the impervious surface the ground water shall further go down six lulc classes were identified based on national remote sensing centre classification scheme nrsc 1995 it is assumed that with the increase in the built up land concretization and increase in the impervious surface the ground water shall further go down erdas image software was utilized to analyze the spatial pattern of lulc change during 1991 2018 fig 4 buffer analysis was done in arcgis software around six groundwater monitoring stations used in this study four concentric buffer zones each of 1 km were made to measure the lulc change and its relationship with the long term groundwater trends the accuracy assessment was done to see the overall accuracy and kappa k statistics it is seen that the overall accuracy of lulc was 87 20 85 80 92 80 and 93 0 in 1991 2001 2011 and 2022 respectively at the same time the k statics calculated was 0 88 0 87 0 94 and 0 96 in 1991 2001 2011 and 2022 respectively this clearly shows that classified lulc maps had very good accuracies 3 3 socio demographic data socio demographic data at the ward level for the censuses of 2001 and 2011 were downloaded from the office of registrar general and census commissioner india census of india 2020 a total of 24 census wards cover mumbai city boundary and we analyzed the change in the number of households population density and literacy levels mumbai has experienced a steady increase in population during the latter half of the 20th century however it experienced a decline in population in the northernmost and southernmost wards while the central part of mumbai consisting of andheri goregaon powai and kandivali neighborhoods the highest population densities in 2011 were concentrated along the national highway 48 in the south colaba and bandra and in the center andheri dadar and powai fig 2 a the spatial distribution of the number of households revealed the highest concentrations greater than 100 000 in central mumbai over the last three decades mainly due to the intensive construction of high rise apartment buildings such as observed in powai andheri and kandivali to name a few fig 2b similarly the spatial distribution of working population mostly overlapped with that of the number of households in andheri powai and kandivali fig 2c one of the important aspects of the urban layout of mumbai is the presence of slums across the entire city fig 2d the number of people living in slums is about 104 million 9 of the total population of india the percentage of people living in slums is estimated to be as high as 41 84 in greater mumbai which mean about 9 million people live in these areas dharavi is the largest slum in mumbai and the second largest in asia it is estimated that one million people live in dharavi which spans just 535 acres and has a total population of 1million world population review 2021 the city has experienced substantial growth rate during last five decades due to high level of industrial development and growth in the suburban areas of greater mumbai deshmukh 2013 according to the 2001 census mumbai slum population was 54 5 which declined to 41 84 in the 2011 census census of india 2020 4 results and discussion the results and discussion section are divided into two parts the first section includes a discussion of the long term trends in groundwater levels across the six selected stations in mumbai the second section examines the role of surrounding lulcc and evidence from field observations on the observed trends in groundwater levels 4 1 spatial patterns of trends in groundwater levels the spatial patterns of station level long term trends in groundwater levels depths at the seasonal scale are shown in fig 3 in general the spatial patterns were similar across the different seasons with a north south gradient in the levels of groundwater depletion specifically the highest trends were observed in dahisar the northernmost station while the lowest trends negative during all seasons were observed in colaba seasonally the lowest trends were observed for all the stations during august monsoon season representing the rainiest period of the year conversely the highest rates of groundwater depletion were observed during the direr seasons pre monsoon may and post monsoon kharif november particularly during the pre monsoon season all the stations experienced increasing trends in the depths of groundwater levels including statistically significant trends at half of the stations dahisar a m c colony and colaba fig 3b in addition dahisar the northernmost station experienced the highest and statistically significant rates of depletion during all the seasons the location of the groundwater monitoring station in dahisar is surrounded by dense urban built up high rise multi residential apartment buildings two of the southernmost stations colaba and bombay churchgate located at the tip of the island constitute the older part of the city consisting of predominantly low rise buildings the observed negative rates at these stations can also be attributed to seawater intrusion in view of their proximity to the arabian sea moreover a finer analysis of decadal level trends in the groundwater levels across the different stations revealed higher depletion trends since the mid 1990s particularly in the northern interior stations of dahisar mahorli chemur and a m c colony all of these stations overlap with the highest population density and number of households coinciding with the construction of high rise multi residential buildings to house the growing population according to moghadam and helbich 2013 future urban expansion will keep occurring more toward the north along the major transportation networks 4 2 role of lulcc on the trends in groundwater levels given the distinct spatial patterns of increasing trends at all the stations across the study area we next examine the role of lulcc on these trends the total area of mumbai is 603 65 km2 with six predominant lulc types consisting of water bodies dense vegetation scrubland built up area cropland areas and open land fig 4 among these different lulc types the largest increase was observed for urban built up land use type from 173 34 km2 in 1991 to 344 4 km2 in 2018 table 1 specifically since 2001 there was a steeper increase in built up areas in mumbai on the contrary dense vegetation type experienced the largest decrease from 215 5 km2 in 1991 to 128 7 km2 in 2018 most of the dense vegetation was limited to the sgnp in the northern most part of the city the decrease in dense vegetation is a result of both encroachment by developers and slum dwellers as well as environmentally destructive activities such as tree felling by local residents in the sgnp zérah 2007 the adjacent neighborhoods around the park are some of the fastest increasing areas of population and urban development it was followed by a decrease in agricultural croplands from 36 67km2 in 1991 to 10 32 km2 in 2018 the areas in all other lulc types experienced a moderate to slight decrease between 1991 and 2018 the large scale conversion from natural to dense built up land uses implies an increase in paved impervious surfaces which inhibit groundwater recharge the availability of infrastructure reinforced by the national and local government has accelerated the economic prosperity making mumbai a foremost economic and financial center in the process bhagat 2011 this has resulted in rapid urban sprawl from the analysis of lulcc it is also evident that most of the urban expansion occurred in the northern parts of the city which also overlaps with the highest population densities and number of households this is in conformity with the results of previous studies that mention a direct link between urban growth and population growth basawaraja et al 2011 bagan and yamagata 2012 specifically the total population in mumbai increased from 12 7 million in 1991 to almost 20 million in 2018 in this context it is noteworthy that a large proportion of the built up areas consist of multi residential high rise apartment buildings to accommodate the rapidly growing population resulting in increased water demand and consumption which ultimately results in groundwater depletion the results of our analysis are in conformity with results of previous research examining the role of population increase in mumbai haque et al 2013 rani et al 2015 given the larger proportion of growth in urban built up areas from 2001 to 2018 we analyzed the change in lulc types in the immediate surroundings of the six stations table 2 the change analysis revealed the largest increase in built up area around three stations a m c colony dahisar and mahroli chemur for all buffer zones table 2 specifically the increase in urban built up areas for these three stations were greater than 3 5 km 2 km 1 5 km and 0 5 km within the 4 km 3 km 2 km and 1 km buffer zones respectively thus it is evident that the stations that recorded the steepest increase in groundwater level depths also experienced the largest increase in urban built up land uses accompanied by an increase in population density and number of households similar association between land cover change and groundwater levels have been found in other large megacities foster 2001 kalhor and emaminejad 2019 mishra et al 2014 sharp 2010 it is evident from the above analysis that the area is extremely fragile for groundwater depletion and recharge specifically shallow groundwater is subjected to severe pollution from sewage effluents from industrial wastes and saltwater intrusion due to high building density and older buildings there is limited space for rainwater harvesting despite above average rainfall therefore the following recommendations are made based on the results of our study and for more sustainable management of groundwater resources groundwater should not be used as drinking water supply in mumbai because there is enough surface water available from nearby freshwater lakes adjacent to the city including vihar modak sagar lower vaitarna middle and upper vaitarna lake and tansa and bhatsa dams more systematic monitoring and record of deep to very deep bore wells drilled in the city for perennial water supply although enough space is not available for rainwater harvesting roof top rainwater harvesting should be made compulsory to capture the runoff and minimize urban floods in addition roads may be constructed with adequate slope and design for groundwater recharge for example using hard and porous materials industries should be allowed to pump groundwater away from the seacoast and practice more effective treatment of effluents before discharging into local creeks hotels and bigger establishments should be encouraged to adopt more water recycling practices and attain zero balance approach 5 conclusions in the present study we examined the station level long term seasonal trends in groundwater level depths in the mumbai urban area it is one of the largest and fastest growing urban regions in the world and has unmatched effects on urban sprawl and population dynamics chakrabarti 2001 overall the spatial distribution of groundwater
