electrooxidation eo technology are stable due to the presence of titanium ruthenium iridium and platinum oxides this eo technology works by passing current in the presence of minimum electrolyte concentration sufficient to kill the bacteria present in sewage and simulated water this technology can be used in sewage pre treatment plants so that the microbes present in sewage water will not come into the environment thus preventing the spread of an epidemic the lab scale electrochemical disinfection experiments were performed under batch conditions to see the inactivation efficacy of the eo system with eight different bacteria escherichia coli bacillus subtilis staphylococcus aureus salmonella enterica acinetobacter calcoacetius serratia marcescens listeria sp enterococcus faecalis

simulated wastewater microbial decontamination epidemic management water treatment 1 introduction recent covid pandemic events have shown the necessity of advanced microbial decontamination as a preventative measure for epidemic control this is very important for tropical and sub tropical countries of developing and under developing nations where the microbial load in the environment is enormous and sanitization quality is poor this poor infrastructure poverty and lack of awareness have led to many epidemics worldwide one such waterborne epidemic occurred in 2015 in shimla india due to a jaundice outbreak leading to contamination of drinking water and affecting over 5000 people another waterborne epidemic in edinburgh uk occurred due to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa through hospital wastewater 1 2 thus there is a need for a specific advanced eco friendly and economically viable technology that requires the least management and high reusability to prevent these epidemics urinal discharges from the standard toilets of hospitals often pose an environmental threat as they are either partially treated or fed off into the nearby water bodies 3 this untreated partially treated wastewater is potent for waterborne infectious diseases as it may have a high microbial load e g pathogenic viruses bacteria protozoa more than 1 million people die every year due to water and sanitation associated diseases 4 thus the poor efficiency of the conventional treatment system has raised serious concerns over the public health system with the emergence of new strains like covid 19 a centralized wastewater treatment system poses a big question mark on future pandemics in this context the present study reports the applications of eco sanitation as a cost effective decentralized wastewater treatment system 5 capable of eradicating microbial contaminants from hospital wastewater conventional disinfection techniques such as ozonation uv chlorination cannot effectively treat the viruses and other pathogens present in the hospital wastewater this might be due to the enormous volume of wastewater and the inadequacy of tertiary treatment as the concentration range of microorganisms varies from 10 3 10 6 mg l it becomes difficult to remove these micro pollutants from conventional treatments 6 moreover the formation of chlorine substituted by products during chlorination has raised other major environmental concerns 7 therefore the need of the hour is to have an on site treatment facility for the ward specific wastewater before it mixes with the common effluent it will help avoid the spread of pathogenic microbes in whole water and also define the process economy some latest studies have been published about the biological wastewater treatment through the biometric dynamic membrane 8 and aerobic granular sludge ags 9 10 however treatment time and volume of effluent would remain a challenging factor in recent years electrochemical technologies ec have become more reliable than the conventional methods for treating wastewater containing toxic and micropollutants 11 14 one of the most promising ec wastewater treatment technologies is electrochemical oxidation eo 15 eo has shown considerable potential in treating domestic and industrial wastewater streams one of the promising areas in which this technology has shown significant applications is eco sanitation eo is a cost effective feasible and eco friendly technology in wastewater treatments 16 17 this technology is highly efficient because it uses the different compositions of mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes and has the potential for the field scale treatment of wastewater these electrodes can generate a lot of reactive chlorine spices rcs and reactive oxygen species ros 18 which would eventually attack the target pollutants for the degradation of an extensive range of pollutants more emphasis has been given to a different group of electrodes such as lead lead oxide boron doped diamond bdd and dimensionally stable anodes 19 21 eo using lead and lead oxide has been proven effective because of its low cost stability and high oxygen evolution 22 but at the same time one of its significant drawbacks was the formation of an adherent film on the surface of the anode leading to electrode poisoning 23 eo using bdd electrodes has unique features such as high overpotential high corrosion stability good conductivity and current efficiency 24 25 along with the limitation of low chlorine generation the formation of toxic by products like chlorates perchlorates and diamond anodes huge price cost makes its large scale application unrealistic 26 various authors have reported that mixed metal oxides with market name dimensionally stable anodes dsa were highly efficient electrochemically durable and high power for chlorine generation 20 furthermore compared to other electrodes it possesses longer shelf life 27 28 at an acidic ph range the rate of hydroxyl radicals oh adsorption through water electrolysis on the mmo anodes is high leading to direct compound oxidation in bulk the generation of hocl oxidant species is maximal leading to indirect oxidation the chloride generation enhances the electrochemical disinfection by forming rcs and chlorine radical species 29 32 various dsa like ti bi binary dsa ir ta binary dsa ti ru binary dsa sn sb binary dsa ir ru binary dsa ru sn ce ternary dsa sn ru ir ternary dsa and ru ir sn ti quaternary mmo anodes 33 have established their worth in treating an extensive range of dyes sewerage 34 35 pesticides and herbicides 36 37 phenolic compounds 38 pharmaceutical waste 39 40 and microcystin toxins 41 during eo microorganisms are killed by various oxidants produced during water electrolysis 3 the oxidant generation depends on the anode composition 42 the anodes of lead dioxide pbo2 bdd and antimony doped tin oxide favors free oh formation the dsa anodes form surface bound oh enhancing the rcs formation 27 the inactivation of bacteria during the eo process can be generally explained by two types of damage to bacterial cells first rcs reacts with the cell surface components leading to permeability changes in the cell membrane or damaging the enzymatic systems of bacteria secondly this damage to the cell surface can cause impairment of intracellular components especially the loss of deoxyribonucleic acid dna integrity 43 the damages depend on the ct value the type of bacterial cells and their structural differences gram positive vs gram negative here the ct value refers to the concentration of disinfectant and their reaction time the damages to the cell surfaces were majorly at low chlorine concentration 44 but severe impairments to the bacterial genome can occur if the chlorine concentration exceeds its threshold value 44 45 few researchers have also reported some low cost and eco friendly ways of using identified bacterial consortiums to treat domestic wastewater using different multistage biofilters 46 another method of using a magnetic disinfectant prepared through the polymerization of thiourea and formaldehyde in the presence of magnetite nanoparticles was loaded with silver and gold ions to deactivate water pathogenic microbes 47 48 although recently reported studies on the catalyst for bacterium species inactivation using different technologies 49 51 yet their commercial angle in decentralized treatment has not been visualized in this context the present study offers a commercially viable solution as a decentralized treatment facility specializing in ward specific wastewater from hospitals moreover achieving the complete inactivation rate within 1 2 min with minimum current density and electrolyte range further claims our proposal for this technology to be a decentralized treatment system the novel combination of mixed metal oxide electrodes with the unique composition of pt ru ir ti will be used for the decentralized treatment of hospital wastewater to commercialize this eo technique the mmo anodes with stainless steel cathodes can be powered with solar panels for the on site treatment of hospital and actual sewage wastewater the objective is to optimize the disinfection parameters of wastewater electrolysis cells for hospital wastewater treatment the operational parameters like current density electrolyte concentration cell voltage ph and reaction time are essential for optimizing the ec disinfection system this process would lead to the killing of microorganisms with reduced treatment time and maintaining the durability of electrodes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and microorganisms all chemicals of analytical grade were used in this

composition of the purchased mmo anodes were done using fe sem field emission scanning electron microscopy along with eds mapping energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy nova nano sem 450 jfei company of usa sea pte ltd the crystalline structure of the mmo anodes was characterized by xrd x ray diffraction using the x pert diffractometer from 2 theta 2theta 90o raman spectra were obtained for mmo anodes on a confocal raman spectrometer lab ram hr evolution horiba at 532 nm the bacterial images were recorded by an upright light microscope supertek 52 2 3 sample preparation the simulated wastewater was prepared by dissolving 3 5 g potassium acetate 400 mg sodium sulfate and 5 ml glacial acetic acid in 1 l of double distilled water the bacterial culture was grown by inoculating 1 2 μl of the bacterial strain in luria broth then the bacterial strain with a concentration of 104 cells ml i e 3 ml was inoculated according to the absorbance range of about 0 8 1 nm in the simulated fluid the concentration of sodium chloride varied according to the reaction the sample solution was freshly prepared for every experiment 2 4 experimental setup the eo treatment of the simulated wastewater was carried out in a glass beaker having a volume of 300 ml under the batch conditions as shown in fig 1 the electrodes used in the present study are mmo which is composed of titanium sheet coated with the metal oxides of tio2 iro2 ruo2 pt and were purchased from tiaano pvt ltd chennai india whereas cathode was made up of stainless steel purchased from aar kay deepak steels pvt ltd mohali india both cathode and anode dimensions were the same 70 mm 70 mm 1 mm the inter electrode spacing between the two electrodes was 20 mm the current density was maintained for each experiment by a dc supply procured from gayatri engineers maharashtra india model 0 30 v 0 2 a the reactor was kept over a magnetic stirrer at 500 600 rpm for homogeneity of the reaction throughout the experiment 3 2 5 experimental procedure the eo treatment of the simulated wastewater containing the microorganisms was carried out under galvanostatic conditions all the experiments were carried out at room temperature i e 25 c the ph range of the sample solution was set according to the experimental reaction by using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh the conductivity of the solution was maintained by using nacl as a supporting electrolyte the initial conductivity of the solution was around 2 72 ms after a specific times interval 200 μl of the sample volume was taken and was inoculated into 5 ml of luria broth solution in a test tube the test tubes containing the sample volume were incubated in a bod incubator for 24 h after 24 h the samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically at 600 nm after each experimental run the electrodes were washed by dipping in a 5 h2so4 solution 53 it was observed that the inactivation of the microorganisms was complete within a short time thus the efficacy of the eo process was to prove the inactivation of microorganisms in the simulated wastewater all the experiments were performed three times to ensure the reproducibility of the results the mean value has been quoted in the study and the standard deviation value is represented in bar graphs where ever required 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of anodes 3 1 1 fe sem eds analysis fe sem analysis was done to analyze the structural and surface morphology of the mmo anodes at the same time eds was performed to study the elemental composition of the different metal oxides coated on the surface of the anode the sem images for the freshly coated and recycled mmo anodes are depicted in fig 2 a b the sem images of both fresh and recycled anodes showed almost similar surface characteristics even after eighty experimental runs the electrode structure is comparatively porous and smooth with increased surface area and small cracks due to oxides of titanium ruthenium iridium and platinum in the ti sheet thereby preventing the electrodes from rusting thus increasing the stability of electrodes for a longer time 54 further the platinum content adds to more roughness and capacity in mmo anodes the protrusive peaks of ru ir pt ti and o in the recycled mmo as shown in fig 2 b confirm the anodes durability after 80 cycles the eds illustrates the atomic concentration of metals present in the oxide mixture which was almost similar for both the fresh and recycled mmo samples as shown in fig 2 a b hence it establishes that mmos are stable even after eighty recycles the elemental mapping of both fresh and recycled mmo anodes was also performed as shown in fig 2 c n 3 1 2 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction study was performed for the fresh and recycled mmo as shown in fig 3 xrd analysis was done to study the crystalline structures of metal oxide coated on the titanium sheet from the results oxides of ru ir pt and ti in the rutile structure of mmo were observed the prominent peaks of the metal oxides of ru ir pt and ti were also seen in the recycled mmo thus assuring all the metals intactness after eighty experimental runs it was also observed that there were some differences in the metal peaks from their original location due to the loss of some metal s volume during 80 cycles the diffraction peaks of titanium dioxide jcpds card 01 088 1172 titanium jcpds card 01 089 5009 iridium oxide jcpds card 01 086 0330 platinum oxide jcpds card 01 075 0978 and ruthenium oxide jcpds card 01 073 1469 were also determined any extra peak in the recycled mmo indicates some ionic species due to electrolytes in earlier literature nearly similar peaks are reported 55 57 3 1 3 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy study for both the fresh and recycled mmo was done to affirm the presence of the different oxides as shown in fig 4 the presence of peaks at around 133 cm 1 was of tio2 58 525 cm 1 of ruo2 728 cm 1 of iro2 59 and at 1600 cm 1 of pt 60 the raman spectrum for the recycled mmo was almost similar to that of the fresh mmo as shown in fig 4 it was also observed that there was a raman shift in the metal peaks of ruo2 and iro2 from their original location due to the loss of metal s volume from the outer layer of recycled mmo during 80 cycles thus establishing the fact that the composition of mmo is heterogeneous thus concluding that the addition of oxides of ti ir pt and ru metals has increased the durability of electrodes for a more extended period 3 1 4 cyclic voltammetry cv the cv experiments were performed to characterize the electrochemical activity of the mmo electrode as shown in the supplementary information file fig s1 the experiment was performed with saturated calomel as a reference electrode and platinum as a counter electrode with a scanning rate of 500 mv s the full cv of the mmo anode was recorded in the potential range of 1 0 to 0 5 v as it can be seen that an oxidation peak at around 18 ma was observed for cycle 1 but for cycles 20 40 60 and 80 the oxidation peaks were stable at 25 ma thus concluding the stability and durability of mmo anodes even after 80 cycles the cv experiments were performed to characterize the electrochemical activity of the mmo electrode as shown in the supplementary information file fig s1 the experiment was performed with saturated calomel as a reference electrode and platinum as a counter electrode with a scanning rate of 500 mv s the full cv of the mmo anode was recorded in the potential range of 1 0 to 0 5 v as it can be seen that an oxidation peak at around 18 ma was observed for cycle 1 but for cycles 20 40 60 and 80 the oxidation peaks were stable at 25 ma thus concluding the stability and durability of mmo anodes even after 80 cycles 3 2 preliminary study the preliminary tests were carried out to confirm the eo process s efficacy and establish the boundary conditions shown in fig 5 a b the first experiment was carried out with only electrolytes present in the reactor and no current was supplied it was found that with no current involvement in the eo setup containing the simulated wastewater no reduction in the bacterial count was observed as shown in fig 5 a this might be because of no generation of oxidative species like oh o3 ho2 and chloro oxidant species which are dependent on current density even the electron transfer capacity is also reliable in the application of current as a result no inactivation of bacteria was seen the maximum percentage inactivation of bacteria observed was around 10 after 10 min of reaction time the following experiment was performed when the only current was applied with no electrolyte nacl concentration since no electrolyte was added there was no production of rcs such as free chlorine cl2 hocl clo and chlorine radical species cl cl2 also ros including oh were not formed during the electrochemical splitting of water which can strengthen the overall electrooxidation efficacy 61 62 as a result no inactivation of bacteria in the simulated wastewater was observed the maximum percentage inactivation observed was around 6 after 10 min as shown in fig 5 b 3 3 effect of process parameters 3 3 1 effect of current density on inactivation of bacteria one of the significant factors in deciding eo s process economy for bacteria s inactivation is the current density it was observed that when the current density was increased the production rate of chloro oxidant species was also increased 63 in this study the current density range varied from 1 19 ma cm2 to 11 90 ma cm2 to see the inactivation of microbes it inactivated all the bacteria by applying a minimum current density of 2 380 ma cm2 for 2 min an optimized current density range for the complete inactivation of all eight bacteria is shown in fig 6 a d the inactivation of all eight bacteria taken in this study was possibly due to membrane disruption caused by milliampere current 64 due to this membrane disruption there was an influx of toxic substances causing cell death it can be concluded that the bactericidal effect was due to interactions between the bacteria the medium and the electrode material 64 it can be seen from fig 6 e that there was no inactivation of microbes at 1 19 ma cm2 even after 5 min but at other current densities range of 11 90 7 14 4 76 and 2 38 ma cm2 inactivation was observed within 2 min the percentage inactivation of bacteria at these current density ranges was 100 thus establishing that mmo shows better efficacy and is more stable at small current densities 3 3 2 effect of electrolyte nacl concentration on inactivation of bacteria the electrolyte concentration plays a crucial role in making the eo process efficient in inactivating bacteria it determines the formation of reactive chlorine species such as hclo clo etc higher the amount of nacl concentration more rcs will be produced leading to an increase in the percentage inactivation of bacteria at the same time it was observed that fouling and rusting of electrodes occur at high nacl concentrations by considering this the electrolyte concentration range varied from 0 5 to 3 0 g for this study it has been observed that the mmo anodes prevent fouling by stimulating direct oxidation along with mediated oxidation 65 the original ph of the simulated wastewater solution in this study was around 4 45 at an acidic ph range the rate of adsorption of oh is high on anodes leading to direct oxidation at the anode the production of hocl oxidative species was maximal over other oxidative species like clo and cl2 thus leading to indirect oxidation on anodes the optimum amount of nacl concentration should be taken for the stability of electrodes an optimized range of nacl dose for the complete inactivation of all eight bacteria is shown in fig 7 a e at different electrolyte concentrations of 0 5 g 0 8 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 100 inactivation of all the eight bacteria was observed in 2 min of reaction time 3 4 analysis of bacterial cell damage by potassium ion leakage the outer membrane of bacteria acts as a barrier to the permeability of intracellular substances the eo treatment could damage the cell wall and the outer membrane of bacteria by rcs leading to an increase in the permeability and leakage of k ions from the cell 66 the permeability of the cell membrane was studied by examining the potassium ion leakage before and after eo treatment of the cell there was a gradual increase of k concentration after a treatment time of 2 min from 35 mg l to 65 mg l in e coli and from 35 mg l to 50 mg l in the case of b subtilis as shown in fig 8 a the total k concentration was released entirely when the bacteria were completely inactivated after a treatment time of 2 min this suggested that the membrane permeability was completely disrupted after the 100 inactivation of bacteria 3 5 analysis of bacterial inactivation by vital staining the simulated wastewater having eight different bacteria was further analyzed before and after eo treatment through vital staining by trypan blue dye trypan blue stain is exclusively used to stain the dead cells as live cells have an intact cell membrane the trypan blue cannot pass through the cell membrane and the cytoplasm as the eo treatment damages the cell membrane of bacteria by rcs the trypan blue can pass through the porous membrane and enter the cytoplasm both the live and dead cells were analyzed under the light microscope and only the dead cells appeared blue as shown in fig 8 b q 3 6 inactivation of microorganisms in sewage wastewater by eo treatment to show the commercial aspect of this technology a batch set up for the eo treatment of sewage wastewater was done the successful 100 inactivation of all the microorganisms in the sewage wastewater was achieved within 8 min at an applied current density of 2 38 ma cm2 with a nacl dose of 1 0 g this was due to rcs generation leading to the membrane disruption and complete inactivation of all the microorganisms further to confirm the complete inactivation of microorganisms the treated sewage sample was plated on luria agar plates and the no of colonies cfu ml was analyzed as shown in fig 9 a l thus it can be concluded that the mmo anodes are efficient at low current density and minimum nacl concentration for eo treatment of sewage wastewater 3 7 durability studies mmo electrodes practical feasibility on the pilot scale in the eo process depends on their stability durability and recyclability in the present study efforts have been made to check the durability of electrodes in terms of the number of recycles and the inactivation efficacy of microbes the mmo electrodes were successfully used for 80 cycles without any drastic change in their inactivation efficacy as shown in fig 9 m the high durability of mmo electrodes in this study was due to the minimum concentration of electrolytes at lower values of current density further the stability of the electrodes after 80 cycles was confirmed by fe sem eds mapping xrd and raman spectroscopy as discussed in section 3 1 3 8 operating cost analysis the total cost of the treatment process for the inactivation of bacteria from the simulated wastewater using mmo anodes was approximated through this study the cost of electrodes was 9 43 and the total operating cost for bacterial removal per run was 0 117 m3 tentative which is comparatively less than the previously reported studies 65 67 68 the results showed that the eo process is economically feasible for simulated wastewater treatment as depicted in table 1 further the cost of such a treatment process can be reduced during the scale up studies by modifying the reactor s operating condition and design 3 9 significant findings the significant findings of the present study are summarized in table 2 4 conclusion the eo treatment of simulated wastewater solution with mmo leads to the complete inactivation of microbes at a low current density range of 1 19 11 90 ma cm2 with reduced treatment time even the eo treatment of actual sewage water at an applied current density of 2 38 ma cm2 and nacl dose of 1 0 g within 8 min leads to the complete inactivation of microbes the maximum inactivation was due to a indirect oxidation with highly oxidant species like clo hocl h2o2 oh etc b oxidation via hydroxyl radicals which are in situ electrochemically generated on the surface of the anode and c direct oxidation of compound and it is intermediated on the surface of the anode these rcs and oh species produced during electrolysis destroy the bacteria and lead to disinfection of simulated wastewater thus ros generation causes the inactivation of the bacterial cell at optimized conditions 100 inactivation of bacteria was achieved the characterization studies of mmo through fe sem eds mapping xrd and raman shift have proved electrodes durability and efficacy even after 80 cycles the results obtained have established the effectiveness of the eo process in the treatment of simulated and actual sewage water the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 i v curves for mmo anode at

composition of the purchased mmo anodes were done using fe sem field emission scanning electron microscopy along with eds mapping energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy nova nano sem 450 jfei company of usa sea pte ltd the crystalline structure of the mmo anodes was characterized by xrd x ray diffraction using the x pert diffractometer from 2 theta 2theta 90o raman spectra were obtained for mmo anodes on a confocal raman spectrometer lab ram hr evolution horiba at 532 nm the bacterial images were recorded by an upright light microscope supertek 52 2 3 sample preparation the simulated wastewater was prepared by dissolving 3 5 g potassium acetate 400 mg sodium sulfate and 5 ml glacial acetic acid in 1 l of double distilled water the bacterial culture was grown by inoculating 1 2 μl of the bacterial strain in luria broth then the bacterial strain with a concentration of 104 cells ml i e 3 ml was inoculated according to the absorbance range of about 0 8 1 nm in the simulated fluid the concentration of sodium chloride varied according to the reaction the sample solution was freshly prepared for every experiment 2 4 experimental setup the eo treatment of the simulated wastewater was carried out in a glass beaker having a volume of 300 ml under the batch conditions as shown in fig 1 the electrodes used in the present study are mmo which is composed of titanium sheet coated with the metal oxides of tio2 iro2 ruo2 pt and were purchased from tiaano pvt ltd chennai india whereas cathode was made up of stainless steel purchased from aar kay deepak steels pvt ltd mohali india both cathode and anode dimensions were the same 70 mm 70 mm 1 mm the inter electrode spacing between the two electrodes was 20 mm the current density was maintained for each experiment by a dc supply procured from gayatri engineers maharashtra india model 0 30 v 0 2 a the reactor was kept over a magnetic stirrer at 500 600 rpm for homogeneity of the reaction throughout the experiment 3 2 5 experimental procedure the eo treatment of the simulated wastewater containing the microorganisms was carried out under galvanostatic conditions all the experiments were carried out at room temperature i e 25 c the ph range of the sample solution was set according to the experimental reaction by using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh the conductivity of the solution was maintained by using nacl as a supporting electrolyte the initial conductivity of the solution was around 2 72 ms after a specific times interval 200 μl of the sample volume was taken and was inoculated into 5 ml of luria broth solution in a test tube the test tubes containing the sample volume were incubated in a bod incubator for 24 h after 24 h the samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically at 600 nm after each experimental run the electrodes were washed by dipping in a 5 h2so4 solution 53 it was observed that the inactivation of the microorganisms was complete within a short time thus the efficacy of the eo process was to prove the inactivation of microorganisms in the simulated wastewater all the experiments were performed three times to ensure the reproducibility of the results the mean value has been quoted in the study and the standard deviation value is represented in bar graphs where ever required 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of anodes 3 1 1 fe sem eds analysis fe sem analysis was done to analyze the structural and surface morphology of the mmo anodes at the same time eds was performed to study the elemental composition of the different metal oxides coated on the surface of the anode the sem images for the freshly coated and recycled mmo anodes are depicted in fig 2 a b the sem images of both fresh and recycled anodes showed almost similar surface characteristics even after eighty experimental runs the electrode structure is comparatively porous and smooth with increased surface area and small cracks due to oxides of titanium ruthenium iridium and platinum in the ti sheet thereby preventing the electrodes from rusting thus increasing the stability of electrodes for a longer time 54 further the platinum content adds to more roughness and capacity in mmo anodes the protrusive peaks of ru ir pt ti and o in the recycled mmo as shown in fig 2 b confirm the anodes durability after 80 cycles the eds illustrates the atomic concentration of metals present in the oxide mixture which was almost similar for both the fresh and recycled mmo samples as shown in fig 2 a b hence it establishes that mmos are stable even after eighty recycles the elemental mapping of both fresh and recycled mmo anodes was also performed as shown in fig 2 c n 3 1 2 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction study was performed for the fresh and recycled mmo as shown in fig 3 xrd analysis was done to study the crystalline structures of metal oxide coated on the titanium sheet from the results oxides of ru ir pt and ti in the rutile structure of mmo were observed the prominent peaks of the metal oxides of ru ir pt and ti were also seen in the recycled mmo thus assuring all the metals intactness after eighty experimental runs it was also observed that there were some differences in the metal peaks from their original location due to the loss of some metal s volume during 80 cycles the diffraction peaks of titanium dioxide jcpds card 01 088 1172 titanium jcpds card 01 089 5009 iridium oxide jcpds card 01 086 0330 platinum oxide jcpds card 01 075 0978 and ruthenium oxide jcpds card 01 073 1469 were also determined any extra peak in the recycled mmo indicates some ionic species due to electrolytes in earlier literature nearly similar peaks are reported 55 57 3 1 3 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy study for both the fresh and recycled mmo was done to affirm the presence of the different oxides as shown in fig 4 the presence of peaks at around 133 cm 1 was of tio2 58 525 cm 1 of ruo2 728 cm 1 of iro2 59 and at 1600 cm 1 of pt 60 the raman spectrum for the recycled mmo was almost similar to that of the fresh mmo as shown in fig 4 it was also observed that there was a raman shift in the metal peaks of ruo2 and iro2 from their original location due to the loss of metal s volume from the outer layer of recycled mmo during 80 cycles thus establishing the fact that the composition of mmo is heterogeneous thus concluding that the addition of oxides of ti ir pt and ru metals has increased the durability of electrodes for a more extended period 3 1 4 cyclic voltammetry cv the cv experiments were performed to characterize the electrochemical activity of the mmo electrode as shown in the supplementary information file fig s1 the experiment was performed with saturated calomel as a reference electrode and platinum as a counter electrode with a scanning rate of 500 mv s the full cv of the mmo anode was recorded in the potential range of 1 0 to 0 5 v as it can be seen that an oxidation peak at around 18 ma was observed for cycle 1 but for cycles 20 40 60 and 80 the oxidation peaks were stable at 25 ma thus concluding the stability and durability of mmo anodes even after 80 cycles the cv experiments were performed to characterize the electrochemical activity of the mmo electrode as shown in the supplementary information file fig s1 the experiment was performed with saturated calomel as a reference electrode and platinum as a counter electrode with a scanning rate of 500 mv s the full cv of the mmo anode was recorded in the potential range of 1 0 to 0 5 v as it can be seen that an oxidation peak at around 18 ma was observed for cycle 1 but for cycles 20 40 60 and 80 the oxidation peaks were stable at 25 ma thus concluding the stability and durability of mmo anodes even after 80 cycles 3 2 preliminary study the preliminary tests were carried out to confirm the eo process s efficacy and establish the boundary conditions shown in fig 5 a b the first experiment was carried out with only electrolytes present in the reactor and no current was supplied it was found that with no current involvement in the eo setup containing the simulated wastewater no reduction in the bacterial count was observed as shown in fig 5 a this might be because of no generation of oxidative species like oh o3 ho2 and chloro oxidant species which are dependent on current density even the electron transfer capacity is also reliable in the application of current as a result no inactivation of bacteria was seen the maximum percentage inactivation of bacteria observed was around 10 after 10 min of reaction time the following experiment was performed when the only current was applied with no electrolyte nacl concentration since no electrolyte was added there was no production of rcs such as free chlorine cl2 hocl clo and chlorine radical species cl cl2 also ros including oh were not formed during the electrochemical splitting of water which can strengthen the overall electrooxidation efficacy 61 62 as a result no inactivation of bacteria in the simulated wastewater was observed the maximum percentage inactivation observed was around 6 after 10 min as shown in fig 5 b 3 3 effect of process parameters 3 3 1 effect of current density on inactivation of bacteria one of the significant factors in deciding eo s process economy for bacteria s inactivation is the current density it was observed that when the current density was increased the production rate of chloro oxidant species was also increased 63 in this study the current density range varied from 1 19 ma cm2 to 11 90 ma cm2 to see the inactivation of microbes it inactivated all the bacteria by applying a minimum current density of 2 380 ma cm2 for 2 min an optimized current density range for the complete inactivation of all eight bacteria is shown in fig 6 a d the inactivation of all eight bacteria taken in this study was possibly due to membrane disruption caused by milliampere current 64 due to this membrane disruption there was an influx of toxic substances causing cell death it can be concluded that the bactericidal effect was due to interactions between the bacteria the medium and the electrode material 64 it can be seen from fig 6 e that there was no inactivation of microbes at 1 19 ma cm2 even after 5 min but at other current densities range of 11 90 7 14 4 76 and 2 38 ma cm2 inactivation was observed within 2 min the percentage inactivation of bacteria at these current density ranges was 100 thus establishing that mmo shows better efficacy and is more stable at small current densities 3 3 2 effect of electrolyte nacl concentration on inactivation of bacteria the electrolyte concentration plays a crucial role in making the eo process efficient in inactivating bacteria it determines the formation of reactive chlorine species such as hclo clo etc higher the amount of nacl concentration more rcs will be produced leading to an increase in the percentage inactivation of bacteria at the same time it was observed that fouling and rusting of electrodes occur at high nacl concentrations by considering this the electrolyte concentration range varied from 0 5 to 3 0 g for this study it has been observed that the mmo anodes prevent fouling by stimulating direct oxidation along with mediated oxidation 65 the original ph of the simulated wastewater solution in this study was around 4 45 at an acidic ph range the rate of adsorption of oh is high on anodes leading to direct oxidation at the anode the production of hocl oxidative species was maximal over other oxidative species like clo and cl2 thus leading to indirect oxidation on anodes the optimum amount of nacl concentration should be taken for the stability of electrodes an optimized range of nacl dose for the complete inactivation of all eight bacteria is shown in fig 7 a e at different electrolyte concentrations of 0 5 g 0 8 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 100 inactivation of all the eight bacteria was observed in 2 min of reaction time 3 4 analysis of bacterial cell damage by potassium ion leakage the outer membrane of bacteria acts as a barrier to the permeability of intracellular substances the eo treatment could damage the cell wall and the outer membrane of bacteria by rcs leading to an increase in the permeability and leakage of k ions from the cell 66 the permeability of the cell membrane was studied by examining the potassium ion leakage before and after eo treatment of the cell there was a gradual increase of k concentration after a treatment time of 2 min from 35 mg l to 65 mg l in e coli and from 35 mg l to 50 mg l in the case of b subtilis as shown in fig 8 a the total k concentration was released entirely when the bacteria were completely inactivated after a treatment time of 2 min this suggested that the membrane permeability was completely disrupted after the 100 inactivation of bacteria 3 5 analysis of bacterial inactivation by vital staining the simulated wastewater having eight different bacteria was further analyzed before and after eo treatment through vital staining by trypan blue dye trypan blue stain is exclusively used to stain the dead cells as live cells have an intact cell membrane the trypan blue cannot pass through the cell membrane and the cytoplasm as the eo treatment damages the cell membrane of bacteria by rcs the trypan blue can pass through the porous membrane and enter the cytoplasm both the live and dead cells were analyzed under the light microscope and only the dead cells appeared blue as shown in fig 8 b q 3 6 inactivation of microorganisms in sewage wastewater by eo treatment to show the commercial aspect of this technology a batch set up for the eo treatment of sewage wastewater was done the successful 100 inactivation of all the microorganisms in the sewage wastewater was achieved within 8 min at an applied current density of 2 38 ma cm2 with a nacl dose of 1 0 g this was due to rcs generation leading to the membrane disruption and complete inactivation of all the microorganisms further to confirm the complete inactivation of microorganisms the treated sewage sample was plated on luria agar plates and the no of colonies cfu ml was analyzed as shown in fig 9 a l thus it can be concluded that the mmo anodes are efficient at low current density and minimum nacl concentration for eo treatment of sewage wastewater 3 7 durability studies mmo electrodes practical feasibility on the pilot scale in the eo process depends on their stability durability and recyclability in the present study efforts have been made to check the durability of electrodes in terms of the number of recycles and the inactivation efficacy of microbes the mmo electrodes were successfully used for 80 cycles without any drastic change in their inactivation efficacy as shown in fig 9 m the high durability of mmo electrodes in this study was due to the minimum concentration of electrolytes at lower values of current density further the stability of the electrodes after 80 cycles was confirmed by fe sem eds mapping xrd and raman spectroscopy as discussed in section 3 1 3 8 operating cost analysis the total cost of the treatment process for the inactivation of bacteria from the simulated wastewater using mmo anodes was approximated through this study the cost of electrodes was 9 43 and the total operating cost for bacterial removal per run was 0 117 m3 tentative which is comparatively less than the previously reported studies 65 67 68 the results showed that the eo process is economically feasible for simulated wastewater treatment as depicted in table 1 further the cost of such a treatment process can be reduced during the scale up studies by modifying the reactor s operating condition and design 3 9 significant findings the significant findings of the present study are summarized in table 2 4 conclusion the eo treatment of simulated wastewater solution with mmo leads to the complete inactivation of microbes at a low current density range of 1 19 11 90 ma cm2 with reduced treatment time even the eo treatment of actual sewage water at an applied current density of 2 38 ma cm2 and nacl dose of 1 0 g within 8 min leads to the complete inactivation of microbes the maximum inactivation was due to a indirect oxidation with highly oxidant species like clo hocl h2o2 oh etc b oxidation via hydroxyl radicals which are in situ electrochemically generated on the surface of the anode and c direct oxidation of compound and it is intermediated on the surface of the anode these rcs and oh species produced during electrolysis destroy the bacteria and lead to disinfection of simulated wastewater thus ros generation causes the inactivation of the bacterial cell at optimized conditions 100 inactivation of bacteria was achieved the characterization studies of mmo through fe sem eds mapping xrd and raman shift have proved electrodes durability and efficacy even after 80 cycles the results obtained have established the effectiveness of the eo process in the treatment of simulated and actual sewage water the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 i v curves for mmo anode at

12886,in this study we have examined a new all organic conditioning method for sewage sludge pretreatment featuring the combined use of poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdmd and tannic acid ta the impact of the reagents and the specific dosing order were identified for process optimization results showed that ta pdmd mode i e ta addition followed by pdmd has better sludge filterability and dewaterability with the optimal dosage it decreased specific resistance of filtration by 90 60 capillary suction time by 65 08 and reduced moisture content of dewatered sludge cake to 53 46 giving the highest dewatering performance reported so far in addition a significant positive correlation was found between viscosity and dehydration performance rp 0 9898 p 0 05 the explanation was the enhanced interparticle interaction and structural strength indicated by higher apparent viscosity and yield stress thixotropic hysteresis loop solid like viscoelastic property and higher fractal dimension df value as well the enhanced compressibility 0 69 versus 1 06 of raw sludge and sem image further confirmed the compact and permeable structure of the conditioned sludge and for dosing order it was proved that ta first conditioning method led to full reaction of protein precipitation which produced increasingly compact flocs consequently in conclusion the floc property played an important role in condensed sludge formation and in deep dewatering process which offset the side effect of undesirably higher equilibrium viscosity of the conditioned sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sewage sludge co conditioning deep dewatering viscosity compressibility 1 introduction sewage sludge which contains various toxic substances including pathogens heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants is an inevitable by product of the biological treatment units in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 2 large amounts of sewage sludge may pose a huge threat to natural environment as well as human society without appropriate disposal 2 commonly applied technologies for sludge disposal include anaerobic aerobic digestion incineration and landfill 3 in all these methods sludge dewatering functions as an essential pre post treatment for sludge volume minimization transportation facilitation and calorific value increase as well 4 5 therefore after dewatering the sludge cake with little moisture content mc is always recommended furthermore mechanical dewatering technologies such as centrifuge belt press and filter press should be the prior choice in reducing moisture content otherwise the influence of the wet weather would be huge when adopting natural drying method 6 7 and the energy consumption would be high during artificial desiccation process 8 9 considering the high heat capacity and the latent heat of evaporation of water molecules 10 however because of the highly complicated composition of sludge it turned out that in industrial practice mechanical dewatering can at best reduce the moisture content to 85 with no effective pretreatment conditioning involved 11 12 the existing pretreatment technologies have three main categories physical chemical and biological as suggested by sina et al an optimal solution should make a balance between the operational and economic objectives in wwtps 9 only those methods with both lower investment operational cost and high conditioning efficacy turned out to have the highest fitness and feasibility in practice therefore the reagent based chemical conditioning methods i e the use of efficient and cost effective substances including coagulant flocculant filtration aid or their combined usage have always been the most popular choice selected for the sludge pretreatment initially lime and coagulants mostly metal salts such as aluminum al and iron fe species were widely used for sludge treatment nonetheless inorganic reagents have long been criticized for the high consumption large amount of residue in sludge cake and the threat of corrosion to incineration facilities 13 thus there is an urgent need to investigate the feasibility of all organic method in sludge treatment among the typical organic polymers poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmd in short has drawn much attention in sludge conditioning because of its function of charge neutralization and particle flocculation 13 xiao et al applied pdmd to agglomerate fine particles in pre oxidized sludge for dewaterability enhancement and finally achieved a moisture content mc at 73 16 14 in addition a natural polyphenolic compound tannic acid ta was reported to have the capacity to precipitate proteins 15 as a major component of the sludge protein accounts for more than 40 of the sludge extracellular polymeric substances eps which wraps water and impedes it to flow out during dewatering and causes poor dewaterability of wasted activated sludge was 16 liu et al identified a significant negative correlation between was dewaterability and extracellular proteins 17 against this backdrop in theory the combined usage of pdmd and ta could offset the incompetence of pdmd alone for extracellular protein stabilization and improve the dewatering efficiency of the co conditioning technique in practice it still remains unknown whether the combined organic reagents could enhance sludge dewaterability to optimize the co conditioning process we respectively investigated the dose dependent performance under no conditioning pre treatment pdmd ta treatment p t mode in short and ta pdmd treatment t p mode in short furthermore the mechanisms and key factors involved in the deep dewatering performance were also identified and discussed based on floc property variations of the sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and chemicals the was was obtained from wusong wastewater treatment plant located in shanghai china the sampling point was at the discharge valve of the sludge thickener the raw sludge rs was stored in refrigerator at 4 c all the experiments employed in this study were carried out within 1 week the main characteristics of the sludge are listed in table 1 all these data were obtained through laboratory test and further analyses at length were given in section 2 3 pdmd was in commercial grade characterized by an aqueous solution with purity at 40 charge density at 100 and molecular weight at 100 kda in addition the analytical grade tannic acid ta c76h52o46 96 0 was supplied by thermo fisher scientific co ltd shanghai china 2 2 sludge conditioning tests in each conditioning test the rs was first homogenized and aliquoted to 150 ml either ta or pdmd was injected into the beaker containing sludge which was stirred at 250 rpm for 4 min then the other reagent was added into the same beaker to be stirred at the same speed for 4 min too the conditioned sludge was used for dewaterability identification before being compressed by an mmp 3 2 micro filter press afmitech netherlands 18 finally the impacts of the conditioners the amount of their dosage as well as the dosing order on dewatering performance of the two different conditioning modes i e p t or t p mode and rs were investigated and compared 2 3 analytical procedure 2 3 1 sludge dewaterability cst mc and srf capillary suction time cst was tested by a handy 304b cst appliance triton uk the moisture content mc of the retained sludge cake was recorded on the hc103 moisture analyzer mettler toledo switzerland specific resistance to filtration srf was measured by the vacuum filtration method 19 additionally 150 ml sludge samples all went through a standard 9 cm brinell funnel embedded with a pre moistened filtering paper then the sludge was filtered under constant vacuum pressure 0 05 mpa until the vacuum was broken the filtrate volume was recorded every 10 s srf value was calculated according to eq 1 1 srf 2 p a 2 b μω where srf cm g refers to the specific resistance of sludge p pa refers to the filtration pressure a cm2 refers to the filter area μ pa s refers to the filtrate viscosity ω g cm3 refers to the mass of the cake solids on filter paper from every unit volume of the filtrate and b s cm6 was calculated based on the slope of the time of filtration to the volume of filtrate t v versus the filtrate volume v 2 3 2 sludge properties ts and vs of the sludge were determined through the standard methods 20 viscosity was measured via a rotary viscometer ndj8s lichen tech china zeta potential was obtained via zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 3000hs malvern uk size distribution and fractal dimension df of sludge particles were determined by a mastersizer 3000 malvern uk through light scattering method 21 extracellular protein pn in extracellular polymeric substances eps was evaluated by lowry folin technique using bovine serum albumin bsa as the criterion 22 after being freeze dried and coated with gold the sludge samples went through a field emission scanning electron microscope sem analyzer phenom g2 pro phenom scientific netherlands for the identification of their surface morphology 2 3 3 rheological tests rheological performance of the sludge was evaluated by a rotary rheometer haake mars60 thermo scientific germany considering that the wall slip effect was prone to overshadow rheological tests 23 24 we employed rough internal surface of the measurement cell to avoid wall slip 25 26 in the controlled shear rate csr test rheograms and the apparent viscosity of the sludge samples were recorded for further calculation of flowability as well as thixotropic property the shear rate increased from 1 to 1000 s 1 and then fell back from 1000 to 1 s 1 in a linear manner the herschel bulkley model eq 2 was used to process rheological data for the method was previously shown to be effective in describing sludge rheology 27 2 τ k γ n τ y in eq 2 τ and τy respectively refers to the shear stress and yield stress pa γ refers to the shear rate s 1 k refers to the consistency index pa sn which indicates the average firmness of the samples and n is the flow behavior index in dynamic measurement the strain amplitude sweep sas test was used to determine the linear viscoelastic lve range and to explore the viscoelastic properties of the sludge during the whole test the strain amplitude was logarithmically raised from 0 01 to 1000 in a sinusoidal manner at a steady frequency of 1 hz 3 results and discussion 3 1 dose dependent effect of the conditioners on sludge dewaterability to avoid the overdose effect of the coagulant flocculant in the sludge co conditioning process pdmd was taken as an individual conditioner reagent for pre testing and the optimum dosage was herein obtained at 2 w w of ts as shown in fig s1 in the co conditioning process based on this fixed dosage both srf and cst values decreased rapidly and then increased gradually as ta increased fig 1 both parameters reached their lowest points when ta dosage was at 2 in addition the dosing order of the two conditioners also made a difference as shown in figs 1a and b within the dosage range the srf and cst values of the sludge in the t p mode were lower than those in the p t mode with optimal amounts of ta and pdmd added in t p mode conditioning the srf value decreased from 4 14 1011 cm g rs to 3 89 1010 cm g and cst from 75 9 s rs to 26 5 s this result proved that the conditioned sludge had significantly better filterability than the raw sludge to conclude the co conditioning method managed to improve the sludge filterability tremendously with very limited consumption of the conditioners which is inconsistent with previously reported results claiming that enhanced dewaterability was always accompanied by increasing ta addition 15 moisture content mc of the sludge cake is regarded as the most direct index to evaluate sludge dewaterability in this study a micro filter press was employed for sludge pressure filtration under 0 8 mpa for 15 min which could simulate the actual state of the plate and frame filter in wwtps 18 for raw sludge it was definitely difficult to get well shaped sludge cake because the fine sludge particles would easily leak out of the mesh resulting in ultra thin sludge sheet or get stuck inside resulting in runny yolks structure in the sludge cake after co conditioning treatment however well preserved sludge cake could be obtained with either conditioning mode in addition the mc of the sludge cake in the t p mode was lower than that in the p t mode within the dosage range fig 1c with the optimal dosage the mc content of the formed cake respectively decreased to 57 71 in the p t mode and 53 46 in t p mode usually after treatment with oxidation coagulation and flocculation alone mc could be reduced to only about 70 80 28 even after some combined triple conditioner treatment such as oxidation flocculation and biochar persulfate coagulation treatment mc only reached its lowest point at 58 51 29 comparatively our mc after co conditioning 53 46 verified the remarkably high efficiency of the ta pdmd based pre treatment technique 3 2 changes of floc property after co conditioning under most circumstances a lower viscosity is preferred during the dewatering process as it means less flow resistance 30 however the viscosity of the co conditioned sludges in this study increased after the p t and t p treatment fig 2 which was contradictory to the reported results 31 in addition taking fig 1c into consideration we can find that the highest viscosity was achieved when pdmd and ta dosage reached their critical dose points 2 for pdmd and 2 for ta also we can identify a significant positive correlation between viscosity and dehydration performance table s1 in this context it is legitimate to suggest that there should be some important elements to offset the adverse effects caused by high sludge viscosity to make detailed illustration of the flowability characteristics of the conditioned sludge when the conditioners were at their optimal points we recorded rheograms of the shear stress fig 3a and apparent viscosity fig 3b in the sludge samples with different dosing orders in addition the herschel bulkley equation was adopted to accurately identify their shear thinning behavior and to analyze the non newtonian characteristics as shown in table s2 the value of n increased from 0 3449 to 0 3717 and that of the yield stress τy from 1 5098 pa to 1 9757 pa these results showed that non newtonian characteristics were strengthened and the internal structure of the conditioned sludge was enhanced with the t p mode having stronger effect than the p t mode varying viscosity is the rheological indication of flow induced structural changes if the changes are reversible and time dependent the effect is called thixotropy 32 as shown in figs 3a and b during the stress recovery process an obvious hysteresis loop was observed in both co conditioned sludge samples indicating that a larger amount of time was needed for the sludge flocs to recover their structures the hysteresis loop implied obvious thixotropic effect found in the conditioned sludge 32 34 taking into account all these indicators including higher apparent viscosity strengthened yield stress and significant thixotropic property its reasonable for us to speculate that the colloidal force between particles interparticle interaction was greatly strengthened the after co conditioning treatment which in turn required a larger amount of time for micro structure recovery 35 36 in terms of the viscoelastic property fig 3c the two curves of elastic modulus g and viscous modulus g which reflected the structural strength and deformative energy of sludge samples during the shear process showed similar evolutionary tendencies in the lve range the elastic behavior dominated the viscous modulus suggesting a solid like property and certain rigidity of the conditioned sludge 13 as the dosing order switched from the p t to the t p mode both g and g increased moreover the value of the complex modulus g further increased from 31 24 pa in the p t mode to 49 03 pa in the t p mode indicating that the conditioned sludge in the t p mode had a more robust inner structure to resist deformation than the p t mode df reflects the structural properties of an aggregate from geometry with its value varying between 1 a linear aggregate and 3 a compact or space filling form higher fractal dimension means the components of the sludge system are increasingly compact 21 in fig 3d the fractal dimensions of co conditioned sludge samples 1 96 in the p t mode and 2 02 in the t p mode were relatively higher than that of the raw sludge 1 91 indicating that the network structure of the sludge was essentially strengthened by contrast the pam conditioned sludge basically remained unchanged df of 1 94 to conclude df variation was consistent with that of the transient and dynamic rheological properties i e flowability and elastic property which re confirmed the existence of stronger inner structure in co conditioned sludge especially in the t p conditioning mode in addition to rheological properties the variation of perceptible compressibility s was also examined between different conditioning modes as shown in fig 4 the compressibility of the raw sludge was 1 06 after co conditioning the sludge compressibility decreased significantly to 0 84 the p t mode and 0 69 in the t p mode by comparison the compressibility of the cationic pam conditioned sludge was 1 04 at best fig s2 which explained why the cationic pam conditioned sludge deformed easily and consequently blocked the cake filter during the compression process 37 the impacts of different conditioning methods on the sludge particle structure were also demonstrated by the sem image as shown in fig s3 irregular rs flocs aggregated to form sludge clusters after conditioning treatment and the flocs with larger size have a higher possibility of formation fig s4 furthermore fig s3 also emphasizes the difference between coagulants flocculants the floc aggregates after co conditioning treatment were clearly more compact and denser than those in the raw and pam conditioned sludge in addition the co conditioned sludge flocs were more porous figs s3e and f representing excellent water permeability and water removal performance during the pressure depression process 3 3 mechanism analysis and key factor identification according to previously reported results enhanced sludge dewaterability was frequently coupled with eps degradation and weakened intermolecular force 38 complete degradation of organic matter is ideally desirable for the enhancement of sludge dewaterability however in this study the continuous decrease of protein content did not lead to increasingly enhanced sludge dewaterability fig s5 instead the improved dewatering performance in this study was attributed to enhanced interparticle interaction and the following structural strength we can verify the result from fractal transient and dynamic rheological perspective it is thus supposed that compact flocs were very likely to be the key factor for condensed structure formation in the sludge cake which explained the inconsistency between eps content and sludge dewaterability in this study in this context it is reasonable to interpret the increment of viscosity as the symbol of stronger interparticle force instead of the obstacle to sludge dewatering 39 also the mechanism of the optimal conditioning method

12886,in this study we have examined a new all organic conditioning method for sewage sludge pretreatment featuring the combined use of poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdmd and tannic acid ta the impact of the reagents and the specific dosing order were identified for process optimization results showed that ta pdmd mode i e ta addition followed by pdmd has better sludge filterability and dewaterability with the optimal dosage it decreased specific resistance of filtration by 90 60 capillary suction time by 65 08 and reduced moisture content of dewatered sludge cake to 53 46 giving the highest dewatering performance reported so far in addition a significant positive correlation was found between viscosity and dehydration performance rp 0 9898 p 0 05 the explanation was the enhanced interparticle interaction and structural strength indicated by higher apparent viscosity and yield stress thixotropic hysteresis loop solid like viscoelastic property and higher fractal dimension df value as well the enhanced compressibility 0 69 versus 1 06 of raw sludge and sem image further confirmed the compact and permeable structure of the conditioned sludge and for dosing order it was proved that ta first conditioning method led to full reaction of protein precipitation which produced increasingly compact flocs consequently in conclusion the floc property played an important role in condensed sludge formation and in deep dewatering process which offset the side effect of undesirably higher equilibrium viscosity of the conditioned sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sewage sludge co conditioning deep dewatering viscosity compressibility 1 introduction sewage sludge which contains various toxic substances including pathogens heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants is an inevitable by product of the biological treatment units in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 2 large amounts of sewage sludge may pose a huge threat to natural environment as well as human society without appropriate disposal 2 commonly applied technologies for sludge disposal include anaerobic aerobic digestion incineration and landfill 3 in all these methods sludge dewatering functions as an essential pre post treatment for sludge volume minimization transportation facilitation and calorific value increase as well 4 5 therefore after dewatering the sludge cake with little moisture content mc is always recommended furthermore mechanical dewatering technologies such as centrifuge belt press and filter press should be the prior choice in reducing moisture content otherwise the influence of the wet weather would be huge when adopting natural drying method 6 7 and the energy consumption would be high during artificial desiccation process 8 9 considering the high heat capacity and the latent heat of evaporation of water molecules 10 however because of the highly complicated composition of sludge it turned out that in industrial practice mechanical dewatering can at best reduce the moisture content to 85 with no effective pretreatment conditioning involved 11 12 the existing pretreatment technologies have three main categories physical chemical and biological as suggested by sina et al an optimal solution should make a balance between the operational and economic objectives in wwtps 9 only those methods with both lower investment operational cost and high conditioning efficacy turned out to have the highest fitness and feasibility in practice therefore the reagent based chemical conditioning methods i e the use of efficient and cost effective substances including coagulant flocculant filtration aid or their combined usage have always been the most popular choice selected for the sludge pretreatment initially lime and coagulants mostly metal salts such as aluminum al and iron fe species were widely used for sludge treatment nonetheless inorganic reagents have long been criticized for the high consumption large amount of residue in sludge cake and the threat of corrosion to incineration facilities 13 thus there is an urgent need to investigate the feasibility of all organic method in sludge treatment among the typical organic polymers poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmd in short has drawn much attention in sludge conditioning because of its function of charge neutralization and particle flocculation 13 xiao et al applied pdmd to agglomerate fine particles in pre oxidized sludge for dewaterability enhancement and finally achieved a moisture content mc at 73 16 14 in addition a natural polyphenolic compound tannic acid ta was reported to have the capacity to precipitate proteins 15 as a major component of the sludge protein accounts for more than 40 of the sludge extracellular polymeric substances eps which wraps water and impedes it to flow out during dewatering and causes poor dewaterability of wasted activated sludge was 16 liu et al identified a significant negative correlation between was dewaterability and extracellular proteins 17 against this backdrop in theory the combined usage of pdmd and ta could offset the incompetence of pdmd alone for extracellular protein stabilization and improve the dewatering efficiency of the co conditioning technique in practice it still remains unknown whether the combined organic reagents could enhance sludge dewaterability to optimize the co conditioning process we respectively investigated the dose dependent performance under no conditioning pre treatment pdmd ta treatment p t mode in short and ta pdmd treatment t p mode in short furthermore the mechanisms and key factors involved in the deep dewatering performance were also identified and discussed based on floc property variations of the sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and chemicals the was was obtained from wusong wastewater treatment plant located in shanghai china the sampling point was at the discharge valve of the sludge thickener the raw sludge rs was stored in refrigerator at 4 c all the experiments employed in this study were carried out within 1 week the main characteristics of the sludge are listed in table 1 all these data were obtained through laboratory test and further analyses at length were given in section 2 3 pdmd was in commercial grade characterized by an aqueous solution with purity at 40 charge density at 100 and molecular weight at 100 kda in addition the analytical grade tannic acid ta c76h52o46 96 0 was supplied by thermo fisher scientific co ltd shanghai china 2 2 sludge conditioning tests in each conditioning test the rs was first homogenized and aliquoted to 150 ml either ta or pdmd was injected into the beaker containing sludge which was stirred at 250 rpm for 4 min then the other reagent was added into the same beaker to be stirred at the same speed for 4 min too the conditioned sludge was used for dewaterability identification before being compressed by an mmp 3 2 micro filter press afmitech netherlands 18 finally the impacts of the conditioners the amount of their dosage as well as the dosing order on dewatering performance of the two different conditioning modes i e p t or t p mode and rs were investigated and compared 2 3 analytical procedure 2 3 1 sludge dewaterability cst mc and srf capillary suction time cst was tested by a handy 304b cst appliance triton uk the moisture content mc of the retained sludge cake was recorded on the hc103 moisture analyzer mettler toledo switzerland specific resistance to filtration srf was measured by the vacuum filtration method 19 additionally 150 ml sludge samples all went through a standard 9 cm brinell funnel embedded with a pre moistened filtering paper then the sludge was filtered under constant vacuum pressure 0 05 mpa until the vacuum was broken the filtrate volume was recorded every 10 s srf value was calculated according to eq 1 1 srf 2 p a 2 b μω where srf cm g refers to the specific resistance of sludge p pa refers to the filtration pressure a cm2 refers to the filter area μ pa s refers to the filtrate viscosity ω g cm3 refers to the mass of the cake solids on filter paper from every unit volume of the filtrate and b s cm6 was calculated based on the slope of the time of filtration to the volume of filtrate t v versus the filtrate volume v 2 3 2 sludge properties ts and vs of the sludge were determined through the standard methods 20 viscosity was measured via a rotary viscometer ndj8s lichen tech china zeta potential was obtained via zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 3000hs malvern uk size distribution and fractal dimension df of sludge particles were determined by a mastersizer 3000 malvern uk through light scattering method 21 extracellular protein pn in extracellular polymeric substances eps was evaluated by lowry folin technique using bovine serum albumin bsa as the criterion 22 after being freeze dried and coated with gold the sludge samples went through a field emission scanning electron microscope sem analyzer phenom g2 pro phenom scientific netherlands for the identification of their surface morphology 2 3 3 rheological tests rheological performance of the sludge was evaluated by a rotary rheometer haake mars60 thermo scientific germany considering that the wall slip effect was prone to overshadow rheological tests 23 24 we employed rough internal surface of the measurement cell to avoid wall slip 25 26 in the controlled shear rate csr test rheograms and the apparent viscosity of the sludge samples were recorded for further calculation of flowability as well as thixotropic property the shear rate increased from 1 to 1000 s 1 and then fell back from 1000 to 1 s 1 in a linear manner the herschel bulkley model eq 2 was used to process rheological data for the method was previously shown to be effective in describing sludge rheology 27 2 τ k γ n τ y in eq 2 τ and τy respectively refers to the shear stress and yield stress pa γ refers to the shear rate s 1 k refers to the consistency index pa sn which indicates the average firmness of the samples and n is the flow behavior index in dynamic measurement the strain amplitude sweep sas test was used to determine the linear viscoelastic lve range and to explore the viscoelastic properties of the sludge during the whole test the strain amplitude was logarithmically raised from 0 01 to 1000 in a sinusoidal manner at a steady frequency of 1 hz 3 results and discussion 3 1 dose dependent effect of the conditioners on sludge dewaterability to avoid the overdose effect of the coagulant flocculant in the sludge co conditioning process pdmd was taken as an individual conditioner reagent for pre testing and the optimum dosage was herein obtained at 2 w w of ts as shown in fig s1 in the co conditioning process based on this fixed dosage both srf and cst values decreased rapidly and then increased gradually as ta increased fig 1 both parameters reached their lowest points when ta dosage was at 2 in addition the dosing order of the two conditioners also made a difference as shown in figs 1a and b within the dosage range the srf and cst values of the sludge in the t p mode were lower than those in the p t mode with optimal amounts of ta and pdmd added in t p mode conditioning the srf value decreased from 4 14 1011 cm g rs to 3 89 1010 cm g and cst from 75 9 s rs to 26 5 s this result proved that the conditioned sludge had significantly better filterability than the raw sludge to conclude the co conditioning method managed to improve the sludge filterability tremendously with very limited consumption of the conditioners which is inconsistent with previously reported results claiming that enhanced dewaterability was always accompanied by increasing ta addition 15 moisture content mc of the sludge cake is regarded as the most direct index to evaluate sludge dewaterability in this study a micro filter press was employed for sludge pressure filtration under 0 8 mpa for 15 min which could simulate the actual state of the plate and frame filter in wwtps 18 for raw sludge it was definitely difficult to get well shaped sludge cake because the fine sludge particles would easily leak out of the mesh resulting in ultra thin sludge sheet or get stuck inside resulting in runny yolks structure in the sludge cake after co conditioning treatment however well preserved sludge cake could be obtained with either conditioning mode in addition the mc of the sludge cake in the t p mode was lower than that in the p t mode within the dosage range fig 1c with the optimal dosage the mc content of the formed cake respectively decreased to 57 71 in the p t mode and 53 46 in t p mode usually after treatment with oxidation coagulation and flocculation alone mc could be reduced to only about 70 80 28 even after some combined triple conditioner treatment such as oxidation flocculation and biochar persulfate coagulation treatment mc only reached its lowest point at 58 51 29 comparatively our mc after co conditioning 53 46 verified the remarkably high efficiency of the ta pdmd based pre treatment technique 3 2 changes of floc property after co conditioning under most circumstances a lower viscosity is preferred during the dewatering process as it means less flow resistance 30 however the viscosity of the co conditioned sludges in this study increased after the p t and t p treatment fig 2 which was contradictory to the reported results 31 in addition taking fig 1c into consideration we can find that the highest viscosity was achieved when pdmd and ta dosage reached their critical dose points 2 for pdmd and 2 for ta also we can identify a significant positive correlation between viscosity and dehydration performance table s1 in this context it is legitimate to suggest that there should be some important elements to offset the adverse effects caused by high sludge viscosity to make detailed illustration of the flowability characteristics of the conditioned sludge when the conditioners were at their optimal points we recorded rheograms of the shear stress fig 3a and apparent viscosity fig 3b in the sludge samples with different dosing orders in addition the herschel bulkley equation was adopted to accurately identify their shear thinning behavior and to analyze the non newtonian characteristics as shown in table s2 the value of n increased from 0 3449 to 0 3717 and that of the yield stress τy from 1 5098 pa to 1 9757 pa these results showed that non newtonian characteristics were strengthened and the internal structure of the conditioned sludge was enhanced with the t p mode having stronger effect than the p t mode varying viscosity is the rheological indication of flow induced structural changes if the changes are reversible and time dependent the effect is called thixotropy 32 as shown in figs 3a and b during the stress recovery process an obvious hysteresis loop was observed in both co conditioned sludge samples indicating that a larger amount of time was needed for the sludge flocs to recover their structures the hysteresis loop implied obvious thixotropic effect found in the conditioned sludge 32 34 taking into account all these indicators including higher apparent viscosity strengthened yield stress and significant thixotropic property its reasonable for us to speculate that the colloidal force between particles interparticle interaction was greatly strengthened the after co conditioning treatment which in turn required a larger amount of time for micro structure recovery 35 36 in terms of the viscoelastic property fig 3c the two curves of elastic modulus g and viscous modulus g which reflected the structural strength and deformative energy of sludge samples during the shear process showed similar evolutionary tendencies in the lve range the elastic behavior dominated the viscous modulus suggesting a solid like property and certain rigidity of the conditioned sludge 13 as the dosing order switched from the p t to the t p mode both g and g increased moreover the value of the complex modulus g further increased from 31 24 pa in the p t mode to 49 03 pa in the t p mode indicating that the conditioned sludge in the t p mode had a more robust inner structure to resist deformation than the p t mode df reflects the structural properties of an aggregate from geometry with its value varying between 1 a linear aggregate and 3 a compact or space filling form higher fractal dimension means the components of the sludge system are increasingly compact 21 in fig 3d the fractal dimensions of co conditioned sludge samples 1 96 in the p t mode and 2 02 in the t p mode were relatively higher than that of the raw sludge 1 91 indicating that the network structure of the sludge was essentially strengthened by contrast the pam conditioned sludge basically remained unchanged df of 1 94 to conclude df variation was consistent with that of the transient and dynamic rheological properties i e flowability and elastic property which re confirmed the existence of stronger inner structure in co conditioned sludge especially in the t p conditioning mode in addition to rheological properties the variation of perceptible compressibility s was also examined between different conditioning modes as shown in fig 4 the compressibility of the raw sludge was 1 06 after co conditioning the sludge compressibility decreased significantly to 0 84 the p t mode and 0 69 in the t p mode by comparison the compressibility of the cationic pam conditioned sludge was 1 04 at best fig s2 which explained why the cationic pam conditioned sludge deformed easily and consequently blocked the cake filter during the compression process 37 the impacts of different conditioning methods on the sludge particle structure were also demonstrated by the sem image as shown in fig s3 irregular rs flocs aggregated to form sludge clusters after conditioning treatment and the flocs with larger size have a higher possibility of formation fig s4 furthermore fig s3 also emphasizes the difference between coagulants flocculants the floc aggregates after co conditioning treatment were clearly more compact and denser than those in the raw and pam conditioned sludge in addition the co conditioned sludge flocs were more porous figs s3e and f representing excellent water permeability and water removal performance during the pressure depression process 3 3 mechanism analysis and key factor identification according to previously reported results enhanced sludge dewaterability was frequently coupled with eps degradation and weakened intermolecular force 38 complete degradation of organic matter is ideally desirable for the enhancement of sludge dewaterability however in this study the continuous decrease of protein content did not lead to increasingly enhanced sludge dewaterability fig s5 instead the improved dewatering performance in this study was attributed to enhanced interparticle interaction and the following structural strength we can verify the result from fractal transient and dynamic rheological perspective it is thus supposed that compact flocs were very

12887,a chemical less microwave enhanced photolysis process named mw uv was established for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation and the mechanisms were specifically studied 96 7 of smx could be removed in an extremely short reaction time of 140 s under 400 w of microwave and 23 0 mw cm2 of uv light at 254 nm the half live of smx was greatly shortened to 5 s in mw uv process compared with 67 s in uv process and 1386 s in mw process mw uv process was also effective when applied to complex real water matrices such as river water seawater and synthetic waste water non thermal effects of microwave were found to play an essential role in elevating photolysis degradation efficiency the ros formation detected by quenching experiments and epr test showed that smx degradation by mw uv followed non radicals dominated method although 1o2 and oh co existed in this system 16 intermediates in total were detected by hplc q tof and three degradation pathways based on 1o2 and oh oxidation were proposed according to the structural characteristics of the intermediates besides toxicity evaluation of smx and its intermediates revealed that mw uv process could effectively reduce the toxicity of smx this study provides an efficient and promising scheme for practical smx degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords singlet oxygen sulfamethoxazole microwave photolysis advanced oxidation 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is a widely employed and representative sulfonamide antibiotics for bacterial disease treatment in human beings and other livestock it has been quite frequently detected in both surface and ground water 1 4 due to the fact that smx is difficult to be degraded by neither natural degradation nor conventional biological treatments commonly used in wastewater treatment plant smx is recognized as a toxic accumulative and bacterial tolerant substance 5 which has been identified as one of the priority contaminants in water matrices of china because of its great threat to aquatic bacteria algae plankton and even human health 6 8 it is highly desired to develop an effective way to degrade smx to reduce its eco risk though many kinds of chemical and physical methods have been investigated in recent years advanced oxidation processes such as sulfate radical based oxidation 9 12 ozonation 13 14 fenton oxidation 15 18 chlorination 19 21 and photocatalysis 22 25 were demonstrated to be extremely effective on smx degradation 26 among them sulfate radical based oxidation attracted more attention due to the stronger oxidation capacity of sulfate radical persulfates are the general precursors of sulfate radicals which are stable under ambient condition thus additional catalyst and energy are normally required for activating them besides the addition of catalyst would cause secondary environmental pollution in practical use ozonation is another common choice for smx degradation benefited from the highly oxidative and non selective ozone however ozone is difficulty to store thus requires to be prepared on site which to some extent hinders its widespread application fenton oxidation could only be effective in acidic condition to protect the activity of fe2 which limits its application in neutral and alkaline wastewater chlorination is a traditional disinfection method with high efficiency and low cost however the chlorinated disinfection by products have become an emerging problem due to their ecological toxicity to human and environment 27 considering the photosensitivity of smx ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes such as uv photolysis and uv photocatalysis have shown great application potential for smx degradation and water purification taking advantages of the characteristics of uv such as strong oxidation capacity and complete degradation for various pollutants chemical less no secondary pollution mild reaction conditions etc by combing artificial uv light and free radicals uv based advanced oxidation achieved excellent removal of smx 18 28 32 but the photon utilization rate is always the bottleneck factor limiting the efficiency of uv based advanced oxidation in recent years the facile combination of microwave and photocatalysis as well as the introduction of microwave discharged electrodeless uv lamp mdel have gained dazzling results in the degradation of organic pollutants such as malachite green 33 fluoxetine 34 cefoperazone 35 ciprofloxacin 36 urea solution 37 methyl mercaptan 38 and etc the synergistic effects among microwave uv light and photocatalysts were proposed to promote the formation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and accelerate the generation of more hydroxyl radicals in aqueous system so as to improve the photodegradation efficiency of the mentioned pollutants 39 40 previous studies on micropollutant degradation were mostly relying on the cooperation between mw uv and photocatalysts and the corresponding research interest was mainly on the development of various nano photocatalysts however the addition of chemical catalysts would unavoidably cause certain pollution to water by catalysts themselves thus it is more applicable to develop a method for efficient micropollutant degradation using bare microwave and ultraviolet light without chemical catalysts the mdel excited by microwave has higher light emitting efficiency and longer service life than traditional electrode uv lamp while the scale and power density of the mdel could be regulated according to the reaction needs 41 the combination of microwave and uv light emitted by the mdel will be a new attempt to efficiently solve the problem of smx pollution in water environment which not only conforms to the light sensitive characteristics of smx but also can effectively improve the photo degradation efficiency and the feasibility of practical application herein we developed a chemical less microwave enhanced photolysis process named mw uv process for smx degradation this proposed method employed no additional chemical reagent which would significantly inhibit the generation of secondary environmental contaminant and reduce process costs the synergistic effects of microwave and mdels uv light on the degradation of smx were systematically studied besides the effects of main operation parameters and water quality factors on smx degradation were investigated respectively to clarify the optimized condition for its practical application at the same time the degradation mechanism of smx was specifically discussed based on the real time evaluation of radicals and non radicals in mw uv process the main degradation products of smx were experimentally detected and the possible degradation paths were proposed reasonably moreover the toxicity of intermediates was analyzed and predicted to access the eco risk during the mw uv degradation of smx 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfamethoxazole smx 99 humic acid ha 90 5 5

company incorporation cincinnati usa other chemicals were all of analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all the chemicals were used without further purification smx solution in this research was mostly prepared in deionized water dw milli q billerica usa but sometimes dissolved in different water matrices such as river water rw seawater sw and synthetic wastewater sww for the study of water matrices effects on smx degradation specifically rw was taken from the north part of xinglinwan reservoir xiamen china and sw was sampled from the sea area near the xiamen convention and exhibition center xiamen china besides sww was prepared in the lab with 480 mg l c6h12o6 20 mg l co nh2 2 10 mg l nh4 2so4 and 10 mg l kh2po4 the water quality parameters of the four water matrices are illustrated in table s1 2 2 the mw uv degradation procedure of smx the schematic diagram of the experiment setup of mw uv process was presented as fig 1 in a typical mw uv degradation procedure first inserted two u style mdels shanghai jiguang special illumination instruments factory shanghai china into 2 l of smx solution initial concentration 500 μg l in a cylindrical glass reactor then connected the reactor with peristaltic pump and placed it into an atmospheric microwave equipment apex preekem scientific instruments co ltd shanghai china for circulated degradation smx solution could receive simultaneous irradiation of microwave and uv light in mw uv process the mdels involved in these experiments have the maximum emission at 254 nm and the emitted uv light intensity linearly increases with the input microwave power as demonstrated in eq 1 1 y 0 0912 x 12 18 r 2 0 9873 where y is the uv light intensity mw cm2 of two mdels and x is microwave power w besides the microwave irradiation only mw uv light irradiation only uv and traditional heating th processes were also carried out for comparison with mw uv process mw process was conducted without any uv light irradiation and the microwave power was set as 400 w in uv process two mdels were installed onto an external microwave magnetron equipment instead put into the apex microwave oven which could exclude microwave irradiation on smx solution the microwave power of the external microwave magnetron equipment was also kept at 400 w to make sure the same dosage of uv light irradiation with that in mw uv process for the th process smx solution was heated on a heating plate without any uv or microwave irradiation all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the specific experimental conditions were illustrated in section 3 2 3 analytical methods smx concentration was analyzed by shimadzu lc 20a high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector shimadzu japan and a reversed phase shimadzu inert sustain c18 analytical column 4 6 mm 150 mm particle size 5 μm the mobile phase for smx detection was composed of 0 1 formic acid solution phase a and pure methanol phase b while the volume ratio of a b was 30 70 and the flow rate of mobile phase was 1 0 ml min the temperature of the column was kept at 40 c and smx was tested under 270 nm of uv light the reactive oxygen species ros were detected by epr emx 10 12 bruker germany using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agents for hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen respectively the epr tests were conducted under the condition of temperature 296 k microwave frequency 9 844 ghz microwave power 20 mw modulation amplitude 1 0 g modulation frequency 100 khz and scan time 1 min the intermediates of smx were analyzed by an agilent 1290 hplc combined with a q tof mass spectrometer agilent usa the mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization source and functioned in positive mode the column applied to separate the intermediates was an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm particle size 1 8 μm the mobile phase was the mixture of pure water phase a and pure methanol phase b with volume ratio of 50 50 and mobile phase flow rate 0 4 ml min the intermediates of smx were determined at 310 nm and the m z scan range was from 50 to 1100 2 4 toxicity assessment 2 4 1 acute toxicity analysis the acute toxicity of smx and its intermediates was evaluated by luminescence inhibition test of the vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria biofix lumi which were produced by macherey nagel company in germany and complied with the din en iso 11348 3 standards the specific procedure of the acute toxicity analysis was as follows first added 6 ml of biofix lumi multi shot activation solution into the biofix lumi multi shot lyophilized bacteria and then shaken well the mixture and refrigerated it for 5 min under the temperature of 2 c to 8 c until the luminescent bacteria were fully activated meanwhile prepared a certain number of glass test tubes chose one as the control test tube and the rest as the sample test tubes injected 0 5 ml of activated luminescent bacteria solution into each tube and cultivated for 10 min under 15 c then added 500 μl of biofix lumi control solution to the control tube and 500 μl of sample solution into each sample tube cultured all the mixtures for 30 min before testing the luminous intensity of luminescent bacteria in portable water toxicity analyzer biofix lumi 10 the experimental results were expressed by luminescence inhibition rate and the calculation formula is listed as eq 2 2 luminescence inhibition rate 1 sample luminescence intensity control luminescence intensity 100 2 4 2 acute and chronic toxicity prediction the acute and chronic toxicity of smx and its intermediates were predicted by ecosar software version 1 11 developed by the u s environmental protection agency using fish daphnid and green algae as the model organisms the chemical information of specific transformation product tp was collected from the lc q tof ms ms detection results and the inferred chemical structure of each tp was detailed presented in section 3 6 of the manuscript the acute toxicity was expressed by the lc50 values of fish and daphnid and the ec50 value of green algae respectively the chronic toxicity was marked uniformly for the three model organisms in this study the minimum predicted lc50 or ec50 values of different functional groups were selected to represent the toxicity of the substance besides the toxicity level was determined according to the global harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals as shown in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons of smx degradation in different processes four different processes mw uv uv mw and th were compared to understand the smx decomposition process as shown in fig 2 mw uv had the highest smx removal rate of the studied four processes which reached up to 96 7 after 140 s of degradation meanwhile the smx degradation efficiency was 75 2 in uv process and only 6 6 in mw process after the same time of reaction obviously microwave and uv light had synergistic effects on smx removal which significantly improve the degradation of smx microwave irradiation alone could not cause effective smx degradation due to the relatively low photon energy of microwave the function of microwave on chemical reaction could be generally divided into thermal and non thermal effects in this study smx solution showed only 2 c increase in temperature after 140 s of microwave irradiation which suggested thermal effect of microwave played little role on smx degradation meanwhile negligible decomposition of smx was measured after th treatment for 140 s proving that thermal effect should not be considered for smx degradation in such a short heating time accordingly we believe that non thermal effect of microwave played a leading role to significantly accelerate the smx degradation when combined with uv according to zhou and loupy et al 39 42 microwave irradiation had directional arrangement effect on polar molecules such as smx which could stabilize the transition states of polar reactions and reduce the activation energies besides high frequency microwave irradiation could increase the reactive oxygen species formation in aqueous solution 39 40 the combined action of the two non thermal effects of microwave finally significantly improved the uv degradation of smx in mw uv process in order to confirm the general feasibility of mw uv treatment for micropollutants degradation tetracycline and norfloxacin were selected and shown great degradation under mw uv treatment as shown in fig s3 the kinetics of smx removal in the four processes were also studied based on the data from fig 2 as shown in table 1 the degradation of smx in mw uv process could be fitted by pseudo second order kinetic model while the uv mw and th processes all followed pseudo first order kinetics the calculated half lives t 1 2 of smx in mw uv process was 5 s while those of uv mw and th processes were 67 s 1386 s and 8664 s respectively indicating that the mw uv process constructed by the combination of microwave and uv could greatly accelerate the degradation of smx at the same time the calculated degradation half life of smx in mw process 1386 s was significantly lower than that in th process 8664 s suggesting that microwave heating could promote the smx degradation comparing with traditional heating 3 2 effect of microwave power on mw uv degradation of smx microwave power was investigated as the most important factor for smx degradation in mw uv system which not only influenced the microwave irradiation but also changed the uv light of mdels excited by microwave see eq 1 as illustrated in fig 3 increasing microwave power led to obvious elevation of smx removal efficiency especially when the input microwave power rose from 300 w to 400 w the reason could be ascribed to the linearly enhanced uv light intensity of mdels and the strengthened non thermal effect of microwave with the increase of microwave power however when microwave power was over 400 w the growth rate on smx removal slowed down because the fast increased temperature of smx solution under higher microwave power speeded up the quenching of radicals and finally hindered smx degradation although the smx removal rate under 500 w and 600 w were higher than that under 400 w within 100 s the degradations of smx were almost the same after 120 s under these three mw power densities besides according to the results in section 3 6 many intermediates could be generated in the reaction system although the chemical structure of smx was destroyed and the concentration of smx was greatly reduced in extremely short time in the mw uv system it was necessary to extend the reaction time appropriately to further degrade the intermediate products and reduce the eco risk of the smx intermediates in practical application however due to the rapid temperature rise of the reaction solution under 500 600 w of microwave irradiation prolonging the reaction time would result in an extremely hot reaction solution which would cause serious quenching of free radicals in the system and further affect the degradation rate of smx a power density at 400 w of microwave was selected to inhibit the rapid temperature increase of reaction solution and achieve the same removal of smx with that under 500 w or 600 w after 120 s moreover the overall toxicity of the mixture of smx and its intermediation went lower than smx and the ecological safety was improved under 400 w of irradiation for prolonged reaction time according to toxicity assessment in section 3 7 of the manuscript therefore a power density at 400 w of microwave was chosen for subsequent experiments 3 3 effect of ph on mw uv degradation of smx smx has different dissociation states under different ph conditions thus ph played an important role on the degradation performance of smx during mw uv process it could be found in fig 4 that the smx removal rate decreased as the ph of solution increased from 3 to 11 and the apparent rate constant k obs followed almost the same trend specifically the smx removal and k obs increased when ph increased from 3 to 5 but decreased when ph increased from 5 to 11 as is known the pk a1 of smx is 1 6 and pk a2 is 5 7 which means smx is in protonated form at ph below 1 6 and in deprotonated form at ph above 5 7 43 according to oliveira et al smx was in transition from protonated form to neutral form and then to deprotonated form when ph elevated from 1 6 to 5 7 meanwhile the smx in neutral form had the highest absorption of uv light while the smx in deprotonated form had the lowest uv absorption 23 in this case the neutral form smx in the reaction system was increased when the ph of smx solution increased from 3 to 5 as a consequence the uv absorption of smx solution would be improved which induced the elevation of smx removal rate and k obs however the neutral form smx gradually transformed into deprotonated form smx when ph kept on increasing from 5 to 11 which inhibited the uv absorption of smx and accordingly caused the decrease of smx degradation and k obs besides according to shah et al 44 oh could react with oh with a reaction rate constant of 1 2 1010 l mol 1 s 1 therefore more oh would compete with smx for oh in reaction system with the increased ph resulting in the decrease of smx removal rate the same trend has also been found in wang s research on uv no3 photo degradation of smx 45 3 4 comparisons of smx degradation in different water matrices considering the complexity of real water matrices degradation of smx in rw sw and sww were also investigated to evaluate the feasibility of mw uv process in practical application the results were collected in fig 5 generally smx in the four tested water matrices could all be fast degraded which proved the effectiveness of mw uv process in different water matrices in addition smx removal rate would be interfered by the complex composition of water matric for the investigated four kinds of water matrices the smx removal rate and k obs followed the sequences of dw rw sww sw which was adverse to the sequences of cod of these water matrices see table s1 the lowest removal of smx occurred in sw might be owing to the highest cod and conductivity of sw the organic compounds and inorganic salts in sw could cause inhibitory effects such as inner filter effect complexation of metal ions 46 and radicals quenching 47 to smx degradation on the other hand although the cod of sww was much lower than that of sw the smx removal in sww was very close to that in sw which was possibly attributed by the fact that higher tn in sww would induced stronger no3 screening effect to smx decomposition 48 the above results showed us the feasibility and provided some references for practical application of mw uv process in smx removal in different water matrices furthermore the influence of humic acid ha on smx removal was also discussed as it is one of the major kinds of natural organic matter in various water matrices ha was reported to have antagonistic dual role on the photodegradation of organic pollutants according to the results illustrated in fig 6 ha played a negative role in smx degradation the smx removal rate and k obs both decreased when elevating the concentration of ha qi et al 49 has observed a similar trend in the uv activated peroxymonosulfate degradation of flumequine they found that ha caused obvious competition with the target pollutants for so4 and oh radicals similarly ha might be a competitor of smx which hindered the access of smx to uv irradiation and ros and finally resulted in the ineffective degradation of smx it should be noticed that the concentration of ha would definitely have influence on the removal of smx in real water matrices 3 5 the reactive oxygen species formation in mw uv degradation of smx quenching experiments and epr tests were carried out to study the formation of reactive oxygen species ros and the dominant ros in mw uv for degrading smx radical oh and non radical 1o2 were generally considered to be the main ros in photolysis process 50 here methanol was used as the radical quencher of oh with a quenching rate at 9 7 108 mol l 1 s 1 while nan3 was applied as the scavenger of both radicals e g k oh 1 2 1010 mol l 1 s 1 and non radicals e g k 1 o2 2 109 mol l 1 s 1 51 in this experiment the addition of 0 1 ml ch3oh just caused a slight decrease on smx removal in the first 80 s but the input of 40 mg l nan3 induced significant inhibition on the degradation of smx as shown in fig 7 up to 60 of decrease could be found on smx removal when nan3 was added the results suggested that oh radicals were not the crucial reason for smx degradation but non radical 1o2 oxidation had a greater effect on the degradation of smx epr tests were further conducted to verify the existence of 1o2 and oh using temp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents respectively a clear 1 1 1 triplet peak with hyperfine coupling constants of an 16 90 g was found in fig 8a which was the characteristic signal of temp 1o2 meanwhile a set of characteristic peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed in fig 8b which could be inferred as the signal of dmpo oh an ah 14 96 g but the peak intensity of dmpo oh was relatively weak in this case another set of three peaks with much stronger intensity in fig 8b might be indexed to the signal of dmpo an 17 75 compared with the spectra of pure dmpo epr results proved the formation of 1o2 and oh in mw uv system however the peak intensity of oh was relatively weak combined the results of epr tests with the quenching experiments above 1o2 and oh were confirmed to co exist in mw uv system but non radicals 1o2 was more important than oh in the degradation of smx by mw uv process in order to further understand the participation of non radicals l histidine as 1o2 quencher scavenger and 1 4 benzoquinone as superoxide quencher scavenger were employed to confirm the existence and role of 1o2 and superoxide during smx degradation process as shown in fig s4 it suggested that both 1o2 and superoxide could be generated and contributed to smx degradation in mw uv process thus it could be generally concluded that smx removal in mw uv process was mainly dominated by non radicals 3 6 transformation products and possible degradation pathways of smx transformation products tps of smx produced in mw uv process were further detected by lc q tof ms ms sixteen tps with proposed chemical structures were tentatively identified through the ms ms spectra and corresponding references the m z values and speculated chemical structures of the tps were listed in table s3 and three potential degradation pathways were also proposed as shown in fig 9 degradation path i was triggered by oxidation of the amino group on the benzene ring of smx yin et al suggested that the smx degradation path by 1o2 oxidation was different from that by oh oxidation according to dft simulation 1o2 was more likely to attack the n atom of amino group on the benzene ring but oh was more inclined to attack sn bond 52 as for degradation path i the amino group on the benzene ring of smx was first oxidized by 1o2 to form tp 267 1 53 and further oxidized to produce nitro derivative tp 283 1 53 54 then the electrophilic substitution of oh occurred on the isoxazole ring of tp 283 1 to form tp 299 54 and continued to induce the isoxazole ring opening to produce tp 245 53 and tp 226 besides amino group on the benzene ring the cs bond was also likely to be attacked by 1o2 52 as a side path of degradation path i the cs bond of tp 267 1 broke down under the attack of 1o2 and tp 140 was generated in this path 55 degradation path ii was initiated by oh oxidation of the branched alkyl on the isoxazole ring of smx which resulted in hydroformylation to form tp 267 2 15 and carboxylation to produce tp 283 2 15 further attacks of oh would lead to the opening of isoxazole ring and the gradual formation of tp 273 tp 186 tp 188 15 and tp 173 1 53 degradation path iii was originated by gradual hydroxylation and oh would firstly attacked the benzene ring of smx to form tp 269 53 the isoxazole ring of tp 269 was then oxidized and broken to generate tp 231 53 and tp 173 2 15 respectively owing to hydroxyl substitution of tp173 2 tp 193 55 was subsequently formed in this path 3 7 toxicity changes and prediction the intermediates detection results showed that many tps were produced during the rapid degradation of smx in mw uv process however the tps could not be completely mineralized due to the short reaction time the structures of the tps were varied and their toxicity and potential ecological risk were still unknown therefore the toxicity changes of smx solution during mw uv degradation were studied to evaluate the ecological risk of smx and its tps in mw uv degradation process accordingly the smx degradation process could be further optimized from the perspective of toxicity control firstly the acute toxicity changes of smx and its tps in mw uv process were investigated using the luminescence inhibition rate of luminescent bacteria as the evaluation index as illustrated in fig s2 the luminescence inhibition rate of smx solution showed a downward trend with the extension of degradation time indicating that the overall acute toxicity of smx solution decreased and the ecological safety was improved during the mw uv degradation of smx specifically the acute toxicity of smx and its tps went down in the first 5 min but slightly went up after 5 min of reaction suggesting that some tps with higher acute toxicity might be produced or the concentration of the existed tps with higher toxicity might be elevated after 5 min of reaction for further understanding the toxicity of smx and its tps ecosar software was applied to predict the acute and chronic toxicity of smx and the tps the calculation results were summarized in table s4 and the toxicity level of the tps was respectively graded according to the global harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals in table s2 the toxicity prediction results of smx and its tps were comprehensively demonstrated in fig 10 in general daphnid was the most sensitive organism to the toxicity of smx and its tps according to the ecosar prediction results the acute toxicity of tp 299 tp 140 tp 269 tp173 2 and tp 193 to fish was greater than that of smx itself which reached the level of harmful but for daphnid and green algae the toxicity of all the tps was basically less than or approximately equal to that of smx referring to the results in fig s2 the small elevation in the acute toxicity of the tps produced after 5 min of reaction might be caused by the increase on the concentration of intermediates with smaller molecules but higher toxicity such as tp 173 2 and tp 140 overall the acute toxicity was controllable and tended to decrease during the mw uv degradation of smx which was consistent with the results in fig s2 thus the mw uv process could effectively control and reduce the acute toxicity of smx as for the prediction results of chronic toxicity the toxicity of most tps was less than or equal to smx however the chronic toxicity of tp 267 1 tp 283 1 and tp 226 to fish was greater than smx itself reaching the very toxic level at the same time the chronic toxicity of tp 267 1 tp 283 1 tp 299 tp 140 tp 269 tp 173 2 and tp 193 to green algae was also higher than smx arriving at the degree of toxic the results indicated that the mw uv process could reduce chronic toxicity to a certain extent however the formation of some intermediates with high chronic toxicity should still be vigilant furthermore the phenol amide group in tp 299 tp 269 and tp 173 2 was the main factor leading to their increased toxicity while the phenol group in tp 140 and tp 193 was the important reason for their higher toxicity analyzed from the perspective of substance structure meanwhile the acute and chronic toxicity of tp 245 to all the three organisms were significantly less than those of tp 299 indicating that the opening of isoxazole ring could favor the detoxification of smx intermediates 4 conclusions a chemical less microwave enhanced photolysis process was established for smx decomposition and non thermal effects of microwave significantly improved the photolysis degradation efficiency and shortened the degradation procedure 96 7 of smx could be removed after 140 s of mw uv treatment under microwave power of 400 w and uv light intensity of 23 0 mw cm2 with the maximum uv wavelength at 254 nm while only 75 2 and 6 6 of smx could be decomposed by bare uv and bare mw treatments respectively at the same time kinetics study showed that the half live of smx was only 5 s in mw uv process which was much shorter than 67 s in uv process and 1386 s in mw process respectively mw uv process was also effective for smx degradation in different actual water matrices and the removal efficiency followed the order of dw rw sww sw however ha and nitrate in actual water still could inhibit the degradation of smx which should be paid attention in practical application ros detections revealed that smx degradation by mw uv followed non radicals dominated strategy meanwhile a total of 16 intermediates were detected in mw uv degradation of smx and three degradation pathways based on 1o2 and oh oxidation were proposed according to the structural characteristics of these intermediates besides toxicity evaluation of smx and the intermediates suggested that mw uv process could effectively reduce the toxicity of smx and control the ecological risk in the degradation of smx although a few intermediates with toxicity higher than smx generated in the reaction process this study provides a facile method for smx degradation without additional chemical reagents and the toxicity of byproducts could be effectively controlled the mw uv process is also efficient and easy to operate for smx degradation in a variety of practical water matrices which pave the way for practical application of mw uv in water purification abbreviations smx sulfamethoxazole mw uv microwave enhanced photolysis

12887,a chemical less microwave enhanced photolysis process named mw uv was established for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation and the mechanisms were specifically studied 96 7 of smx could be removed in an extremely short reaction time of 140 s under 400 w of microwave and 23 0 mw cm2 of uv light at 254 nm the half live of smx was greatly shortened to 5 s in mw uv process compared with 67 s in uv process and 1386 s in mw process mw uv process was also effective when applied to complex real water matrices such as river water seawater and synthetic waste water non thermal effects of microwave were found to play an essential role in elevating photolysis degradation efficiency the ros formation detected by quenching experiments and epr test showed that smx degradation by mw uv followed non radicals dominated method although 1o2 and oh co existed in this system 16 intermediates in total were detected by hplc q tof and three degradation pathways based on 1o2 and oh oxidation were proposed according to the structural characteristics of the intermediates besides toxicity evaluation of smx and its intermediates revealed that mw uv process could effectively reduce the toxicity of smx this study provides an efficient and promising scheme for practical smx degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords singlet oxygen sulfamethoxazole microwave photolysis advanced oxidation 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx is a widely employed and representative sulfonamide antibiotics for bacterial disease treatment in human beings and other livestock it has been quite frequently detected in both surface and ground water 1 4 due to the fact that smx is difficult to be degraded by neither natural degradation nor conventional biological treatments commonly used in wastewater treatment plant smx is recognized as a toxic accumulative and bacterial tolerant substance 5 which has been identified as one of the priority contaminants in water matrices of china because of its great threat to aquatic bacteria algae plankton and even human health 6 8 it is highly desired to develop an effective way to degrade smx to reduce its eco risk though many kinds of chemical and physical methods have been investigated in recent years advanced oxidation processes such as sulfate radical based oxidation 9 12 ozonation 13 14 fenton oxidation 15 18 chlorination 19 21 and photocatalysis 22 25 were demonstrated to be extremely effective on smx degradation 26 among them sulfate radical based oxidation attracted more attention due to the stronger oxidation capacity of sulfate radical persulfates are the general precursors of sulfate radicals which are stable under ambient condition thus additional catalyst and energy are normally required for activating them besides the addition of catalyst would cause secondary environmental pollution in practical use ozonation is another common choice for smx degradation benefited from the highly oxidative and non selective ozone however ozone is difficulty to store thus requires to be prepared on site which to some extent hinders its widespread application fenton oxidation could only be effective in acidic condition to protect the activity of fe2 which limits its application in neutral and alkaline wastewater chlorination is a traditional disinfection method with high efficiency and low cost however the chlorinated disinfection by products have become an emerging problem due to their ecological toxicity to human and environment 27 considering the photosensitivity of smx ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes such as uv photolysis and uv photocatalysis have shown great application potential for smx degradation and water purification taking advantages of the characteristics of uv such as strong oxidation capacity and complete degradation for various pollutants chemical less no secondary pollution mild reaction conditions etc by combing artificial uv light and free radicals uv based advanced oxidation achieved excellent removal of smx 18 28 32 but the photon utilization rate is always the bottleneck factor limiting the efficiency of uv based advanced oxidation in recent years the facile combination of microwave and photocatalysis as well as the introduction of microwave discharged electrodeless uv lamp mdel have gained dazzling results in the degradation of organic pollutants such as malachite green 33 fluoxetine 34 cefoperazone 35 ciprofloxacin 36 urea solution 37 methyl mercaptan 38 and etc the synergistic effects among microwave uv light and photocatalysts were proposed to promote the formation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and accelerate the generation of more hydroxyl radicals in aqueous system so as to improve the photodegradation efficiency of the mentioned pollutants 39 40 previous studies on micropollutant degradation were mostly relying on the cooperation between mw uv and photocatalysts and the corresponding research interest was mainly on the development of various nano photocatalysts however the addition of chemical catalysts would unavoidably cause certain pollution to water by catalysts themselves thus it is more applicable to develop a method for efficient micropollutant degradation using bare microwave and ultraviolet light without chemical catalysts the mdel excited by microwave has higher light emitting efficiency and longer service life than traditional electrode uv lamp while the scale and power density of the mdel could be regulated according to the reaction needs 41 the combination of microwave and uv light emitted by the mdel will be a new attempt to efficiently solve the problem of smx pollution in water environment which not only conforms to the light sensitive characteristics of smx but also can effectively improve the photo degradation efficiency and the feasibility of practical application herein we developed a chemical less microwave enhanced photolysis process named mw uv process for smx degradation this proposed method employed no additional chemical reagent which would significantly inhibit the generation of secondary environmental contaminant and reduce process costs the synergistic effects of microwave and mdels uv light on the degradation of smx were systematically studied besides the effects of main operation parameters and water quality factors on smx degradation were investigated respectively to clarify the optimized condition for its practical application at the same time the degradation mechanism of smx was specifically discussed based on the real time evaluation of radicals and non radicals in mw uv process the main degradation products of smx were experimentally detected and the possible degradation paths were proposed reasonably moreover the toxicity of intermediates was analyzed and predicted to access the eco risk during the mw uv degradation of smx 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfamethoxazole smx 99 humic acid ha 90 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp were purchased from aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china methanol of chromatographic grade was provided by tedia company incorporation cincinnati usa other chemicals were all of analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all the chemicals were used without further purification smx solution in this research was mostly prepared in deionized water dw milli q billerica usa but sometimes dissolved in different water matrices such as river water rw seawater sw and synthetic wastewater sww for the study of water matrices effects on smx degradation specifically rw was taken from the north part of xinglinwan reservoir xiamen china and sw was sampled from the sea area near the xiamen convention and exhibition center xiamen china besides sww was prepared in the lab with 480 mg l c6h12o6 20 mg l co nh2 2 10 mg l nh4 2so4 and 10 mg l kh2po4 the water quality parameters of the four water matrices are illustrated in table s1 2 2 the mw uv degradation procedure of smx the schematic diagram of the experiment setup of mw uv process was presented as fig 1 in a typical mw uv degradation procedure first inserted two u style mdels shanghai jiguang special illumination instruments factory shanghai china into 2 l of smx solution initial concentration 500 μg l in a cylindrical glass reactor then connected the reactor with peristaltic pump and placed it into an atmospheric microwave equipment apex preekem scientific instruments co ltd shanghai china for circulated degradation smx solution could receive simultaneous irradiation of microwave and uv light in mw uv process the mdels involved in these experiments have the maximum emission at 254 nm and the emitted uv light intensity linearly increases with the input microwave power as demonstrated in eq 1 1 y 0 0912 x 12 18 r 2 0 9873 where y is the uv light intensity mw cm2 of two mdels and x is microwave power w besides the microwave irradiation only mw uv light irradiation only uv and traditional heating th processes were also carried out for comparison with mw uv process mw process was conducted without any uv light irradiation and the microwave power was set as 400 w in uv process two mdels were installed onto an external microwave magnetron equipment instead put into the apex microwave oven which could exclude microwave irradiation on smx solution the microwave power of the external microwave magnetron equipment was also kept at 400 w to make sure the same dosage of uv light irradiation with that in mw uv process for the th process smx solution was heated on a heating plate without any uv or microwave irradiation all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the specific experimental conditions were illustrated in section 3 2 3 analytical methods smx concentration was analyzed by shimadzu lc 20a high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector shimadzu japan and a reversed phase shimadzu inert sustain c18 analytical column 4 6 mm 150 mm particle size 5 μm the mobile phase for smx detection was composed of 0 1 formic acid solution phase a and pure methanol phase b while the volume ratio of a b was 30 70 and the flow rate of mobile phase was 1 0 ml min the temperature of the column was kept at 40 c and smx was tested under 270 nm of uv light the reactive oxygen species ros were detected by epr emx 10 12 bruker germany using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agents for hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen respectively the epr tests were conducted under the condition of temperature 296 k microwave frequency 9 844 ghz microwave power 20 mw modulation amplitude 1 0 g modulation frequency 100 khz and scan time 1 min the intermediates of smx were analyzed by an agilent 1290 hplc combined with a q tof mass spectrometer agilent usa the mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization source and functioned in positive mode the column applied to separate the intermediates was an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm particle size 1 8 μm the mobile phase was the mixture of pure water phase a and pure methanol phase b with volume ratio of 50 50 and mobile phase flow rate 0 4 ml min the intermediates of smx were determined at 310 nm and the m z scan range was from 50 to 1100 2 4 toxicity assessment 2 4 1 acute toxicity analysis the acute toxicity of smx and its intermediates was evaluated by luminescence inhibition test of the vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria biofix lumi which were produced by macherey nagel company in germany and complied with the din en iso 11348 3 standards the specific procedure of the acute toxicity analysis was as follows first added 6 ml of biofix lumi multi shot activation solution into the biofix lumi multi shot lyophilized bacteria and then shaken well the mixture and refrigerated it for 5 min under the temperature of 2 c to 8 c until the luminescent bacteria were fully activated meanwhile prepared a certain number of glass test tubes chose one as the control test tube and the rest as the sample test tubes injected 0 5 ml of activated luminescent bacteria solution into each tube and cultivated for 10 min under 15 c then added 500 μl of biofix lumi control solution to the control tube and 500 μl of sample solution into each sample tube cultured all the mixtures for 30 min before testing the luminous intensity of luminescent bacteria in portable water toxicity analyzer biofix lumi 10 the experimental results were expressed by luminescence inhibition rate and the calculation formula is listed as eq 2 2 luminescence inhibition rate 1 sample luminescence intensity control luminescence intensity 100 2 4 2 acute and chronic toxicity prediction the acute and chronic toxicity of smx and its intermediates were predicted by ecosar software version 1 11 developed by the u s environmental protection agency using fish daphnid and green algae as the model organisms the chemical information of specific transformation product tp was collected from the lc q tof ms ms detection results and the inferred chemical structure of each tp was detailed presented in section 3 6 of the manuscript the acute toxicity was expressed by the lc50 values of fish and daphnid and the ec50 value of green algae respectively the chronic toxicity was marked uniformly for the three model organisms in this study the minimum predicted lc50 or ec50 values of different functional groups were selected to represent the toxicity of the substance besides the toxicity level was determined according to the global harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals as shown in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons of smx degradation in different processes four different processes mw uv uv mw and th were compared to understand the smx decomposition process as shown in fig 2 mw uv had the highest smx removal rate of the studied four processes which reached up to 96 7 after 140 s of degradation meanwhile the smx degradation efficiency was 75 2 in uv process and only 6 6 in mw process after the same time of reaction obviously microwave and uv light had synergistic effects on smx removal which significantly improve the degradation of smx microwave irradiation alone could not cause effective smx degradation due to the relatively low photon energy of microwave the function of microwave on chemical reaction could be generally divided into thermal and non thermal effects in this study smx solution showed only 2 c increase in temperature after 140 s of microwave irradiation which suggested thermal effect of microwave played little role on smx degradation meanwhile negligible decomposition of smx was measured after th treatment for 140 s proving that thermal effect should not be considered for smx degradation in such a short heating time accordingly we believe that non thermal effect of microwave played a leading role to significantly accelerate the smx degradation when combined with uv according to zhou and loupy et al 39 42 microwave irradiation had directional arrangement effect on polar molecules such as smx which could stabilize the transition states of polar reactions and reduce the activation energies besides high frequency microwave irradiation could increase the reactive oxygen species formation in aqueous solution 39 40 the combined action of the two non thermal effects of microwave finally significantly improved the uv degradation of smx in mw uv process in order to confirm the general feasibility of mw uv treatment for micropollutants degradation tetracycline and norfloxacin were selected and shown great degradation under mw uv treatment as shown in fig s3 the kinetics of smx removal in the four processes were also studied based on the data from fig 2 as shown in table 1 the degradation of smx in mw uv process could be fitted by pseudo second order kinetic model while the uv mw and th processes all followed pseudo first order kinetics the calculated half lives t 1 2 of smx in mw uv process was 5 s while those of uv mw and th processes were 67 s 1386 s and 8664 s respectively indicating that the mw uv process constructed by the combination of microwave and uv could greatly accelerate the degradation of smx at the same time the calculated degradation half life of smx in mw process 1386 s was significantly lower than that in th process 8664 s suggesting that microwave heating could promote the smx degradation comparing with traditional heating 3 2 effect of microwave power on mw uv degradation of smx microwave power was investigated as the most important factor for smx degradation in mw uv system which not only influenced the microwave irradiation but also changed the uv light of mdels excited by microwave see eq 1 as illustrated in fig 3 increasing microwave power led to obvious elevation of smx removal efficiency especially when the input microwave power rose from 300 w to 400 w the reason could be ascribed to the linearly enhanced uv light intensity of mdels and the strengthened non thermal effect of microwave with the increase of microwave power however when microwave power was over 400 w the growth rate on smx removal slowed down because the fast increased temperature of smx solution under higher microwave power speeded up the quenching of radicals and finally hindered smx degradation although the smx removal rate under 500 w and 600 w were higher than that under 400 w within 100 s the degradations of smx were almost the same after 120 s under these three mw power densities besides according to the results in section 3 6 many intermediates could be generated in the reaction system although the chemical structure of smx was destroyed and the concentration of smx was greatly reduced in extremely short time in the mw uv system it was necessary to extend the reaction time appropriately to further degrade the intermediate products and reduce the eco risk of the smx intermediates in practical application however due to the rapid temperature rise of the reaction solution under 500 600 w of microwave irradiation prolonging the reaction time would result in an extremely hot reaction solution which would cause serious quenching of free radicals in the system and further affect the degradation rate of smx a power density at 400 w of microwave was selected to inhibit the rapid temperature increase of reaction solution and achieve the same removal of smx with that under 500 w or 600 w after 120 s moreover the overall toxicity of the mixture of smx and its intermediation went lower than smx and the ecological safety was improved under 400 w of irradiation for prolonged reaction time according to toxicity assessment in section 3 7 of the manuscript therefore a power density at 400 w of microwave was chosen for subsequent experiments 3 3 effect of ph on mw uv degradation of smx smx has different dissociation states under different ph conditions thus ph played an important role on the degradation performance of smx during mw uv process it could be found in fig 4 that the smx removal rate decreased as the ph of solution increased from 3 to 11 and the apparent rate constant k obs followed almost the same trend specifically the smx removal and k obs increased when ph increased from 3 to 5 but decreased when ph increased from 5 to 11 as is known the pk a1 of smx is 1 6 and pk a2 is 5 7 which means smx is in protonated form at ph below 1 6 and in deprotonated form at ph above 5 7 43 according to oliveira et al smx was in transition from protonated form to neutral form and then to deprotonated form when ph elevated from 1 6 to 5 7 meanwhile the smx in neutral form had the highest absorption of uv light while the smx in deprotonated form had the lowest uv absorption 23 in this case the neutral form smx in the reaction system was increased when the ph of smx solution increased from 3 to 5 as a consequence the uv absorption of smx solution would be improved which induced the elevation of smx removal rate and k obs however the neutral form smx gradually transformed into deprotonated form smx when ph kept on increasing from 5 to 11 which inhibited the uv absorption of smx and accordingly caused the decrease of smx degradation and k obs besides according to shah et al 44 oh could react with oh with a reaction rate constant of 1 2 1010 l mol 1 s 1 therefore more oh would compete with smx for oh in reaction system with the increased ph resulting in the decrease of smx removal rate the same trend has also been found in wang s research on uv no3 photo degradation of smx 45 3 4 comparisons of smx degradation in different water matrices considering the complexity of real water matrices degradation of smx in rw sw and sww were also investigated to evaluate the feasibility of mw uv process in practical application the results were collected in fig 5 generally smx in the four tested water matrices could all be fast degraded which proved the effectiveness of mw uv process in different water matrices in addition smx removal rate would be interfered by the complex composition of water matric for the investigated four kinds of water matrices the smx removal rate and k obs followed the sequences of dw rw sww sw which was adverse to the sequences of cod of these water matrices see table s1 the lowest removal of smx occurred in sw might be owing to the highest cod and conductivity of sw the organic compounds and inorganic salts in sw could cause inhibitory effects such as inner filter effect complexation of metal ions 46 and radicals quenching 47 to smx degradation on the other hand although the cod of sww was much lower than that of sw the smx removal in sww was very close to that in sw which was possibly attributed by the fact that higher tn in sww would induced stronger no3 screening effect to smx decomposition 48 the above results showed us the feasibility and provided some references for practical application of mw uv process in smx removal in different water matrices furthermore the influence of humic acid ha on smx removal was also discussed as it is one of the major kinds of natural organic matter in various water matrices ha was reported to have antagonistic dual role on the photodegradation of organic pollutants according to the results illustrated in fig 6 ha played a negative role in smx degradation the smx removal rate and k obs both decreased when elevating the concentration of ha qi et al 49 has observed a similar trend in the uv activated peroxymonosulfate degradation of flumequine they found that ha caused obvious competition with the target pollutants for so4 and oh radicals similarly ha might be a competitor of smx which hindered the access of smx to uv irradiation and ros and finally resulted in the ineffective degradation of smx it should be noticed that the concentration of ha would definitely have influence on the removal of smx in real water matrices 3 5 the reactive oxygen species formation in mw uv degradation of smx quenching experiments and epr tests were carried out to study the formation of reactive oxygen species ros and the dominant ros in mw uv for degrading smx radical oh and non radical 1o2 were generally considered to be the main ros in photolysis process 50 here methanol was used as the radical quencher of oh with a quenching rate at 9 7 108 mol l 1 s 1 while nan3 was applied as the scavenger of both radicals e g k oh 1 2 1010 mol l 1 s 1 and non radicals e g k 1 o2 2 109 mol l 1 s 1 51 in this experiment the addition of 0 1 ml ch3oh just caused a slight decrease on smx removal in the first 80 s but the input of 40 mg l nan3 induced significant inhibition on the degradation of smx as shown in fig 7 up to 60 of decrease could be found on smx removal when nan3 was added the results suggested that oh radicals were not the crucial reason for smx degradation but non radical 1o2 oxidation had a greater effect on the degradation of smx epr tests were further conducted to verify the existence of 1o2 and oh using temp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents respectively a clear 1 1 1 triplet peak with hyperfine coupling constants of an 16 90 g was found in fig 8a which was the characteristic signal of temp 1o2 meanwhile a set of characteristic peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed in fig 8b which could be inferred as the signal of dmpo oh an ah 14 96 g but the peak intensity of dmpo oh was relatively weak in this case another set of three peaks with much stronger intensity in fig 8b might be indexed to the signal of dmpo an 17 75 compared with the spectra of pure dmpo epr results proved the formation of 1o2 and oh in mw uv system however the peak intensity of oh was relatively weak combined the results of epr tests with the quenching experiments above 1o2 and oh were confirmed to co exist in mw uv system but non radicals 1o2 was more important than oh in the degradation of smx by mw uv process in order to further understand the participation of non radicals l histidine as 1o2 quencher scavenger and 1 4 benzoquinone as superoxide quencher scavenger were employed to confirm the existence and role of 1o2 and superoxide during smx degradation process as shown in fig s4 it suggested that both 1o2 and superoxide could be generated and contributed to smx degradation in mw uv process thus it could be generally concluded that smx removal in mw uv process was mainly dominated by non radicals 3 6 transformation products and possible degradation pathways of smx transformation products tps of smx produced in mw uv process were further detected by lc q tof ms ms sixteen tps with proposed chemical structures were tentatively identified through the ms ms spectra and corresponding references the m z values and speculated chemical structures of the tps were listed in table s3 and three potential degradation pathways were also proposed as shown in fig 9 degradation path i was triggered by oxidation of the amino group on the benzene ring of smx yin et al suggested that the smx degradation path by 1o2 oxidation was different from that by oh oxidation according to dft simulation 1o2 was more likely to attack the n atom of amino group on the benzene ring but oh was more inclined to attack sn bond 52 as for degradation path i the amino group on the benzene ring of smx was first oxidized by 1o2 to form tp 267 1 53 and further oxidized to produce nitro derivative tp 283 1 53 54 then the electrophilic substitution of oh occurred on the isoxazole ring of tp 283 1 to form tp 299 54 and continued to induce the isoxazole ring opening to produce tp 245 53 and tp 226 besides amino group on the benzene ring the cs bond was also likely to be attacked by 1o2 52 as a side path of degradation path i the cs bond of tp 267 1 broke down under the attack of 1o2 and tp 140 was generated in this path 55 degradation path ii was initiated by oh oxidation of the branched alkyl on the isoxazole ring of smx which resulted in hydroformylation to form tp 267 2 15 and carboxylation to produce tp 283 2 15 further attacks of oh would lead to the opening of isoxazole ring and the gradual formation of tp 273 tp 186 tp 188 15 and tp 173 1 53 degradation path iii was originated by gradual hydroxylation and oh would firstly attacked the benzene ring of smx to form tp 269 53 the isoxazole ring of tp 269 was then oxidized and broken to generate tp 231 53 and tp 173 2 15 respectively owing to hydroxyl substitution of tp173 2 tp 193 55 was subsequently formed in this path 3 7 toxicity changes and prediction the intermediates detection results showed that many tps were produced during the rapid degradation of smx in mw uv process however the tps could not be completely mineralized due to the short reaction time the structures of the tps were varied and their toxicity and potential ecological risk were still unknown therefore the toxicity changes of smx solution during mw uv degradation were studied to evaluate the ecological risk of smx and its tps in mw uv degradation process accordingly the smx degradation process could be further optimized from the perspective of toxicity control firstly the acute toxicity changes of smx and its tps in mw uv process were investigated using the luminescence inhibition rate of luminescent bacteria as the evaluation index as illustrated in fig s2 the luminescence inhibition rate of smx solution showed a downward trend with the extension of degradation time indicating that the overall acute toxicity of smx solution decreased and the ecological safety was improved during the mw uv degradation of smx specifically the acute toxicity of smx and its tps went down in the first 5 min but slightly went up after 5 min of reaction suggesting that some tps with higher acute toxicity might be produced or the concentration of the existed tps with higher toxicity might be elevated after 5 min of reaction for further understanding the toxicity of smx and its tps ecosar software was applied to predict the acute and chronic toxicity of smx and the tps the calculation results were summarized in table s4 and the toxicity level of the tps was respectively graded according to the global harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals in table s2 the toxicity prediction results of smx and its tps were comprehensively demonstrated in fig 10 in general daphnid was the most sensitive organism to the toxicity of smx and its tps according to the ecosar prediction results the acute toxicity of tp 299 tp 140 tp 269 tp173 2 and tp 193 to fish was greater than that of smx itself which reached the level of harmful but for daphnid and green algae the toxicity of all the tps was basically less than or approximately equal to that of smx referring to the results in fig s2 the small elevation in the acute toxicity of the tps produced after 5 min of reaction might be caused by the increase on the concentration of intermediates with smaller molecules but higher toxicity such as tp 173 2 and tp 140 overall the acute toxicity was controllable and tended to decrease during the mw uv degradation of smx which was consistent with the results in fig s2 thus the mw uv process could effectively control and reduce the acute toxicity of smx as for the prediction results of chronic toxicity the toxicity of most tps was less than or equal to smx however the chronic toxicity of tp 267 1 tp 283 1 and tp 226 to fish was greater than smx itself reaching the very toxic level at the same time the chronic toxicity of tp 267 1 tp 283 1 tp 299 tp 140 tp 269 tp 173 2 and tp 193 to green algae was also higher than smx arriving at the degree of toxic the results indicated that the mw uv process could reduce chronic toxicity to a certain extent however the formation of some intermediates with high chronic toxicity should still be vigilant furthermore the phenol amide group in tp 299 tp 269 and tp 173 2 was the main factor leading to their increased toxicity while the phenol group in tp 140 and tp 193 was the important reason for their higher toxicity analyzed from the perspective of substance structure meanwhile the acute and chronic toxicity of tp 245 to all the three organisms were significantly less than those of tp 299 indicating that the opening of isoxazole ring could favor the detoxification of smx intermediates 4 conclusions a chemical less microwave enhanced photolysis process was established for smx decomposition and non thermal effects of microwave significantly improved the photolysis degradation efficiency and shortened the degradation procedure 96 7 of smx could be removed after 140 s of mw uv treatment under microwave power of 400 w and uv light intensity of 23 0 mw cm2 with the maximum uv wavelength at 254 nm while only 75 2 and 6 6 of smx could be decomposed by bare uv and bare mw treatments respectively at the same time kinetics study showed that the half live of smx was only 5 s in mw uv process which was much shorter than 67 s in uv process and 1386 s in mw process respectively mw uv process was also effective for smx degradation in different actual water matrices and the removal efficiency followed the order of dw rw sww sw however ha and nitrate in actual water still could inhibit the degradation of smx which should be paid attention in practical application ros detections revealed that smx degradation by mw uv followed non radicals dominated strategy meanwhile a total of 16 intermediates were detected in mw uv degradation of smx and three degradation pathways based on 1o2 and oh oxidation were proposed according to the structural characteristics of these intermediates besides toxicity evaluation of smx and the intermediates suggested that mw uv process could effectively reduce the toxicity of smx and control the ecological risk in the degradation of smx although a few intermediates with toxicity higher than smx generated in the reaction process this study provides a facile method for smx degradation without additional chemical reagents and the toxicity of byproducts could be effectively controlled the mw uv process is also efficient and easy to operate for smx degradation in a variety of practical water matrices which pave the way for practical application of mw uv in water purification abbreviations smx sulfamethoxazole mw uv microwave enhanced photolysis

12888,the traditional air flotation device with a single structure cannot fully satisfy the requirements of oil droplets growth at different conglomeration stages in crew cold rolling emulsion wastewater treatment thus leading to relatively poor demulsification effect to address this concern a novel integrated sequential air flotation device was carved out besides two kinds of organic and inorganic demulsifiers were collectively used in sequence to give full play to the advantages of this device the optimal operating conditions were determined by single factor experiments and response surface analysis and the performance of the entire device was evaluated the possible demulsification mechanism was investigated by fitr and gcms results for crew the interfacial tension ift membrane rupture rate and micrograph observation in the actual wastewater treatment the cod removal efficiency increased from 93 to 98 compared with a single air flotation device this research provides theoretical guidance for the metallurgy emulsion treatment graphical abstract a novel integrated sequential air flotation device was carved out besides two kinds of organic and inorganic demulsifiers were collectively used in sequence to give full play to the advantages of this device unlabelled image keywords demulsification demulsifiers diffusion air flotation dissolved air flotation emulsion wastewater 1 introduction in the cold rolling production emulsion lubrication is often used to reduce the abrasion effect of the steel rolling process at present the emulsions commonly used in the chinese cold rolling industry mainly consist of base oil and other components include non ionic and anionic surfactants extreme pressure agents antioxidants and rust inhibitors etc among those components base oil is a complex mixture composed of some kinds of hydrocarbons with high boiling point high molecular weight alongside non hydrocarbons and other macromolecular organic substances 1 surfactant is an amphiphilic substance that could make the base oil dispersed uniformly in water to form a stable emulsion in addition the crew are usually added with various substances such as rust inhibitors antibacterial agents preservatives etc which further complicate their chemical compositions and more difficult to handle 2 3 at the same time crew will cause great potential harm to the environment 4 5 nowadays the air flotation method is commonly used to treat oily emulsion wastewater the principle is to inject fine air bubbles into the water to accelerate them to adhere to the surface of the oil droplets and form a scum layer to separate from the water rajak 6 research showed that the theoretical maximum oil removal efficiency of air flotation treatment oil emulsion can be close to 98 karhu 7 et al enhanced daf with a coagulant which can reduce cod by 70 when treating actual oily wastewater chen 8 et al found that microbubble flotation was more efficient than macrobubble flotation in the treatment of heavy oil wastewater etchepare 9 et al handled emulsified crude oil in saline water by dissolved air flotation with micro and nanobubbles the overall efficiency of the flotation process from 73 to 84 and from 92 to 95 respectively furthermore the use of a more reasonable demulsifier is also the key to improving the effect of air flotation tang 10 and others developed a new type of composite flocculant which had a good removal effect on a variety of oily emulsion wastewaters and the maximum values of oil removal efficiency and cod removal efficiency were 96 9 and 95 4 respectively despite some progress has been made in some fields to date their practical application is still severely limited therefore developing a combination of green and efficient combined treatment process has become a rigid demand for crew treatment today in view of this the main objectives of this study are invented a novel type of sequential air flotation device investigated its reliability and optimal working conditions evaluated the demulsification performance of joint use of two kinds of demulsifiers combined with this device explored the effect on removal efficiency under different influencing factors and summarized main demulsification mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals used in this study are of

from jiangsu haian chemical factory 2 2 preparation of simulated wastewater the actual raw emulsion wastewater in this experiment was drawn from the chromium plating production lines in the large size cold rolling plant in china the prepared waste water was prepared by referring to the quality of waste water and using quaker brand rolling oil when configuring dissolved 9 g of quaker crude oil in 1 l of water petroleum content 7845 mg additive content 1155 mg and stirred at 1500 rpm for 30 min to fully mix the oil phase and the water phase the comparison of simulated wastewater and real wastewater quality was shown in table 1 2 3 new integrated air flotation device this integrated air flotation device fig 1 was mainly composed of five parts as follows aeration zone diffusion air flotation reaction zone pressurized dissolved air flotation reaction zone scum scraping system and drainage system the core reaction zone includes two parts the diffusion air flotation was applied in the front section where inorganic coagulants was input followed by a pressurized dissolved air flotation using non ionic polymer as demulsifier the influent water first entered the diffusion air flotation zone where the inorganic coagulant was added and mixed into the emulsion through a strong mechanical stirring the generated fine flocs bubbles conglomerates floated up and flowed into the next reaction zone the residual oil droplets in the supernatant after the first stage of coagulation separation were mixed with the air in the sequent pressurized dissolved air flotation zone the non ionic polymer demulsifier was put into this region in a bid to further promote the demulsification of the residual oil droplets and make them collide with one another and grow larger in addition a sludge return system was set to fetch the aggregated oil particles to re enter the diffusion air flotation zone for the purpose that these particles would act as crystals for rapid formation of the conglomerates in the whole reaction area which could effectively improve the demulsification efficiency 2 4 experimental methods 2 4 1 static demulsification experiment in this experiment an erlenmeyer flask with 1000 ml of emulsion was placed in a shaker at 60 c and 200 rpm for preheating for 10 min then took 100 ml of each emulsion and placed it in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask and added a specified amount of the compound demulsifier solution in the erlenmeyer flask the stirring program was set to fast stirring 300 rpm for 1 min medium speed stirring 100 rpm for 2 min and slow speed stirring 50 rpm for 5 min after stirring let it settle in a 60 c water bath for 60 min to observe the coagulation effect and pipetted 10 ml of clear liquid and diluted 10 times to determine cod 2 4 2 dynamic experiment first put the conical flask containing the emulsion in a shaker at 60 c and 200 rpm for preheating for 10 min then the preheated emulsion entered into an integrated apparatus and underwent the air flotation treatment 2 5 analysis method in this experiment infrared spectroscopy oil analyzer et1500 mxkinley usa was used to measure the remaining oil content in the water sample observation of oil droplets size distribution during aggregation of emulsion droplets with a photomicrography system olympusbx53 shanghai shangguang microscope shanghai china the hanging drop method was used to test the strength of the interface membrane 11 the potassium dichromate method was used to determine the cod value the zeta potential was measured by a potential analyzer zetasizer 3000hsa malvern uk response surface analysis was produced by design expert 8 software gc ms agilent 6890 n agilent technologies usa and ftir nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa were used to characterize the emulsion wastewater and determine the composition of different components in the emulsion and the types of surfactants the dynamic interfacial tension between crew and the compound demulsifier solution was measured with a spinning droplet tensiometer tx 500c beijing shengwei technology beijing china at 6000 rpm 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of crew composition gc ms results fig s1a showed that the emulsion contained a large amount of linear branched long chain alkanes and alkyl substituted cycloalkanes the majority of oil substances in emulsion were mineral oil meanwhile the main surfactant components in emulsion were some macromolecular alcohols containing long chain alkanes and fatty acid esters with carboxyl structure 12 the strong absorption band at 3446 cm 1 in the ftir fig 5a spectrum of emulsion may refer to alcoholic hydroxyl groups the emulsion contained a large number of alcoholic hydroxyl structures as its hydrophilic groups the bands at 2917 cm 1 2845 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 may represent the stretching vibration bands of ch3 and ch2 indicating that the emulsion contained more alkyl structures which constituted its hydrophobic parts 13 15 the absorption band at 722 cm 1 further confirmed the presence of multiple ch2 structures in emulsion which proved that emulsion contained more asphaltenes 16 18 in summary the hydrophilic groups in the emulsion surfactant mainly referred to some polar functional groups while hydrophobic ones to long chain alkanes and asphaltenes were adsorbed on the interfacial membrane these characteristics made the oil droplets quite stable and difficult to separate from water 3 2 demulsification effect of inorganic metal salt coagulants polyferric sulfate pfs polyaluminum chloride pac ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 7h2o and ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o were selected to compare the demulsification effects fig s2a showed that the demulsification effect of ferrous sulfate was the most significant and cod removal efficiency reached 85 the removal efficiencies of polyferric sulfate and ferric sulfate were 80 and 78 respectively whereas pac had the lowest additionally given that ferrous sulphate was relatively cheaper than the other ones it was taken as the best flocculant in this study as shown in fig s2b at low concentrations as the dosage of ferrous iron rose the degradation efficiency of cod gradually boosted this was due to the increase of fe oh 3 colloids formed by the gradual hydrolysis of ferrous sulfate which could entrap colloidal oil droplets through sweep flocculation 19 likewise zeta potential test results showed that the iron sulfite had a remarkable electrical neutralization effect besides sweep flocculation but when ferrous sulfate was added excessively the electrical reversal on the surface of colloids would occur which would re stabilize the oil droplets in the emulsion consequently the cod removal efficiency declined in summary the best dosage of ferrous sulfate was 2 g l 3 3 demulsification effect of non ionic polymer demulsifier even though ferrous sulfate had presented a considerable removal performance in the above experiments the use of ferrous sulfate alone for demulsification still could not meet the discharge requirements in china presumptively the reason came from its demulsification mechanism acting as electric neutralization and sweep flocculation in this case the demulsification proceeded on by only changing the surface charges characteristics of the oily substances as a whole while the structure of the surfactant covering on the outer layer of the oil droplets left unchanged therefore the de oiling effect in this primary stage was insufficient it is necessary to further damage or destroy partially the interfacial membrane structure of surfactant the key source of stability of oil droplet 20 21 and lay bare a variety of oil components underneath the interface membrane essentially those oil components predominantly long chain alkane were prone to aggregating into larger droplets and readily separating from the emulsion to this end the polymer demulsifiers were applied to continue the demulsification process down the track the demulsification mechanism of non ionic polymer demulsifier was shown in the fig 6a and b theoretically the emulsion molecules would inherently squeeze with each other resulting in a loss in the total quantity of molecules in the membrane and the interface membrane became thinner as a result interfacial tension was formed accelerating water molecules to flow into the interface membrane from the outside the rapid flow of water molecules would form a water film in the interfacial membrane which would hinder the transfer of substances on both sides of the membrane and the accumulation of the oil droplets 22 therefore the stability of emulsion is mainly reckoned to stem from this aspect when the demulsifier was put into the emulsion it could replace the original membrane forming molecules by making full use of its higher activity and quickly fill the space within the membrane in the absence of most of the other molecules 23 soon afterwards a majority of the segments in the demulsifier would be absorbed on the interface through hydrogen bonds and have a strong tendency of stretching across it accordingly the inter molecular interactions and the interface tension could be effectively reduced in accompany with the thinning of the interface membrane which made it rather easier for the aggregation of droplets 24 in this way it achieved further and more thorough demulsification effect by changing the membrane structure 3 3 1 effect of type of non ionic polymer demulsifiers on the basis of the ferrous sulfate treatment in the initial stage the supernatant was added with different kinds of non ionic polymer demulsifiers to further destabilize of the oil droplets by means of producing some changes or damages upon inter membranes between the surfactants and the main oily components we selected 9 common non ionic polymer demulsifiers for experiments namely ae9901 ae1910 ar036 ar015 sp169 f68 p84 l45 and l64 the introduction of non ionic polymer demulsifier was shown in the table s1 cod removal efficiencies of different demulsifiers were shown as fig 2a evidently the removal effect of ae9901 and ar036 was the best at 92 it could be seen that the non ionic polymer demulsifier could further improve the cod removal efficiency on the foundation of the structural changes damages of interface membrane amid these demulsifers in particular ae9901 and ar036 had relatively larger molecular weights with more branched chains which could provide more chances for the demulsifer molecules diffusing to the vicinity of the interface membrane by this means it occupied a larger surface area on the interface membrane which greatly reduced the tension of the interface membrane 25 besides the crew used in this experiment contained a lot of asphaltenes under normal situations asphaltene molecular with large size could be adsorbed on the interfacial membrane to form a firmly attached coating which made the emulsion strongly stable 26 27 when the asphaltenes were dispersed and became smaller more voids would be exposed on the interfacial membrane and the demulsifier would be more easily adsorbed on the interfacial membrane 28 the particle size of asphaltene relied on the aromaticity of its surrounding oil phase environment both ae and ar demulsifiers contained aryl groups and the enhancement in aromaticity made the balancing state of asphaltenes shift from aggregation to dispersion and reduced their average particle size 29 accordingly the coating effect of asphaltene was weakened and it was easier to be replaced by demulsifier molecules comparatively for sp169 demulsifier with a simple molecular structure and fewer branched chains structure its demulsification effect apparently was the worst in short ae9901 and ar036 demulsifiers were used to demulsify the emulsion 3 3 2 effect of compound of non ionic polymer demulsifiers the combined use of demulsifiers in applications could collectively take the advantages of their own features which could achieve better demulsification effects 30 31 the initiator of the ae type demulsifier was polyethylene polyamine a strong hydrophilic polymer which had a long molecular chain with many branches with high hlb hydrophile lipophile balance number value however higher hlb means higher repulsion between hydrophilic end and weaker hydrophobic association 32 whereas the initiator of ar type demulsifier was alkyl phenolic resin with a stronger lipophilicity and relatively lower molecular weight in the course of demulsification when the demulsifier was adsorbed on the interfacial membrane the lipophilic end extended into the oil phase and the hydrophilic end did into the water phase due to the different adsorption capacities of the lipophilic and the hydrophilic end of those demulsifiers the adsorption balance on the interfacial membrane would change the end towards the water phase would hold back the accumulation of oil droplets due to the steric hindrance and therefore the more lipophilic the demulsifier moved towards the oil phase as a whole the less affected it was fig 6c according to this principle the combination of ae9901 and ar036 demulsifier was selected in this study for the sake of making both of them play into their strengths together when the compound demulsifier was added its aromaticity weakened the coating of membrane molecules by the asphaltene and more contact sites on the interface membrane were exposed the characteristics of large molecular weight and many branches allowed it to quickly occupy and fill up these contact sites replacing the membrane molecules and resulting in weakening of the stability of the interfacial membrane after the adsorption equilibrium was reached because the compound demulsifier had strong lipophilicity the steric hindrance effect caused by the hydrophilic end was less significant and the oil droplets were more likely to accumulate as a result such a compound demulsifier had high efficient membrane replacement ability and the aggregation between oil droplets was also improved fig 2 b showed that when the compound ratio was 1 2 in ae9901 ar036 the efficiency of compound demulsifier could reach up to about 94 better than single one under this ratio with more share of ar036 the compound demulsifier had better lipophilicity and was less affected by the steric hindrance which was in favor of improving the demulsification the best effect was achieved when the dosage of compound demulsifier was 200 mg l at this moment the replacement of the demulsifier molecules for the interfacial membrane molecules reached equilibrium alongside the interfacial membrane tension dropped down to the minimum naturally if an excessive amount of demulsifier continued to be added the cod degradation efficiency was almost unchanged 33 specifically the polymer demulsifier had higher activity and could seep into the oil water interface to replace the surfactant molecules previously occupied on the membrane this characteristic made it array loosely on the interface and effectively reduce the intermolecular interactions as a result the strength of the w o interfacial membrane would decrease which was favorable for the subsequent demulsification 3 4 effect of initial conditions of influent on static demulsification experiment 3 4 1 effect of initial ph of influent fig s3a showed that the optimal initial ph was about 8 and the cod degradation efficiency was about 95 at this time in the case of a strong acid environment cod degradation efficiency was low because the amount of h was too much to form adequate fe oh 3 for sweeping flocculation when the ph was too high hydrated ferric iron would be hydrolyzed to produce hydroxyl ferric ions the ferric hydroxide colloids were liable to be destroyed 34 and the demulsification efficiency was reduced in order to explore the influence of the initial ph value on the demulsification stage the ph change of the supernatant in the coagulation stage was tested fig 2c the experimental ph value was the ph range of crew the results showed that the ph value of the supernatant tended to be neutral within half an hour after the addition of ferrous sulfate which was due to an increase in acidity of the ferrous sulfate aqueous solution the asphaltenes polar groups 35 were charged at both high and low ph which could improve surface activity the charged asphaltenes were more likely to accumulate and hinder the demulsification process the polar groups of the lipophilic base of the emulsion would also be affected by this reason which reduced the replacement efficiency of the demulsifier similarly for non ionic demulsifiers it dissolved in water without dissociating ions and had no charge which would prefer a neutral environment in this sense a neutral environment is more conducive to demulsification 3 4 2 effect of initial temperature of influent for the coagulation stage high temperature could strengthen the hydrolysis ability of ferrous sulfate 36 and increase the size of oil droplets 37 which was beneficial to the formation of flocs temperature also was an important factor that affected the effect of non ionic polymer demulsifiers as fig 6c after the demulsifier molecules were hydrolyzed the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide segments were adsorbed into the water phase and on the interface membrane respectively as the temperature rose both began to move towards the oil phase eventually ethylene oxide began to be adsorbed on the interfacial membrane and the propylene oxide segment completely entered the oil phase 38 this characteristic indicated that when the temperature raised the hydrophilic end gradually became shorter by ensuring that the demulsifier molecules were entirely adsorbed on the interfacial membrane the steric hindrance in the water phase would be greatly reduced and the polymerization of oil droplets would accelerate the experimental results fig s3b showed that 60 c was the best reaction temperature for the compound demulsifier considering the temperature of the actual crew outlet was usually 60 c 70 c there was no need to adjust the temperature to ensure the demulsification effect which proved that this compound demulsifier had better practicability and economy so as to better explore the effect of temperature on the effect of the demulsifier the effect of temperature on the strength of the interfacial membrane was tested and the results were as fig 2d as the temperature became higher the rupture effect of the interfacial membrane rose sharply and the strength of the interfacial membrane continued to go down obviously it further confirmed the importance of temperature for non ionic polymer demulsifiers in the initial stage of the reaction the reaction effect was better at 80 c when the reaction reached 60 min the reaction temperature of 60 c could also obtain the same performance as at 80 c 3 5 response surface method optimization experiment 3 5 1 response surface method experimental design this experiment used design expert 8 software and adopted the central combination design method box boheken to carry out a three factor and three level experimental design for the treatment of emulsion wastewater by the compound demulsifier on the basis of static experimental methods and results three factors of the initial ph value of wastewater the reaction temperature and the dosage of demulsifier were selected among them the ratio of demulsifier was ferrous sulfate ae9901 ar036 30 1 2 the final effluent cod concentration was used as the response value then analyzed the main effects of the three factors and the interaction between the factors on the demulsification effect the horizontal distribution of the factors was shown in table s2 among them a b and c represented initial ph value reaction temperature and dosage of demulsifier respectively and 1 0 and 1 referred to the three levels of each factor respectively the experimental plan and experimental results were shown in table 2 among them the reaction conditions of the five groups of experiments 1 7 9 10 and 13 were completely the same and their main purpose was to test the random errors in the experiment process 3 5 2 model establishment of cod removal efficiency and significance test according to the data in table 2 the second order empirical model of the bbd response surface method were 1 y a 0 a 1 a a 2 b a 3 c a 11 a 2 a 22 b 2 a 33 c 2 a 12 ab a 13 ac a 23 bc among them y represented the predicted response value a0 was a constant factor a1 a2 a3 was a linear effect coefficient a11 a22 a33was a second order effect coefficient a12 a13 a23 was an interaction effect coefficient and a b and c represented the level values of each factor substituted the data in table 2 into eq 1 the equation of the quadratic polynomial regression model for the three main influencing factors of demulsification reaction were 2 y 65 95 1 38 a 22 45 b 12 43 c 1 06 ab 0 09 ac 0 08 bc 1 51 a 2 2 59 b 2 0 68 c 2 the results of the analysis of variance of the model were shown in table 3 from the results of the analysis of variance in table 2 it could be seen that the fitting model f 54 37 which was much greater than 1 indicating that the model was highly significant and its p 0 0001 and the lack of fit term p 0 05 stated that the model had a good fitting result and strong significance greater than 99 99 without obvious error the f value of the three influencing factors in the table was fa fc fb from large to small consequently the order of factors from high to low as ph value demulsifier dosage temperature the p values of ab ac and bc were all greater than 0 05 illustrating that there was a certain weak interaction between each factor the p value of ac was 0 35 closer to 0 05 indicating that the interaction between the demulsifier dosage and the ph value was more striking than that between other factors the analysis of variance was performed on the data in table 3 and the results were shown in table s3 it could be seen from table s3 that the fitting coefficient of the model was r2 0 9820 which was close to 1 the correction coefficient r2 adj 0 9782 close to r2 the coefficient of variation c v 5 38 10 and the dispersion was small which proved that the model had good stability accuracy and high reliability the adeq precision was 45 5635 4 indicating that the model was more reasonable it could also be seen from fig s4 that the results obtained by the response surface experiment were more concentrated on both sides of the predicted cod degradation efficiency which also verified that the model had a better fitting effect and the predicted value was very close to the actual value 3 5 3 interaction analysis of various process parameters fig 3 results above showed that the interaction between the dosage of demulsifier and the ph value was more significant the optimal inlet water ph was between 7 2 and 7 7 with a small range of variation the ph of the actual crew used in this experiment was about 7 8 and could suitably match this range of the optimal ph without additional adjustment needed which could not only underpin a good effect but also save economic costs furthermore on the grounds of strong relevance between the ph and dosage when a fluctuation in the load of raw emulsion called for a vivid and timely response in the demulsifer dosage control this feature of ph self adjustment would be much helpful to sum up response surface analysis explored the relationship between various factors and the treatment effect under the overall static experiment it showed that the demulsification scheme of this experiment could achieve excellent demulsification effect only by using the close to original conditions of crew effluent which had superior economy and applicability the cod degradation efficiency predicted by the model under this condition was 95 97 according to this experimental condition several verification experiments were carried out and the average cod degradation efficiency obtained was 95 32 which was very close to the predicted value it was proved that the established model was highly accurate and could be used to predict the demulsification effect under actual operation conditions 3 6 analysis of the demulsification mechanism of compound demulsifier through the comprehensive analysis of the results of ftir fig 5a it could be found that the composition and properties of the oily substance before and after the reaction were quite different compared with cold rolling crude oil the oily substance had no obvious absorption band at 3700 3200 cm 1 after treatment it may be that the non ionic polymer emulsifier destroyed the interface layer resulting in the appearance of short chain substances containing alcoholic hydroxyl groups the bands at 2917 cm 1 2845 cm 1 1460 cm 1 1740 cm 1 and 1162 cm 1 did not change significantly indicating that the separated oily substance still contained long chain alkanes and fatty acid esters that is the mineral oil and fatty acid esters in the water body were separated from the water sample from the side the removal of cod in the water body mainly depended on the coagulation and destabilization of the compound demulsifier to separate the organic pollutants from the water body rather than degrading macromolecular organic matter the gcms analysis fig s1b of the oily substance after the reaction detected the cleavage of the long chain alkane of the surfactant in the emulsion this testified that the structure of interface membrane changed and the asphaltenes were dispersed as a result macromolecular organic pollutants such as oils are separated from the water and under the action of coagulation the small size oil droplets wrapped by the surfactant were further removed the cod value of the water body had dropped significantly this showed that the analysis results of gcms and ftir were consistent with the previous experimental results it also can be observed in the micrographs in fig 5b that the oil droplets were uniformly dispersed into smaller ones at the initial stage of the reaction after the composite demulsifier was added it penetrated into the interfacial membrane which reduced the stability of the membrane and resulted in the separation of oil and water those irregular oil droplets approached each other and gradually aggregated into larger oil droplets this was also confirmed by the dynamic interfacial tension change in fig 5d all in all an in depth elaboration on the demulsification mechanism of the compound demulsifier was presented as follows the compounded demulsifier first contacted the asphaltenes in the outer layer of the emulsion due to the polarity of its own ether bonds the aromatic groups in the phenolic resin were linked to the asphaltenes by hydrogen bonding which reduced the attraction among the asphaltenes and increased the solubility 39 the tendency of asphaltenes aggregation on the interfacial membrane decreased thus exposing more contact sites on the membrane the characteristics of large molecular weight and multi branched chains of demulsifier the made it have an advantage in the adsorption competition over the original membrane molecules resulting in a large number of the latter ones being displaced consequently the demulsifier molecules were adsorbed on the interfacial membrane through hydrogen bonds and the membrane strength decreased under the two phase stretching action of the lipophilic and the hydrophilic end at the same time the water film effect was weakened and the polymerization resistance between oil droplets dropped further which could effectively realize the destabilization of the most droplets finally the approaching oil droplets could be more likely to gradually agglomerate into large sized aggregates which was conducive to further separation and removing oil droplets from the water 3 7 application of new integrated air flotation device based on the characteristics of the different demulsifiers used above we subdivided the oil droplet removal process into two stages the primary destabilization stage and the secondary aggregation stage in the primary destabilization stage the main purpose of the oil droplets was to form larger dense flocs in the secondary aggregation stage the main purpose of the oil droplets was to separate from the water phase and float for removal for this reason different treatment areas were purposely set up to satisfy the requirements of different oil droplets growth stages in the integrated sequential air flotation device 3 7 1 primary destabilization stage the diffusion air flotation zone was set up as the reaction zone of the aggregation stage the diffusion air flotation zone included a coagulation reaction zone at the front and a diffusion air flotation zone at the back in the coagulation reaction zone ferrous sulfate was added to flocculate the tiny oil droplets to produce primary flocs it was reported that coagulation could reduce the electrostatic repulsion between air bubbles and oil droplets thus the bubbles were easily adhered and collided with the oil droplets in subsequent processing 40 in the diffusion air flotation zone the stirring of the impeller could provide sufficient g gradient for coagulation meanwhile the average size of fine bubbles formed under an appropriate stirring intensity through the diffusion air flotation was roughly equivalent to that of the aggregates generated simultaneously in the course of primary coagulation this feature would give rise to more opportunities of collision among the oil particles and in turn fulfill a highly efficient agglomeration of bubble flocs 41 hence at this stage influent flow and stirring intensity were selected as the main influencing factors for the operation of the diffusion air flotation zone it could be seen from fig 4a that when the influent flow was small the removal efficiency of cod and oil began to go up significantly with the ascent of the influent flow under the cooperation of air bubble vibration and stirring the collision efficiency between emulsion molecules and oily colloidal particles steadily rose the cod and oil removal efficiency also reached the maximum value of 98 5 and 98 2 when the influent flow was 1 5 m3 h however when the influent flow increased further the demulsification efficiency decreased instead excessive influent flow would strengt1hen the shear force in the water body which caused the already grown flocs to be destroyed and the oil droplets returned to the water phase in addition it also hindered the collision between bubbles and emulsion and prevented the re generation of flocs consequently the demulsification efficiency was reduced as could be seen from the fig 4b when the stirring intensity was too small the energy for collisions between particles was insufficient which made those particles hard to squeeze and penetrate with each other as a result the ferrous sulfate could not effectively play the role of sweeping flocculation and the coagulation effect was relatively poor when the bubbles grew close to the size of the flocs under a rational stirring intensity the collision efficiency between the bubble and the flocs reached the maximum which promoted the oil removal efficiency up to the top 98 85 likewise excessive stirring intensity would destroy the formed flocs and the coagulation effect would be worse 3 7 2 secondary aggregation stage the diffusion air flotation could remove a majority of small oil droplets from the emulsion followed by the dissolved flotation zone with the aim to deal with the larger particles gradually formed in the sequent stage the non ionic polymer compound demulsifier was added in the pressurized mixing zone in an attempt to demolish the interfacial membrane and realize further destabilization of the oil droplets in this way the primary flocs could continue to grow the detailed process for air bubbles growth in this phase would be expounded as follows as shown in the fig 6d for the conventional air flotation the bubbles could not be adsorbed and fixed inside the flocs so they mainly uplifted the flocs from the outside but for the dissolved air flotation in this study more microbubbles could be generated with a more uniform shape and a looser structure as for the larger flocs formed at this stage the voids inside the flocs were also increasing the microbubbles produced by dissolved air flotation could be thoroughly absorbed inside the larger flocs and grew up with them this feature reduced the density of flocs and ramped them up to form a hollow inner structure 42 as a consequence they were apt to float up with higher speed and readily gather with each other for this reason at this stage air water ratio was selected as the main influencing factors as shown in the fig 4c when the air water ratio in the dissolved air flotation zone was relatively low the oil removal was poor this was because in the case of insufficient aeration the number of bubbles produced was small at this time the oil removal was accomplished mainly through the action of gravity and a large number of oil droplets could not be adsorbed within the flocs formed through the addition of the polymers with high molecular weight as the aeration intensity went on rising the cod and oil content of the effluent would drop down significantly in this process the tiny bubbles produced during the dissolved air flotation would contribute to fabricate a hollow structure in the flocs which was beneficial to the oil removal improvement on the whole the cod and oil removal efficiency reached the maximum values of 98 3 and 99 23 when the air water ratio was 18 1 as the air water ratio went well beyond a certain range the oil removal efficiency and cod removal efficiency declined instead the presumed mechanism was as follows first bubbles were more likely to collide and coalesce with each other so the excessive bubbles would reduce the chance of oil droplets colliding with bubbles secondly the grown up flocs with larger size would also disassembly due to the over intensified collision from those excessive bubbles finally the larger bubbles produced under an excessively higher air water ratio could not completely attach to the flocs and weaken the ability of flocs to float up in this case the oil droplet flocs were more easily broken apart and the removal efficiency sequentially decreased 3 7 3 actual wastewater operation experiment on the basis of the optimal operating conditions of the device obtained above continued to study the demulsification effect of the demulsification air flotation process on the crew under different water quality conditions five batches of crew were obtained from the chromium plating production line of the cold rolling workshop for five consecutive weeks fig 4d showed that the coagulation air flotation process had a better effect on actual wastewater treatment and had strong adaptability to changes in wastewater quality the cod removal efficiency of the five times all reached more than 98 which met the influent load requirements of the subsequent biological treatment and reached the expected goal as a comparison the cod removal efficiency of single coagulation air flotation in the actual wastewater treatment of crew was only about 93 fig s5 additionally china s metallurgical industry usually applied a single polymer demulsifier for demulsification which consumed at a rather high cost in this study cheap inorganic coagulant was used as the pretreatment of demulsification which reduced the dosage of relatively expensive demulsifier in practical applications it could greatly reduce costs while maintaining excellent processing results 3 8 changes in the distribution of oil droplets as shown in fig 5b the oil droplets in the system showed different spatial distributions at different times at 0 5 min the oil droplets molecules squeezed and coalesced each other to produce aggregates with larger particle sizes and the oil droplets distribution density decreased at 10 15 min the oil droplets distribution density was significantly reduced a light yellow transparent thin oil membrane began to appear on the surface of the emulsion and the primary flocs were basically formed at 20 25 min there were only a few oil droplets with larger particle size in the emulsion and at 25 min the existence of oil droplets could hardly be observed it can be concluded that the particle size of the oil droplets in the system was on the rise fig 5c and the compound demulsifiers and a combination of two kinds of air flotation processes promoted the accumulation of oil droplets when the particle size of the oil droplets reached a certain level they would surface under the influence of air bubbles the process of separating suspended particles from the water is called precipitation when the specific gravity of the particles was greater than 1 it appears to sink otherwise it will float because the density of mineral oilρ1was less than the density of waterρ2 mineral oil slowly floats upward in still water the speed of buoyancy in still water is subject to the gravity f1 of the particles in the water and the resistance f2 of the water when the particles float up during the initial process of floating up the resistance increased continuously then it reached equilibrium with gravity the acceleration became zero and the floating speed of the oil droplets became constant the floating speed of a spherical oil drop with diameter in still water was u 4 3 g c d ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 d the solution is in a static water state re 1 and the stokes formula is obtained u 1 18 ρ 2 ρ 1 μ g d 2 check the reynolds number r e ρ 2 ud μ when the oil droplet particle size was 237 48 μm r e was calculated as 1 07 according to the stokes formula the results were shown in table s4 as the oil droplets continued to accumulate their particle size and rising speed kept on rising from the attached table in fig s6 it could be seen that the particle size of the oil droplets increased by multiples starting from 5 min from fig s6 the linear fitting curve of particle size and oil droplet floating velocity was y 2 939 49 259 with the extension of time the oil droplets with a particle size larger than 13 448 μm would start to float up after 5 min because of the destruction of the interface membrane structure the tiny particles in the suspended state aggregated with each other at a fast speed the number of oil droplets larger than 13 448 μm increased significantly which was suitable for the achievement of better oil removal 4 conclusion in this work in order to solve the problem of low efficiency of single air flotation device in oil removal a novel integrated sequential air flotation device paired with compound demulsifier was used to treat emulsion wastewater the compound demulsifier could quickly pass through the asphaltene and adsorb on the interfacial membrane effectively reducing the interfacial tension and the stability of the oily droplets in addition the integrated sequential air flotation device generated large bubbles in the oil droplet aggregation stage to facilitate the effective collision between the oil droplets and form larger flocs in the oil droplet separation stage micro bubbles were generated to reduce the density of the flocs allowing them to rise quickly and escape it could better satisfy the requirements of oil droplets growth at different conglomeration stages in the course of oil removal and produced synergistic demulsification effects with different demulsifiers which could ensure the efficient removal of oil droplets in the whole process compared with the single coagulation flotation device the cod removal efficiency of the new integrated air flotation device in actual treatment increased from 93 to 98 and the treatment effect was not affected by water quality fluctuations the results of response surface analysis showed that the device had strong applicability and reliability which clearly proved the huge promotion potential and role of the integrated sequential air flotation device in crew treatment funding this work was supported by major science and technology project of

were collectively used in sequence to give full play to the advantages of this device unlabelled image keywords demulsification demulsifiers diffusion air flotation dissolved air flotation emulsion wastewater 1 introduction in the cold rolling production emulsion lubrication is often used to reduce the abrasion effect of the steel rolling process at present the emulsions commonly used in the chinese cold rolling industry mainly consist of base oil and other components include non ionic and anionic surfactants extreme pressure agents antioxidants and rust inhibitors etc among those components base oil is a complex mixture composed of some kinds of hydrocarbons with high boiling point high molecular weight alongside non hydrocarbons and other macromolecular organic substances 1 surfactant is an amphiphilic substance that could make the base oil dispersed uniformly in water to form a stable emulsion in addition the crew are usually added with various substances such as rust inhibitors antibacterial agents preservatives etc which further complicate their chemical compositions and more difficult to handle 2 3 at the same time crew will cause great potential harm to the environment 4 5 nowadays the air flotation method is commonly used to treat oily emulsion wastewater the principle is to inject fine air bubbles into the water to accelerate them to adhere to the surface of the oil droplets and form a scum layer to separate from the water rajak 6 research showed that the theoretical maximum oil removal efficiency of air flotation treatment oil emulsion can be close to 98 karhu 7 et al enhanced daf with a coagulant which can reduce cod by 70 when treating actual oily wastewater chen 8 et al found that microbubble flotation was more efficient than macrobubble flotation in the treatment of heavy oil wastewater etchepare 9 et al handled emulsified crude oil in saline water by dissolved air flotation with micro and nanobubbles the overall efficiency of the flotation process from 73 to 84 and from 92 to 95 respectively furthermore the use of a more reasonable demulsifier is also the key to improving the effect of air flotation tang 10 and others developed a new type of composite flocculant which had a good removal effect on a variety of oily emulsion wastewaters and the maximum values of oil removal efficiency and cod removal efficiency were 96 9 and 95 4 respectively despite some progress has been made in some fields to date their practical application is still severely limited therefore developing a combination of green and efficient combined treatment process has become a rigid demand for crew treatment today in view of this the main objectives of this study are invented a novel type of sequential air flotation device investigated its reliability and optimal working conditions evaluated the demulsification performance of joint use of two kinds of demulsifiers combined with this device explored the effect on removal efficiency under different influencing factors and summarized main demulsification mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals used in this study are of

cold rolling plant in china the prepared waste water was prepared by referring to the quality of waste water and using quaker brand rolling oil when configuring dissolved 9 g of quaker crude oil in 1 l of water petroleum content 7845 mg additive content 1155 mg and stirred at 1500 rpm for 30 min to fully mix the oil phase and the water phase the comparison of simulated wastewater and real wastewater quality was shown in table 1 2 3 new integrated air flotation device this integrated air flotation device fig 1 was mainly composed of five parts as follows aeration zone diffusion air flotation reaction zone pressurized dissolved air flotation reaction zone scum scraping system and drainage system the core reaction zone includes two parts the diffusion air flotation was applied in the front section where inorganic coagulants was input followed by a pressurized dissolved air flotation using non ionic polymer as demulsifier the influent water first entered the diffusion air flotation zone where the inorganic coagulant was added and mixed into the emulsion through a strong mechanical stirring the generated fine flocs bubbles conglomerates floated up and flowed into the next reaction zone the residual oil droplets in the supernatant after the first stage of coagulation separation were mixed with the air in the sequent pressurized dissolved air flotation zone the non ionic polymer demulsifier was put into this region in a bid to further promote the demulsification of the residual oil droplets and make them collide with one another and grow larger in addition a sludge return system was set to fetch the aggregated oil particles to re enter the diffusion air flotation zone for the purpose that these particles would act as crystals for rapid formation of the conglomerates in the whole reaction area which could effectively improve the demulsification efficiency 2 4 experimental methods 2 4 1 static demulsification experiment in this experiment an erlenmeyer flask with 1000 ml of emulsion was placed in a shaker at 60 c and 200 rpm for preheating for 10 min then took 100 ml of each emulsion and placed it in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask and added a specified amount of the compound demulsifier solution in the erlenmeyer flask the stirring program was set to fast stirring 300 rpm for 1 min medium speed stirring 100 rpm for 2 min and slow speed stirring 50 rpm for 5 min after stirring let it settle in a 60 c water bath for 60 min to observe the coagulation effect and pipetted 10 ml of clear liquid and diluted 10 times to determine cod 2 4 2 dynamic experiment first put the conical flask containing the emulsion in a shaker at 60 c and 200 rpm for preheating for 10 min then the preheated emulsion entered into an integrated apparatus and underwent the air flotation treatment 2 5 analysis method in this experiment infrared spectroscopy oil analyzer et1500 mxkinley usa was used to measure the remaining oil content in the water sample observation of oil droplets size distribution during aggregation of emulsion droplets with a photomicrography system olympusbx53 shanghai shangguang microscope shanghai china the hanging drop method was used to test the strength of the interface membrane 11 the potassium dichromate method was used to determine the cod value the zeta potential was measured by a potential analyzer zetasizer 3000hsa malvern uk response surface analysis was produced by design expert 8 software gc ms agilent 6890 n agilent technologies usa and ftir nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa were used to characterize the emulsion wastewater and determine the composition of different components in the emulsion and the types of surfactants the dynamic interfacial tension between crew and the compound demulsifier solution was measured with a spinning droplet tensiometer tx 500c beijing shengwei technology beijing china at 6000 rpm 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of crew composition gc ms results fig s1a showed that the emulsion contained a large amount of linear branched long chain alkanes and alkyl substituted cycloalkanes the majority of oil substances in emulsion were mineral oil meanwhile the main surfactant components in emulsion were some macromolecular alcohols containing long chain alkanes and fatty acid esters with carboxyl structure 12 the strong absorption band at 3446 cm 1 in the ftir fig 5a spectrum of emulsion may refer to alcoholic hydroxyl groups the emulsion contained a large number of alcoholic hydroxyl structures as its hydrophilic groups the bands at 2917 cm 1 2845 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 may represent the stretching vibration bands of ch3 and ch2 indicating that the emulsion contained more alkyl structures which constituted its hydrophobic parts 13 15 the absorption band at 722 cm 1 further confirmed the presence of multiple ch2 structures in emulsion which proved that emulsion contained more asphaltenes 16 18 in summary the hydrophilic groups in the emulsion surfactant mainly referred to some polar functional groups while hydrophobic ones to long chain alkanes and asphaltenes were adsorbed on the interfacial membrane these characteristics made the oil droplets quite stable and difficult to separate from water 3 2 demulsification effect of inorganic metal salt coagulants polyferric sulfate pfs polyaluminum chloride pac ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 7h2o and ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o were selected to compare the demulsification effects fig s2a showed that the demulsification effect of ferrous sulfate was the most significant and cod removal efficiency reached 85 the removal efficiencies of polyferric sulfate and ferric sulfate were 80 and 78 respectively whereas pac had the lowest additionally given that ferrous sulphate was relatively cheaper than the other ones it was taken as the best flocculant in this study as shown in fig s2b at low concentrations as the dosage of ferrous iron rose the degradation efficiency of cod gradually boosted this was due to the increase of fe oh 3 colloids formed by the gradual hydrolysis of ferrous sulfate which could entrap colloidal oil droplets through sweep flocculation 19 likewise zeta potential test results showed that the iron sulfite had a remarkable electrical neutralization effect besides sweep flocculation but when ferrous sulfate was added excessively the electrical reversal on the surface of colloids would occur which would re stabilize the oil droplets in the emulsion consequently the cod removal efficiency declined in summary the best dosage of ferrous sulfate was 2 g l 3 3 demulsification effect of non ionic polymer demulsifier even though ferrous sulfate had presented a considerable removal performance in the above experiments the use of ferrous sulfate alone for demulsification still could not meet the discharge requirements in china presumptively the reason came from its demulsification mechanism acting as electric neutralization and sweep flocculation in this case the demulsification proceeded on by only changing the surface charges characteristics of the oily substances as a whole while the structure of the surfactant covering on the outer layer of the oil droplets left unchanged therefore the de oiling effect in this primary stage was insufficient it is necessary to further damage or destroy partially the interfacial membrane structure of surfactant the key source of stability of oil droplet 20 21 and lay bare a variety of oil components underneath the interface membrane essentially those oil components predominantly long chain alkane were prone to aggregating into larger droplets and readily separating from the emulsion to this end the polymer demulsifiers were applied to continue the demulsification process down the track the demulsification mechanism of non ionic polymer demulsifier was shown in the fig 6a and b theoretically the emulsion molecules would inherently squeeze with each other resulting in a loss in the total quantity of molecules in the membrane and the interface membrane became thinner as a result interfacial tension was formed accelerating water molecules to flow into the interface membrane from the outside the rapid flow of water molecules would form a water film in the interfacial membrane which would hinder the transfer of substances on both sides of the membrane and the accumulation of the oil droplets 22 therefore the stability of emulsion is mainly reckoned to stem from this aspect when the demulsifier was put into the emulsion it could replace the original membrane forming molecules by making full use of its higher activity and quickly fill the space within the membrane in the absence of most of the other molecules 23 soon afterwards a majority of the segments in the demulsifier would be absorbed on the interface through hydrogen bonds and have a strong tendency of stretching across it accordingly the inter molecular interactions and the interface tension could be effectively reduced in accompany with the thinning of the interface membrane which made it rather easier for the aggregation of droplets 24 in this way it achieved further and more thorough demulsification effect by changing the membrane structure 3 3 1 effect of type of non ionic polymer demulsifiers on the basis of the ferrous sulfate treatment in the initial stage the supernatant was added with different kinds of non ionic polymer demulsifiers to further destabilize of the oil droplets by means of producing some changes or damages upon inter membranes between the surfactants and the main oily components we selected 9 common non ionic polymer demulsifiers for experiments namely ae9901 ae1910 ar036 ar015 sp169 f68 p84 l45 and l64 the introduction of non ionic polymer demulsifier was shown in the table s1 cod removal efficiencies of different demulsifiers were shown as fig 2a evidently the removal effect of ae9901 and ar036 was the best at 92 it could be seen that the non ionic polymer demulsifier could further improve the cod removal efficiency on the foundation of the structural changes damages of interface membrane amid these demulsifers in particular ae9901 and ar036 had relatively larger molecular weights with more branched chains which could provide more chances for the demulsifer molecules diffusing to the vicinity of the interface membrane by this means it occupied a larger surface area on the interface membrane which greatly reduced the tension of the interface membrane 25 besides the crew used in this experiment contained a lot of asphaltenes under normal situations asphaltene molecular with large size could be adsorbed on the interfacial membrane to form a firmly attached coating which made the emulsion strongly stable 26 27 when the asphaltenes were dispersed and became smaller more voids would be exposed on the interfacial membrane and the demulsifier would be more easily adsorbed on the interfacial membrane 28 the particle size of asphaltene relied on the aromaticity of its surrounding oil phase environment both ae and ar demulsifiers contained aryl groups and the enhancement in aromaticity made the balancing state of asphaltenes shift from aggregation to dispersion and reduced their average particle size 29 accordingly the coating effect of asphaltene was weakened and it was easier to be replaced by demulsifier molecules comparatively for sp169 demulsifier with a simple molecular structure and fewer branched chains structure its demulsification effect apparently was the worst in short ae9901 and ar036 demulsifiers were used to demulsify the emulsion 3 3 2 effect of compound of non ionic polymer demulsifiers the combined use of demulsifiers in applications could collectively take the advantages of their own features which could achieve better demulsification effects 30 31 the initiator of the ae type demulsifier was polyethylene polyamine a strong hydrophilic polymer which had a long molecular chain with many branches with high hlb hydrophile lipophile balance number value however higher hlb means higher repulsion between hydrophilic end and weaker hydrophobic association 32 whereas the initiator of ar type demulsifier was alkyl phenolic resin with a stronger lipophilicity and relatively lower molecular weight in the course of demulsification when the demulsifier was adsorbed on the interfacial membrane the lipophilic end extended into the oil phase and the hydrophilic end did into the water phase due to the different adsorption capacities of the lipophilic and the hydrophilic end of those demulsifiers the adsorption balance on the interfacial membrane would change the end towards the water phase would hold back the accumulation of oil droplets due to the steric hindrance and therefore the more lipophilic the demulsifier moved towards the oil phase as a whole the less affected it was fig 6c according to this principle the combination of ae9901 and ar036 demulsifier was selected in this study for the sake of making both of them play into their strengths together when the compound demulsifier was added its aromaticity weakened the coating of membrane molecules by the asphaltene and more contact sites on the interface membrane were exposed the characteristics of large molecular weight and many branches allowed it to quickly occupy and fill up these contact sites replacing the membrane molecules and resulting in weakening of the stability of the interfacial membrane after the adsorption equilibrium was reached because the compound demulsifier had strong lipophilicity the steric hindrance effect caused by the hydrophilic end was less significant and the oil droplets were more likely to accumulate as a result such a compound demulsifier had high efficient membrane replacement ability and the aggregation between oil droplets was also improved fig 2 b showed that when the compound ratio was 1 2 in ae9901 ar036 the efficiency of compound demulsifier could reach up to about 94 better than single one under this ratio with more share of ar036 the compound demulsifier had better lipophilicity and was less affected by the steric hindrance which was in favor of improving the demulsification the best effect was achieved when the dosage of compound demulsifier was 200 mg l at this moment the replacement of the demulsifier molecules for the interfacial membrane molecules reached equilibrium alongside the interfacial membrane tension dropped down to the minimum naturally if an excessive amount of demulsifier continued to be added the cod degradation efficiency was almost unchanged 33 specifically the polymer demulsifier had higher activity and could seep into the oil water interface to replace the surfactant molecules previously occupied on the membrane this characteristic made it array loosely on the interface and effectively reduce the intermolecular interactions as a result the strength of the w o interfacial membrane would decrease which was favorable for the subsequent demulsification 3 4 effect of initial conditions of influent on static demulsification experiment 3 4 1 effect of initial ph of influent fig s3a showed that the optimal initial ph was about 8 and the cod degradation efficiency was about 95 at this time in the case of a strong acid environment cod degradation efficiency was low because the amount of h was too much to form adequate fe oh 3 for sweeping flocculation when the ph was too high hydrated ferric iron would be hydrolyzed to produce hydroxyl ferric ions the ferric hydroxide colloids were liable to be destroyed 34 and the demulsification efficiency was reduced in order to explore the influence of the initial ph value on the demulsification stage the ph change of the supernatant in the coagulation stage was tested fig 2c the experimental ph value was the ph range of crew the results showed that the ph value of the supernatant tended to be neutral within half an hour after the addition of ferrous sulfate which was due to an increase in acidity of the ferrous sulfate aqueous solution the asphaltenes polar groups 35 were charged at both high and low ph which could improve surface activity the charged asphaltenes were more likely to accumulate and hinder the demulsification process the polar groups of the lipophilic base of the emulsion would also be affected by this reason which reduced the replacement efficiency of the demulsifier similarly for non ionic demulsifiers it dissolved in water without dissociating ions and had no charge which would prefer a neutral environment in this sense a neutral environment is more conducive to demulsification 3 4 2 effect of initial temperature of influent for the coagulation stage high temperature could strengthen the hydrolysis ability of ferrous sulfate 36 and increase the size of oil droplets 37 which was beneficial to the formation of flocs temperature also was an important factor that affected the effect of non ionic polymer demulsifiers as fig 6c after the demulsifier molecules were hydrolyzed the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide segments were adsorbed into the water phase and on the interface membrane respectively as the temperature rose both began to move towards the oil phase eventually ethylene oxide began to be adsorbed on the interfacial membrane and the propylene oxide segment completely entered the oil phase 38 this characteristic indicated that when the temperature raised the hydrophilic end gradually became shorter by ensuring that the demulsifier molecules were entirely adsorbed on the interfacial membrane the steric hindrance in the water phase would be greatly reduced and the polymerization of oil droplets would accelerate the experimental results fig s3b showed that 60 c was the best reaction temperature for the compound demulsifier considering the temperature of the actual crew outlet was usually 60 c 70 c there was no need to adjust the temperature to ensure the demulsification effect which proved that this compound demulsifier had better practicability and economy so as to better explore the effect of temperature on the effect of the demulsifier the effect of temperature on the strength of the interfacial membrane was tested and the results were as fig 2d as the temperature became higher the rupture effect of the interfacial membrane rose sharply and the strength of the interfacial membrane continued to go down obviously it further confirmed the importance of temperature for non ionic polymer demulsifiers in the initial stage of the reaction the reaction effect was better at 80 c when the reaction reached 60 min the reaction temperature of 60 c could also obtain the same performance as at 80 c 3 5 response surface method optimization experiment 3 5 1 response surface method experimental design this experiment used design expert 8 software and adopted the central combination design method box boheken to carry out a three factor and three level experimental design for the treatment of emulsion wastewater by the compound demulsifier on the basis of static experimental methods and results three factors of the initial ph value of wastewater the reaction temperature and the dosage of demulsifier were selected among them the ratio of demulsifier was ferrous sulfate ae9901 ar036 30 1 2 the final effluent cod concentration was used as the response value then analyzed the main effects of the three factors and the interaction between the factors on the demulsification effect the horizontal distribution of the factors was shown in table s2 among them a b and c represented initial ph value reaction temperature and dosage of demulsifier respectively and 1 0 and 1 referred to the three levels of each factor respectively the experimental plan and experimental results were shown in table 2 among them the reaction conditions of the five groups of experiments 1 7 9 10 and 13 were completely the same and their main purpose was to test the random errors in the experiment process 3 5 2 model establishment of cod removal efficiency and significance test according to the data in table 2 the second order empirical model of the bbd response surface method were 1 y a 0 a 1 a a 2 b a 3 c a 11 a 2 a 22 b 2 a 33 c 2 a 12 ab a 13 ac a 23 bc among them y represented the predicted response value a0 was a constant factor a1 a2 a3 was a linear effect coefficient a11 a22 a33was a second order effect coefficient a12 a13 a23 was an interaction effect coefficient and a b and c represented the level values of each factor substituted the data in table 2 into eq 1 the equation of the quadratic polynomial regression model for the three main influencing factors of demulsification reaction were 2 y 65 95 1 38 a 22 45 b 12 43 c 1 06 ab 0 09 ac 0 08 bc 1 51 a 2 2 59 b 2 0 68 c 2 the results of the analysis of variance of the model were shown in table 3 from the results of the analysis of variance in table 2 it could be seen that the fitting model f 54 37 which was much greater than 1 indicating that the model was highly significant and its p 0 0001 and the lack of fit term p 0 05 stated that the model had a good fitting result and strong significance greater than 99 99 without obvious error the f value of the three influencing factors in the table was fa fc fb from large to small consequently the order of factors from high to low as ph value demulsifier dosage temperature the p values of ab ac and bc were all greater than 0 05 illustrating that there was a certain weak interaction between each factor the p value of ac was 0 35 closer to 0 05 indicating that the interaction between the demulsifier dosage and the ph value was more striking than that between other factors the analysis of variance was performed on the data in table 3 and the results were shown in table s3 it could be seen from table s3 that the fitting coefficient of the model was r2 0 9820 which was close to 1 the correction coefficient r2 adj 0 9782 close to r2 the coefficient of variation c v 5 38 10 and the dispersion was small which proved that the model had good stability accuracy and high reliability the adeq precision was 45 5635 4 indicating that the model was more reasonable it could also be seen from fig s4 that the results obtained by the response surface experiment were more concentrated on both sides of the predicted cod degradation efficiency which also verified that the model had a better fitting effect and the predicted value was very close to the actual value 3 5 3 interaction analysis of various process parameters fig 3 results above showed that the interaction between the dosage of demulsifier and the ph value was more significant the optimal inlet water ph was between 7 2 and 7 7 with a small range of variation the ph of the actual crew used in this experiment was about 7 8 and could suitably match this range of the optimal ph without additional adjustment needed which could not only underpin a good effect but also save economic costs furthermore on the grounds of strong relevance between the ph and dosage when a fluctuation in the load of raw emulsion called for a vivid and timely response in the demulsifer dosage control this feature of ph self adjustment would be much helpful to sum up response surface analysis explored the relationship between various factors and the treatment effect under the overall static experiment it showed that the demulsification scheme of this experiment could achieve excellent demulsification effect only by using the close to original conditions of crew effluent which had superior economy and applicability the cod degradation efficiency predicted by the model under this condition was 95 97 according to this experimental condition several verification experiments were carried out and the average cod degradation efficiency obtained was 95 32 which was very close to the predicted value it was proved that the established model was highly accurate and could be used to predict the demulsification effect under actual operation conditions 3 6 analysis of the demulsification mechanism of compound demulsifier through the comprehensive analysis of the results of ftir fig 5a it could be found that the composition and properties of the oily substance before and after the reaction were quite different compared with cold rolling crude oil the oily substance had no obvious absorption band at 3700 3200 cm 1 after treatment it may be that the non ionic polymer emulsifier destroyed the interface layer resulting in the appearance of short chain substances containing alcoholic hydroxyl groups the bands at 2917 cm 1 2845 cm 1 1460 cm 1 1740 cm 1 and 1162 cm 1 did not change significantly indicating that the separated oily substance still contained long chain alkanes and fatty acid esters that is the mineral oil and fatty acid esters in the water body were separated from the water sample from the side the removal of cod in the water body mainly depended on the coagulation and destabilization of the compound demulsifier to separate the organic pollutants from the water body rather than degrading macromolecular organic matter the gcms analysis fig s1b of the oily substance after the reaction detected the cleavage of the long chain alkane of the surfactant in the emulsion this testified that the structure of interface membrane changed and the asphaltenes were dispersed as a result macromolecular organic pollutants such as oils are separated from the water and under the action of coagulation the small size oil droplets wrapped by the surfactant were further removed the cod value of the water body had dropped significantly this showed that the analysis results of gcms and ftir were consistent with the previous experimental results it also can be observed in the micrographs in fig 5b that the oil droplets were uniformly dispersed into smaller ones at the initial stage of the reaction after the composite demulsifier was added it penetrated into the interfacial membrane which reduced the stability of the membrane and resulted in the separation of oil and water those irregular oil droplets approached each other and gradually aggregated into larger oil droplets this was also confirmed by the dynamic interfacial tension change in fig 5d all in all an in depth elaboration on the demulsification mechanism of the compound demulsifier was presented as follows the compounded demulsifier first contacted the asphaltenes in the outer layer of the emulsion due to the polarity of its own ether bonds the aromatic groups in the phenolic resin were linked to the asphaltenes by hydrogen bonding which reduced the attraction among the asphaltenes and increased the solubility 39 the tendency of asphaltenes aggregation on the interfacial membrane decreased thus exposing more contact sites on the membrane the characteristics of large molecular weight and multi branched chains of demulsifier the made it have an advantage in the adsorption competition over the original membrane molecules resulting in a large number of the latter ones being displaced consequently the demulsifier molecules were adsorbed on the interfacial membrane through hydrogen bonds and the membrane strength decreased under the two phase stretching action of the lipophilic and the hydrophilic end at the same time the water film effect was weakened and the polymerization resistance between oil droplets dropped further which could effectively realize the destabilization of the most droplets finally the approaching oil droplets could be more likely to gradually agglomerate into large sized aggregates which was conducive to further separation and removing oil droplets from the water 3 7 application of new integrated air flotation device based on the characteristics of the different demulsifiers used above we subdivided the oil droplet removal process into two stages the primary destabilization stage and the secondary aggregation stage in the primary destabilization stage the main purpose of the oil droplets was to form larger dense flocs in the secondary aggregation stage the main purpose of the oil droplets was to separate from the water phase and float for removal for this reason different treatment areas were purposely set up to satisfy the requirements of different oil droplets growth stages in the integrated sequential air flotation device 3 7 1 primary destabilization stage the diffusion air flotation zone was set up as the reaction zone of the aggregation stage the diffusion air flotation zone included a coagulation reaction zone at the front and a diffusion air flotation zone at the back in the coagulation reaction zone ferrous sulfate was added to flocculate the tiny oil droplets to produce primary flocs it was reported that coagulation could reduce the electrostatic repulsion between air bubbles and oil droplets thus the bubbles were easily adhered and collided with the oil droplets in subsequent processing 40 in the diffusion air flotation zone the stirring of the impeller could provide sufficient g gradient for coagulation meanwhile the average size of fine bubbles formed under an appropriate stirring intensity through the diffusion air flotation was roughly equivalent to that of the aggregates generated simultaneously in the course of primary coagulation this feature would give rise to more opportunities of collision among the oil particles and in turn fulfill a highly efficient agglomeration of bubble flocs 41 hence at this stage influent flow and stirring intensity were selected as the main influencing factors for the operation of the diffusion air flotation zone it could be seen from fig 4a that when the influent flow was small the removal efficiency of cod and oil began to go up significantly with the ascent of the influent flow under the cooperation of air bubble vibration and stirring the collision efficiency between emulsion molecules and oily colloidal particles steadily rose the cod and oil removal efficiency also reached the maximum value of 98 5 and 98 2 when the influent flow was 1 5 m3 h however when the influent flow increased further the demulsification efficiency decreased instead excessive influent flow would strengt1hen the shear force in the water body which caused the already grown flocs to be destroyed and the oil droplets returned to the water phase in addition it also hindered the collision between bubbles and emulsion and prevented the re generation of flocs consequently the demulsification efficiency was reduced as could be seen from the fig 4b when the stirring intensity was too small the energy for collisions between particles was insufficient which made those particles hard to squeeze and penetrate with each other as a result the ferrous sulfate could not effectively play the role of sweeping flocculation and the coagulation effect was relatively poor when the bubbles grew close to the size of the flocs under a rational stirring intensity the collision efficiency between the bubble and the flocs reached the maximum which promoted the oil removal efficiency up to the top 98 85 likewise excessive stirring intensity would destroy the formed flocs and the coagulation effect would be worse 3 7 2 secondary aggregation stage the diffusion air flotation could remove a majority of small oil droplets from the emulsion followed by the dissolved flotation zone with the aim to deal with the larger particles gradually formed in the sequent stage the non ionic polymer compound demulsifier was added in the pressurized mixing zone in an attempt to demolish the interfacial membrane and realize further destabilization of the oil droplets in this way the primary flocs could continue to grow the detailed process for air bubbles growth in this phase would be expounded as follows as shown in the fig 6d for the conventional air flotation the bubbles could not be adsorbed and fixed inside the flocs so they mainly uplifted the flocs from the outside but for the dissolved air flotation in this study more microbubbles could be generated with a more uniform shape and a looser structure as for the larger flocs formed at this stage the voids inside the flocs were also increasing the microbubbles produced by dissolved air flotation could be thoroughly absorbed inside the larger flocs and grew up with them this feature reduced the density of flocs and ramped them up to form a hollow inner structure 42 as a consequence they were apt to float up with higher speed and readily gather with each other for this reason at this stage air water ratio was selected as the main influencing factors as shown in the fig 4c when the air water ratio in the dissolved air flotation zone was relatively low the oil removal was poor this was because in the case of insufficient aeration the number of bubbles produced was small at this time the oil removal was accomplished mainly through the action of gravity and a large number of oil droplets could not be adsorbed within the flocs formed through the addition of the polymers with high molecular weight as the aeration intensity went on rising the cod and oil content of the effluent would drop down significantly in this process the tiny bubbles produced during the dissolved air flotation would contribute to fabricate a hollow structure in the flocs which was beneficial to the oil removal improvement on the whole the cod and oil removal efficiency reached the maximum values of 98 3 and 99 23 when the air water ratio was 18 1 as the air water ratio went well beyond a certain range the oil removal efficiency and cod removal efficiency declined instead the presumed mechanism was as follows first bubbles were more likely to collide and coalesce with each other so the excessive bubbles would reduce the chance of oil droplets colliding with bubbles secondly the grown up flocs with larger size would also disassembly due to the over intensified collision from those excessive bubbles finally the larger bubbles produced under an excessively higher air water ratio could not completely attach to the flocs and weaken the ability of flocs to float up in this case the oil droplet flocs were more easily broken apart and the removal efficiency sequentially decreased 3 7 3 actual wastewater operation experiment on the basis of the optimal operating conditions of the device obtained above continued to study the demulsification effect of the demulsification air flotation process on the crew under different water quality conditions five batches of crew were obtained from the chromium plating production line of the cold rolling workshop for five consecutive weeks fig 4d showed that the coagulation air flotation process had a better effect on actual wastewater treatment and had strong adaptability to changes in wastewater quality the cod removal efficiency of the five times all reached more than 98 which met the influent load requirements of the subsequent biological treatment and reached the expected goal as a comparison the cod removal efficiency of single coagulation air flotation in the actual wastewater treatment of crew was only about 93 fig s5 additionally china s metallurgical industry usually applied a single polymer demulsifier for demulsification which consumed at a rather high cost in this study cheap inorganic coagulant was used as the pretreatment of demulsification which reduced the dosage of relatively expensive demulsifier in practical applications it could greatly reduce costs while maintaining excellent processing results 3 8 changes in the distribution of oil droplets as shown in fig 5b the oil droplets in the system showed different spatial distributions at different times at 0 5 min the oil droplets molecules squeezed and coalesced each other to produce aggregates with larger particle sizes and the oil droplets distribution density decreased at 10 15 min the oil droplets distribution density was significantly reduced a light yellow transparent thin oil membrane began to appear on the surface of the emulsion and the primary flocs were basically formed at 20 25 min there were only a few oil droplets with larger particle size in the emulsion and at 25 min the existence of oil droplets could hardly be observed it can be concluded that the particle size of the oil droplets in the system was on the rise fig 5c and the compound demulsifiers and a combination of two kinds of air flotation processes promoted the accumulation of oil droplets when the particle size of the oil droplets reached a certain level they would surface under the influence of air bubbles the process of separating suspended particles from the water is called precipitation when the specific gravity of the particles was greater than 1 it appears to sink otherwise it will float because the density of mineral oilρ1was less than the density of waterρ2 mineral oil slowly floats upward in still water the speed of buoyancy in still water is subject to the gravity f1 of the particles in the water and the resistance f2 of the water when the particles float up during the initial process of floating up the resistance increased continuously then it reached equilibrium with gravity the acceleration became zero and the floating speed of the oil droplets became constant the floating speed of a spherical oil drop with diameter in still water was u 4 3 g c d ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 d the solution is in a static water state re 1 and the stokes formula is obtained u 1 18 ρ 2 ρ 1 μ g d 2 check the reynolds number r e ρ 2 ud μ when the oil droplet particle size was 237 48 μm r e was calculated as 1 07 according to the stokes formula the results were shown in table s4 as the oil droplets continued to accumulate their particle size and rising speed kept on rising from the attached table in fig s6 it could be seen that the particle size of the oil droplets increased by multiples starting from 5 min from fig s6 the linear fitting curve of particle size and oil droplet floating velocity was y 2 939 49 259 with the extension of time the oil droplets with a particle size larger than 13 448 μm would start to float up after 5 min because of the destruction of the interface membrane structure the tiny particles in the suspended state aggregated with each other at a fast speed the number of oil droplets larger than 13 448 μm increased significantly which was suitable for the achievement of better oil removal 4 conclusion in this work in order to solve the problem of low efficiency of single air flotation device in oil removal a novel integrated sequential air flotation device paired with compound demulsifier was used to treat emulsion wastewater the compound demulsifier could quickly pass through the asphaltene and adsorb on the interfacial membrane effectively reducing the interfacial tension and the stability of the oily droplets in addition the integrated sequential air flotation device generated large bubbles in the oil droplet aggregation stage to facilitate the effective collision between the oil droplets and form larger flocs in the oil droplet separation stage micro bubbles were generated to reduce the density of the flocs allowing them to rise quickly and escape it could better satisfy the requirements of oil droplets growth at different conglomeration stages in the course of oil removal and produced synergistic demulsification effects with different demulsifiers which could ensure the efficient removal of oil droplets in the whole process compared with the single coagulation flotation device the cod removal efficiency of the new integrated air flotation device in actual treatment increased from 93 to 98 and the treatment effect was not affected by water quality fluctuations the results of response surface analysis showed that the device had strong applicability and reliability which clearly proved the huge promotion potential and role of the integrated sequential air flotation device in crew treatment funding this work was supported by major science and technology project of

12889,this work proposes an appropriate method for cleaning pharmaceutical wastewater from hazardous compounds like cephalosporin and also conducts innovative full design criteria for commercial scale applications associated with full economic evaluation the sillenite bi12tio20 bto was used as a catalyst in this approach and it was chosen based on previous studies first the bto catalyst was characterized and tested before proposing it as an alternative solution the catalyst bto has been characterized using various characterization techniques such as xrd tem bet xps and drs this catalyst was found to be a nanoparticles sillenite type with a space group cubic structure type i23 agglomerated in grains form with particle size around 3 15 μm and a surface area of 8 84 m2 g its bandgap was

batch experimental testing and pilot scale designs proved the viability of employing bto sillenite in a large scale demonstration for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment as a sustainable and cost effective photocatalytic system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pharmaceutical wastewater photocatalysis cost evaluation antibiotic degradation 1 introduction water pollution is among the major problems that harm the environment life and life forms it has been one of the major global environmental remediation challenges in recent decades 1 3 in fact water supplies are one of the most crucial aspects of every society s long term growth however they are constantly polluted by harmful pollutants due to human activity 4 5 pharmaceutical textile thinner and metallurgical industries are the main sources of these contaminants 6 7 the most hazardous pollutants from them are pharmaceuticals or drugs also known as emerging pollutants due to their potential negative effects on humans and the environment antibiotics are among the most harmful toxins among pharmaceutical substances since they are extensively used and exceedingly destructive because their environmental pollution can enhance aquatic toxicity 2 8 9 a survey of antibiotic use found that worldwide antibiotic consumption was roughly 200 000 tons in 2015 has risen by 65 in only 15 years from 2000 and will double by 2030 8 10 the widespread use of antibiotics and their constant discharge ensures that they are present in various water supplies at levels ranging between ng l and μg l 11 13 even at low concentrations of antibiotics the presence of these compounds in water supplies can promote carcinogenesis and build and develop bacterial resistance which results in the creation of antibiotic resistant bacteria abr 14 18 according to the world health organization who abr is regarded as a serious concern to public health in the twenty first century since it kills over 700 000 people per year 19 antibiotics are classified into several classes with cephalosporins being the most frequently used 6 cephalosporin is one of the β lactam antibiotic pseudo persistent type that is commonly identified in water due to its broad antibacterial activity and high therapeutic use 20 22 among cephalosporins cefixime cfx cefaclor cfr and cefuroxime cfrm are widely used here in an algerian pharmaceutical company however they are stable and non degradable in water so a lot of research has been done in order to remove them in fact many researchers note that conventional biological treatments cannot completely remove these antibiotics from the water 23 25 necessitating the development of new effective methods for eliminating these dangerous contaminants 26 conventional water treatment methods such as adsorption reverse osmosis air stripping physical and biological procedures can only remove soluble organic matter in reality these methods do not completely remove contaminants 27 rather they just move them from one phase to another phase 28 29 however pharmaceutical substances such as antibiotics which are stable and non biodegradable require more advanced treatment techniques 30 31 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes aops are effective approaches for degrading pharmaceutical compounds many aop processes have been applied to remove a lot of these pollutants from the water environments including heterogeneous photocatalysis photo electrocatalysis ozone h2o2 and fenton and photo fenton reactions 7 32 aops are promising approaches because they are low cost ecologically beneficial and long term solutions for the fast degradation of non biodegradable substances in water 33 36 among aops techniques photocatalysis has attracted the scientific community s interest it has been widely employed in water treatment where it has been proven to remove non biodegradable substances from water effectively 37 heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors is widely used because semiconductors have different useful and excellent properties for the photocatalytic process such as light absorption ability producing charge carriers when activated with light energy and electrical properties 38 based on our previous studies heterogeneous photocatalysis successfully removed many antibiotics however new semiconductors with strong photocatalytic activity and small bandgap must be developed and tested in order to obtain more effective treatments 15 the increased search for novel material categories in recent years has resulted in the discovery of new types of semiconductors 39 41 bismuth based semiconductors especially sillenites oxides have received much attention as new and promising catalysts because of their unconventional crystal formations photoelectric and dielectric properties and promising photocatalytic activity 42 44 crystals of sillenite having a general formula bi12mo20 bmo where m is one of the transition metals are centered cubic body crystal structure crystallizes in the i23 space group 45 these crystals properties were due to the space group 46 our previous research has discovered a large number of novel sillenite that can be employed as photocatalysts such as bi12tio20 47 bi12coo20 27 bi12nio19 48 and bi12zno20 32 49 among those sillenites bismuth titanate bi12tio20 bto has recently received much attention 46 showing an effective removal of an antibiotic in our previous investigation in the pharmaceutical industry antibiotics are always manufactured in a solo unit special for it only so treating them with an efficient method is very necessary this paper aims to use the sillenite bi12tio20 for the removal of different cephalosporins and to evaluate the large scale economics of this process for industrial applications this is a continuation of a previous work in which this catalyst demonstrated effective photocatalytic activity for removing the antibiotic cefixime firstly the catalyst was characterized by new characterization such as x ray diffraction xrd with rietveld refinement brunauer emmett teller bet field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and uv vis diffusion reflectance spectroscopy drs then the photocatalytic activity of this sillenite was tested for photodegradation of certain cephalosporin antibiotics cfx cfc and cfrm furthermore an appropriate photocatalytic degradation mechanism has been proposed this paper also addressed the design criteria and cost evaluation studies for removing antibiotics using the bto sillenite to evaluate the commercial applicability of the proposed photocatalytic treatment system on a large scale to our knowledge only a few research have discussed the removal of antibiotics using the bto catalyst moreover no study has been previously conducted on the economic evaluation of antibiotic elimination by sillenites using a stirred photocatalytic reactor 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals products employed in the present paper were titanium dioxide 99 tio2 from merck bismuth nitrate pentahydrate 98 5 bi no3 3 5h2o from chem lab polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp k30 cefixime cfx cefaclor cfr and cefuroxime cfrm from pharmalliance an algerian pharmaceutical company distilled water was employed as a solvent 2 2 synthesis of the sillenite bi12tio20 bi12tio20 material sillenite type has been synthesized by the sol gel method by dissolving tio2 and bi no3 3 5h2o in water with stoichiometric amounts 1 12 ratio hno3 was added in a 20 volume to increase the solubility of the nitrates in order to turn the solution into a gel pvp k30 was added to the reaction solution as a complexing agent at a concentration of 15 w w the resulting solution was dehydrated on a hot plate until it became a gel then burnt to form xerogel after combustion at 200 c for 6 h in an air oven the obtained amorphous xerogel was crushed by grinding in an agate mortar then calcined in an air oven for 6 h at 600 c to increase crystallinity and remove the remaining carbonated waste after the combustion reaction after that the obtained product is the sillenite bi12tio20 it was subjected to phase and structural characterization morphology and optical analysis 2 3 characterization types of equipment used for the characterization were pw 1730 philips was used with monochromatic radiation with λ 0 15417 nm for phillips xrd analysis xrd data were refined using the rietveld technique which was implemented using the maud program where vesta software was used to draw the structural illustration the morphology was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 7610 plus in conjunction with eds analysis at a scan rate of 20 kv bet analysis was performed by micromeritics asap 2420 and particle size was characterized by horiba la 960a laser particle size analyzer a thermos scientific k alpha equipment with a twin al k x ray source was used for the xps analysis for the optical study the diffuse reflectance spectrum drs was measured with a dry pressed disk of the sample through cary 5000 uv vis 2 4 photocatalytic application in order to assess the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst bi12tio20 three antibiotics that are not biodegradable and pose a high risk to the environment were selected those antibiotics are from the same class cephalosporin which are cefixime cfx cefaclor cfr and cefuroxime cfrm the photocatalytic degradation tests were performed in a double walled reactor with magnetic stirring by mixing 1 5 g l of the catalyst bto in 100 ml solutions with an antibiotic concentration of 10 mg l and ph equal to 6 those values were found to be optimal conditions in our previous study 47 using a thermostatic bath connected reactor as a cooling system the temperature of the solution was kept almost constant at 25 c during the photocatalytic studies it was critical to remove the catalyst s adsorption impact before beginning the photocatalytic process and irradiation by mixing the antibiotic samples with the catalyst in a dark condition for 120 min to maintain the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption after maintaining the adsorption equilibrium an ultraviolet light 24 w 270 nm 20 mw cm2 produced by philips was used as a light and energy source and placed 10 cm away from the solution s surface the duration of irradiation was determined to be approximately 4 h based on our previously photocatalytic applications the concentration of antibiotics was followed by measuring the maximum absorbance at the appropriate antibiotic wavelength with a uv visible spectrophotometer optizen uv 3220uv where appropriate wavelengths are 288 nm 265 nm and 280 nm for cfx cfc and cfrx respectively uv visible spectrometry was applied in this study since it is a quick method with little inaccuracy compared to hplc analysis 8 the degradation efficiency was evaluated using eq 1 the degradation kinetics of the three antibiotics were studied using the pseudo first order kinetic model using the equation eq 2 1 degradation efficiency abs ad abs t abs ad 100 2 ln c ad c t k app t where c ad c t abs ad abs t absad is the initial absorbance after adsorption and abst is the absorbance after radiation at the time t kis the pseudo first order rate constant represented in sec 1 and calculated from the slope of the curve made between ln abs ad abs t and time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalyst x ray powder diffraction xrd is usually employed to analyze the crystal structure and crystallinity of the nanoparticles fig 1 shows the xrd pattern of the sillenite bi12tio20 catalyst prepared using the sol gel approach in order to confirm the phase and the purity of the nanocrystals and extract the different constants such as the lattice parameters atomic positions and r adjusting factors the rietveld refinement method was employed to refine them from experimental xrd patterns with the help of the maud software as it is hard to measure the lattice parameters and the phase structure directly from xrd 50 the rietveld results are presented in a red line in fig 1 where experimental xrd are the black points as can be noticed there is a good fit between the theoretical rietveld and experimental xrd results the height of the peaks and the small value of sig quality of fit 1 68 prove the purity and the good crystallization of our sample also all peaks presented in the sample are in good agreement with that given in the jcpds data file pdf 340097 51 thus this confirms the success of the established synthesis method the measured lattice parameters of the cubic bi12tio20 are a b c 10 18 å described by the space group cubic structure type i23 the parameters obtained from rietveld refinement enabled us to construct the sillenite by applying it to the vista program in order to clarify the cubic structure of bi12tio20 the structure is illustrated in fig 1 inset through this figure we can notice that the structure of the sillenite is made of bio8 polyhedrons and tio4 tetrahedrons put at the vertices and in the pivot of the unit cell as each vertex of the tio4 tetrahedron is subscribed with three on the polyhedron bio8 52 53 previous work shows that the bio8 polyhedron in bi12tio20 crystals can act as active donor sites promote electron transfer to o2 and eliminate electron hole recombination pairs 54 this is considered a significant advantage in the photocatalysis process tio4 tetrahedron gave relative stability to these structures responsible for anti inhibition stability by comparing it with other sillenite in the form bi12mo20 44 which gives us an incentive to use it as a photocatalyst the scanning electron microscopy fe sem analyses are performed to explore the precise morphological features of the synthesized catalysts and give a close picture of the material structure so fig 2 a shows the fe sem image of the pure sillenite bi12tio20 nanoparticles as can notice the morphology of our sillenite is present in the form of agglomerated nanoparticles the agglomeration of the nanopowders can be attributed to the formation of small crystals in the inherent structure and nature of the materials present in the sample 28 49 the average size of grains the agglomeration of nanoparticles was found to be approximately 3 to 8 μm the grains are closely formed in such a dense structure due to the smaller grain sizes which can be clearly seen in the image fig 2 b shows the edx analysis of the sillenite bi12tio20 the edx analysis was performed by neglecting the presence of oxygen atoms as in meb edx the percentage of oxygen can be affected by external conditions of the equipment it can demonstrate that the atomic percentages of the elements ti and bi in the sample correspond well to the stoichiometric values 1 12 for ti bi further confirming its purity and quality this study also revealed that the homogeneous structure of bi12tio20 contains bi ti and o as main elements without impurities where the presence of c pd and au is due to the preparation method for fe sem analysis metallization in order to determine the specific surface area of the bto catalyst the brunauer emmitt teller bet technique of the co2 adsorption isotherm at a temperature of 298 k was performed the co2 sorption isotherm was extensively described in fig 3 a as can be seen the adsorption is type ii showing that the adsorbent is microporous and has significant adsorbate adsorbent interactions 54 therefore the surface area can be calculated using the bet equation 55 by drawing 1 v p0 p 1 as a function of p p0 fig 3 b 3 1 v p 0 p 1 1 x m c c 1 x m c p p 0 where x m is the volume of gas at stp v is the amount of co2 adsorbed at given p p 0 and c is the bet constant after calculating x m 0 661 cm3 g the total surface area 3 465 m2 can be calculated using the next equation 55 4 s t x m n a a v m where n a avogadro s number a cross sectional area of co2 gas 0 195 nm2 55 and v m molar volume 22 414 l mol 55 the bet surface area can be calculated by dividing the total surface area by the mass of the sample 0 392 g 5 s bet s t m the surface area calculated from bet analysis was found to be 8 84 m2 g this value was very close to that calculated by a theoretical method in our previous work 11 329 m2 g 47 the decrease remarked from the experimental and theoretical was due to the agglomeration of the sample which can decrease the surface area the specific surface area is related to particle size because agglomerations of the inter particles are attached to it 56 57 so it is important to analyze the particle size in the sample the equivalent diameter or the sphere s diameter with the same volume as the particle is frequently employed to convey information about the particle s size the particle histogram and size distribution of the sample obtained using the sol gel method were obtained using a laser particle size analyzer fig 4 as can be seen the particles were micrometric granules and the average diameter calculated by the method of cumulants was 15 μm it is true that bi12tio20 crystals are nanoparticles however their nature generates granules by agglomeration for that we obtained microparticles the ratio of specific surface area to particle size reflects the agglomeration status this result is in line with the fe sem image as it shows agglomerated microparticles however this agglomeration does not usually exist in photocatalysis applications due to the mixing system in the reactor xps measurements were carried out to detect the elemental states and chemical composition of the bto sample starting with the xps survey spectrum of bto sillenite that is illustrated in fig 5 a it demonstrates the presence of bi ti and o elements peaks indicating the presence of oxidation states of constituent elements in the crystals the c1s peak at 284 6 ev was not in the sample but was due to the carbon containing instrument that was used for calibration a high resolution xps spectrum was used to analyze the chemical state of each element bi ti and o fig 4 b d fig 5 b shows the ti 2p orbital scans of the bi12tio20 nanostructures two distinct peaks cantered at approximately 465 58 and 457 08 ev are attributed to the ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 respectively those values are identical to the theoretical values of tio2 suggesting that ti exists in the chemical state of ti iv 58 59 the two small peaks at 474 28 and 453 28 ev represent two shakeup satellites as can be seen in fig 5 c two main xps peaks of bi 4f were shown at binding energies at 164 2 and 158 9 ev for bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively indicating the presence of the bi iii oxidation state this is in good agreement with previous works 60 61 the o 1 s binding energy peaks at around 530 89 and 529 45 ev fig 5 d are attributed to o atoms bound to metals bi o bi and tio bonds 62 in addition it should be noted that the o1s of the nanoparticles exhibit a broad and somewhat asymmetric peak which indicates the presence of other types of oxygen in the surface region these oxygen species can be lattice oxygen 529 26 ev or adsorbed oxygen 531 08 ev at the bi12tio20 surface 59 in order to investigate the light harvesting ability of sillenite bi12tio20 uv vis optical absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature in the 200 900 nm wavelength region as shown in fig 6 we observe that nanoparticles have strong absorption in the uv region with a value of the absorption edge λo of 475 nm it is also noted that sillenites have a clear ability to absorb even visible light and thus can be exploited in sunlight applications the absorption property of the sample in the visible light region is due to the presence of bi2o3 and tio2 in the structure of the sample causing an intrinsic band transition 63 64 the tauc plot method was used in order to estimate optical band energy eg using optical absorption data of the sillenite nanopowders 6 it relates the incident photon energy hν and the absorption coefficient α of the nanopowders as follows 65 66 6 αh ν m a h ν e g where a is a constant and m is the optical transmission type indicative of photon absorption it is equal to 1 for direct and 2 for indirect transmission respectively from the plot curve of αhν 1 2 versus photon energy hν fig 6 the band energy of bi12tio20 can be determined by the linear fit extrapolation onto the x axis the bandgap was found to be at 2 9 ev with a direct transition which is fairly close to earlier reports 67 68 this value confirms that the bto catalyst has a wide absorption capacity for light photons and can show optical activity in the ultraviolet region driven by visible light which is very useful for use in optical applications such as photocatalysis especially by using sunlight as an energy source 69 71 3 2 degradation of different pollutants by the sillenite bi12tio20 our previous investigation determined that the optimal condition for the most effective degradation for the removal of cfx using bto sillenite were 1 5 g l catalyst dose 10 mg l initial concentration and ph equal to 6 47 this investigation carried out other tests under those optimal conditions to eliminate other antibiotics from the same family cephalosporins namely cfc and cfrx the effect of photolysis and adsorption on the three cephalosporin antibiotics were investigated before the photocatalytic degradation tests and they did not achieve any removal and hence it was neglected the photocatalytic activity of bto for the photodegradation of the three antibiotics is shown in fig 7 a bto s photocatalytic activity demonstrated its capacity to degrade the cephalosporin family cfx cfc and cfrx by up to 94 81 and 69 71 within 210 min respectively the photocatalytic performance of bto differs from one antibiotic compound to another owing to the structure and the complexity of each antibiotic s molecules because this can affect the degradation efficiency rather than the catalyst s properties the more complex the compound the more difficult degradation the catalytic reaction kinetics of the bto catalyst on the three antibiotics were studied using a pseudo first order model fig 7 b the results are summarized in table 1 modeling results of the photocatalytic efficiency of bto on cfx cfrx and cfr compounds were all in accordance with the first order kinetic reaction and they were validated by the r2 values table 1 the first order rate constants k app were calculated to be 1 898 10 2 min 1 8 38 10 3 min 1 and 6 09 10 3 min 1 for cfx cfc and cfrm respectively the rate constant k app for cfx degradation was found to be higher than those of cfrx and cfc the higher the rate constant the more efficient and quicker the degradation this can easily be seen in the degradation of cfx these results demonstrated that bto has a very good degradation performance and a strong catalytic activity thus the findings support the catalyst s suitability for real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for the mechanism of degradation the degradation of cephalosporins as organic compounds by the catalyst bto sillenite was controlled by different reaction pathways regulated by the active species hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide o2 as reactive oxidant species ros 47 when a semiconductor is excited by a light source it absorbs photons with an energy greater than or equal to its bandgap resulting in the generation of the electron hole pairs e and h 15 those electron hole pairs then generate oh radicals by oxidation reaction h2o h oh h and o2 radicals by the reduction reaction o 2 e o 2 49 the active species oh and o2 are very strong reagents in chemical reactions they can both conduct chemical reduction or oxidation reactions when they come into contact with cephalosporins causing them to degrade into smaller molecules 6 the proposed mechanism for cephalosporins photodegradation using the bto catalyst is depicted in fig 8 3 3 large scale economic evaluation design and cost estimation studies were carried out for conducting a bto sillenite based photocatalytic system for antibiotic wastewater treatment in ouled fayed 36 43 55 3 n 2 57 42 5 e algeria a factory was taken as a reference this factory works on the production of drugs and antibiotics 24 h a day for 6 days per week the engineering design of an antibiotic removal unit using bi12tio20 catalyst was proposed based on the obtained batch experimental results stirring rate of 300 rpm catalyst dose of 1 5 g l contact time of 4 h and light intensity of 24 watts the following three subsections explain the design steps with a fully descriptive presentation of the pilot scale system with a proposed continuous feed processing and cost evaluation 3 3 1 design criteria pilot scale design investigations were conducted for the photocatalysis unit designed for continuous feed processing fig 8 depicts the schematic presentation for the pilot plant elimination units showing the operating process for treating 1 l min antibiotic polluted effluent the subsequent two eqs 7 and 8 were used to determine the required volume and internal dimensions of the photocatalysis unit 7 q 24 v t where q is the volume flow rate of antibiotic effluent m3 day v is the required volume of the photocatalysis unit m3 and t is the contact time min 8 v n π d 2 l 4 where n is the number of tanks d is the tank diameter cm and l is the tank length cm 3 3 2 system set up and operation in this research part an applied engineering touch is added to give a general conception of the reactors shape dimensions and numbers highlighting the best way to install the treatment units and lamps as well as explaining how the water flows inside the system so that gives a viable and developed idea for anyone looking for treating such complex water a photocatalytic treatment system was suggested to remove antibiotics from the wastewater of pharmaceutical factories the hydraulic design of the system was adopted on a 1 l min discharge to be multiplication neutral to facilitate the design process later for non specialists fig 9 shows a schematic diagram of the proposed pilot scale treatment system the system is proposed to include a photocatalysis unit with a designed volume of 0 28 m3 and internal dimensions of 100 cm in length and 60 cm in diameter a slopped sedimentation unit 100 l was also proposed for catalytic bi12tio20 separation as shown in fig 9 the antibiotic polluted wastewater is proposed to feed the photocatalysis unit by 1 l min discharge to be rapidly mixed 300 rpm by a horizontal axial impeller for 4 h contact time then the treated effluent is gravely discharged to the sedimentation unit after that the treated water is discharged to a storage tank a to be reused for other purposes in the factory or it can be drained into the city s sewage system the separated bi12tio20 catalytic material is stored in another storage tank c to be treated for recycling purposes the proposed system includes storage tanks b and c into which a new and recycled bi12tio20 catalytic material is dosed respectively it has been recommended that the material be pumped via storage tanks b and c alternately day by day to maximize cost savings furthermore the system was suggested to be connected to a photocell with surrounding philips lamps to maintain the optimum light intensity 24 watts at night while depending on the intense sunlight in the morning to maximize energy consumption savings 3 3 3 economic evaluation the economic feasibility assessment is crucial to assessing the viability of the proposed treatment system presented in fig 10 the study was conducted based on a 1 44 m3 day effluent flow rate with optimal determined parameters from batch studies 300 rpm stirring 1 5 g l dosages 4 h contact duration and 24 watts light intensity the factory s operating hours are 24 h a day six days a week all costs for equipment and materials were gathered from several algerian treatment plant equipment suppliers the total cost was calculated based on four main items fabrication and implementation mechanical and electrical operating and other costs the following illustrative diagram fig 10 summarizes the method of calculating the amounts of energy consumed and the cost of catalytic material preparation and other critical considerations for cost evaluation the treatment cost of the catalytic material was estimated to be 5 of its preparation cost the system s need for operating technicians and workers was also considered the salaries of one technician chemist and one worker per shift 8 h were estimated to be 1500 month to cover all shifts based on algeria s average salaries the cost of maintenance was eliminated from the analysis since it is not a governing criterion for the treatment system the total cost was evaluated for applying bto sillenite based photocatalytic system for antibiotic polluted wastewater treatment with 1 l min effluent table 2 lists the conducted calculation results the fabrication and implementation cost of the proposed system was valued to be 1520 4000 m3 for a total volume of 0 38m3 for the fabrication of the 6 mm aclyric photocatalysis and sedimentation units the mechanical and electrical equipment were estimated as 950 2500 m3 for a total volume of 0 38m3 the catalytic material bi12tio20 preparation cost is calculated to be 1 74 m3 0 126 m3 for tio2 1 52 m3 for bi no3 3 5h2o and 0 011 m3 for pvp k30 and 0 08 m3 for hno3 based on the chemical cost in local suppliers the catalytic material treatment cost is estimated to be 0 1 5 of the material preparation cost energy consumption cost is calculated for 12 philips saving energy lamps with an electricity tariff of 0 033 h according to the local tariff for factories in algeria the technicians chemists and workers salaries were considered to be 43 4 m3 other costs were considered to be 2 m3 for sludge handling reusing the treated catalytic material resulted in a decrease in the system running costs and energy savings from depending on sunshine in the morning by 30 of the operating cost 3 3 4 break even and payback analysis the break even analysis involves identifying and evaluating an entity s margin of safety based on revenue collected and related expenses 72 74 in this study breakeven analysis is applied and used to trade off the cost of effluent treatment based on the proposed in plant treatment system and off plant treatment works considering an off plant treatment cost 75 m3 the subsequent two eqs 9 and 10 were used to determine the break even quantity and profit 75 76 9 q be fc r v 10 p r v q fc where q be is the break even quantity m3 fc is the fixed cost r is the revenue v is the variable cost and p is the profit the break even analysis of the in plant and off plant proposed treatment works is shown in fig 11 the fabricating cost of the in plant treatment system was considered as the fixed cost 2470 while the operating cost was taken as the variable cost 46 the break even quantity can be determined as 85 17 m3 as shown in fig 11 this break even quantity refers to the amount of effluent at which the costs of in plant treatment equal the costs of off plant treatment works payback analysis is applied to determine the required minimum life of the system to recover the initial investment for 5 years of operation both expected and cumulative cash flows are displayed in fig 12 the cash flow in the payback completion year was determined as 9528 while the cumulative cash flow preceding the break even point is 2490 for treated effluent of 414 7 m3 year furthermore the payback period can be determined as 2 26 years as shown in fig 12 4 conclusion in the context of our research the sillenite bi12tio20 was successfully synthesized using the sol gel approach and used to remove various antibiotics from water to treat pharmaceutical wastewater first the catalyst was characterized using various characterization techniques such as xrd tem bet xps and drs this catalyst was found to be a nanoparticles sillenite type with a space group cubic structure type i23 agglomerated in grains form with particle size around 3 15 μm and a surface area of 8 84 m2 g its bandgap was found to be at 2 9 ev those proprieties were found to be very useful in optical applications such as photocatalysis after that the photocatalytic performance of bto was tested for the removal of cefixime cefaclor and cefuroxime it has shown an efficient degradation for them at around 94 81 and 69 71 within 210 min respectively these results demonstrated that bto has a very good degradation performance and a strong catalytic activity thus the findings support the catalyst s suitability for real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for that a photocatalytic treatment system has been proposed as a large scale of the previous process and then examined its commercial potential the break even quantity is determined to be 85 17 m3 while the payback period is determined as 2 26 years for using the in plant proposed treatment system in 5 years of operation the findings of batch experimental testing and pilot scale designs proved the viability of employing bto sillenite in a large scale demonstration for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment as a sustainable and cost effective photocatalytic system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12889,this work proposes an appropriate method for cleaning pharmaceutical wastewater from hazardous compounds like cephalosporin and also conducts innovative full design criteria for commercial scale applications associated with full economic evaluation the sillenite bi12tio20 bto was used as a catalyst in this approach and it was chosen based on previous studies first the bto catalyst was characterized and tested before proposing it as an alternative solution the catalyst bto has been characterized using various characterization techniques such as xrd tem bet xps and drs this catalyst

effective photocatalytic system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pharmaceutical wastewater photocatalysis cost evaluation antibiotic degradation 1 introduction water pollution is among the major problems that harm the environment life and life forms it has been one of the major global environmental remediation challenges in recent decades 1 3 in fact water supplies are one of the most crucial aspects of every society s long term growth however they are constantly polluted by harmful pollutants due to human activity 4 5 pharmaceutical textile thinner and metallurgical industries are the main sources of these contaminants 6 7 the most hazardous pollutants from them are pharmaceuticals or drugs also known as emerging pollutants due to their potential negative effects on humans and the environment antibiotics are among the most harmful toxins among pharmaceutical substances since they are extensively used and exceedingly destructive because their environmental pollution can enhance aquatic toxicity 2 8 9 a survey of antibiotic use found that worldwide antibiotic consumption was roughly 200 000 tons in 2015 has risen by 65 in only 15 years from 2000 and will double by 2030 8 10 the widespread use of antibiotics and their constant discharge ensures that they are present in various water supplies at levels ranging between ng l and μg l 11 13 even at low concentrations of antibiotics the presence of these compounds in water supplies can promote carcinogenesis and build and develop bacterial resistance which results in the creation of antibiotic resistant bacteria abr 14 18 according to the world health organization who abr is regarded as a serious concern to public health in the twenty first century since it kills over 700 000 people per year 19 antibiotics are classified into several classes with cephalosporins being the most frequently used 6 cephalosporin is one of the β lactam antibiotic pseudo persistent type that is commonly identified in water due to its broad antibacterial activity and high therapeutic use 20 22 among cephalosporins cefixime cfx cefaclor cfr and cefuroxime cfrm are widely used here in an algerian pharmaceutical company however they are stable and non degradable in water so a lot of research has been done in order to remove them in fact many researchers note that conventional biological treatments cannot completely remove these antibiotics from the water 23 25 necessitating the development of new effective methods for eliminating these dangerous contaminants 26 conventional water treatment methods such as adsorption reverse osmosis air stripping physical and biological procedures can only remove soluble organic matter in reality these methods do not completely remove contaminants 27 rather they just move them from one phase to another phase 28 29 however pharmaceutical substances such as antibiotics which are stable and non biodegradable require more advanced treatment techniques 30 31 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes aops are effective approaches for degrading pharmaceutical compounds many aop processes have been applied to remove a lot of these pollutants from the water environments including heterogeneous photocatalysis photo electrocatalysis ozone h2o2 and fenton and photo fenton reactions 7 32 aops are promising approaches because they are low cost ecologically beneficial and long term solutions for the fast degradation of non biodegradable substances in water 33 36 among aops techniques photocatalysis has attracted the scientific community s interest it has been widely employed in water treatment where it has been proven to remove non biodegradable substances from water effectively 37 heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors is widely used because semiconductors have different useful and excellent properties for the photocatalytic process such as light absorption ability producing charge carriers when activated with light energy and electrical properties 38 based on our previous studies heterogeneous photocatalysis successfully removed many antibiotics however new semiconductors with strong photocatalytic activity and small bandgap must be developed and tested in order to obtain more effective treatments 15 the increased search for novel material categories in recent years has resulted in the discovery of new types of semiconductors 39 41 bismuth based semiconductors especially sillenites oxides have received much attention as new and promising catalysts because of their unconventional crystal formations photoelectric and dielectric properties and promising photocatalytic activity 42 44 crystals of sillenite having a general formula bi12mo20 bmo where m is one of the transition metals are centered cubic body crystal structure crystallizes in the i23 space group 45 these crystals properties were due to the space group 46 our previous research has discovered a large number of novel sillenite that can be employed as photocatalysts such as bi12tio20 47 bi12coo20 27 bi12nio19 48 and bi12zno20 32 49 among those sillenites bismuth titanate bi12tio20 bto has recently received much attention 46 showing an effective removal of an antibiotic in our previous investigation in the pharmaceutical industry antibiotics are always manufactured in a solo unit special for it only so treating them with an efficient method is very necessary this paper aims to use the sillenite bi12tio20 for the removal of different cephalosporins and to evaluate the large scale economics of this process for industrial applications this is a continuation of a previous work in which this catalyst demonstrated effective photocatalytic activity for removing the antibiotic cefixime firstly the catalyst was characterized by new characterization such as x ray diffraction xrd with rietveld refinement brunauer emmett teller bet field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and uv vis diffusion reflectance spectroscopy drs then the photocatalytic activity of this sillenite was tested for photodegradation of certain cephalosporin antibiotics cfx cfc and cfrm furthermore an appropriate photocatalytic degradation mechanism has been proposed this paper also addressed the design criteria and cost evaluation studies for removing antibiotics using the bto sillenite to evaluate the commercial applicability of the proposed photocatalytic treatment system on a large scale to our knowledge only a few research have discussed the removal of antibiotics using the bto catalyst moreover no study has been previously conducted on the economic evaluation of antibiotic elimination by sillenites using a stirred photocatalytic reactor 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals products employed in the present paper were titanium dioxide 99 tio2 from merck bismuth nitrate pentahydrate 98 5 bi no3 3 5h2o from chem lab polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp k30 cefixime cfx cefaclor cfr and cefuroxime cfrm from pharmalliance an algerian pharmaceutical company distilled water was employed as a solvent 2 2 synthesis of the sillenite bi12tio20 bi12tio20 material sillenite type has been synthesized by the sol gel method by dissolving tio2 and bi no3 3 5h2o in water with stoichiometric amounts 1 12 ratio hno3 was added in a 20 volume to increase the solubility of the nitrates in order to turn the solution into a gel pvp k30 was added to the reaction solution as a complexing agent at a concentration of 15 w w the resulting solution was dehydrated on a hot plate until it became a gel then burnt to form xerogel after combustion at 200 c for 6 h in an air oven the obtained amorphous xerogel was crushed by grinding in an agate mortar then calcined in an air oven for 6 h at 600 c to increase crystallinity and remove the remaining carbonated waste after the combustion reaction after that the obtained product is the sillenite bi12tio20 it was subjected to phase and structural characterization morphology and optical analysis 2 3 characterization types of equipment used for the characterization were pw 1730 philips was used with monochromatic radiation with λ 0 15417 nm for phillips xrd analysis xrd data were refined using the rietveld technique which was implemented using the maud program where vesta software was used to draw the structural illustration the morphology was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 7610 plus in conjunction with eds analysis at a scan rate of 20 kv bet analysis was performed by micromeritics asap 2420 and particle size was characterized by horiba la 960a laser particle size analyzer a thermos scientific k alpha equipment with a twin al k x ray source was used for the xps analysis for the optical study the diffuse reflectance spectrum drs was measured with a dry pressed disk of the sample through cary 5000 uv vis 2 4 photocatalytic application in order to assess the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst bi12tio20 three antibiotics that are not biodegradable and pose a high risk to the environment were selected those antibiotics are from the same class cephalosporin which are cefixime cfx cefaclor cfr and cefuroxime cfrm the photocatalytic degradation tests were performed in a double walled reactor with magnetic stirring by mixing 1 5 g l of the catalyst bto in 100 ml solutions with an antibiotic concentration of 10 mg l and ph equal to 6 those values were found to be optimal conditions in our previous study 47 using a thermostatic bath connected reactor as a cooling system the temperature of the solution was kept almost constant at 25 c during the photocatalytic studies it was critical to remove the catalyst s adsorption impact before beginning the photocatalytic process and irradiation by mixing the antibiotic samples with the catalyst in a dark condition for 120 min to maintain the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption after maintaining the adsorption equilibrium an ultraviolet light 24 w 270 nm 20 mw cm2 produced by philips was used as a light and energy source and placed 10 cm away from the solution s surface the duration of irradiation was determined to be approximately 4 h based on our previously photocatalytic applications the concentration of antibiotics was followed by measuring the maximum absorbance at the appropriate antibiotic wavelength with a uv visible spectrophotometer optizen uv 3220uv where appropriate wavelengths are 288 nm 265 nm and 280 nm for cfx cfc and cfrx respectively uv visible spectrometry was applied in this study since it is a quick method with little inaccuracy compared to hplc analysis 8 the degradation efficiency was evaluated using eq

and calculated from the slope of the curve made between ln abs ad abs t and time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalyst x ray powder diffraction xrd is usually employed to analyze the crystal structure and crystallinity of the nanoparticles fig 1 shows the xrd pattern of the sillenite bi12tio20 catalyst prepared using the sol gel approach in order to confirm the phase and the purity of the nanocrystals and extract the different constants such as the lattice parameters atomic positions and r adjusting factors the rietveld refinement method was employed to refine them from experimental xrd patterns with the help of the maud software as it is hard to measure the lattice parameters and the phase structure directly from xrd 50 the rietveld results are presented in a red line in fig 1 where experimental xrd are the black points as can be noticed there is a good fit between the theoretical rietveld and experimental xrd results the height of the peaks and the small value of sig quality of fit 1 68 prove the purity and the good crystallization of our sample also all peaks presented in the sample are in good agreement with that given in the jcpds data file pdf 340097 51 thus this confirms the success of the established synthesis method the measured lattice parameters of the cubic bi12tio20 are a b c 10 18 å described by the space group cubic structure type i23 the parameters obtained from rietveld refinement enabled us to construct the sillenite by applying it to the vista program in order to clarify the cubic structure of bi12tio20 the structure is illustrated in fig 1 inset through this figure we can notice that the structure of the sillenite is made of bio8 polyhedrons and tio4 tetrahedrons put at the vertices and in the pivot of the unit cell as each vertex of the tio4 tetrahedron is subscribed with three on the polyhedron bio8 52 53 previous work shows that the bio8 polyhedron in bi12tio20 crystals can act as active donor sites promote electron transfer to o2 and eliminate electron hole recombination pairs 54 this is considered a significant advantage in the photocatalysis process tio4 tetrahedron gave relative stability to these structures responsible for anti inhibition stability by comparing it with other sillenite in the form bi12mo20 44 which gives us an incentive to use it as a photocatalyst the scanning electron microscopy fe sem analyses are performed to explore the precise morphological features of the synthesized catalysts and give a close picture of the material structure so fig 2 a shows the fe sem image of the pure sillenite bi12tio20 nanoparticles as can notice the morphology of our sillenite is present in the form of agglomerated nanoparticles the agglomeration of the nanopowders can be attributed to the formation of small crystals in the inherent structure and nature of the materials present in the sample 28 49 the average size of grains the agglomeration of nanoparticles was found to be approximately 3 to 8 μm the grains are closely formed in such a dense structure due to the smaller grain sizes which can be clearly seen in the image fig 2 b shows the edx analysis of the sillenite bi12tio20 the edx analysis was performed by neglecting the presence of oxygen atoms as in meb edx the percentage of oxygen can be affected by external conditions of the equipment it can demonstrate that the atomic percentages of the elements ti and bi in the sample correspond well to the stoichiometric values 1 12 for ti bi further confirming its purity and quality this study also revealed that the homogeneous structure of bi12tio20 contains bi ti and o as main elements without impurities where the presence of c pd and au is due to the preparation method for fe sem analysis metallization in order to determine the specific surface area of the bto catalyst the brunauer emmitt teller bet technique of the co2 adsorption isotherm at a temperature of 298 k was performed the co2 sorption isotherm was extensively described in fig 3 a as can be seen the adsorption is type ii showing that the adsorbent is microporous and has significant adsorbate adsorbent interactions 54 therefore the surface area can be calculated using the bet equation 55 by drawing 1 v p0 p 1 as a function of p p0 fig 3 b 3 1 v p 0 p 1 1 x m c c 1 x m c p p 0 where x m is the volume of gas at stp v is the amount of co2 adsorbed at given p p 0 and c is the bet constant after calculating x m 0 661 cm3 g the total surface area 3 465 m2 can be calculated using the next equation 55 4 s t x m n a a v m where n a avogadro s number a cross sectional area of co2 gas 0 195 nm2 55 and v m molar volume 22 414 l mol 55 the bet surface area can be calculated by dividing the total surface area by the mass of the sample 0 392 g 5 s bet s t m the surface area calculated from bet analysis was found to be 8 84 m2 g this value was very close to that calculated by a theoretical method in our previous work 11 329 m2 g 47 the decrease remarked from the experimental and theoretical was due to the agglomeration of the sample which can decrease the surface area the specific surface area is related to particle size because agglomerations of the inter particles are attached to it 56 57 so it is important to analyze the particle size in the sample the equivalent diameter or the sphere s diameter with the same volume as the particle is frequently employed to convey information about the particle s size the particle histogram and size distribution of the sample obtained using the sol gel method were obtained using a laser particle size analyzer fig 4 as can be seen the particles were micrometric granules and the average diameter calculated by the method of cumulants was 15 μm it is true that bi12tio20 crystals are nanoparticles however their nature generates granules by agglomeration for that we obtained microparticles the ratio of specific surface area to particle size reflects the agglomeration status this result is in line with the fe sem image as it shows agglomerated microparticles however this agglomeration does not usually exist in photocatalysis applications due to the mixing system in the reactor xps measurements were carried out to detect the elemental states and chemical composition of the bto sample starting with the xps survey spectrum of bto sillenite that is illustrated in fig 5 a it demonstrates the presence of bi ti and o elements peaks indicating the presence of oxidation states of constituent elements in the crystals the c1s peak at 284 6 ev was not in the sample but was due to the carbon containing instrument that was used for calibration a high resolution xps spectrum was used to analyze the chemical state of each element bi ti and o fig 4 b d fig 5 b shows the ti 2p orbital scans of the bi12tio20 nanostructures two distinct peaks cantered at approximately 465 58 and 457 08 ev are attributed to the ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 respectively those values are identical to the theoretical values of tio2 suggesting that ti exists in the chemical state of ti iv 58 59 the two small peaks at 474 28 and 453 28 ev represent two shakeup satellites as can be seen in fig 5 c two main xps peaks of bi 4f were shown at binding energies at 164 2 and 158 9 ev for bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively indicating the presence of the bi iii oxidation state this is in good agreement with previous works 60 61 the o 1 s binding energy peaks at around 530 89 and 529 45 ev fig 5 d are attributed to o atoms bound to metals bi o bi and tio bonds 62 in addition it should be noted that the o1s of the nanoparticles exhibit a broad and somewhat asymmetric peak which indicates the presence of other types of oxygen in the surface region these oxygen species can be lattice oxygen 529 26 ev or adsorbed oxygen 531 08 ev at the bi12tio20 surface 59 in order to investigate the light harvesting ability of sillenite bi12tio20 uv vis optical absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature in the 200 900 nm wavelength region as shown in fig 6 we observe that nanoparticles have strong absorption in the uv region with a value of the absorption edge λo of 475 nm it is also noted that sillenites have a clear ability to absorb even visible light and thus can be exploited in sunlight applications the absorption property of the sample in the visible light region is due to the presence of bi2o3 and tio2 in the structure of the sample causing an intrinsic band transition 63 64 the tauc plot method was used in order to estimate optical band energy eg using optical absorption data of the sillenite nanopowders 6 it relates the incident photon energy hν and the absorption coefficient α of the nanopowders as follows 65 66 6 αh ν m a h ν e g where a is a constant and m is the optical transmission type indicative of photon absorption it is equal to 1 for direct and 2 for indirect transmission respectively from the plot curve of αhν 1 2 versus photon energy hν fig 6 the band energy of bi12tio20 can be determined by the linear fit extrapolation onto the x axis the bandgap was found to be at 2 9 ev with a direct transition which is fairly close to earlier reports 67 68 this value confirms that the bto catalyst has a wide absorption capacity for light photons and can show optical activity in the ultraviolet region driven by visible light which is very useful for use in optical applications such as photocatalysis especially by using sunlight as an energy source 69 71 3 2 degradation of different pollutants by the sillenite bi12tio20 our previous investigation determined that the optimal condition for the most effective degradation for the removal of cfx using bto sillenite were 1 5 g l catalyst dose 10 mg l initial concentration and ph equal to 6 47 this investigation carried out other tests under those optimal conditions to eliminate other antibiotics from the same family cephalosporins namely cfc and cfrx the effect of photolysis and adsorption on the three cephalosporin antibiotics were investigated before the photocatalytic degradation tests and they did not achieve any removal and hence it was neglected the photocatalytic activity of bto for the photodegradation of the three antibiotics is shown in fig 7 a bto s photocatalytic activity demonstrated its capacity to degrade the cephalosporin family cfx cfc and cfrx by up to 94 81 and 69 71 within 210 min respectively the photocatalytic performance of bto differs from one antibiotic compound to another owing to the structure and the complexity of each antibiotic s molecules because this can affect the degradation efficiency rather than the catalyst s properties the more complex the compound the more difficult degradation the catalytic reaction kinetics of the bto catalyst on the three antibiotics were studied using a pseudo first order model fig 7 b the results are summarized in table 1 modeling results of the photocatalytic efficiency of bto on cfx cfrx and cfr compounds were all in accordance with the first order kinetic reaction and they were validated by the r2 values table 1 the first order rate constants k app were calculated to be 1 898 10 2 min 1 8 38 10 3 min 1 and 6 09 10 3 min 1 for cfx cfc and cfrm respectively the rate constant k app for cfx degradation was found to be higher than those of cfrx and cfc the higher the rate constant the more efficient and quicker the degradation this can easily be seen in the degradation of cfx these results demonstrated that bto has a very good degradation performance and a strong catalytic activity thus the findings support the catalyst s suitability for real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for the mechanism of degradation the degradation of cephalosporins as organic compounds by the catalyst bto sillenite was controlled by different reaction pathways regulated by the active species hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide o2 as reactive oxidant species ros 47 when a semiconductor is excited by a light source it absorbs photons with an energy greater than or equal to its bandgap resulting in the generation of the electron hole pairs e and h 15 those electron hole pairs then generate oh radicals by oxidation reaction h2o h oh h and o2 radicals by the reduction reaction o 2 e o 2 49 the active species oh and o2 are very strong reagents in chemical reactions they can both conduct chemical reduction or oxidation reactions when they come into contact with cephalosporins causing them to degrade into smaller molecules 6 the proposed mechanism for cephalosporins photodegradation using the bto catalyst is depicted in fig 8 3 3 large scale economic evaluation design and cost estimation studies were carried out for conducting a bto sillenite based photocatalytic system for antibiotic wastewater treatment in ouled fayed 36 43 55 3 n 2 57 42 5 e algeria a factory was taken as a reference this factory works on the production of drugs and antibiotics 24 h a day for 6 days per week the engineering design of an antibiotic removal unit using bi12tio20 catalyst was proposed based on the obtained batch experimental results stirring rate of 300 rpm catalyst dose of 1 5 g l contact time of 4 h and light intensity of 24 watts the following three subsections explain the design steps with a fully descriptive presentation of the pilot scale system with a proposed continuous feed processing and cost evaluation 3 3 1 design criteria pilot scale design investigations were conducted for the photocatalysis unit designed for continuous feed processing fig 8 depicts the schematic presentation for the pilot plant elimination units showing the operating process for treating 1 l min antibiotic polluted effluent the subsequent two eqs 7 and 8 were used to determine the required volume and internal dimensions of the photocatalysis unit 7 q 24 v t where q is the volume flow rate of antibiotic effluent m3 day v is the required volume of the photocatalysis unit m3 and t is the contact time min 8 v n π d 2 l 4 where n is the number of tanks d is the tank diameter cm and l is the tank length cm 3 3 2 system set up and operation in this research part an applied engineering touch is added to give a general conception of the reactors shape dimensions and numbers highlighting the best way to install the treatment units and lamps as well as explaining how the water flows inside the system so that gives a viable and developed idea for anyone looking for treating such complex water a photocatalytic treatment system was suggested to remove antibiotics from the wastewater of pharmaceutical factories the hydraulic design of the system was adopted on a 1 l min discharge to be multiplication neutral to facilitate the design process later for non specialists fig 9 shows a schematic diagram of the proposed pilot scale treatment system the system is proposed to include a photocatalysis unit with a designed volume of 0 28 m3 and internal dimensions of 100 cm in length and 60 cm in diameter a slopped sedimentation unit 100 l was also proposed for catalytic bi12tio20 separation as shown in fig 9 the antibiotic polluted wastewater is proposed to feed the photocatalysis unit by 1 l min discharge to be rapidly mixed 300 rpm by a horizontal axial impeller for 4 h contact time then the treated effluent is gravely discharged to the sedimentation unit after that the treated water is discharged to a storage tank a to be reused for other purposes in the factory or it can be drained into the city s sewage system the separated bi12tio20 catalytic material is stored in another storage tank c to be treated for recycling purposes the proposed system includes storage tanks b and c into which a new and recycled bi12tio20 catalytic material is dosed respectively it has been recommended that the material be pumped via storage tanks b and c alternately day by day to maximize cost savings furthermore the system was suggested to be connected to a photocell with surrounding philips lamps to maintain the optimum light intensity 24 watts at night while depending on the intense sunlight in the morning to maximize energy consumption savings 3 3 3 economic evaluation the economic feasibility assessment is crucial to assessing the viability of the proposed treatment system presented in fig 10 the study was conducted based on a 1 44 m3 day effluent flow rate with optimal determined parameters from batch studies 300 rpm stirring 1 5 g l dosages 4 h contact duration and 24 watts light intensity the factory s operating hours are 24 h a day six days a week all costs for equipment and materials were gathered from several algerian treatment plant equipment suppliers the total cost was calculated based on four main items fabrication and implementation mechanical and electrical operating and other costs the following illustrative diagram fig 10 summarizes the method of calculating the amounts of energy consumed and the cost of catalytic material preparation and other critical considerations for cost evaluation the treatment cost of the catalytic material was estimated to be 5 of its preparation cost the system s need for operating technicians and workers was also considered the salaries of one technician chemist and one worker per shift 8 h were estimated to be 1500 month to cover all shifts based on algeria s average salaries the cost of maintenance was eliminated from the analysis since it is not a governing criterion for the treatment system the total cost was evaluated for applying bto sillenite based photocatalytic system for antibiotic polluted wastewater treatment with 1 l min effluent table 2 lists the conducted calculation results the fabrication and implementation cost of the proposed system was valued to be 1520 4000 m3 for a total volume of 0 38m3 for the fabrication of the 6 mm aclyric photocatalysis and sedimentation units the mechanical and electrical equipment were estimated as 950 2500 m3 for a total volume of 0 38m3 the catalytic material bi12tio20 preparation cost is calculated to be 1 74 m3 0 126 m3 for tio2 1 52 m3 for bi no3 3 5h2o and 0 011 m3 for pvp k30 and 0 08 m3 for hno3 based on the chemical cost in local suppliers the catalytic material treatment cost is estimated to be 0 1 5 of the material preparation cost energy consumption cost is calculated for 12 philips saving energy lamps with an electricity tariff of 0 033 h according to the local tariff for factories in algeria the technicians chemists and workers salaries were considered to be 43 4 m3 other costs were considered to be 2 m3 for sludge handling reusing the treated catalytic material resulted in a decrease in the system running costs and energy savings from depending on sunshine in the morning by 30 of the operating cost 3 3 4 break even and payback analysis the break even analysis involves identifying and evaluating an entity s margin of safety based on revenue collected and related expenses 72 74 in this study breakeven analysis is applied and used to trade off the cost of effluent treatment based on the proposed in plant treatment system and off plant treatment works considering an off plant treatment cost 75 m3 the subsequent two eqs 9 and 10 were used to determine the break even quantity and profit 75 76 9 q be fc r v 10 p r v q fc where q be is the break even quantity m3 fc is the fixed cost r is the revenue v is the variable cost and p is the profit the break even analysis of the in plant and off plant proposed treatment works is shown in fig 11 the fabricating cost of the in plant treatment system was considered as the fixed cost 2470 while the operating cost was taken as the variable cost 46 the break even quantity can be determined as 85 17 m3 as shown in fig 11 this break even quantity refers to the amount of effluent at which the costs of in plant treatment equal the costs of off plant treatment works payback analysis is applied to determine the required minimum life of the system to recover the initial investment for 5 years of operation both expected and cumulative cash flows are displayed in fig 12 the cash flow in the payback completion year was determined as 9528 while the cumulative cash flow preceding the break even point is 2490 for treated effluent of 414 7 m3 year furthermore the payback period can be determined as 2 26 years as shown in fig 12 4 conclusion in the context of our research the sillenite bi12tio20 was successfully synthesized using the sol gel approach and used to remove various antibiotics from water to treat pharmaceutical wastewater first the catalyst was characterized using various characterization techniques such as xrd tem bet xps and drs this catalyst was found to be a nanoparticles sillenite type with a space group cubic structure type i23 agglomerated in grains form with particle size around 3 15 μm and a surface area of 8 84 m2 g its bandgap was found to be at 2 9 ev those proprieties were found to be very useful in optical applications such as photocatalysis after that the photocatalytic performance of bto was tested for the removal of cefixime cefaclor and cefuroxime it has shown an efficient degradation for them at around 94 81 and 69 71 within 210 min respectively these results demonstrated that bto has a very good degradation performance and a strong catalytic activity thus the findings support the catalyst s suitability for real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for that a photocatalytic treatment system has been proposed as a large scale of the previous process and then examined its commercial potential the break even quantity is determined to be 85 17 m3 while the payback period is determined as 2 26 years for using the in plant proposed treatment system in 5 years of operation the findings of batch experimental testing and pilot scale designs proved the viability of employing bto sillenite in a large scale demonstration for pharmaceutical wastewater
