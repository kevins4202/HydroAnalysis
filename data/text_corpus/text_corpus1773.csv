8865,following the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident extensive research has been conducted on the dynamic distribution of radiocaesium in large reservoirs however studies on small ponds particularly those used for rice cultivation are limited this study analyzed the vertical water quality profiles including the bioavailable caesium 137 137cs in an irrigation small pond classified as discontinuous cold polymictic based on water mixing type and subjected to a high 2 0 mbq m 2 deposition of 137cs and evaluated their potential risk associated with agricultural use during 2014 2015 the suspended and dissolved concentrations of 137cs in the pond water ranged from 0 10 to 7 7 bq l 1 and 0 03 0 88 bq l 1 respectively the elution of dissolved 137cs from the bottom sediment occurred only during the summer when the water temperature exceeded 15 c nh4 increased and dissolved oxygen decreased except during flood inflow mixing events the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer did not increase in the surface layer at depths 1 0 m in a 3 m shallow pond without a well defined thermocline a gradual density stratification primarily occurred in the lower layer during summer limiting the transport of dissolved 137cs from the bottom to the surface layer about 5 of 137cs in the suspended solids and bottom sediment are exchangeable indicating the mica rich soils and geological conditions with a high fixation capacity of 137cs reduce the risk of 137cs elution even after three to four years of considerable depositions the risk of radiocaesium absorption by paddy rice and subsequent increase in radiocaesium concentration in brown rice was negligible as long as the surface water of the pond was used for agriculture graphical abstract ga1 keywords bioavailable radiocaesium vertical water quality profile small irrigation pond mica rich geology water mixing type data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident of tokyo electric power company holdings inc tepco following the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 marked the first unintended large scale release of radioactive materials in the asian monsoon region this event resulted in the release of 1 3 1016 bq of caesium 137 137cs a radionuclide with a long half life within a month of the accident chino et al 2011 subsequently some of the deposited 137cs in the terrestrial environment were carried by rivers during periods of heavy rainfall onda et al 2020 in freshwater systems the presence of mica francis and brinkley 1976 and certain clay minerals evans et al 1983 in the sediments leads to the selective adsorption of 137cs consequently in catchments with reservoirs most of the discharged 137cs enter the water system and get deposited in the bottom sediment of the reservoirs aoi et al 2013 funaki et al 2018 hayashi and tsuji 2020 this raises concerns about the potential elution of 137cs from the bottom sediment of reservoirs particularly regarding its impact on the agricultural use of water resources paddy cultivation is prevalent in japan and other asian monsoon regions necessitating substantial water resources for irrigation consequently the presence of contaminants in the water sourced from rivers and reservoirs for irrigation poses a potential threat to rice production particularly the highly bioavailable dissolved radiocaesium is of major concern as plants can readily absorb it through the soil leading to its incorporation into the rice crop suzuki et al 2015 investigated the concentration of 137cs in brown rice from rice plants cultivated with varying levels of dissolved 137cs in irrigation water their findings revealed that 137cs in irrigation water at an activity concentration of 10 bq l 1 affected the accumulation of 137cs in brown rice at a concentration of 1 bq l 1 the impact was slight and at 0 1 bq l 1 the effect was negligible therefore the reference safety level for dissolved 137cs in irrigation water is considered to be less than 1 bq l 1 additionally it is important to note that the contribution of contaminated irrigation water to the 137cs content in rice can be regulated by the exchangeable potassium k content of the soil as highlighted by nguyen et al 2022 in general the activity concentration of suspended 137cs is higher in the lower layers of the reservoir as most suspended solids settle at the bottom consequently the surface water exhibits a relatively low activity concentration of suspended 137cs therefore the risk associated with irrigation water containing suspended 137cs is negligible when the surface water is free of suspended particles for this reason the japanese ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff 2016 recommends the safe withdrawal of surface water for agricultural use the dynamics of dissolved 137cs particularly concerning vertical distribution remain poorly understood the vertical distribution of water quality in lakes and reservoirs is primarily influenced by vertical mixing processes thus classifying lakes and reservoirs based on their water mixing types lewis 1983 can offer valuable insights numerous studies have demonstrated the elution of dissolved 137cs from reservoir sediments evans et al 1983 kaminski et al 1997 tsuji et al 2022 the elution process of 137cs from sediments is closely linked to its various forms within the sediments tsukada et al 2008 conducted a sequential extraction method to determine the exchangeable organically bound and strongly bound fractions of 137cs in soil the exchangeable fraction can be easily desorbed through cation exchange the organically bound fraction is primarily released during the decomposition of organic matter and the strongly bound fraction is considered irreversibly adsorbed onto soil particles given that dissolved 137cs primarily elute through the desorption of exchangeable 137cs adsorbed on sediments and suspended solids via ion exchange it is crucial to consider the dynamics of cations present in the water particularly ammonium ion nh4 and potassium ion k in order to comprehend the behavior of dissolved 137cs there have been a few thorough studies of dissolved 137cs dynamics in lakes and reservoirs including coexisting ions and water dynamics particularly in small reservoirs however the safe use of surface water for irrigation relies on ensuring that the dissolved 137cs released from the bottom sediment do not impact the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface water therefore understanding the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs in reservoirs is very important to gain insights into its dynamics and ascertain the suitability of reservoir water for agricultural purposes small reservoirs play a crucial role in supporting sustainable agricultural production not only in asia zhou et al 2020 luong et al 2021 but also in europe casadei et al 2019 and africa owusu et al 2022 l√≥pez felices et al 2020 globally there are approximately 440 000 small reservoirs with areas ranging from 1 to 10 ha accounting for 86 of all reservoirs downing et al 2006 in japan as of 2022 there are approximately 140 000 irrigation reservoirs with around 81 being small ponds with a storage capacity of 10 000 m3 or less these reservoirs are vital water resources for paddy field irrigation including in fukushima prefecture numerous studies have investigated various aspects of small reservoirs in fukushima including the distribution of contamination across a wide area tsukada et al 2017 and the behavior of radiocaesium in reservoirs located in close proximity to the fdnpp konoplev et al 2021 kubota et al 2022 wakiyama et al 2017 wakiyama et al 2019 however research on the vertical profiles of dissolved 137cs in reservoirs has predominantly focused on larger reservoirs funaki et al 2020 funaki et al 2022 while small reservoirs remain largely unexplored although studies have examined the vertical profiles of 137cs in reservoirs in the usa evans et al 1983 and lakes in europe following the chornobyl accident davison et al 1993 iaea 2006 santschi et al 1990 few have investigated the dynamics of dissolved 137cs through high frequency vertical profile observations moreover limited research is available regarding the suitability of reservoir water for agricultural use specifically regarding the presence of radiocaesium and its concentration range this knowledge gap is addressed in this study by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the vertical profile of 137cs in a typical small pond in a mountainous region characterized by relatively high levels of 137cs deposition through high frequency observations this work aimed to elucidate the dynamics of 137cs while focusing on their release from bottom sediments and their availability in the surface water for irrigation this study seeks to enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics of radiocaesium which is crucial for improving preparedness in the face of potential nuclear disasters in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the pond is located at an elevation of 540 m above sea level in the abukuma mountains in iitate mura fukushima prefecture it is an irrigation reservoir constructed by damming up a valley the study site is approximately 34 km northwest of fdnpp in a straight line fig 1 the average 137cs deposition in the catchment of the pond was 2 0 mbq m 2 mext 2011 until the great east japan earthquake the pond was used to supply irrigation water to rice paddies following the disaster its usage was limited to the experimental cultivation of rice in 2013 shin et al 2015 the pond under study is a representative small pond covering an area of 0 73 ha with a total storage capacity of approximately 7500 m3 and a fetch of 80 m the average water depth in the pond is 3 4 m with a minimum recorded depth of 3 1 m however during heavy rainfall the water level temporarily rises to a maximum of 4 0 m the pond has a catchment area of 62 ha primarily consisting of forested land with some agricultural fields and a small number of houses however this area was designated as a difficult to return zone after the disaster and all residents were evacuated and entry to the area was strictly restricted consequently the impact of human activities such as farming and domestic wastewater on water usage and quality was minimal throughout the survey the catchment area is characterized by biotite granite in its surface geology with the abukuma granitic rocks originating from the early cretaceous granite formation kubo et al 2014 the biotite granite in the study area contains a significant proportion of mica with biotite as the primary mineral and leucite as a secondary component during periods of stream flooding the pond receives sediment from the surrounding area including sandy soil known as masa a weathered form of granite it has been observed that a substantial amount of the deposited radiocaesium in this region is retained and stabilized within the weathered biotite which is abundant in the masa soils mukai et al 2016 2 2 survey of water quality a vertical profile survey of water quality was conducted from april 2014 to march 2016 at the deepest point w fig 1 to determine the vertical profile of radiocaesium and other water quality parameters in the pond the survey was conducted one to five times a month 34 times in total except in january and february when the pond surface water is frozen therefore vertical profiles of water quality parameters were observed at a greater frequency than in previous studies funaki et al 2020 funaki et al 2022 a hose with a water sampling strainer and water quality profiler aaq172 jfe advantech hyogo japan was lowered from a rubber boat floating on the pond to collect water at each depth the water quality was measured by using sensors fig 2 water was sampled from depths of 0 1 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m below the water surface and the depths were added or changed according to the water level at that time measurements taken by the water quality profiler were organized at depths of every 0 25 m water samples were collected carefully and continuously using a peristaltic pump i p cole parmer illinois usa installed on the ground through a stainless steel strainer and nylon hose to collect a minimum of approximately 5 l and a maximum of around 40 l of water sample for analysis the collected water was immediately processed on site using the rapid enrichment technique tsuji et al 2014 yasutaka et al 2013 the obtained caesium enriched cartridges were brought back to the laboratory for drying and measuring the contents of dissolved and suspended 137cs respectively using ge semiconductor detectors canberra gc2020 mirion technologies ct usa ortec gem 40 advanced measurement technology tn usa the total activity concentration of 137cs was determined as the sum of suspended 137cs and dissolved 137cs decay corrections were made based on the sampling date the relative average standard deviation of the measured radioactivity was 4 0 for suspended 137cs and 7 5 for dissolved 137cs other water quality parameters analyzed are shown in table 1 to determine the vertical profile of water temperature in the reservoir and the temperature of the inflow water temperature data loggers utbi 001 onset computer ma usa were installed at seven depths from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir fig 2 and points a and b for the inflow water the water temperature was measured every 30 min 2 3 rainfall and hydraulic residence time of the pond in situ rainfall measurements were recorded every 10 min using a 0 5 mm tipping mass rain gauge ow 34 bp ota keiki seisakusho tokyo japan to determine the hydraulic residence time of the pond during the observation period the runoff discharges from a spillway point d and an intake facility point e were observed the spillway volume was obtained from water level observations and weir formulas at the spillway and water level observations at the square weir at the intake facility water level observations were made at 10 min intervals to determine the respective overflow depths the sum of the discharge from the spillway and intake gate was used as the pond outflow discharge q l s 1 and the hydraulic residence time hrt in days d was calculated using the following equation 1 hrt v q 86 4 597 h 2 201 h 86 4 q where v is the reservoir storage volume in m3 expressed as a function of the reservoir depth of h in m based on actual measurements 2 4 investigation of suspended solids and sediments in the water to determine the activity concentration of 137cs and its fraction ratios in suspended solids and bottom sediment the activity concentrations present in suspended solids entering the pond and in the bottom sediment were measured the collection of suspended solids entering the pond was analyzed at sites a and b fig 1 during a heavy rain runoff on july 15 2015 water samples were collected and the suspended solids were obtained after filtration sediment traps were used to collect sedimentation particles in the pond water they were placed at two depths in the upper and lower layers at site w fig 1 with settings at 2 3 m and 0 6 m above the bottom respectively fig 2 three sediment traps which were bottomed acrylic cylinders with an inner diameter of 8 cm and length of 30 cm were placed at each depth sediment trap surveys were conducted during september 7 september 29 september 29 october 15 and october 15 november 19 in the fall of 2015 the bottom sediments were sampled on november 20 and december 3 2014 using a core sampler dik 180a daiki rika kogyo saitama japan at point a the deepest point of the pond and point b approximately 30 cm above the deepest elevation with lengths of 28 cm and 43 cm respectively these cores were taken to the laboratory and sliced every 1 2 cm in the direction of the pond s depth these suspended solids and bottom sediment samples were air dried or dried at 40 c using a dryer crushed and used as analytical samples exchangeable organic and fixed residual fractions of 137cs in suspended solids and sediments were determined by sequential extraction methods tsukada et al 2008 and activity concentrations of 137cs were measured using ge semiconductor detectors 2 5 stability of stratification the stability of the stratification was examined using the brunt vaisala frequency n defined using the following equation 2 n 2 g œÅ 0 d œÅ d z where g is the acceleration of gravity in m s 2 z is the vertical position in m œÅ is the density of water in kg m 3 and œÅ 0 is the mean density n 2 0 is considered stable stratification n 2 0 is neutral and n 2 0 is unstable stratification arita and nakai 1998 water density in the pond was primarily determined by water temperature as is typically the case with few exceptions therefore water density was calculated based on water temperature measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical mixing of pond water based on the water temperature profile fig 3a shows the temporal changes in the water temperature of the inflow from the stream and the surface and bottom layers of the pond comparative analysis showed that the inflow water temperature was almost the lowest throughout the year stream water entering the pond was expected to flow into the bottom layer due to the difference in density except during winter from the latter half of april to the first half of september the water temperature difference between the reservoir s surface and bottom layers increased with a maximum difference of approximately 6 c in august from july to august the temperatures of the inflow water and the bottom layer of the pond remain almost equal which is considered largely due to the inflow of water as the pond is mostly shallow approximately 3 4 m deep no well defined thermocline was observed even during july fig 3b when there was a large temperature difference the daily temperature profile variation in july revealed a decrease in temperature from the pond s surface to a depth of approximately 0 8 m during nighttime indicating the occurrence of heat dissipation this phenomenon suggests the presence of water convection and mixing within this depth range the depth of the mixed layer is calculated from the fetch using the following equation ragotzkie 1978 to be approximately 0 9 m which agrees almost exactly with the observed value 3 d 4 f 0 5 where d is mixed layer thickness in m and f is the fetch in km from late september to mid march of the following year the water temperature was almost the same in all layers resulting in the circulation period fig 3a a comparison of the water temperature profiles at 14 00 on october 14 and 6 00 on october 15 fig 3b confirms the whole layer mixing after that the pond surface froze from mid december to late february during this period the inflow water temperature frequently remained below 4 c indicating that the water likely entered the upper layer of the pond considering these conditions the pond can be classified as a discontinuous cold polymictic water body as per the classification of lake water mixing types proposed by lewis 1983 3 2 fractions of 137cs in suspended solids and the bottom sediment fig 4a shows the fractions of 137cs determined using sequential extraction and the activity concentration of 137cs in the suspended solids in stream water entering the pond during heavy rainfall approximately 90 of the 137cs in the suspended solids in the inflow was in the fraction firmly bound to soil particles and the remainder was in the organic and exchangeable fraction with the exchangeable fraction accounting for only approximately 3 of the total table 2 shows the amounts of rainfall and sedimentation during the sediment trap survey period fig 4b shows the fraction ratios of the three forms of 137cs and the activity concentrations of 137cs in suspended solids trapped in the sediment traps a heavy rainfall event from september 9 to september 11 2015 with total rainfall of 375 mm resulted in a large inflow of suspended solids from the catchment area hence the amount captured by the sediment traps was considerably higher during this period than in other periods in all three periods 137cs trapped in the lower layer were 1 8 3 2 times higher than in the upper layer however the activity concentration of 137cs and fraction ratios of 137cs in each fraction did not differ between the upper and lower layers the activity concentrations of 137cs and fraction ratios in bottom sediments collected with a core sampler are shown in fig 4c the surface layer of the bottom sediments showed an average activity concentration of around 66 bq g 1 for 137cs when comparing the deepest point a to point b as shown in fig 1 which had a difference in bottom elevation of approximately 30 cm it was observed that the activity concentration of 137cs did not significantly differ at the surface of the bottom sediments but varied considerably below the surface at point a high activity concentrations of 137cs were detected down to approximately 28 cm below the surface whereas at point b 137cs was detected approximately 5 cm below the surface at point a the maximum activity concentration of 137cs was observed in layer a6 26 cm below the bottom and the concentration tended to decrease toward the upper layer the exchangeable 137cs fraction in the sediment at point a was the largest in the a5 a6 layer 6 7 and fell toward the surface the fixed and organic fractions did not exhibit clear trends the sharp decrease in 137cs activity concentration below layer a6 suggested that this layer was the surface of the bottom sediment of the pond immediately after the fdnpp accident in march 2011 the comparison of 137cs profiles between sites a and b indicates that 137cs accumulated more prominently at site a this accumulation can be attributed to the deposition of suspended solids resuspended from the bottom surface and or direct input from the stream water 3 3 vertical profile of dissolved 137cs under normal conditions throughout the year and the kd values table 3 shows the results of water quality measurement and analysis by depth and table 4 shows the cumulative rainfall at the time of the water quality surveys the effect of the rain was limited as 85 of the survey days had a 24 h cumulative rainfall of less than 10 mm however some survey days were affected by rains with maximum 24 h cumulative rainfall of 64 mm fig 5 shows the seasonal changes in the vertical profile of 137cs using representative data from the 2014 survey days with 24 h cumulative rainfall of 10 mm overall the activity concentrations of dissolved and suspended 137cs tended to be higher in the lower layers the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs was low during april and december and increased from may to august with a maximum value of 0 58 bq l 1 on august 21 at a depth of 3 0 m only a minor difference was observed in the activity concentrations of 137cs between the surface and bottom layers in winter for the dissolved and suspended forms then the solid liquid distribution coefficient kd representing the equilibrium state of dissolved and suspended 137cs was examined 4 kd l kg 1 activity concentration in solid phase bq kg 1 activity concentration in liquid phase bq l 1 fig 6 shows the kd by water depth obtained from the surveys with less than 10 mm of cumulative rainfall in 24 h when water movement is considered relatively small at depths of 1 0 m and 2 0 m kd was relatively stable between 5 105 l kg 1 and 9 106 l kg 1 confirming a high correlation with water temperature in contrast to the other three depths the kd value at 3 0 m decreased rapidly with increasing water temperature as described later this may be due to 137cs desorption associated with increased nh4 concentration in the bottom layer during the summer leading to decreased kd values table 5 compares the kd values from various studies conducted in fukushima including the findings from this study the kd values obtained in this study ranged from 9 3 105 to 1 8 106 l kg 1 geometric mean which were relatively higher compared to other studies this difference can be attributed to the geological composition of the basin which consists of granitoid with a significant amount of mica as well as the relatively low water temperatures due to the location of the study pond in a highland area in a study by taniguchi et al 2019 the geometric mean of kd values for 29 rivers mainly in fukushima prefecture was as low as 2 7 105 l kg 1 however for rivers where the watershed geology is predominantly granitoid such as the downstream area of the kuchibuto river a higher kd value of 1 4 106 l kg 1 was observed conversely the fujiwara river with a basin primarily composed of sedimentary rocks exhibited a lower kd value of 1 6 104 l kg 1 furthermore it should be noted that the study site is located at the upstream end of the watershed which may be influenced by lower concentrations of coexisting cations such as nh4 and k which can affect the desorption of 137cs from the data presented in table 5 it can be observed that kd values tend to be smaller in the bottom layer of reservoirs with higher nh4 concentrations 3 4 vertical profile of dissolved 137cs during summer fig 7 shows the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs and related water quality parameters during the six days from july 25 to july 31 2014 during summer when there was no rain during this period dissolved 137cs increased from the bottom layer 3 1 m where the concentration was high to a depth of 2 0 m considering that the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in stream water remains low even during rainfall events shinomiya et al 2014 and no other sources of dissolved 137cs were identified it is evident that the observed increase resulted from elution from the bottom sediment the average hydraulic residence time over the course of six days was estimated to be 7 3 d therefore over 80 of the pond water was replaced during this period as the water inflowed into the bottom layer during this period the vertical flow of pond water was basically upward and the water was considered outflowing from the uppermost layer out of the pond back calculation of the depth at which 80 of the water flowed in from the height volume curve h v curve of the pond revealed the depth to be 0 4 m below the water surface hence the water at a depth of 1 0 m should have been replaced by water rising from the lower levels however at 1 0 m unlike at 2 0 m the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs changed negligibly therefore it is concluded that some factors might be restricting the upward migration of dissolved 137cs as discussed below the water temperature profile fig 7a shows that the difference in temperature between the surface and bottom layers was approximately 4 c on july 25 and increased to more than 7 c on july 31 although a clear thermocline was not formed water temperature increased in all layers dissolved oxygen do decreased from 3 4 to 1 8 mg l 1 in the lowermost layer indicating anoxia and n 2 increased overall indicating an increase in stratification stability the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were clearly increased in the layer below 2 0 m while that of nitrate nitrogen no3 n decreased at depths below 2 75 m fig 7c the decrease of 0 023 mg l 1 in no3 n concentration at a depth of 2 75 m is almost equal to the increase of 0 027 mg l 1 in nh4 n concentration the decrease in no3 n concentration at 3 0 m and 3 1 m was 0 019 and 0 013 mg l 1 respectively while nh4 n concentration increased by a greater amount 0 061 and 0 061 mg l 1 respectively this may indicate that the effect of nh4 elution from the bottom sediment was predominant the ratio of dissolved nitrogen d n to t n showed that most of the nitrogen was present in the dissolved form in small reservoirs when the no3 n concentration reaches zero the nh4 n linearly increases after the onset of anoxia and the sulfide content increases due to sulfate reduction thach et al 2018 in the study pond a decrease in no3 n content and increased nh4 n content were observed as the bottom layer became anoxic during summer negligible concentration changes were observed in the sulfate so4 2 profile suggesting that more anaerobic processes such as sulfide formation did not occur no3 n decreased from 0 1 to 1 0 m depth possibly due to internal production i e consumption by phytoplankton growth however the vertical profiles of fluorescent chlorophyll and total organic carbon toc showed little changes and no other apparent factors could be determined the vertical profile of the conservative cations na and k showed that their concentrations were similar respectively across all layers based on the above the dissolved 137cs observed in the lower layers during the summer months may result from the desorption and elution of 137cs via ion exchange driven by the increase in nh4 concentration in the sediment this is consistent with the findings of previous studies evans et al 1983 funaki et al 2020 kaminski et al 1997 tsuji et al 2022 the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs showed an increase in the activity concentration from the lower layer to a depth of 2 0 m although the activity concentration increased negligibly at a depth of 1 0 m among the parameters investigated nh4 n exhibited a similar vertical concentration profile to that of dissolved 137cs notably nh4 n concentration showed a clear increase from the lower layer to a depth of 2 0 m with no significant difference observed at depths shallower than 1 0 m this suggests a close relationship between the presence of dissolved 137cs and nh4 specifically the increasing concentrations of dissolved 137cs at depths beyond 2 0 m may reach equilibrium with nh4 as the nh4 content decreases the less stable dissolved 137cs could potentially be adsorbed by suspended solids in the water at a depth of 1 0 m the activity concentration of suspended 137cs increased from 0 14 to 0 49 bq l 1 indicating the influence of dissolved 137cs that migrated through vertical water flow from the lower layer and transformed into the suspended form additionally there was an increase in 137cs per unit mass of suspended solids from 105 to 238 kbq kg 1 at a depth of 1 0 m during the six day period providing further support for the possibility of adsorption of dissolved 137cs by suspended solids 3 5 elution rate of 137cs from the bottom sediment during midsummer next we analyzed how rapidly the dissolved 137cs was eluted in the pond under study during the summer assuming uniformity of water quality in the vertical direction in the pond we estimated the elution rate of 137cs ve j during midsummer using the following equation based on the change in dissolved 137cs during the six consecutive rainless days from july 25 31 2014 which were discussed in section 3 4 4 ve j el a j d i v i c inc i a j d where el is the total elution of 137cs in kbq d 1 a j is the reference area of the elution range in m2 i is the vertically divided layer number d is the number of days v i is the water volume corresponding to the representative depth in m3 and cinc i is the increase in the concentration of dissolved 137cs at the representative depth in bq l 1 the reference area for the elution range was assumed to be as follows case 1 j 1 water surface area at full water case 2 j 2 water surface area at a depth of 2 5 m and case 3 j 3 water surface area at a depth of 3 0 m the results of the elution rate estimation are shown in table 6 based on the total area of the pond the elution rate of 137cs was 12 bq m 2 d 1 while it was 32 and 121 bq m 2 d 1 assuming depths of 2 5 m or 3 0 m respectively in summer these values were approximately 1 3rd or lesser than the elution rate of 310 bq m 2 d 1 kubota et al 2022 in a pond with shallow water depth control these rates of 137cs elution during midsummer are considered to be the highest in the year assuming that these elution rates of 137cs are maintained throughout the year the ratio of the eluted to the deposited amount of 137cs at this site would be 0 22 0 58 and 2 2 in the above three cases respectively the actual annual elution rate would be lower than these values the actual annual elution rate should be calculated from the balance in the quality of the water flowing in and out of the pond 3 6 vertical profile of radiocaesium during rainfall fig 8 shows the vertical profiles of dissolved 137cs and other water quality parameters during the rainfall event july 18 2014 when cumulative rainfall was 41 mm for 24 h and 57 mm for 72 h and the hydraulic residence time was approximately 2 0 d the figure also shows the vertical profiles before july 11 and after july 25 the rainfall for comparison the dissolved 137cs profile during the rainfall runoff was clearly disturbed compared to that in normal water e g 0 46 bq l 1 at 0 1 m and 0 88 bq l 1 at 3 0 m which were clearly higher than those in normal water the concentration at 3 0 m was double that at 3 1 m indicative of concentration inversion furthermore except for the surface layer nh4 n concentration was higher in the depth range of 1 2 m than in normal water and there was no relationship between nh4 n and dissolved 137cs contents which was observed in normal water this is clearly an effect of the mixing of the pond water due to the inflow of stream water the vertical mixing of pond water decreased the difference in water temperature between the surface and lower layers during rainfall 1 7 c and resulted in a generally high ss fig 8b the concentration of suspended 137cs was also usually higher except in the topmost layer 0 1 m however the disturbance of the water directly above the bottom sediment is considered to be limited because of the decreasing trend of do and increasing nh4 n concentrations at depths 3 0 3 1 m directly above the sediment therefore with this amount of rainfall the elution of 137cs in dissolved form is considered to occur continuously 3 7 water quality conditions for elution of 137cs fig 9 shows the changes in water quality at a depth of 1 0 m and directly above the bottom sediment over two years the maximum activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer was 0 58 bq l 1 while at a depth of 1 0 m the maximum concentration was 0 17 bq l 1 less than 30 of the bottom layer the increase in dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer was clearly synchronized with the increase in water temperature and nh4 concentration and the decrease in do during the summer in the bottom layer the decomposition of organic matter due to the rise in water temperature consumes do and generates nh4 which is responsible for the desorption of 137cs however the migration of dissolved 137cs from the bottom to the upper layer is strongly restricted by the weak density stratification formed by the gradual temperature gradient during the rainless period of summer fig 10 shows the relation of dissolved 137cs content with nh4 do and water temperature in the layer directly above the bottom sediment do was almost saturated at water temperatures ranging from 4 to 14 c and the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs was less than 0 10 bq l 1 however when water temperatures exceeded 15 c the concentration of dissolved 137cs increased with a decrease in do and an increase in nh4 almost without exception in this pond seasonal variations in the amount of 137cs eluted from the sediment were clearly observed with a peak in the summer season as described previously this is considered to be due to the desorption of exchangeable 137cs via ion exchange with nh4 produced by the decomposition of organic matter in the bottom sediment in shallow waters the nh4 concentration in bottom sediments is higher in summer and lower in winter in response to temperature changes while in deeper waters the temperature and nh4 concentration in bottom sediments are almost constant throughout the year kamiyama et al 1978 relatedly dissolved inorganic nitrogen leaching from bottom sediments in shallow lakes is greater under high temperatures wen et al 2022 therefore except for special conditions such as the presence of aquatic vegetation in lake vorsee kaminski et al 1997 the elution of 137cs with a distinct seasonality is expected to be observed in shallow waters such as this pond in response to changes in nh4 concentrations in the bottom sediment 3 8 stratification and mixing characteristics in the study pond and vertical migration of dissolved 137cs the absence of complete stratification in a shallow pond with a maximum depth of 3 m and the lack of a distinct thermocline even during periods of high heat has implications for material dynamics in shallow lakes it is commonly understood that water is well mixed vertically condie and webster 2002 in fact as far as conservative ions such as na are concerned all the layers in the study pond are well mixed fig 7b however even with a hydraulic residence time of approximately 9 d significant variations in the vertical concentration profiles were observed for the relatively unstable parameters including nh4 do and the activity concentrations of dissolved 137cs indicating that these substances exhibited distinct vertical distribution patterns despite the water being replaced within that time the vertical profile of n 2 showed changes in the direction of increasing stratification stability during the rainless period in summer fig 7a a decrease in stability during summer rainfall fig 8a and a value of almost zero during the circulation period fig 9 comparison of n 2 at 1 0 m and 2 5 m depths in summer fig 9 shows that at first the depth of 1 0 m has a long period of positive values on average although there are periods of high variability and negative minimum values in particular intermittent negative values have been observed since june 2015 suggesting that vertical mixing occurs often in contrast at 2 5 m values are generally higher and fluctuate less than at 1 0 m the values were stable and positive from mid april to the end of september 2014 and from mid april to mid august 2015 thus even under conditions where no clear thermocline was formed a more stable stratification was found to have formed in the lower layers during the summer disturbing factors in the water column in relatively small lakes are thermal convection tuan et al 2009 kimura et al 2012 read et al 2012 inflow during heavy rainfall laborde et al 2010 and typhoons kimura et al 2012 the intermittent negative n 2 values in the study pond from late august to mid september 2015 not only at 1 0 m but also at 2 5 m were due to the disturbance of pond water by inflows caused by significant rainfall events rainfall from august 27th to september 1st total rainfall of 86 mm mean residence time of 4 3 d and from september 6 20 total rainfall of 500 mm mean residence time of 2 4 d as described above in ponds classified as discontinuous cold polymictic although intermittently mixing occurs due to inflow from heavy rainfall the migration of dissolved 137cs from bottom sediment to surface water during the summer season is limited 3 9 effects of different mixing types of reservoir water on the vertical migration of dissolved 137cs table 7 compares the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs measured in this study with that reported in previous studies evans et al 1983 kaminski et al 1997 funaki et al 2020 funaki et al 2022 kubota et al 2022 as described in the previous section the study pond classified as discontinuous cold polymictic indicated that dissolved 137cs accumulated in the bottom layer might limit surface water migration even without a clear thermocline therefore dissolved 137cs concentrations in surface water increase discontinuously and intermittently especially in summer table 8 although the study pond was approximately 3 m deep it can be inferred that such dissolved 137cs dynamics can be observed in reservoirs with a water depth over the thickness of the mixed layer calculated from the fetch by eq 3 plus a certain margin height in lake vorsee kaminski et al 1997 and an irrigation reservoir kubota et al 2022 characterized as continuous polymictic due to their shallow depth and regular vertical mixing the water undergoes daily vertical mixing except during freezing periods as a result dissolved 137cs released from the bottom sediments immediately contribute to the increased concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface layer and effluent without any time lag at the ogaki dam in the eastern part of fukushima prefecture classified as warm monomictic with deeper water depth a clear thermocline was formed in the depth range of 1 3 m during the summer the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs was high in the bottom layer 0 4 0 8 bq l 1 and low in the surface layer 0 15 0 18 bq l 1 this is because the solute exchange between epilimnion and hypolimnion is minimal similar trends were observed at par pond evans et al 1983 and yokokawa dam funaki et al 2022 on the contrary during the winter season ogaki dam enters the mixing season and full layer mixing occurs dissolved 137cs concentrations were slightly higher 0 43 bq l 1 in the bottom layer in january 2018 when anoxic water masses were present but lower 0 15 bq l 1 when anoxic water masses were not present and the high dissolved 137cs concentrations in the bottom layer have resolved this indicates that dissolved 137cs generated and accumulated in the bottom layer of warm monomictic reservoirs during the thermal stratification period may remain in the bottom layer in the presence of nh4 ions and then mix into all layers during the mixing period contributing to the increased concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface layer in fact the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the effluent from ogaki dam was observed to be lower in summer and higher in winter in fy2013 and fy2014 maff 2018 thus different mixing types of reservoir water or in other words different depths of the reservoir can be inferred to change the pattern of the activity concentrations of dissolved 137cs in the surface layer of the reservoir this aspect should be further investigated in future studies for confirmation 3 10 risks in irrigation use of the pond water despite the fact that dissolved 137cs is known for their high bioavailability and easy uptake by biota the concentration of this radionuclide in the surface water of the investigated pond remained low even after a duration of 3 4 years since the incident as previously indicated two significant factors suppressed the increase in the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs the mica rich geology soils and the relatively weak density stratification formed by the gradual changes in water temperature the mica rich geology soils trapped most of the 137cs inflow from the catchment area in the sediment limiting the amount of 137cs released from the sediment consequently suppressing the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer to a maximum of 0 88 bq l 1 the relatively weak density stratification also greatly limited the migration of 137cs generated in the bottom layer to the surface layer this further suppressed the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface water to a maximum of 0 14 bq l 1 during normal water conditions since the surface activity concentration of dissolved 137cs is much lower than 1 bq l 1 if the water used for irrigation is limited to the surface water of the pond the risk of 137cs in irrigation water being absorbed by the rice and increasing the activity concentration of 137cs in the brown rice is low even in the summer in addition the risk of an increase in the activity concentration of 137cs in brown rice is reduced further even in the circulation period from autumn onwards due to the decrease in the elution rate of 137cs at low water temperatures and dilution by whole layer mixing given the limited data presented in this paper regarding variations in dissolved 137cs concentrations within the pond s surface layer the discussion of the potential risks linked to utilizing surface water during rainfall events will be deferred to future investigations further research is necessary to adequately assess and address the implications and risks associated with such scenarios 3 11 limitations of this study and future issues this study provides evidence that ponds with shallow water depths of 3 m have a low likelihood of experiencing significant increases in dissolved 137cs concentrations in the surface layer during the summer season the influence of bottom sediment on surface water concentrations of 137cs may become more apparent when reservoir water levels are lower in some cases reservoirs have even become a source rather than a sink for 137cs kubota et al 2022 during extremely low water levels however the specific impact of decreasing water levels resulting from increased water use during the summer on the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs remains unknown therefore there is a need to investigate the effect of water level management on radiocaesium concentrations in the surface water of shallow reservoirs which is an important issue for future research furthermore it is necessary to validate the estimated elution flux of dissolved 137cs from the pond by considering its impact on the overall balance of dissolved 137cs within the pond another intriguing aspect is comprehending the relationship between the accumulation rate of 137cs inflow from the pond s upstream catchment and the pond s water storage capacity therefore it is vital to investigate the 137cs balance within the pond from this perspective 4 conclusions in this study we examined the vertical profile of 137cs and other water quality characteristics in a small shallow pond with a maximum depth of around 3 m located in an area with a relatively high deposition of 137cs to understand the dynamics of bioavailable radiocaesium and to consider the risks associated with its use as agricultural water the major findings are as follows 1 the vertical profiles of dissolved and suspended 137cs under normal water conditions i e non flood conditions showed that the concentrations of both dissolved and suspended 137cs were higher in the lower layers during the summer and that both forms were uniformly distributed throughout the circulation period 2 vertical mixing is restricted by the gradual density stratification in summer even without a clear thermocline 3 the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in bottom water increased during the summer when the water temperature exceeded 15 c do decreased and nh4 increased 4 under normal water conditions even when dissolved 137cs concentration in the bottom layer was high the increase in concentration was limited to layers deeper than 2 m and there was almost no increase in concentration at depths shallower than 1 m 5 relatively high dissolved 137cs was detected in the surface water during rainfall runoff 6 the above trends may be similar in reservoirs classified as either discontinuous cold polymictic or discontinuous warm polymictic depending on the mixing type of the water 7 differences in the mixing type of the reservoir water suggest that dissolved 137cs concentrations in the surface water increase in different seasons and patterns 8 in water bodies where mica rich geology and soils are distributed the solid liquid distribution coefficient kd is relatively large and reduces the concentration and elution of dissolved 137cs according to the findings of this study utilizing surface water from reservoirs that share similar characteristics and geological conditions as the studied pond does not pose an elevated risk of radiocaesium absorption through irrigation credit authorship

8865,following the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident extensive research has been conducted on the dynamic distribution of radiocaesium in large reservoirs however studies on small ponds particularly those used for rice cultivation are limited this study analyzed the vertical water quality profiles including the bioavailable caesium 137 137cs in an irrigation small pond classified as discontinuous cold polymictic based on water mixing type and subjected to a high 2 0 mbq m 2 deposition of 137cs and evaluated their potential risk associated with agricultural use during 2014 2015 the suspended and dissolved concentrations of 137cs in the pond water ranged from 0 10 to 7 7 bq l 1 and 0 03 0 88 bq l 1 respectively the elution of dissolved 137cs from the bottom sediment occurred only during the summer when the water temperature exceeded 15 c nh4 increased and dissolved oxygen decreased except during flood inflow mixing events the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer did not increase in the surface layer at depths 1 0 m in a 3 m shallow pond without a well defined thermocline a gradual density stratification primarily occurred in the lower layer during summer limiting the transport of dissolved 137cs from the bottom to the surface layer about 5 of 137cs in the suspended solids and bottom sediment are exchangeable indicating the mica rich soils and geological conditions with a high fixation capacity of 137cs reduce the risk of 137cs elution even after three to four years of considerable depositions the risk of radiocaesium absorption by paddy rice and subsequent increase in radiocaesium concentration in brown rice was negligible as long as the surface water of the pond was used for agriculture graphical abstract ga1 keywords bioavailable radiocaesium vertical water quality profile small irrigation pond mica rich geology water mixing type data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident of tokyo electric power company holdings inc tepco following the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 marked the first unintended large scale release of radioactive materials in the asian monsoon region this event resulted in the release of 1 3 1016 bq of caesium 137 137cs a radionuclide with a long half life within a month of the accident chino et al 2011 subsequently some of the deposited 137cs in the terrestrial environment were carried by rivers during periods of heavy rainfall onda et al 2020 in freshwater systems the presence of mica francis and brinkley 1976 and certain clay minerals evans et al 1983 in the sediments leads to the selective adsorption of 137cs consequently in catchments with reservoirs most of the discharged 137cs enter the water system and get deposited in the bottom sediment of the reservoirs aoi et al 2013 funaki et al 2018 hayashi and tsuji 2020 this raises concerns about the potential elution of 137cs from the bottom sediment of reservoirs particularly regarding its impact on the agricultural use of water resources paddy cultivation is prevalent in japan and other asian monsoon regions necessitating substantial water resources for irrigation consequently the presence of contaminants in the water sourced from rivers and reservoirs for irrigation poses a potential threat to rice production particularly the highly bioavailable dissolved radiocaesium is of major concern as plants can readily absorb it through the soil leading to its incorporation into the rice crop suzuki et al 2015 investigated the concentration of 137cs in brown rice from rice plants cultivated with varying levels of dissolved 137cs in irrigation water their findings revealed that 137cs in irrigation water at an activity concentration of 10 bq l 1 affected the accumulation of 137cs in brown rice at a concentration of 1 bq l 1 the impact was slight and at 0 1 bq l 1 the effect was negligible therefore the reference safety level for dissolved 137cs in irrigation water is considered to be less than 1 bq l 1 additionally it is important to note that the contribution of contaminated irrigation water to the 137cs content in rice can be regulated by the exchangeable potassium k content of the soil as highlighted by nguyen et al 2022 in general the activity concentration of suspended 137cs is higher in the lower layers of the reservoir as most suspended solids settle at the bottom consequently the surface water exhibits a relatively low activity concentration of suspended 137cs therefore the risk associated with irrigation water containing suspended 137cs is negligible when the surface water is free of suspended particles for this reason the japanese ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff 2016 recommends the safe withdrawal of surface water for agricultural use the dynamics of dissolved 137cs particularly concerning vertical distribution remain poorly understood the vertical distribution of water quality in lakes and reservoirs is primarily influenced by vertical mixing processes thus classifying lakes and reservoirs based on their water mixing types lewis 1983 can offer valuable insights numerous studies have demonstrated the elution of dissolved 137cs from reservoir sediments evans et al 1983 kaminski et al 1997 tsuji et al 2022 the elution process of 137cs from sediments is closely linked to its various forms within the sediments tsukada et al 2008 conducted a sequential extraction method to determine the exchangeable organically bound and strongly bound fractions of 137cs in soil the exchangeable fraction can be easily desorbed through cation exchange the organically bound fraction is primarily released during the decomposition of organic matter and the strongly bound fraction is considered irreversibly adsorbed onto soil particles given that dissolved 137cs primarily elute through the desorption of exchangeable 137cs adsorbed on sediments and suspended solids via ion exchange it is crucial to consider the dynamics of cations present in the water particularly ammonium ion nh4 and potassium ion k in order to comprehend the behavior of dissolved 137cs there have been a few thorough studies of dissolved 137cs dynamics in lakes and reservoirs including coexisting ions and water dynamics particularly in small reservoirs however the safe use of surface water for irrigation relies on ensuring that the dissolved 137cs released from the bottom sediment do not impact the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface water therefore understanding the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs in reservoirs is very important to gain insights into its dynamics and ascertain the suitability of reservoir water for agricultural purposes small reservoirs play a crucial role in supporting sustainable agricultural production not only in asia zhou et al 2020 luong et al 2021 but also in europe casadei et al 2019 and africa owusu et al 2022 l√≥pez felices et al 2020 globally there are approximately 440 000 small reservoirs with areas ranging from 1 to 10 ha accounting for 86 of all reservoirs downing et al 2006 in japan as of 2022 there are approximately 140 000 irrigation reservoirs with around 81 being small ponds with a storage capacity of 10 000 m3 or less these reservoirs are vital water resources for paddy field irrigation including in fukushima prefecture numerous studies have investigated various aspects of small reservoirs in fukushima including the distribution of contamination across a wide area tsukada et al 2017 and the behavior of radiocaesium in reservoirs located in close proximity to the fdnpp konoplev et al 2021 kubota et al 2022 wakiyama et al 2017 wakiyama et al 2019 however research on the vertical profiles of dissolved 137cs in reservoirs has predominantly focused on larger reservoirs funaki et al 2020 funaki et al 2022 while small reservoirs remain largely unexplored although studies have examined the vertical profiles of 137cs in reservoirs in the usa evans et al 1983 and lakes in europe following the chornobyl accident davison et al 1993 iaea 2006 santschi et al 1990 few have investigated the dynamics of dissolved 137cs through high frequency vertical profile observations moreover limited research is available regarding the suitability of reservoir water for agricultural use specifically regarding the presence of radiocaesium and its concentration range this knowledge gap is addressed in this study by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the vertical profile of 137cs in a typical small pond in a mountainous region characterized by relatively high levels of 137cs deposition through high frequency observations this work aimed to elucidate the dynamics of 137cs while focusing on their release from bottom sediments and their availability in the surface water for irrigation this study seeks to enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics of radiocaesium which is crucial for improving preparedness in the face of potential nuclear disasters in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the pond is located at an elevation of 540 m above sea level in the abukuma mountains in iitate mura fukushima prefecture it is an irrigation reservoir constructed by damming up a valley the study site is approximately 34 km northwest of fdnpp in a straight line fig 1 the average 137cs deposition in the catchment of the pond was 2 0 mbq m 2 mext 2011 until the great east japan earthquake the pond was used to supply irrigation water to rice paddies following the disaster its usage was limited to the experimental cultivation of rice in 2013 shin et al 2015 the pond under study is a representative small pond covering an area of 0 73 ha with a total storage capacity of approximately 7500 m3 and a fetch of 80 m the average water depth in the pond is 3 4 m with a minimum recorded depth of 3 1 m however during heavy rainfall the water level temporarily rises to a maximum of 4 0 m the pond has a catchment area of 62 ha primarily consisting of forested land with some agricultural fields and a small number of houses however this area was designated as a difficult to return zone after the disaster and all residents were evacuated and entry to the area was strictly restricted consequently the impact of human activities such as farming and domestic wastewater on water usage and quality was minimal throughout the survey the catchment area is characterized by biotite granite in its surface geology with the abukuma granitic rocks originating from the early cretaceous granite formation kubo et al 2014 the biotite granite in the study area contains a significant proportion of mica with biotite as the primary mineral and leucite as a secondary component during periods of stream flooding the pond receives sediment from the surrounding area including sandy soil known as masa a weathered form of granite it has been observed that a substantial amount of the deposited radiocaesium in this region is retained and stabilized within the weathered biotite which is abundant in the masa soils mukai et al 2016 2 2 survey of water quality a vertical profile survey of water quality was conducted from april 2014 to march 2016 at the deepest point w fig 1 to determine the vertical profile of radiocaesium and other water quality parameters in the pond the survey was conducted one to five times a month 34 times in total except in january and february when the pond surface water is frozen therefore vertical profiles of water quality parameters were observed at a greater frequency than in previous studies funaki et al 2020 funaki et al 2022 a hose with a water sampling strainer and water quality profiler aaq172 jfe advantech hyogo japan was lowered from a rubber boat floating on the pond to collect water at each depth the water quality was measured by using sensors fig 2 water was sampled from depths of 0 1 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m below the water surface and the depths were added or changed according to the water level at that time measurements taken by the water quality profiler were organized at depths of every 0 25 m water samples were collected carefully and continuously using a peristaltic pump i p cole parmer illinois usa installed on the ground through a stainless steel strainer and nylon hose to collect a minimum of approximately 5 l and a maximum of around 40 l of water sample for analysis the collected water was immediately processed on site using the rapid enrichment technique tsuji et al 2014 yasutaka et al 2013 the obtained caesium enriched cartridges were brought back to the laboratory for drying and measuring the contents of dissolved and suspended 137cs respectively using ge semiconductor detectors canberra gc2020 mirion technologies ct usa ortec gem 40 advanced measurement technology tn usa the total activity concentration of 137cs was determined as the sum of suspended 137cs and dissolved 137cs decay corrections were made based on the sampling date the relative average standard deviation of the measured radioactivity was 4 0 for suspended 137cs and 7 5 for dissolved 137cs other water quality parameters analyzed are shown in table 1 to determine the vertical profile of water temperature in the reservoir and the temperature of the inflow water temperature data loggers utbi 001 onset computer ma usa were installed at seven depths from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir fig 2 and points a and b for the inflow water the water temperature was measured every 30 min 2 3 rainfall and hydraulic residence time of the pond in situ rainfall measurements were recorded every 10 min using a 0 5 mm tipping mass rain gauge ow 34 bp ota keiki seisakusho tokyo japan to determine the hydraulic residence time of the pond during the observation period the runoff discharges from a spillway point d and an intake facility point e were observed the spillway volume was obtained from water level observations and weir formulas at the spillway and water level observations at the square weir at the intake facility water level observations were made at 10 min intervals to determine the respective overflow depths the sum of the discharge from the spillway and intake gate was used as the pond outflow discharge q l s 1 and the hydraulic residence time hrt in days d was calculated using the following equation 1 hrt v q 86 4 597 h 2 201 h 86 4 q where v is the reservoir storage volume in m3 expressed as a function of the reservoir depth of h in m based on actual measurements 2 4 investigation of suspended solids and sediments in the water to determine the activity concentration of 137cs and its fraction ratios in suspended solids and bottom sediment the activity concentrations present in suspended solids entering the pond and in the bottom sediment were measured the collection of suspended solids entering the pond was analyzed at sites a and b fig 1 during a heavy rain runoff on july 15 2015 water samples were collected and the suspended solids were obtained after filtration sediment traps were used to collect sedimentation particles in the pond water they were placed at two depths in the upper and lower layers at site w fig 1 with settings at 2 3 m and 0 6 m above the bottom respectively fig 2 three sediment traps which were bottomed acrylic cylinders with an inner diameter of 8 cm and length of 30 cm were placed at each depth sediment trap surveys were conducted during september 7 september 29 september 29 october 15 and october 15 november 19 in the fall of 2015 the bottom sediments were sampled on november 20 and december 3 2014 using a core sampler dik 180a daiki rika kogyo saitama japan at point a the deepest point of the pond and point b approximately 30 cm above the deepest elevation with lengths of 28 cm and 43 cm respectively these cores were taken to the laboratory and sliced every 1 2 cm in the direction of the pond s depth these suspended solids and bottom sediment samples were air dried or dried at 40 c using a dryer crushed and used as analytical samples exchangeable organic and fixed residual fractions of 137cs in suspended solids and sediments were determined by sequential extraction methods tsukada et al 2008 and activity concentrations of 137cs were measured using ge semiconductor detectors 2 5 stability of stratification the stability of the stratification was examined using the brunt vaisala frequency n defined using the following equation 2 n 2 g œÅ 0 d œÅ d z where g is the acceleration of gravity in m s 2 z is the vertical position in m œÅ is the density of water in kg m 3 and œÅ 0 is the mean density n 2 0 is considered stable stratification n 2 0 is neutral and n 2 0 is unstable stratification arita and nakai 1998 water density in the pond was primarily determined by water temperature as is typically the case with few exceptions therefore water density was calculated based on water temperature measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical mixing of pond water based on the water temperature profile fig 3a shows the temporal changes in the water temperature of the inflow from the stream and the surface and bottom layers of the pond comparative analysis showed that the inflow water temperature was almost the lowest throughout the year stream water entering the pond was expected to flow into the bottom layer due to the difference in density except during winter from the latter half of april to the first half of september the water temperature difference between the reservoir s surface and bottom layers increased with a maximum difference of approximately 6 c in august from july to august the temperatures of the inflow water and the bottom layer of the pond remain almost equal which is considered largely due to the inflow of water as the pond is mostly shallow approximately 3 4 m deep no well defined thermocline was observed even during july fig 3b when there was a large temperature difference the daily temperature profile variation in july revealed a decrease in temperature from the pond s surface to a depth of approximately 0 8 m during nighttime indicating the occurrence of heat dissipation this phenomenon suggests the presence of water convection and mixing within this depth range the depth of the mixed layer is calculated from the fetch using the following equation ragotzkie 1978 to be approximately 0 9 m which agrees almost exactly with the observed value 3 d 4 f 0 5 where d is mixed layer thickness in m and f is the fetch in km from late september to mid march of the following year the water temperature was almost the same in all layers resulting in the circulation period fig 3a a comparison of the water temperature profiles at 14 00 on october 14 and 6 00 on october 15 fig 3b confirms the whole layer mixing after that the pond surface froze from mid december to late february during this period the inflow water temperature frequently remained below 4 c indicating that the water likely entered the upper layer of the pond considering these conditions the pond can be classified as a discontinuous cold polymictic water body as per the classification of lake water mixing types proposed by lewis 1983 3 2 fractions of 137cs in suspended solids and the bottom sediment fig 4a shows the fractions of 137cs determined using sequential extraction and the activity concentration of 137cs in the suspended solids in stream water entering the pond during heavy rainfall approximately 90 of the 137cs in the suspended solids in the inflow was in the fraction firmly bound to soil particles and the remainder was in the organic and exchangeable fraction with the exchangeable fraction accounting for only approximately 3 of the total table 2 shows the amounts of rainfall and sedimentation during the sediment trap survey period fig 4b shows the fraction ratios of the three forms of 137cs and the activity concentrations of 137cs in suspended solids trapped in the sediment traps a heavy rainfall event from september 9 to september 11 2015 with total rainfall of 375 mm resulted in a large inflow of suspended solids from the catchment area hence the amount captured by the sediment traps was considerably higher during this period than in other periods in all three periods 137cs trapped in the lower layer were 1 8 3 2 times higher than in the upper layer however the activity concentration of 137cs and fraction ratios of 137cs in each fraction did not differ between the upper and lower layers the activity concentrations of 137cs and fraction ratios in bottom sediments collected with a core sampler are shown in fig 4c the surface layer of the bottom sediments showed an average activity concentration of around 66 bq g 1 for 137cs when comparing the deepest point a to point b as shown in fig 1 which had a difference in bottom elevation of approximately 30 cm it was observed that the activity concentration of 137cs did not significantly differ at the surface of the bottom sediments but varied considerably below the surface at point a high activity concentrations of 137cs were detected down to approximately 28 cm below the surface whereas at point b 137cs was detected approximately 5 cm below the surface at point a the maximum activity concentration of 137cs was observed in layer a6 26 cm below the bottom and the concentration tended to decrease toward the upper layer the exchangeable 137cs fraction in the sediment at point a was the largest in the a5 a6 layer 6 7 and fell toward the surface the fixed and organic fractions did not exhibit clear trends the sharp decrease in 137cs activity concentration below layer a6 suggested that this layer was the surface of the bottom sediment of the pond immediately after the fdnpp accident in march 2011 the comparison of 137cs profiles between sites a and b indicates that 137cs accumulated more prominently at site a this accumulation can be attributed to the deposition of suspended solids resuspended from the bottom surface and or direct input from the stream water 3 3 vertical profile of dissolved 137cs under normal conditions throughout the year and the kd values table 3 shows the results of water quality measurement and analysis by depth and table 4 shows the cumulative rainfall at the time of the water quality surveys the effect of the rain was limited as 85 of the survey days had a 24 h cumulative rainfall of less than 10 mm however some survey days were affected by rains with maximum 24 h cumulative rainfall of 64 mm fig 5 shows the seasonal changes in the vertical profile of 137cs using representative data from the 2014 survey days with 24 h cumulative rainfall of 10 mm overall the activity concentrations of dissolved and suspended 137cs tended to be higher in the lower layers the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs was low during april and december and increased from may to august with a maximum value of 0 58 bq l 1 on august 21 at a depth of 3 0 m only a minor difference was observed in the activity concentrations of 137cs between the surface and bottom layers in winter for the dissolved and suspended forms then the solid liquid distribution coefficient kd representing the equilibrium state of dissolved and suspended 137cs was examined 4 kd l kg 1 activity concentration in solid phase bq kg 1 activity concentration in liquid phase bq l 1 fig 6 shows the kd by water depth obtained from the surveys with less than 10 mm of cumulative rainfall in 24 h when water movement is considered relatively small at depths of 1 0 m and 2 0 m kd was relatively stable between 5 105 l kg 1 and 9 106 l kg 1 confirming a high correlation with water temperature in contrast to the other three depths the kd value at 3 0 m decreased rapidly with increasing water temperature as described later this may be due to 137cs desorption associated with increased nh4 concentration in the bottom layer during the summer leading to decreased kd values table 5 compares the kd values from various studies conducted in fukushima including the findings from this study the kd values obtained in this study ranged from 9 3 105 to 1 8 106 l kg 1 geometric mean which were relatively higher compared to other studies this difference can be attributed to the geological composition of the basin which consists of granitoid with a significant amount of mica as well as the relatively low water temperatures due to the location of the study pond in a highland area in a study by taniguchi et al 2019 the geometric mean of kd values for 29 rivers mainly in fukushima prefecture was as low as 2 7 105 l kg 1 however for rivers where the watershed geology is predominantly granitoid such as the downstream area of the kuchibuto river a higher kd value of 1 4 106 l kg 1 was observed conversely the fujiwara river with a basin primarily composed of sedimentary rocks exhibited a lower kd value of 1 6 104 l kg 1 furthermore it should be noted that the study site is located at the upstream end of the watershed which may be influenced by lower concentrations of coexisting cations such as nh4 and k which can affect the desorption of 137cs from the data presented in table 5 it can be observed that kd values tend to be smaller in the bottom layer of reservoirs with higher nh4 concentrations 3 4 vertical profile of dissolved 137cs during summer fig 7 shows the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs and related water quality parameters during the six days from july 25 to july 31 2014 during summer when there was no rain during this period dissolved 137cs increased from the bottom layer 3 1 m where the concentration was high to a depth of 2 0 m considering that the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in stream water remains low even during rainfall events shinomiya et al 2014 and no other sources of dissolved 137cs were identified it is evident that the observed increase resulted from elution from the bottom sediment the average hydraulic residence time over the course of six days was estimated to be 7 3 d therefore over 80 of the pond water was replaced during this period as the water inflowed into the bottom layer during this period the vertical flow of pond water was basically upward and the water was considered outflowing from the uppermost layer out of the pond back calculation of the depth at which 80 of the water flowed in from the height volume curve h v curve of the pond revealed the depth to be 0 4 m below the water surface hence the water at a depth of 1 0 m should have been replaced by water rising from the lower levels however at 1 0 m unlike at 2 0 m the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs changed negligibly therefore it is concluded that some factors might be restricting the upward migration of dissolved 137cs as discussed below the water temperature profile fig 7a shows that the difference in temperature between the surface and bottom layers was approximately 4 c on july 25 and increased to more than 7 c on july 31 although a clear thermocline was not formed water temperature increased in all layers dissolved oxygen do decreased from 3 4 to 1 8 mg l 1 in the lowermost layer indicating anoxia and n 2 increased overall indicating an increase in stratification stability the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were clearly increased in the layer below 2 0 m while that of nitrate nitrogen no3 n decreased at depths below 2 75 m fig 7c the decrease of 0 023 mg l 1 in no3 n concentration at a depth of 2 75 m is almost equal to the increase of 0 027 mg l 1 in nh4 n concentration the decrease in no3 n concentration at 3 0 m and 3 1 m was 0 019 and 0 013 mg l 1 respectively while nh4 n concentration increased by a greater amount 0 061 and 0 061 mg l 1 respectively this may indicate that the effect of nh4 elution from the bottom sediment was predominant the ratio of dissolved nitrogen d n to t n showed that most of the nitrogen was present in the dissolved form in small reservoirs when the no3 n concentration reaches zero the nh4 n linearly increases after the onset of anoxia and the sulfide content increases due to sulfate reduction thach et al 2018 in the study pond a decrease in no3 n content and increased nh4 n content were observed as the bottom layer became anoxic during summer negligible concentration changes were observed in the sulfate so4 2 profile suggesting that more anaerobic processes such as sulfide formation did not occur no3 n decreased from 0 1 to 1 0 m depth possibly due to internal production i e consumption by phytoplankton growth however the vertical profiles of fluorescent chlorophyll and total organic carbon toc showed little changes and no other apparent factors could be determined the vertical profile of the conservative cations na and k showed that their concentrations were similar respectively across all layers based on the above the dissolved 137cs observed in the lower layers during the summer months may result from the desorption and elution of 137cs via ion exchange driven by the increase in nh4 concentration in the sediment this is consistent with the findings of previous studies evans et al 1983 funaki et al 2020 kaminski et al 1997 tsuji et al 2022 the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs showed an increase in the activity concentration from the lower layer to a depth of 2 0 m although the activity concentration increased negligibly at a depth of 1 0 m among the parameters investigated nh4 n exhibited a similar vertical concentration profile to that of dissolved 137cs notably nh4 n concentration showed a clear increase from the lower layer to a depth of 2 0 m with no significant difference observed at depths shallower than 1 0 m this suggests a close relationship between the presence of dissolved 137cs and nh4 specifically the increasing concentrations of dissolved 137cs at depths beyond 2 0 m may reach equilibrium with nh4 as the nh4 content decreases the less stable dissolved 137cs could potentially be adsorbed by suspended solids in the water at a depth of 1 0 m the activity concentration of suspended 137cs increased from 0 14 to 0 49 bq l 1 indicating the influence of dissolved 137cs that migrated through vertical water flow from the lower layer and transformed into the suspended form additionally there was an increase in 137cs per unit mass of suspended solids from 105 to 238 kbq kg 1 at a depth of 1 0 m during the six day period providing further support for the possibility of adsorption of dissolved 137cs by suspended solids 3 5 elution rate of 137cs from the bottom sediment during midsummer next we analyzed how rapidly the dissolved 137cs was eluted in the pond under study during the summer assuming uniformity of water quality in the vertical direction in the pond we estimated the elution rate of 137cs ve j during midsummer using the following equation based on the change in dissolved 137cs during the six consecutive rainless days from july 25 31 2014 which were discussed in section 3 4 4 ve j el a j d i v i c inc i a j d where el is the total elution of 137cs in kbq d 1 a j is the reference area of the elution range in m2 i is the vertically divided layer number d is the number of days v i is the water volume corresponding to the representative depth in m3 and cinc i is the increase in the concentration of dissolved 137cs at the representative depth in bq l 1 the reference area for the elution range was assumed to be as follows case 1 j 1 water surface area at full water case 2 j 2 water surface area at a depth of 2 5 m and case 3 j 3 water surface area at a depth of 3 0 m the results of the elution rate estimation are shown in table 6 based on the total area of the pond the elution rate of 137cs was 12 bq m 2 d 1 while it was 32 and 121 bq m 2 d 1 assuming depths of 2 5 m or 3 0 m respectively in summer these values were approximately 1 3rd or lesser than the elution rate of 310 bq m 2 d 1 kubota et al 2022 in a pond with shallow water depth control these rates of 137cs elution during midsummer are considered to be the highest in the year assuming that these elution rates of 137cs are maintained throughout the year the ratio of the eluted to the deposited amount of 137cs at this site would be 0 22 0 58 and 2 2 in the above three cases respectively the actual annual elution rate would be lower than these values the actual annual elution rate should be calculated from the balance in the quality of the water flowing in and out of the pond 3 6 vertical profile of radiocaesium during rainfall fig 8 shows the vertical profiles of dissolved 137cs and other water quality parameters during the rainfall event july 18 2014 when cumulative rainfall was 41 mm for 24 h and 57 mm for 72 h and the hydraulic residence time was approximately 2 0 d the figure also shows the vertical profiles before july 11 and after july 25 the rainfall for comparison the dissolved 137cs profile during the rainfall runoff was clearly disturbed compared to that in normal water e g 0 46 bq l 1 at 0 1 m and 0 88 bq l 1 at 3 0 m which were clearly higher than those in normal water the concentration at 3 0 m was double that at 3 1 m indicative of concentration inversion furthermore except for the surface layer nh4 n concentration was higher in the depth range of 1 2 m than in normal water and there was no relationship between nh4 n and dissolved 137cs contents which was observed in normal water this is clearly an effect of the mixing of the pond water due to the inflow of stream water the vertical mixing of pond water decreased the difference in water temperature between the surface and lower layers during rainfall 1 7 c and resulted in a generally high ss fig 8b the concentration of suspended 137cs was also usually higher except in the topmost layer 0 1 m however the disturbance of the water directly above the bottom sediment is considered to be limited because of the decreasing trend of do and increasing nh4 n concentrations at depths 3 0 3 1 m directly above the sediment therefore with this amount of rainfall the elution of 137cs in dissolved form is considered to occur continuously 3 7 water quality conditions for elution of 137cs fig 9 shows the changes in water quality at a depth of 1 0 m and directly above the bottom sediment over two years the maximum activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer was 0 58 bq l 1 while at a depth of 1 0 m the maximum concentration was 0 17 bq l 1 less than 30 of the bottom layer the increase in dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer was clearly synchronized with the increase in water temperature and nh4 concentration and the decrease in do during the summer in the bottom layer the decomposition of organic matter due to the rise in water temperature consumes do and generates nh4 which is responsible for the desorption of 137cs however the migration of dissolved 137cs from the bottom to the upper layer is strongly restricted by the weak density stratification formed by the gradual temperature gradient during the rainless period of summer fig 10 shows the relation of dissolved 137cs content with nh4 do and water temperature in the layer directly above the bottom sediment do was almost saturated at water temperatures ranging from 4 to 14 c and the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs was less than 0 10 bq l 1 however when water temperatures exceeded 15 c the concentration of dissolved 137cs increased with a decrease in do and an increase in nh4 almost without exception in this pond seasonal variations in the amount of 137cs eluted from the sediment were clearly observed with a peak in the summer season as described previously this is considered to be due to the desorption of exchangeable 137cs via ion exchange with nh4 produced by the decomposition of organic matter in the bottom sediment in shallow waters the nh4 concentration in bottom sediments is higher in summer and lower in winter in response to temperature changes while in deeper waters the temperature and nh4 concentration in bottom sediments are almost constant throughout the year kamiyama et al 1978 relatedly dissolved inorganic nitrogen leaching from bottom sediments in shallow lakes is greater under high temperatures wen et al 2022 therefore except for special conditions such as the presence of aquatic vegetation in lake vorsee kaminski et al 1997 the elution of 137cs with a distinct seasonality is expected to be observed in shallow waters such as this pond in response to changes in nh4 concentrations in the bottom sediment 3 8 stratification and mixing characteristics in the study pond and vertical migration of dissolved 137cs the absence of complete stratification in a shallow pond with a maximum depth of 3 m and the lack of a distinct thermocline even during periods of high heat has implications for material dynamics in shallow lakes it is commonly understood that water is well mixed vertically condie and webster 2002 in fact as far as conservative ions such as na are concerned all the layers in the study pond are well mixed fig 7b however even with a hydraulic residence time of approximately 9 d significant variations in the vertical concentration profiles were observed for the relatively unstable parameters including nh4 do and the activity concentrations of dissolved 137cs indicating that these substances exhibited distinct vertical distribution patterns despite the water being replaced within that time the vertical profile of n 2 showed changes in the direction of increasing stratification stability during the rainless period in summer fig 7a a decrease in stability during summer rainfall fig 8a and a value of almost zero during the circulation period fig 9 comparison of n 2 at 1 0 m and 2 5 m depths in summer fig 9 shows that at first the depth of 1 0 m has a long period of positive values on average although there are periods of high variability and negative minimum values in particular intermittent negative values have been observed since june 2015 suggesting that vertical mixing occurs often in contrast at 2 5 m values are generally higher and fluctuate less than at 1 0 m the values were stable and positive from mid april to the end of september 2014 and from mid april to mid august 2015 thus even under conditions where no clear thermocline was formed a more stable stratification was found to have formed in the lower layers during the summer disturbing factors in the water column in relatively small lakes are thermal convection tuan et al 2009 kimura et al 2012 read et al 2012 inflow during heavy rainfall laborde et al 2010 and typhoons kimura et al 2012 the intermittent negative n 2 values in the study pond from late august to mid september 2015 not only at 1 0 m but also at 2 5 m were due to the disturbance of pond water by inflows caused by significant rainfall events rainfall from august 27th to september 1st total rainfall of 86 mm mean residence time of 4 3 d and from september 6 20 total rainfall of 500 mm mean residence time of 2 4 d as described above in ponds classified as discontinuous cold polymictic although intermittently mixing occurs due to inflow from heavy rainfall the migration of dissolved 137cs from bottom sediment to surface water during the summer season is limited 3 9 effects of different mixing types of reservoir water on the vertical migration of dissolved 137cs table 7 compares the vertical profile of dissolved 137cs measured in this study with that reported in previous studies evans et al 1983 kaminski et al 1997 funaki et al 2020 funaki et al 2022 kubota et al 2022 as described in the previous section the study pond classified as discontinuous cold polymictic indicated that dissolved 137cs accumulated in the bottom layer might limit surface water migration even without a clear thermocline therefore dissolved 137cs concentrations in surface water increase discontinuously and intermittently especially in summer table 8 although the study pond was approximately 3 m deep it can be inferred that such dissolved 137cs dynamics can be observed in reservoirs with a water depth over the thickness of the mixed layer calculated from the fetch by eq 3 plus a certain margin height in lake vorsee kaminski et al 1997 and an irrigation reservoir kubota et al 2022 characterized as continuous polymictic due to their shallow depth and regular vertical mixing the water undergoes daily vertical mixing except during freezing periods as a result dissolved 137cs released from the bottom sediments immediately contribute to the increased concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface layer and effluent without any time lag at the ogaki dam in the eastern part of fukushima prefecture classified as warm monomictic with deeper water depth a clear thermocline was formed in the depth range of 1 3 m during the summer the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs was high in the bottom layer 0 4 0 8 bq l 1 and low in the surface layer 0 15 0 18 bq l 1 this is because the solute exchange between epilimnion and hypolimnion is minimal similar trends were observed at par pond evans et al 1983 and yokokawa dam funaki et al 2022 on the contrary during the winter season ogaki dam enters the mixing season and full layer mixing occurs dissolved 137cs concentrations were slightly higher 0 43 bq l 1 in the bottom layer in january 2018 when anoxic water masses were present but lower 0 15 bq l 1 when anoxic water masses were not present and the high dissolved 137cs concentrations in the bottom layer have resolved this indicates that dissolved 137cs generated and accumulated in the bottom layer of warm monomictic reservoirs during the thermal stratification period may remain in the bottom layer in the presence of nh4 ions and then mix into all layers during the mixing period contributing to the increased concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface layer in fact the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the effluent from ogaki dam was observed to be lower in summer and higher in winter in fy2013 and fy2014 maff 2018 thus different mixing types of reservoir water or in other words different depths of the reservoir can be inferred to change the pattern of the activity concentrations of dissolved 137cs in the surface layer of the reservoir this aspect should be further investigated in future studies for confirmation 3 10 risks in irrigation use of the pond water despite the fact that dissolved 137cs is known for their high bioavailability and easy uptake by biota the concentration of this radionuclide in the surface water of the investigated pond remained low even after a duration of 3 4 years since the incident as previously indicated two significant factors suppressed the increase in the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs the mica rich geology soils and the relatively weak density stratification formed by the gradual changes in water temperature the mica rich geology soils trapped most of the 137cs inflow from the catchment area in the sediment limiting the amount of 137cs released from the sediment consequently suppressing the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the bottom layer to a maximum of 0 88 bq l 1 the relatively weak density stratification also greatly limited the migration of 137cs generated in the bottom layer to the surface layer this further suppressed the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in the surface water to a maximum of 0 14 bq l 1 during normal water conditions since the surface activity concentration of dissolved 137cs is much lower than 1 bq l 1 if the water used for irrigation is limited to the surface water of the pond the risk of 137cs in irrigation water being absorbed by the rice and increasing the activity concentration of 137cs in the brown rice is low even in the summer in addition the risk of an increase in the activity concentration of 137cs in brown rice is reduced further even in the circulation period from autumn onwards due to the decrease in the elution rate of 137cs at low water temperatures and dilution by whole layer mixing given the limited data presented in this paper regarding variations in dissolved 137cs concentrations within the pond s surface layer the discussion of the potential risks linked to utilizing surface water during rainfall events will be deferred to future investigations further research is necessary to adequately assess and address the implications and risks associated with such scenarios 3 11 limitations of this study and future issues this study provides evidence that ponds with shallow water depths of 3 m have a low likelihood of experiencing significant increases in dissolved 137cs concentrations in the surface layer during the summer season the influence of bottom sediment on surface water concentrations of 137cs may become more apparent when reservoir water levels are lower in some cases reservoirs have even become a source rather than a sink for 137cs kubota et al 2022 during extremely low water levels however the specific impact of decreasing water levels resulting from increased water use during the summer on the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs remains unknown therefore there is a need to investigate the effect of water level management on radiocaesium concentrations in the surface water of shallow reservoirs which is an important issue for future research furthermore it is necessary to validate the estimated elution flux of dissolved 137cs from the pond by considering its impact on the overall balance of dissolved 137cs within the pond another intriguing aspect is comprehending the relationship between the accumulation rate of 137cs inflow from the pond s upstream catchment and the pond s water storage capacity therefore it is vital to investigate the 137cs balance within the pond from this perspective 4 conclusions in this study we examined the vertical profile of 137cs and other water quality characteristics in a small shallow pond with a maximum depth of around 3 m located in an area with a relatively high deposition of 137cs to understand the dynamics of bioavailable radiocaesium and to consider the risks associated with its use as agricultural water the major findings are as follows 1 the vertical profiles of dissolved and suspended 137cs under normal water conditions i e non flood conditions showed that the concentrations of both dissolved and suspended 137cs were higher in the lower layers during the summer and that both forms were uniformly distributed throughout the circulation period 2 vertical mixing is restricted by the gradual density stratification in summer even without a clear thermocline 3 the activity concentration of dissolved 137cs in bottom water increased during the summer when the water temperature exceeded 15 c do decreased and nh4 increased 4 under normal water conditions even when dissolved 137cs concentration in the bottom layer was high the increase in concentration was limited to layers deeper than 2 m and there was almost no increase in concentration at depths shallower than 1 m 5 relatively high dissolved 137cs was detected in the surface water during rainfall runoff 6 the above trends may be similar in reservoirs classified as either discontinuous cold polymictic or discontinuous warm polymictic depending on the mixing type of the water 7 differences in the mixing type of the reservoir water suggest that dissolved 137cs concentrations in the surface water increase in different seasons and patterns 8 in water bodies where mica rich geology and soils are distributed the solid liquid distribution coefficient kd is relatively large and reduces the concentration and elution of dissolved 137cs according to the findings of this study utilizing surface water from reservoirs that share similar characteristics and geological conditions as the studied pond does not pose an elevated risk of radiocaesium absorption through irrigation credit authorship

8866,using crop models to develop reasonable irrigation and nitrogen schedules inss is critical for achieving high yields and maximizing water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency however the inss developed based on crop parameters determined through field experiments have low robustness at the regional scale remote sensing data indicate the growth conditions of regional crops and representative regional crop parameters can be determined using remote sensing data the objective of the present study was to develop a regional ins by adopting a crop model with crop parameters calibrated using the remotely sensed leaf area index lai first the crop parameters of a field scale crop model were calibrated on the basis of field scale trial data for four summer maize growing seasons sensitive crop parameters at the regional scale were then identified using an assimilation algorithm based on the remotely sensed lai the rationality of using the remotely sensed lai for determining regional crop parameters was demonstrated by simulating regional maize growth finally a regional scale crop model was developed and coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the regional ins for different typical rainfall years the results indicated that the regional scale crop model was more accurate than was the field scale crop model in simulating the regional lai plant height soil water content and yield and the corresponding rmse decreased by 0 50 m2 m2 0 15 m 0 02 cm3 cm3 344 11 kg ha compared with the inss currently used by farmers the optimized ins was associated with a marginally higher irrigation quantity average increase of 2 66 but a significantly lower nitrogen application rate average decrease of 31 6 the crop yield wue and partial factor productivity for nitrogen were 6 35 12 51 2 64 10 41 and 61 8 66 2 higher respectively in different typical rainfall years when using the optimized ins than when using an unoptimized ins the results of this study indicate that a regional ins established on the basis of regional crop model parameters estimated using remote sensing data can aid irrigation and nitrogen application scheduling keywords regional scale ceres maize model remote sensing water use efficiency partial factor productivity of nitrogen multiobjective optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water and nitrogen are crucial factors that affect crop growth and yield water scarcity has become a global systemic risk sun et al 2016 that challenges the sustainability of traditional agricultural practices and is a major factor limiting agricultural production dadrasan et al 2015 although reliable nitrogen supply for plant growth has made significant contributions to increasing crop yields over the past century zhang et al 2015 the application of nitrogen fertilizers higher than the nitrogen requirements of crops can cause nitrogen loss from arable lands to the environment ronaghi and ghasemi fasaei 2013 such over fertilization not only decreases nitrogen use efficiency nue and increases environmental problems nosheen et al 2021 but also does not significantly increase crop yield li et al 2016 under conditions of limited water supply nitrogen fertilizers are crucial in increasing water use efficiency wue waraich et al 2011 moreover water and nitrogen must be rationally allocated to improve nitrogen fertilizer effectiveness and reduce environmental pollution li et al 2009 therefore suitable measures for rational irrigation and nitrogen management must be identified the development of crop growth models has enabled researchers to simulate crop growth under different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization conditions a variety of models such as ceres maize jones and kiniry 1986 ceres wheat ritchie 1985a and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 have been widely used to simulate crop growth with specific regard to crop yield wue and nue under different irrigation and nitrogen application conditions amouzou et al 2018 malik et al 2019 steduto et al 2009 the models used in these researches have performed excellently in simulating field scale water and nitrogen consumption crop yield wue and nue rational water and nitrogen allocation strategies are crucial for regional agricultural water and fertilizer management and the use of crop models for the development of irrigation and nitrogen schedules inss has become an active research area many scholars have used crop models to simulate crop yields under different water and nitrogen allocation scenarios to determine appropriate measures for irrigation and nitrogen application management however optimal solutions cannot be obtained using this approach linker and kisekka 2017 malik et al 2019 shen et al 2020 optimization algorithms can output optimal solutions for a given set of constraints deb and jain 2013 several efforts have been made to combine crop growth models with optimization algorithms for water and nitrogen management wu et al 2007 brown et al 2010 wen et al 2017 among them many multiobjective pareto optimization methods have been developed roy et al 2019 used dssat model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency kropp et al 2019 further increased the number of optimization objectives by maximizing yield and minimizing irrigation amount nitrogen application rate and nitrogen leaching to achieve the optimization of inss obtaining reliable crop parameters is crucial when using crop models to simulate crop growth and establish an ins the ceres maize model distinguishes between different maize varieties according to their cultivar coefficients jones and kiniry 1986 and the accuracy of this model depends on the cultivar coefficients of crops jin et al 2016 wang et al 2021 shen et al 2020 used the ceres maize model calibrated using field scale trial data to obtain the yield and wue of summer maize under different sowing dates and inss they compared the obtained data with each other to determine the optimal sowing date and ins the results of the comparison were then used to guide the management of summer maize planting in a large region however the direct application of the results of a field scale crop model to the regional scale can lead to a host of errors when large spatial differences exist between the cultivars and growth environments of crops mo et al 2005 another problem in using crop models to simulate regional crop growth conditions and establish a regional ins is the heterogeneity of regional soil meteorological and field management conditions therefore the university of florida developed the ccafs regional agricultural forecasting toolbox shelia et al 2019 which enables the division of spatial heterogeneity in the inputs and outputs of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and agricultural production systems simulator models to improve the effectiveness of these models at the regional scale gyawali et al 2018 used the aforementioned toolbox for seasonal crop yield forecasting in nepal in addition kim and kisekka 2021 demonstrated how the dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2010 software program can be transformed into a usable web based decision support tool for real time simulations conducted using open source geographic information system technology however the crop cultivar coefficients in the aforementioned studies have been derived from a single crop variety in a single field scale trial and spatial underrepresentation is likely to be present when such cultivar coefficients are applied directly to the regional scale the development of remote sensing technology has enabled the clear spatial representation of some simulation results of crop models e g leaf area index lai mandal et al 2019 kayad et al 2022 thus the spatial representation of cultivar coefficients can be improved by coupling remote sensing information with crop models data assimilation methods that combine crop growth models with remote sensing observations have been rapidly developed to increase the spatial simulation accuracy of crop models curnel et al 2011 argued that assimilating lai into the wofost crop model could improve the accuracy of simulating winter wheat yield huang et al 2015 conducted research at the regional scale further confirming this conclusion additionally jin et al 2016 assimilated remotely sensed lai into the ceres maize model and found a significant improvement in the spatiotemporal continuity of lai for summer maize however the last two studies have estimated the crop model parameters for each pixel from the remotely sensed lai of each pixel factors such as a small quantity of remotely sensed lai data for a single pixel and errors in the remotely sensed lai can cause instability in crop model parameters in summary spatial underrepresentation is present when crop parameters determined from field scale trials are used at regional scales and parameter instability occurs when the pixel by pixel lai is used to derive pixel by pixel crop model parameters at the regional scale therefore we developed a framework that involves the use of a crop model with crop parameters calibrated using remotely sensed lai data to establish a regional ins the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the feasibility of estimating the lai of maize from backward scattering information extracted from microwave remote sensing images 2 to investigate the feasibility of assimilating the remotely sensed lai and crop models to determine regionally representative crop parameters and to assess the ability of the crop models to simulate regional scale summer maize growth 3 to study the use of multiobjective optimization algorithms in establishing an ins that simultaneously achieves high wue high partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn and high crop yield and 4 to analyze the rationality of the established ins in addition we defined the regional scale ceres maize model as a crop model that considers the spatial variability in soil and meteorological parameters and the crop parameters used in this model were calibrated using the remotely sensed lai i e data assimilation method our field scale ceres maize model is a crop model that does not account for the spatial variability in soil and meteorological parameters the crop parameters used in this model were calibrated using field scale experimental data 2 materials and methods this study consisted of two parts the first part involved determining the crop parameters of the regional scale ceres maize model by using data assimilation methods we estimated the lai of summer maize in the study area in different growth stages by using the field scale measured lai and microwave remote sensing data obtained from the sentinel 1 satellite subsequently the sce ua algorithm was used for iteratively updating the sensitive crop parameters of the regional scale ceres maize model until the gap between the lai simulated by the crop model and the remotely sensed lai was minimized the second part of this study involved combining nsga iii and the regional scale ceres maize model for the multiobjective optimization of the ins for summer maize in three typical rainfall years dry normal and wet years finally the optimal ins was determined according to the pareto solution set the overall research framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 study area the study area encompasses most of the fenwei river valley plain 34 42 35 72 n and 109 26 111 48 e fig 2 and includes 16 irrigation districts the climate of this area is semiarid its average annual precipitation is 550 mm its average annual air temperature is 14 4 c and its altitude is 350 800 m the land in the study area is mostly used for agriculture with wheat and maize being planted in rotation in the winter and summer seasons respectively the sowing and harvesting dates of summer maize are early june and early october respectively obtaining information on the summer maize varieties selected by each farmer in a large region is very difficult a survey we conducted revealed that farmers within a certain geographical area tend to select similar maize varieties therefore the study area can be divided into several subregions according to the growth characteristics and growth environment of maize and farmers in the same subregion can be assumed to adopt the same maize varieties guo et al 2018 because the x means algorithm can estimate the number of clusters pelleg and moore 2000 we used this algorithm to divide the study area into three subregions namely mz1 mz2 and mz3 according to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of summer maize as well as the clay and silt contents of the soil fig 2 soil data were obtained from the national earth system science data center http www geodata cn the process for determining the ndvi of summer maize is described in section 2 2 2 the black dots in fig 2 represent regional sampling areas and the yellow dots represent field scale experiment stations 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 field data we selected the dssat ceres maize model to simulate maize growth to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy at the field scale we conducted field experiments in the summer maize growing seasons of 2016 2017 2020 and 2021 the field experiments performed in 2016 and 2017 were conducted at wugong station fig 2 in these experiments the common cultivar zhengdan 958 in the study area was planted and the planting density was 60 000 plants per hectare the aforementioned experiments were replicated thrice had a two factor design three nitrogen application rates and three levels of irrigation and were conducted in a split split plot arranged in randomized blocks the experiments performed in 2020 and 2021 were conducted at yangling station fig 2 with the zhengdan 958 cultivar these experiments were replicated thrice had a two factor design four nitrogen application rates and three planting density levels and were conducted in split split plot arranged in randomized blocks in all the experiments the plot area was 24 m2 weeds were eradicated and insecticide was sprayed in accordance with local agricultural practices data from the 2016 and 2020 trials lai soil water content swc and yield were used to calibrate the field scale ceres maize model and data from the 2017 and 2021 trials were used to validate this model we measured the lai seven times during each growing season by using a gauge with a precision of 1 mm the length from the collar to the tip and width widest point of the leaf of all leaves of the selected plants were measured the areas of individual leaves and lai were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 a s a l w 0 75 2 l a i t a p d 10000 where asa is the area of a single leaf m2 l and w are the length and width of the leaf in meters respectively 0 75 is a coefficient ta is the area of all leaves of a single maize plant in square meters and pd is the planting density in plants per hectare swc was measured every 10 15 days during each growing season by using the gravimetric method the swc was measured every 20 cm over a depth of 0 100 cm by using the center of each plot as an observation point the volumetric water content was obtained by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the bulk density the cylindrical core method casanova et al 2016 which is widely used in agricultural soils was used to measure the soil bulk density yield was measured after the planted maize was harvested to determine the crop parameters of the regional scale ceres maize model we estimated the lai of summer maize at different growth stages across the study area by constructing a model by using remote sensing data and the measured lai in 2021 56 sampling areas with a size of 10 m 10 m were established in the study area to monitor the regional scale growth of summer maize fig 2 we selected areas that were located away from roads and trees to prevent roads and trees from influencing the obtained satellite signals the central location of the sampling areas was determined using a global positioning system three independent sampling points with a size of 1 m 1 m were randomly selected in each sampling area and the value of each sampling index i e lai swc plant height and yield for each sampling area was the average of the values obtained for the three sampling points lai plant height and swc at a depth of 0 20 cm were measured at the v5 fifth leaf collar v7 seventh leaf collar v10 tenth leaf collar and r1 silking stages and yield was measured at maize maturity in addition data on planting date planting depth plant spacing row spacing irrigation time irrigation quantity irrigation method fertilizer application time fertilizer application rate and fertilizer application method were collected for each sampling area 2 2 2 remote sensing data to determine the distribution of summer maize we used sentinel 2 data with high spatial resolution the resolution for this data set is 10 m in the blue green red and near infrared bands and 20 m in the short wave infrared and red edge bands to calculate vegetation indices i e normalized difference vegetation index normalized difference water index and normalized difference built up index sentinel 2 provides data for all land surfaces and coastal areas for every 5 day period the measured spectral range extends from the visible spectrum to the short wave infrared region richter et al 2012 the sentinel 2 top of atmosphere data archived in the google earth engine have been radiometrically and geometrically corrected therefore we extracted the maize growing areas in the study area by using a random forest classifier pal 2005 and the vegetation indices calculated from sentinel 2 top of atmosphere data that were captured during the maize growing season in the summer of 2021 on the basis of the extracted summer maize growing areas we estimated the lai of maize by using backscatter information from sentinel 1 data the measurements of the microwave sensing system of sentinel 1 were marginally affected by solar radiation and this system has all weather working capability with a revisit period of 12 or 6 days thus sentinel 1 images are suitable for estimating the lai of maize in cloudy and rainy areas hosseini et al 2021 we used the sentinel 1 ground range detected grd product provided by google earth engine this product has been subject to preprocessing radiometrically calibration and topographical correction veci et al 2014 to reduce coherent speckle noise the lee method lee et al 1999 was used to filter the grd product backscatter intensities and incidence angles were extracted from the grd product for vertical transmit vertical receive polarization cross polarization and vertical transmit horizontal receive polarization like polarization 2 3 data assimilation based determination of the crop genetic coefficient of the ceres maize model data assimilation which was proposed by charney et al 1969 is a scientific method for integrating intermittent observations and models to reduce the uncertainty of experimental observation errors in model parameter determination we used this method to integrate intermittent satellite observations with the ceres maize crop model to obtain high precision crop model parameters many data assimilation methods are available curnel et al 2011 agyeman et al 2021 wu et al 2021 and the data assimilation method based on the minimization of the cost function is widely used curnel et al 2011 in this method data assimilation is achieved by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a crop model through an assimilation algorithm to minimize the difference between the estimated values obtained using remote sensing data and the simulated values obtained using the crop model therefore we estimated the regional lai through support vector regression svr modeling and then assimilated the estimated lai into the ceres maize crop model to obtain the regional scale crop model parameters 2 3 1 svr based estimation of the regional lai to estimate the lai of summer maize in the study area svr joachims 1998 was used to fit the relationships among backscatter intensity incident angle date of lai measurement and measured lai in 2021 we transformed date of lai measurement into the day of year format svr has been widely used to estimate the lai of maize mandal et al 2019 hosseini et al 2021 svr is a statistical machine learning method where variables are mapped to a high dimensional space to transform a low dimensional nonlinear problem into a high dimensional linear regression problem we derived the code of the svr algorithm from the libsvm online library https www csie ntu edu tw cjlin libsvm index html an svr model maps nonlinear data from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space by using kernel functions the gaussian radial basis function rbf kernel has strong approximation properties because of its few hyperparameters and high accuracy therefore the rbf kernel was selected as the kernel function for constructing an svr model in this study cost c and gamma Œ≥ are two key hyperparameters in the training of an svr model in this study the grid search method hsu et al 2003 and five fold cross validation were used to find the best combination of hyperparameters after the optimal hyperparameters were determined 224 field scale lai observations from 56 sampling areas and the corresponding remote sensing data were randomly divided into training and testing data sets the training data set contained 140 sets of remote sensing data and the corresponding field scale lai measured it was used to train the svr based lai model the testing data set contained 84 sets of remote sensing data and the corresponding field scale lais that were obtained through measurement the performance of the lai estimation model was evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse which were calculated as eqs 3 and 4 2 3 2 ceres maize model the ceres maize model jones and kiniry 1986 embedded in the dssat hoogenboom et al 2010 was used to simulate the temporal variation in the lai of maize in addition the ceres maize model can describe the daily growth and development of maize under temperature stress water stress and nitrogen fertilizer stress ritchie 1998 to calculate the daily soil water balance this model uses a one dimensional tipping bucket soil water balance method to predict soil water flow and root water uptake in up to 10 soil horizons ritchie 1985b to run the field scale ceres maize model meteorological data soil data cultivar coefficients and field management information must be input into it the minimum meteorological data required for this model include daily precipitation maximum daily air temperature minimum daily air temperature and daily solar radiation the aforementioned meteorological data for the wugong and yangling experimental stations were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and yangling meteorological station respectively we used the method of angstrom 1924 to calculate daily solar radiation from daily data on sunshine duration the basic soil data required for the ceres maize model were those on bulk weight organic carbon content clay content silt content field capacity wilting point saturated water content and soil ph all of which were obtained through laboratory measurements field management information was obtained from our experiments at the wugong and yangling stations six cultivar coefficients table 1 were obtained by calibrating the field scale ceres maize model the 2016 and 2020 field scale trial data lai swc and yield were used to calibrate this model and the 2017 and 2021 field scale trial data were used to validate the model the performance of the field scale ceres maize model was evaluated using determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse and average relative error are which were calculated as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o 2 s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 4 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 5 a r e 1 n i 1 n o i s i o i 100 where n is the number of observed values o i and s i are the observed and simulated values for the ith data pair respectively and and s are the observed average and simulated average respectively an r 2 value close to 1 and rmse and are values close to 0 indicate high agreement between the observed and simulated values crop model regionalization was achieved by running the crop model for each simulation unit of the study area therefore the input parameters of the crop model also had to be regionalized considering the study purpose and to minimize computational cost we used a grid of size 5 km 5 km to divide the study area into different simulation units we used ordinary kriging interpolation to estimate the meteorological station data for each grid as for soil data a study by han et al 2015 obtained gridded soil data with a resolution of 5 to ensure consistency between the resolution of the soil and meteorological data we generated gridded values of soil data at a scale of 5 5 km2 through inverse distance weighted interpolation we obtained field management information through field measurements and interviews with local farmers section 2 2 1 different cultivars of the same crop usually exhibit some similarity which indicates that the crop parameters calibrated for a field scale crop model can act as a reference for calibrating crop parameters for a regional scale crop model lu et al 2021b however sensitivity analysis had to be conducted in this study to determine which cultivar parameters had to be spatialized and which cultivar parameters could be obtained from a calibrated field scale crop model 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis because the ceres maize model contains many crop parameters and the irrigation and fertilization data for the sampling area were obtained through surveys a certain degree of uncertainty existed in the model to accurately obtain the crop parameters we conducted sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive and insensitive parameters insensitive parameters were identified using the relatively refined field scale experimental results and sensitive parameters were identified using the lai estimated from remote sensing data for the entire study area the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 was used to identify the sensitive parameters the efast is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition in this test the variance of the model simulation results is decomposed to obtain the sensitivity index of each parameter the higher the sensitivity index of a parameter the stronger is its influence on the model output 2 3 4 integration of the shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona sce ua for data assimilation the sensitive parameters of the ceres maize model were iteratively adjusted using assimilation algorithms to minimize the difference between the lai estimated from microwave remote sensing data and the lai simulated using the regional scale ceres maize model to quantify this difference the following cost function was constructed 6 j x 1 k q k 1 k q 1 q l a i k q s i m x l a i k q r s x l a i k q r s where j is the cost function x is a vector composed of the parameters to be calibrated l a i k q s i m is the lai simulated using the regional scale ceres maize model l a i k q r s is the lai estimated using remote sensing data q is the number of lai observations and k is the number of simulation units the parameter l a i k q r s represents the average lai of all maize pixels within each simulation unit to identify sensitive cultivar coefficients for maize we used the sce ua optimization algorithm duan et al 1993 to minimize the cost function presented in eq 6 this algorithm is a global optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of deterministic search stochastic search and competitive evolution and is insensitive to the initial values of optimization parameters huang et al 2019 if the optimized parameter values are within a predefined normalized geometric range 0 001 https www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 7671 shuffled complex evolution sce ua method and the decrease in the cost function does not exceed 0 01 after 10 iterations then the sce ua algorithm is considered to have converged 2 4 irrigation schedule optimization through the use of calibrated regional scale ceres maize model the inss for summer maize in subregions mz1 mz2 and mz3 were optimized for each typical rainfall year by using a multiobjective optimization algorithm 2 4 1 identification of typical rainfall years multiyear historical precipitation data for the crop growing season are essential for identifying typical rainfall years guo et al 2021 to determine the typical rainfall years at the regional scale we used the ordinary kriging interpolation method to generate daily rainfall data with a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km for the study area for 51 years from 1970 to 2020 we then obtained the daily average rainfall data for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions subsequently the daily rainfall data were used accumulated to determine the precipitation in 51 summer maize growing seasons in each subregion and these precipitation data were used to identify typical rainfall years through empirical frequency analysis we identified that 25 50 and 75 of the cumulative frequency curve of precipitation for each subregion represented wet normal and dry years respectively 2 4 2 irrigation schedule optimization model the multiobjective optimization of the inss was conducted by maximizing yield wue and pfpn which reflected the objectives of pursuing high crop yield saving water improving nue and reducing pollution irrigation frequency irrigation time irrigation quantity nitrogen application time and nitrogen application rate were used as decision variables in the adopted multiobjective optimization algorithm the yield wue and pfpn can be achieved using the regional scale ceres maize model 7 m a x y m a x w u e m a x p f p n d s s a t t 1 t j w 1 w j f 1 f j f b 8 y 1 k k 1 k y k w u e 1 k k 1 k w u e k p f p n 1 k k 1 k p f p n k where y is the average crop yield kg ha k is the number of simulation units in subregion mz1 mz2 or mz3 and j is the irrigation frequency the units of wue and pfpn in eq 8 are kg m3 and kg kg respectively according to farmers in the study area the irrigation frequency was such that j 1 2 3 during the maize growing season a part of the nitrogen quantity used was applied as a base dose during sowing and the remaining quantity was distributed equally according to the irrigation frequency the parameters t 1 t j represent the irrigation dates w 1 w j represent the irrigation quantities f 1 f j denote the nitrogen application rates and f b is the base nitrogen dose during sowing when j 1 w 2 w 3 0 and f 2 f 3 0 moreover when j 2 w 3 0 and f 3 0 we solved the aforementioned multiobjective optimization problem by using nsga iii deb and jain 2013 which combines the principles of evolutionary optimization and multiobjective optimization this algorithm is useful for optimizing complex nonlinear objectives which makes it a powerful tool for multiobjective decision making nsga iii uses specific encoding to convert the decision variable data in the solution space into data with a genotype string structure in a genetic space and the converted data are analogous to chromosomes kumar 2013 to reduce coding redundancy the genes j a 1 a 2 a 3 w 1 w 2 w 3 Œ≤ and f t were used as constituents of the chromosomes fig 3 the meaning of each gene is presented in table 2 before calculating the objective function by using the ceres maize model the chromosome data had to be decoded into decision variables i e irrigation date irrigation quantity and nitrogen rate to avoid conflicts between previous and subsequent irrigation times eqs 9 11 were used for decoding to determine the irrigation date a diagram of irrigation dates is displayed in fig 4 9 t 1 p d a 1 l g p 10 t 2 t 1 a 2 l g p a 1 l g p 11 t 3 t 2 a 3 h d t 2 where p d is the planting date of summer maize l gp is duration of the growth period and h d is the harvest date the harvest date of summer maize in each subregion was set as october 1 the ration factors a 1 a 2 and a 3 reflect the duration of the irrigation interval and t 1 t 2 and t 3 denote the irrigation dates in addition given the level of local irrigation technology the irrigation quantity and nitrogen application rate were set as multiples of 5 and the irrigation time i e top dressing time was rounded off to the nearest whole number for the dssat platemo tian et al 2017 is a matlab platform mathworks natick ma usa that can be used to execute nsga iii we wrote a matlab program for the input and output of the dssat this program generates an experiment file mzx file in the standard format of the dssat and this file includes details on the irrigation date irrigation quantity nitrogen application date and nitrogen application rate the executable file named dscsm047 exe is used by the matlab program to obtain the yield wue and pfpn for an experiment thus the objective function of nsga iii can be simply and elegantly integrated into the dssat nsga iii is considered to have converged when the hypervolume is visually smooth emmerich et al 2005 kropp et al 2019 in addition to improve the computational efficiency the ins optimization process was run on an amd ryzen 7 1700 eight core processor with the support of a matlab parallel computing toolbox 2 4 3 determination of the optimal irrigation schedule nsga iii is a multiobjective optimization algorithm that obtains a pareto solution set by determining the best trade off between multiple conflicting objectives because the optimal solution in the solution set cannot maximize all the objectives simultaneously technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis was used to determine the optimal ins in this study the weights of each objective greatly affect the decision results of the topsis each objective can be assigned a weight by using subjective or objective weighting methods obtaining subjective preferences regarding the importance of the three objectives in this study i e maximizing yield wue and pfpn was difficult therefore the objective weighting method was used to determine the weights of these objectives researchers have developed many objective weighting methods including the entropy method rani et al 2019 principal component analysis pca peng et al 2020 the coefficient of variation cv method el santawy 2015 and the criteria importance though intercriteria correlation critic method diakoulaki et al 1995 in the entropy and cv methods the discreteness of solutions is used to describe the importance of each objective while ignoring the correlations between objectives in pca multiple correlated variables are converted into several integrated uncorrelated variables however pca does not reflect the discreteness of solutions some discreteness and correlation existed among the three objectives of this study by contrast in the critic method standard deviation and correlation coefficient are used to measure the discreteness and correlation between two objectives respectively 12 w u œÉ u v 1 v 1 r u v v 1 v œÉ u v 1 v 1 r u v where w u is the weights of the uth objective œÉ u is the standard deviation of the uth objective r uv is the correlation coefficient between the uth and vth objective and v 3 is the number of objectives after the weights of each objective were determined the topsis yoon and hwang 1995 was used to determine the optimal ins the basic idea of the topsis is to rank solutions by calculating their distance from the positive and negative ideal solutions the best solution is closest to the positive ideal solution and farthest from the negative ideal solution in the topsis the information of the original data can be fully used moreover the topsis can fully reflect the gap between solutions and has the advantages of being accurate reliable and universal by using the topsis we normalized the pareto solution sets of yield wue and pfpn to eliminate their dimensional differences the normalized objectives were then multiplied by their respective weights to construct a weighted objective matrix z the matrix z is a m v matrix where m is the number of pareto solutions and v is the number of objectives the positive ideal solution z best and negative ideal solution z worst were determined according to z these solutions were row vectors that reflected the optimal and worst values respectively of yield wue and pfpn the relative closeness rc i was calculated according to the euclidean distance of the pareto solution from the positive and negative ideal solutions 13 d m v 1 v z m v z v b e s t 2 d m v 1 v z m v z v w o r s t 2 14 r c m d m d m d m where z v b e s t and z v w o r s t are the positive and negative ideal solutions of the vth objective respectively d m is the euclidean distance between the mth pareto solution and the positive ideal solution d m is the euclidean distance between the mth pareto solution and the negative ideal solution m 1 m and rc m represents the relative closeness of the mth pareto solution the closer rc m is to 1 the closer is the corresponding pareto solution to the positive ideal solution and the farther is this solution from the negative ideal solution moreover pareto solutions can be ranked according to their rc m values to determine the optimal solution 3 results 3 1 estimation of the regional lai lai and plant height can indicate maize growth jin et al 2016 fig 5 displays the statistical characteristics of the lai and plant height of summer maize in different growth stages in the study area from the v5 stage to the r1 stage plant height fig 5 a and lai fig 5 b which are represented by the medians of the box plots in fig 5 gradually increased the r1 stage was the turning point from vegetative growth to reproductive growth for summer maize fang et al 2021 with the peak plant height and lai occurring in this stage in the aforementioned stage approximately 75 of the summer maize plants had a height exceeding 2 6 m and approximately 75 of the summer maize plants had an lai higher than 4 8 on the basis of the measured lai of summer maize for 56 sampling areas an svr model was developed using backscatter intensity incidence angle and date when the lai was measured to estimate the lai of summer maize fig 6 illustrates the prediction performance of the aforementioned model on the training and testing sets for the training set fig 6 a the lai predicted by the developed lai prediction model closely matched the measured lai with r 2 0 93 and rmse 0 49 for the test set fig 6 b the r 2 and rmse were 0 89 and 0 59 respectively the measured and predicted lai values were close to the 1 1 line the developed lai estimation model could predict the lai with acceptable accuracy therefore we used this model to estimate the lai at the regional scale fig 7 as displayed in fig 7 the lai of each subregion mz1 mz2 and mz3 gradually increased with the progress of summer maize growth in the v5 stage the differences in the lai values of mz1 and mz2 were not obvious and the lai of these subregions was mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 1 the lai of mz3 was higher than that of the other two subregions and was mainly concentrated between 0 6 and 1 59 in the v7 and v10 stages the lai of maize exhibited obvious differences among the subregions in the r1 stage the lai of mz1 mz2 and mz3 reached the maximum value and the lai of mz3 was marginally smaller than that of the other two subregions 3 2 performance evaluation of the field and regional scale ceres maize models on the basis of the results of sensitivity analysis the p2 p5 and sowing date jin et al 2016 wang et al 2021 which had the highest sensitivity index values were re estimated during data assimilation and the other parameters including p1 g2 g3 and phint were derived from the calibrated field scale ceres maize model to obtain the parameters of the field scale ceres maize model table 3 this model was calibrated using field data for 2016 and 2020 fig 8 and then validated using field data for 2017 and 2021 fig 8 during the calibration stage the lai fig 8 a and yield fig 8 b simulated using the calibrated field scale ceres maize model matched well with the measured lai and yield respectively the corresponding r2 and rmse for lai were 0 97 and 0 21 m2 m2 and for yield they were 0 95 and 178 80 kg ha respectively during the validation stage fig 8 b the field scale crop model also performed well in simulating lai and yield the corresponding r2 and rmse for lai were 0 94 and 0 29 m2 m2 and for yield they were 0 94 and 316 03 kg ha respectively subsequently the efast was used to identify sensitive parameters sowing date p2 and p5 that affect daily lai three sensitive parameters were re estimated for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions and the entire region by using data assimilation methods table 3 differences in cultivar coefficients and sowing dates were found between the regional and field scales and among subregion mz1 subregion mz2 subregion mz3 and the entire study area the aforementioned parameters in table 3 were used to simulate lai plant height swc depth of 0 20 cm and yield for the 56 sampling areas fig 9 as displayed in fig 9 the simulation performance of the regional scale ceres maize model was better than that of the field scale ceres maize model in terms of the r 2 rmse and mre of the growth indicators of summer maize lai plant height swc and yield in addition the simulation performance of the regional scale ceres maize model was better when the study area was divided into three subregions than when the study area was not divided into subregions the r2 values for lai plant height swc and yield increased by 0 02 0 04 0 10 and 0 15 respectively while the rmse values decreased by 0 36 m2 m2 0 04 m 0 01 cm3 cm3 and 203 33 kg ha and the mre values decreased by 33 12 2 67 5 23 and 1 67 respectively in summary the regional scale crop model in which the crop parameters and sowing date are determined through the data assimilation method better reflected the growth characteristics of summer maize at the regional scale when the study area was divided into three subregions than when the area was not divided into subregions therefore we used the regional scale ceres maize model to determine the optimal ins for each subregion 3 3 irrigation schedule optimization before using the regional scale ceres maize model to establish an ins for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions typical rainfall years dry normal and wet years were identified according to the rainfall during the summer maize growing season in each subregion table 4 presents the average air temperature and total rainfall during the summer maize growing season for each typical rainfall year in each subregion fig 10 depicts the maximum daily air temperature minimum daily air temperature and daily rainfall for each typical rainfall year in each subregion the method described in section 2 4 2 was used for the multiobjective optimization of the ins for each subregion in three typical precipitation years and pareto solution sets for maximizing yield wue and pfpn were obtained fig 11 wue increased with yield up to a certain point before decreasing the objective of maximizing pfpn conflicted with the objectives of maximizing wue and yield therefore the weights of yield wue and pfpn for different subregions in three typical rainfall years were determined separately by using the critic method we found that the differences in weights were small in each case to reflect the overall relevance of and conflict among the three objectives in different typical rainfall years in different subregions we integrated the pareto solution sets in nine cases to determine the weights the final determined weights for yield wue and pfpn were 0 41 0 28 and 0 31 respectively after the weights were determined the optimal solutions for different subregions in a dry year normal year and wet year were determined using the topsis black triangles in fig 11 the corresponding optimal inss are presented in table 5 for comparison the current inss used by farmers are also included in table 5 as presented in table 5 compared with the current inss used by farmers the optimized inss were associated with marginally higher irrigation quantities average increase of 2 66 but considerably lower nitrogen application rates average decrease of 31 6 except for the dry year in mz1 and the dry and normal years in mz2 the optimized inss were associated with more frequent irrigation than were the currently used inss in the currently used inss nitrogen is applied during the maize jointing stage whereas in the optimized inss nitrogen is applied during irrigation which increases the frequency of nitrogen application reduces the nitrogen application rate in each instance of nitrogen application and reduces the total nitrogen application rate the average ratio of base fertilizer to top dressing corresponding to the currently used inss was 2 3 and the ratio of base fertilizer to top dressing corresponding to the optimized inss varied in different subregions and typical rainfall years fig 12 depicts the yield wue and pfpn of summer maize under the optimal ins in each subregion in different typical rainfall years the maize yield was lower in mz2 than in mz1 and mz3 in different typical rainfall years because of the higher rainfall higher number of cloudy days and lower temperature in mz2 table 4 fig 10 therefore the wue for mz2 was lower than that for mz1 and mz3 in the wet year the pfpn for mz1 was generally lower than that for mz2 and mz3 because of the sandy soils in mz1 which exhibited low effectiveness in retaining fertilizer in general yield and wue were high in most cases and pfpn was higher than 45 kg kg in most cases for the dry normal and wet years the average yields in the study area were 9429 9465 and 10218 kg ha respectively the average wues were 2 48 2 53 and 2 31 kg m3 respectively and the average pfpns were 54 46 55 23 and 58 49 kg kg respectively fig 13 depicts the percentage changes in yield wue and pfpn between the optimum and currently used inss yield and wue increased in the majority of the areas with the average increases in yield being 12 51 6 35 and 8 93 during the dry normal and wet years respectively and the average increases in wue being 10 41 2 64 and 5 58 during the dry normal and wet years respectively in particular yield and wue increased more in mz1 than in the other subregions in the dry year pfpn increased in all cases with the average increase being 66 17 62 35 and 61 81 for the dry normal and wet years respectively the mz2 subregion exhibited the highest overall increase in pfpn the mz1 subregion exhibited the highest increase in pfpn in the dry year and some areas in the mz3 subregion exhibited the highest increase in pfpn in the normal and wet years certain areas exhibited increases in pfpn but decreases in yield and wue the percentages of the study area that exhibited a decrease of more than 3 in yield were 13 89 8 53 and 2 80 in the dry normal and wet years respectively moreover the percentages of the study area that exhibited a decrease of more than 3 in wue were 9 39 6 53 and 3 41 for the dry normal and wet years respectively in the dry normal and wet years the maximum yield reduction rates were 14 12 11 31 and 11 47 respectively and the maximum reduction rates of wue were 13 11 6 35 and 8 86 respectively in general the optimized inss increased yield wue and pfpn 4 discussion 4 1 increase in the regional simulation accuracy of the regional scale ceres maize model when using remotely sensed lai the calibrated field scale ceres maize model performed well in simulating field scale yield and lai fig 8 because this model is developed for fields with a single maize cultivar and homogeneous maize growing environment jones and kiniry 1986 the ceres maize model can reproduce maize growth as long as the user can accurately input soil data meteorological data field management data and cultivar coefficients into the model amouzou et al 2018 malik et al 2019 the regional scale ceres maize model calibrated using remotely sensed lai performed much better in the simulation of regional scale maize growth than did the field scale ceres maize model calibrated using field trial data fig 9 this result was obtained because the spatial variability in the soil and meteorological conditions in each sampling area considerably decreased when the study area was divided into multiple simulation units guo et al 2021 and shelia et al 2019 have demonstrated that decreases in the spatial variability of soil and meteorological conditions cause an increase in the regional simulation accuracy of a crop model when the study area was not divided into three subregions the regional scale crop model could not simulate the regional crop growth well this result indicates that a single set of crop parameters cannot accurately represent a large area therefore large study regions must be divided into different subregions and crop parameters must be determined for each subregion therond et al 2011 conducted a study using crop models to simulate the growth of maize and wheat in 12 regions of the european union which also confirmed the necessity of this approach consequently we re estimated the satisfactory maize cultivar coefficients and sowing dates for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions by using the lai estimated from microwave remote sensing data table 3 ndvi and soil characteristics should be considered when dividing a large region into subregions because these parameters reflect the combined effect of the crop growth environment and cultivar guo et al 2018 further exploration is required on how large areas can be reasonably subdivided when simulating regional crop growth 4 2 irrigation schedule optimization compared with the current inss used by farmers in the study area the optimized inss were associated with a marginally higher irrigation quantity average increase of 2 66 but considerably lower nitrogen application rate average decrease of 31 6 when the optimized inss were used yield and wue increased in the majority of areas and pfpn increased in all areas these results indicate that the optimized schedules are effective and increase yield wue and pfpn in this study the nitrogen application rate was 150 210 kg ha yang et al 2017 compared the effects of different nitrogen rates on summer maize yield nue nitrogen leaching and nitrogen residue through field trials and recommended a nitrogen application rate of 180 200 kg ha this is because the nitrogen application rates derived using a regional scale crop model can account for the crop yield wue and nue at a regional scale whereas the nitrogen application rates derived through field trials can only reflect the situation at a point scale and for a limited number of years thus we believed that the optimized inss were reasonable the optimized inss resulted in an increase in pfpn but decreases in yield and wue in some areas fig 11 which might be attributed to a combination of soil and climatic conditions additional detailed studies are required to improve yield and wue in these locations the results of this study suggest that regional scale crop models can adequately characterize regional soil meteorological and crop cultivar differences to reflect the effects of irrigation and fertilization on crop yield thus these models can be used to develop optimized inss that are suitable for the regional scale the irrigation quantity was marginally higher in the optimized inss than in the presently used inss because we reduced the nitrogen application rate to reduce environmental pollution this step was not performed when developing the presently used inss compared with the currently used inss the optimized inss exhibited marginally higher irrigation quantities considerably lower nitrogen application rates and higher yields and wues thus the optimized schedules are reasonable the objectives of saving water and fertilizer and increasing yield can be achieved by changing their weights in the currently used inss nitrogen is applied only once after sowing and in the optimized inss nitrogen is applied during irrigation which increases irrigation frequency reduces the nitrogen application rate during each instance of nitrogen application reduces total nitrogen application rate and thus increases pfpn the aforementioned results are obtained because split nitrogen application can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching and increase nitrogen uptake by crops mueller et al 2017 the current practice of applying nitrogen only during the sowing and jointing stages of maize growth can cause nitrate nitrogen to move downward in the soil because of rainfall and irrigation thus the nitrogen fertilizer needs of maize cannot be met during the later stages of growth and soil contamination occurs zhao et al 2006 lu et al 2021a overall the constructed regional scale crop models can characterize regional soil meteorological and crop cultivar differences to reflect the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on crop yield it should be pointed out that when formulating inss at the regional scale we have taken special consideration of the spatial representativeness of crop parameters which has been rare in previous studies therefore regional scale crop models can be used to develop inss that are suitable for the regional scale 5 conclusions we developed a framework for optimizing regional inss that consists of the ceres maize model microwave remote sensing data and a multiobjective optimization algorithm this framework can be used to optimize the ins for crops grown over a large area the conclusions of this study are as follows first microwave backscatter intensity microwave incidence angle and date of lai measurement can be input into an svr model to obtain accurate predictions of the lai of summer maize microwave remote sensing data are less affected by cloud and rain than are optical remote sensing data thus microwave remote sensing data can be feasibly used to estimate lai in areas with high cloud cover and rainfall second the estimated regional lai was input into an assimilation algorithm to determine the key cultivar coefficients of the ceres maize model the crop model parameters determined using remote sensing data enabled more accurate simulations of lai plant height swc and yield at the regional scale than did the crop model parameters determined using field scale experiments third the regional scale ceres maize model was coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the inss for summer maize in different typical rainfall years in different subregions compared with the inss currently used by farmers the optimized inss were associated with an average increase of 2 66 in the irrigation quantity an average decrease of 31 6 in the nitrogen application rate and increases of 6 35 12 51 2 64 10 41 and 61 8 66 2 in the yield wue and pfpn respectively depending on the typical rainfall year the aforementioned results indicate that the optimized inss increased maize yield wue and pfpn this phenomenon occurred mainly because the developed regional scale ceres maize model fully accounts for the spatial variability in meteorological and soil parameters and the spatial representativeness of crop parameters in the study area optimized inss established using regional scale crop model parameters and remote sensing data can provide guidance to irrigation management departments based on the irrigation amounts identified in this paper the government can encourage farmers to reduce nitrogen application and adopt a split nitrogen application approach to provide nitrogen nutrition to maize however this study did not directly address the costs associated with irrigation nitrogen application crop yield and environmental impacts

8866,using crop models to develop reasonable irrigation and nitrogen schedules inss is critical for achieving high yields and maximizing water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency however the inss developed based on crop parameters determined through field experiments have low robustness at the regional scale remote sensing data indicate the growth conditions of regional crops and representative regional crop parameters can be determined using remote sensing data the objective of the present study was to develop a regional ins by adopting a crop model with crop parameters calibrated using the remotely sensed leaf area index lai first the crop parameters of a field scale crop model were calibrated on the basis of field scale trial data for four summer maize growing seasons sensitive crop parameters at the regional scale were then identified using an assimilation algorithm based on the remotely sensed lai the rationality of using the remotely sensed lai for determining regional crop parameters was demonstrated by simulating regional maize growth finally a regional scale crop model was developed and coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the regional ins for different typical rainfall years the results indicated that the regional scale crop model was more accurate than was the field scale crop model in simulating the regional lai plant height soil water content and yield and the corresponding rmse decreased by 0 50 m2 m2 0 15 m 0 02 cm3 cm3 344 11 kg ha compared with the inss currently used by farmers the optimized ins was associated with a marginally higher irrigation quantity average increase of 2 66 but a significantly lower nitrogen application rate average decrease of 31 6 the crop yield wue and partial factor productivity for nitrogen were 6 35 12 51 2 64 10 41 and 61 8 66 2 higher respectively in different typical rainfall years when using the optimized ins than when using an unoptimized ins the results of this study indicate that a regional ins established on the basis of regional crop model parameters estimated using remote sensing data can aid irrigation and nitrogen application scheduling keywords regional scale ceres maize model remote sensing water use efficiency partial factor productivity of nitrogen multiobjective optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water and nitrogen are crucial factors that affect crop growth and yield water scarcity has become a global systemic risk sun et al 2016 that challenges the sustainability of traditional agricultural practices and is a major factor limiting agricultural production dadrasan et al 2015 although reliable nitrogen supply for plant growth has made significant contributions to increasing crop yields over the past century zhang et al 2015 the application of nitrogen fertilizers higher than the nitrogen requirements of crops can cause nitrogen loss from arable lands to the environment ronaghi and ghasemi fasaei 2013 such over fertilization not only decreases nitrogen use efficiency nue and increases environmental problems nosheen et al 2021 but also does not significantly increase crop yield li et al 2016 under conditions of limited water supply nitrogen fertilizers are crucial in increasing water use efficiency wue waraich et al 2011 moreover water and nitrogen must be rationally allocated to improve nitrogen fertilizer effectiveness and reduce environmental pollution li et al 2009 therefore suitable measures for rational irrigation and nitrogen management must be identified the development of crop growth models has enabled researchers to simulate crop growth under different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization conditions a variety of models such as ceres maize jones and kiniry 1986 ceres wheat ritchie 1985a and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 have been widely used to simulate crop growth with specific regard to crop yield wue and nue under different irrigation and nitrogen application conditions amouzou et al 2018 malik et al 2019 steduto et al 2009 the models used in these researches have performed excellently in simulating field scale water and nitrogen consumption crop yield wue and nue rational water and nitrogen allocation strategies are crucial for regional agricultural water and fertilizer management and the use of crop models for the development of irrigation and nitrogen schedules inss has become an active research area many scholars have used crop models to simulate crop yields under different water and nitrogen allocation scenarios to determine appropriate measures for irrigation and nitrogen application management however optimal solutions cannot be obtained using this approach linker and kisekka 2017 malik et al 2019 shen et al 2020 optimization algorithms can output optimal solutions for a given set of constraints deb and jain 2013 several efforts have been made to combine crop growth models with optimization algorithms for water and nitrogen management wu et al 2007 brown et al 2010 wen et al 2017 among them many multiobjective pareto optimization methods have been developed roy et al 2019 used dssat model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency kropp et al 2019 further increased the number of optimization objectives by maximizing yield and minimizing irrigation amount nitrogen application rate and nitrogen leaching to achieve the optimization of inss obtaining reliable crop parameters is crucial when using crop models to simulate crop growth and establish an ins the ceres maize model distinguishes between different maize varieties according to their cultivar coefficients jones and kiniry 1986 and the accuracy of this model depends on the cultivar coefficients of crops jin et al 2016 wang et al 2021 shen et al 2020 used the ceres maize model calibrated using field scale trial data to obtain the yield and wue of summer maize under different sowing dates and inss they compared the obtained data with each other to determine the optimal sowing date and ins the results of the comparison were then used to guide the management of summer maize planting in a large region however the direct application of the results of a field scale crop model to the regional scale can lead to a host of errors when large spatial differences exist between the cultivars and growth environments of crops mo et al 2005 another problem in using crop models to simulate regional crop growth conditions and establish a regional ins is the heterogeneity of regional soil meteorological and field management conditions therefore the university of florida developed the ccafs regional agricultural forecasting toolbox shelia et al 2019 which enables the division of spatial heterogeneity in the inputs and outputs of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and agricultural production systems simulator models to improve the effectiveness of these models at the regional scale gyawali et al 2018 used the aforementioned toolbox for seasonal crop yield forecasting in nepal in addition kim and kisekka 2021 demonstrated how the dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2010 software program can be transformed into a usable web based decision support tool for real time simulations conducted using open source geographic information system technology however the crop cultivar coefficients in the aforementioned studies have been derived from a single crop variety in a single field scale trial and spatial underrepresentation is likely to be present when such cultivar coefficients are applied directly to the regional scale the development of remote sensing technology has enabled the clear spatial representation of some simulation results of crop models e g leaf area index lai mandal et al 2019 kayad et al 2022 thus the spatial representation of cultivar coefficients can be improved by coupling remote sensing information with crop models data assimilation methods that combine crop growth models with remote sensing observations have been rapidly developed to increase the spatial simulation accuracy of crop models curnel et al 2011 argued that assimilating lai into the wofost crop model could improve the accuracy of simulating winter wheat yield huang et al 2015 conducted research at the regional scale further confirming this conclusion additionally jin et al 2016 assimilated remotely sensed lai into the ceres maize model and found a significant improvement in the spatiotemporal continuity of lai for summer maize however the last two studies have estimated the crop model parameters for each pixel from the remotely sensed lai of each pixel factors such as a small quantity of remotely sensed lai data for a single pixel and errors in the remotely sensed lai can cause instability in crop model parameters in summary spatial underrepresentation is present when crop parameters determined from field scale trials are used at regional scales and parameter instability occurs when the pixel by pixel lai is used to derive pixel by pixel crop model parameters at the regional scale therefore we developed a framework that involves the use of a crop model with crop parameters calibrated using remotely sensed lai data to establish a regional ins the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the feasibility of estimating the lai of maize from backward scattering information extracted from microwave remote sensing images 2 to investigate the feasibility of assimilating the remotely sensed lai and crop models to determine regionally representative crop parameters and to assess the ability of the crop models to simulate regional scale summer maize growth 3 to study the use of multiobjective optimization algorithms in establishing an ins that simultaneously achieves high wue high partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn and high crop yield and 4 to analyze the rationality of the established ins in addition we defined the regional scale ceres maize model as a crop model that considers the spatial variability in soil and meteorological parameters and the crop parameters used in this model were calibrated using the remotely sensed lai i e data assimilation method our field scale ceres maize model is a crop model that does not account for the spatial variability in soil and meteorological parameters the crop parameters used in this model were calibrated using field scale experimental data 2 materials and methods this study consisted of two parts the first part involved determining the crop parameters of the regional scale ceres maize model by using data assimilation methods we estimated the lai of summer maize in the study area in different growth stages by using the field scale measured lai and microwave remote sensing data obtained from the sentinel 1 satellite subsequently the sce ua algorithm was used for iteratively updating the sensitive crop parameters of the regional scale ceres maize model until the gap between the lai simulated by the crop model and the remotely sensed lai was minimized the second part of this study involved combining nsga iii and the regional scale ceres maize model for the multiobjective optimization of the ins for summer maize in three typical rainfall years dry normal and wet years finally the optimal ins was determined according to the pareto solution set the overall research framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 study area the study area encompasses most of the fenwei river valley plain 34 42 35 72 n and 109 26 111 48 e fig 2 and includes 16 irrigation districts the climate of this area is semiarid its average annual precipitation is 550 mm its average annual air temperature is 14 4 c and its altitude is 350 800 m the land in the study area is mostly used for agriculture with wheat and maize being planted in rotation in the winter and summer seasons respectively the sowing and harvesting dates of summer maize are early june and early october respectively obtaining information on the summer maize varieties selected by each farmer in a large region is very difficult a survey we conducted revealed that farmers within a certain geographical area tend to select similar maize varieties therefore the study area can be divided into several subregions according to the growth characteristics and growth environment of maize and farmers in the same subregion can be assumed to adopt the same maize varieties guo et al 2018 because the x means algorithm can estimate the number of clusters pelleg and moore 2000 we used this algorithm to divide the study area into three subregions namely mz1 mz2 and mz3 according to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of summer maize as well as the clay and silt contents of the soil fig 2 soil data were obtained from the national earth system science data center http www geodata cn the process for determining the ndvi of summer maize is described in section 2 2 2 the black dots in fig 2 represent regional sampling areas and the yellow dots represent field scale experiment stations 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 field data we selected the dssat ceres maize model to simulate maize growth to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy at the field scale we conducted field experiments in the summer maize growing seasons of 2016 2017 2020 and 2021 the field experiments performed in 2016 and 2017 were conducted at wugong station fig 2 in these experiments the common cultivar zhengdan 958 in the study area was planted and the planting density was 60 000 plants per hectare the aforementioned experiments were replicated thrice had a two factor design three nitrogen application rates and three levels of irrigation and were conducted in a split split plot arranged in randomized blocks the experiments performed in 2020 and 2021 were conducted at yangling station fig 2 with the zhengdan 958 cultivar these experiments were replicated thrice had a two factor design four nitrogen application rates and three planting density levels and were conducted in split split plot arranged in randomized blocks in all the experiments the plot area was 24 m2 weeds were eradicated and insecticide was sprayed in accordance with local agricultural practices data from the 2016 and 2020 trials lai soil water content swc and yield were used to calibrate the field scale ceres maize model and data from the 2017 and 2021 trials were used to validate this model we measured the lai seven times during each growing season by using a gauge with a precision of 1 mm the length from the collar to the tip and width widest point of the leaf of all leaves of the selected plants were measured the areas of individual leaves and lai were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 a s a l w 0 75 2 l a i t a p d 10000 where asa is the area of a single leaf m2 l and w are the length and width of the leaf in meters respectively 0 75 is a coefficient ta is the area of all leaves of a single maize plant in square meters and pd is the planting density in plants per hectare swc was measured every 10 15 days during each growing season by using the gravimetric method the swc was measured every 20 cm over a depth of 0 100 cm by using the center of each plot as an observation point the volumetric water content was obtained by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the bulk density the cylindrical core method casanova et al 2016 which is widely used in agricultural soils was used to measure the soil bulk density yield was measured after the planted maize was harvested to determine the crop parameters of the regional scale ceres maize model we estimated the lai of summer maize at different growth stages across the study area by constructing a model by using remote sensing data and the measured lai in 2021 56 sampling areas with a size of 10 m 10 m were established in the study area to monitor the regional scale growth of summer maize fig 2 we selected areas that were located away from roads and trees to prevent roads and trees from influencing the obtained satellite signals the central location of the sampling areas was determined using a global positioning system three independent sampling points with a size of 1 m 1 m were randomly selected in each sampling area and the value of each sampling index i e lai swc plant height and yield for each sampling area was the average of the values obtained for the three sampling points lai plant height and swc at a depth of 0 20 cm were measured at the v5 fifth leaf collar v7 seventh leaf collar v10 tenth leaf collar and r1 silking stages and yield was measured at maize maturity in addition data on planting date planting depth plant spacing row spacing irrigation time irrigation quantity irrigation method fertilizer application time fertilizer application rate and fertilizer application method were collected for each sampling area 2 2 2 remote sensing data to determine the distribution of summer maize we used sentinel 2 data with high spatial resolution the resolution for this data set is 10 m in the blue green red and near infrared bands and 20 m in the short wave infrared and red edge bands to calculate vegetation indices i e normalized difference vegetation index normalized difference water index and normalized difference built up index sentinel 2 provides data for all land surfaces and coastal areas for every 5 day period the measured spectral range extends from the visible spectrum to the short wave infrared region richter et al 2012 the sentinel 2 top of atmosphere data archived in the google earth engine have been radiometrically and geometrically corrected therefore we extracted the maize growing areas in the study area by using a random forest classifier pal 2005 and the vegetation indices calculated from sentinel 2 top of atmosphere data that were captured during the maize growing season in the summer of 2021 on the basis of the extracted summer maize growing areas we estimated the lai of maize by using backscatter information from sentinel 1 data the measurements of the microwave sensing system of sentinel 1 were marginally affected by solar radiation and this system has all weather working capability with a revisit period of 12 or 6 days thus sentinel 1 images are suitable for estimating the lai of maize in cloudy and rainy areas hosseini et al 2021 we used the sentinel 1 ground range detected grd product provided by google earth engine this product has been subject to preprocessing radiometrically calibration and topographical correction veci et al 2014 to reduce coherent speckle noise the lee method lee et al 1999 was used to filter the grd product backscatter intensities and incidence angles were extracted from the grd product for vertical transmit vertical receive polarization cross polarization and vertical transmit horizontal receive polarization like polarization 2 3 data assimilation based determination of the crop genetic coefficient of the ceres maize model data assimilation which was proposed by charney et al 1969 is a scientific method for integrating intermittent observations and models to reduce the uncertainty of experimental observation errors in model parameter determination we used this method to integrate intermittent satellite observations with the ceres maize crop model to obtain high precision crop model parameters many data assimilation methods are available curnel et al 2011 agyeman et al 2021 wu et al 2021 and the data assimilation method based on the minimization of the cost function is widely used curnel et al 2011 in this method data assimilation is achieved by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a crop model through an assimilation algorithm to minimize the difference between the estimated values obtained using remote sensing data and the simulated values obtained using the crop model therefore we estimated the regional lai through support vector regression svr modeling and then assimilated the estimated lai into the ceres maize crop model to obtain the regional scale crop model parameters 2 3 1 svr based estimation of the regional lai to estimate the lai of summer maize in the study area svr joachims 1998 was used to fit the relationships among backscatter intensity incident angle date of lai measurement and measured lai in 2021 we transformed date of lai measurement into the day of year format svr has been widely used to estimate the lai of maize mandal et al 2019 hosseini et al 2021 svr is a statistical machine learning method where variables are mapped to a high dimensional space to transform a low dimensional nonlinear problem into a high dimensional linear regression problem we derived the code of the svr algorithm from the libsvm online library https www csie ntu edu tw cjlin libsvm index html an svr model maps nonlinear data from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space by using kernel functions the gaussian radial basis function rbf kernel has strong approximation properties because of its few hyperparameters and high accuracy therefore the rbf kernel was selected as the kernel function for constructing an svr model in this study cost c and gamma Œ≥ are two key hyperparameters in the training of an svr model in this study the grid search method hsu et al 2003 and five fold cross validation were used to find the best combination of hyperparameters after the optimal hyperparameters were determined 224 field scale lai observations from 56 sampling areas and the corresponding remote sensing data were randomly divided into training and testing data sets the training data set contained 140 sets of remote sensing data and the corresponding field scale lai measured it was used to train the svr based lai model the testing data set contained 84 sets of remote sensing data and the corresponding field scale lais that were obtained through measurement the performance of the lai estimation model was evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse which were calculated as eqs 3 and 4 2 3 2 ceres maize model the ceres maize model jones and kiniry 1986 embedded in the dssat hoogenboom et al 2010 was used to simulate the temporal variation in the lai of maize in addition the ceres maize model can describe the daily growth and development of maize under temperature stress water stress and nitrogen fertilizer stress ritchie 1998 to calculate the daily soil water balance this model uses a one dimensional tipping bucket soil water balance method to predict soil water flow and root water uptake in up to 10 soil horizons ritchie 1985b to run the field scale ceres maize model meteorological data soil data cultivar coefficients and field management information must be input into it the minimum meteorological data required for this model include daily precipitation maximum daily air temperature minimum daily air temperature and daily solar radiation the aforementioned meteorological data for the wugong and yangling experimental stations were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and yangling meteorological station respectively we used the method of angstrom 1924 to calculate daily solar radiation from daily data on sunshine duration the basic soil data required for the ceres maize model were those on bulk weight organic carbon content clay content silt content field capacity wilting point saturated water content and soil ph all of which were obtained through laboratory measurements field management information was obtained from our experiments at the wugong and yangling stations six cultivar coefficients table 1 were obtained by calibrating the field scale ceres maize model the 2016 and 2020 field scale trial data lai swc and yield were used to calibrate this model and the 2017 and 2021 field scale trial data were used to validate the model the performance of the field scale ceres maize model was evaluated using determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse and average relative error are which were calculated as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o 2 s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 4 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 5 a r e 1 n i 1 n o i s i o i 100 where n is the number of observed values o i and s i are the observed and simulated values for the ith data pair respectively and and s are the observed average and simulated average respectively an r 2 value close to 1 and rmse and are values close to 0 indicate high agreement between the observed and simulated values crop model regionalization was achieved by running the crop model for each simulation unit of the study area therefore the input parameters of the crop model also had to be regionalized considering the study purpose and to minimize computational cost we used a grid of size 5 km 5 km to divide the study area into different simulation units we used ordinary kriging interpolation to estimate the meteorological station data for each grid as for soil data a study by han et al 2015 obtained gridded soil data with a resolution of 5 to ensure consistency between the resolution of the soil and meteorological data we generated gridded values of soil data at a scale of 5 5 km2 through inverse distance weighted interpolation we obtained field management information through field measurements and interviews with local farmers section 2 2 1 different cultivars of the same crop usually exhibit some similarity which indicates that the crop parameters calibrated for a field scale crop model can act as a reference for calibrating crop parameters for a regional scale crop model lu et al 2021b however sensitivity analysis had to be conducted in this study to determine which cultivar parameters had to be spatialized and which cultivar parameters could be obtained from a calibrated field scale crop model 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis because the ceres maize model contains many crop parameters and the irrigation and fertilization data for the sampling area were obtained through surveys a certain degree of uncertainty existed in the model to accurately obtain the crop parameters we conducted sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive and insensitive parameters insensitive parameters were identified using the relatively refined field scale experimental results and sensitive parameters were identified using the lai estimated from remote sensing data for the entire study area the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 was used to identify the sensitive parameters the efast is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition in this test the variance of the model simulation results is decomposed to obtain the sensitivity index of each parameter the higher the sensitivity index of a parameter the stronger is its influence on the model output 2 3 4 integration of the shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona sce ua for data assimilation the sensitive parameters of the ceres maize model were iteratively adjusted using assimilation algorithms to minimize the difference between the lai estimated from microwave remote sensing data and the lai simulated using the regional scale ceres maize model to quantify this difference the following cost function was constructed 6 j x 1 k q k 1 k q 1 q l a i k q s i m x l a i k q r s x l a i k q r s where j is the cost function x is a vector composed of the parameters to be calibrated l a i k q s i m is the lai simulated using the regional scale ceres maize model l a i k q r s is the lai estimated using remote sensing data q is the number of lai observations and k is the number of simulation units the parameter l a i k q r s represents the average lai of all maize pixels within each simulation unit to identify sensitive cultivar coefficients for maize we used the sce ua optimization algorithm duan et al 1993 to minimize the cost function presented in eq 6 this algorithm is a global optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of deterministic search stochastic search and competitive evolution and is insensitive to the initial values of optimization parameters huang et al 2019 if the optimized parameter values are within a predefined normalized geometric range 0 001 https www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 7671 shuffled complex evolution sce ua method and the decrease in the cost function does not exceed 0 01 after 10 iterations then the sce ua algorithm is considered to have converged 2 4 irrigation schedule optimization through the use of calibrated regional scale ceres maize model the inss for summer maize in subregions mz1 mz2 and mz3 were optimized for each typical rainfall year by using a multiobjective optimization algorithm 2 4 1 identification of typical rainfall years multiyear historical precipitation data for the crop growing season are essential for identifying typical rainfall years guo et al 2021 to determine the typical rainfall years at the regional scale we used the ordinary kriging interpolation method to generate daily rainfall data with a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km for the study area for 51 years from 1970 to 2020 we then obtained the daily average rainfall data for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions subsequently the daily rainfall data were used accumulated to determine the precipitation in 51 summer maize growing seasons in each subregion and these precipitation data were used to identify typical rainfall years through empirical frequency analysis we identified that 25 50 and 75 of the cumulative frequency curve of precipitation for each subregion represented wet normal and dry years respectively 2 4 2 irrigation schedule optimization model the multiobjective optimization of the inss was conducted by maximizing yield wue and pfpn which reflected the objectives of pursuing high crop yield saving water improving nue and reducing pollution irrigation frequency irrigation time irrigation quantity nitrogen application time and nitrogen application rate were used as decision variables in the adopted multiobjective optimization algorithm the yield wue and pfpn can be achieved using the regional scale ceres maize model 7 m a x

simulation units in subregion mz1 mz2 or mz3 and j is the irrigation frequency the units of wue and pfpn in eq 8 are kg m3 and kg kg respectively according to farmers in the study area the irrigation frequency was such that j 1 2 3 during the maize growing season a part of the nitrogen quantity used was applied as a base dose during sowing and the remaining quantity was distributed equally according to the irrigation frequency the parameters t 1 t j represent the irrigation dates w 1 w j represent the irrigation quantities f 1 f j denote the nitrogen application rates and f b is the base nitrogen dose during sowing when j 1 w 2 w 3 0 and f 2 f 3 0 moreover when j 2 w 3 0 and f 3 0 we solved the aforementioned multiobjective optimization problem by using nsga iii deb and jain 2013 which combines the principles of evolutionary optimization and multiobjective optimization this algorithm is useful for optimizing complex nonlinear objectives which makes it a powerful tool for multiobjective decision making nsga iii uses specific encoding to convert the decision variable data in the solution space into data with a genotype string structure in a genetic space and the converted data are analogous to chromosomes kumar 2013 to reduce coding redundancy the genes j a 1 a 2 a 3 w 1 w 2 w 3 Œ≤ and f t were used as constituents of the chromosomes fig 3 the meaning of each gene is presented in table 2 before calculating the objective function by using the ceres maize model the chromosome data had to be decoded into decision variables i e irrigation date irrigation quantity and nitrogen rate to avoid conflicts between previous and subsequent irrigation times eqs 9 11 were used for decoding to determine the irrigation date a diagram of irrigation dates is displayed in fig 4 9 t 1 p d a 1 l g p 10 t 2 t 1 a 2 l g p a 1 l g p 11 t 3 t 2 a 3 h d t 2 where p d is the planting date of summer maize l gp is duration of the growth period and h d is the harvest date the harvest date of summer maize in each subregion was set as october 1 the ration factors a 1 a 2 and a 3 reflect the duration of the irrigation interval and t 1 t 2 and t 3 denote the irrigation dates in addition given the level of local irrigation technology the irrigation quantity and nitrogen application rate were set as multiples of 5 and the irrigation time i e top dressing time was rounded off to the nearest whole number for the dssat platemo tian et al 2017 is a matlab platform mathworks natick ma usa that can be used to execute nsga iii we wrote a matlab program for the input and output of the dssat this program generates an experiment file mzx file in the standard format of the dssat and this file includes details on the irrigation date irrigation quantity nitrogen application date and nitrogen application rate the executable file named dscsm047 exe is used by the matlab program to obtain the yield wue and pfpn for an experiment thus the objective function of nsga iii can be simply and elegantly integrated into the dssat nsga iii is considered to have converged when the hypervolume is visually smooth emmerich et al 2005 kropp et al 2019 in addition to improve the computational efficiency the ins optimization process was run on an amd ryzen 7 1700 eight core processor with the support of a matlab parallel computing toolbox 2 4 3 determination of the optimal irrigation schedule nsga iii is a multiobjective optimization algorithm that obtains a pareto solution set by determining the best trade off between multiple conflicting objectives because the optimal solution in the solution set cannot maximize all the objectives simultaneously technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis was used to determine the optimal ins in this study the weights of each objective greatly affect the decision results of the topsis each objective can be assigned a weight by using subjective or objective weighting methods obtaining subjective preferences regarding the importance of the three objectives in this study i e maximizing yield wue and pfpn was difficult therefore the objective weighting method was used to determine the weights of these objectives researchers have developed many objective weighting methods including the entropy method rani et al 2019 principal component analysis pca peng et al 2020 the coefficient of variation cv method el santawy 2015 and the criteria importance though intercriteria correlation critic method diakoulaki et al 1995 in the entropy and cv methods the discreteness of solutions is used to describe the importance of each objective while ignoring the correlations between objectives in pca multiple correlated variables are converted into several integrated uncorrelated variables however pca does not reflect the discreteness of solutions some discreteness and correlation existed among the three objectives of this study by contrast in the critic method standard deviation and correlation coefficient are used to measure the discreteness and correlation between two objectives respectively 12 w u œÉ u v 1 v 1 r u v v 1 v œÉ u v 1 v 1 r u v where w u is the weights of the uth objective œÉ u is the standard deviation of the uth objective r uv is the correlation coefficient between the uth and vth objective and v 3 is the number of objectives after the weights of each objective were determined the topsis yoon and hwang 1995 was used to determine the optimal ins the basic idea of the topsis is to rank solutions by calculating their distance from the positive and negative ideal solutions the best solution is closest to the positive ideal solution and farthest from the negative ideal solution in the topsis the information of the original data can be fully used moreover the topsis can fully reflect the gap between solutions and has the advantages of being accurate reliable and universal by using the topsis we normalized the pareto solution sets of yield wue and pfpn to eliminate their dimensional differences the normalized objectives were then multiplied by their respective weights to construct a weighted objective matrix z the matrix z is a m v matrix where m is the number of pareto solutions and v is the number of objectives the positive ideal solution z best and negative ideal solution z worst were determined according to z these solutions were row vectors that reflected the optimal and worst values respectively of yield wue and pfpn the relative closeness rc i was calculated according to the euclidean distance of the pareto solution from the positive and negative ideal solutions 13 d m v 1 v z m v z v b e s t 2 d m v 1 v z m v z v w o r s t 2 14 r c m d m d m d m where z v b e s t and z v w o r s t are the positive and negative ideal solutions of the vth objective respectively d m is the euclidean distance between the mth pareto solution and the positive ideal solution d m is the euclidean distance between the mth pareto solution and the negative ideal solution m 1 m and rc m represents the relative closeness of the mth pareto solution the closer rc m is to 1 the closer is the corresponding pareto solution to the positive ideal solution and the farther is this solution from the negative ideal solution moreover pareto solutions can be ranked according to their rc m values to determine the optimal solution 3 results 3 1 estimation of the regional lai lai and plant height can indicate maize growth jin et al 2016 fig 5 displays the statistical characteristics of the lai and plant height of summer maize in different growth stages in the study area from the v5 stage to the r1 stage plant height fig 5 a and lai fig 5 b which are represented by the medians of the box plots in fig 5 gradually increased the r1 stage was the turning point from vegetative growth to reproductive growth for summer maize fang et al 2021 with the peak plant height and lai occurring in this stage in the aforementioned stage approximately 75 of the summer maize plants had a height exceeding 2 6 m and approximately 75 of the summer maize plants had an lai higher than 4 8 on the basis of the measured lai of summer maize for 56 sampling areas an svr model was developed using backscatter intensity incidence angle and date when the lai was measured to estimate the lai of summer maize fig 6 illustrates the prediction performance of the aforementioned model on the training and testing sets for the training set fig 6 a the lai predicted by the developed lai prediction model closely matched the measured lai with r 2 0 93 and rmse 0 49 for the test set fig 6 b the r 2 and rmse were 0 89 and 0 59 respectively the measured and predicted lai values were close to the 1 1 line the developed lai estimation model could predict the lai with acceptable accuracy therefore we used this model to estimate the lai at the regional scale fig 7 as displayed in fig 7 the lai of each subregion mz1 mz2 and mz3 gradually increased with the progress of summer maize growth in the v5 stage the differences in the lai values of mz1 and mz2 were not obvious and the lai of these subregions was mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 1 the lai of mz3 was higher than that of the other two subregions and was mainly concentrated between 0 6 and 1 59 in the v7 and v10 stages the lai of maize exhibited obvious differences among the subregions in the r1 stage the lai of mz1 mz2 and mz3 reached the maximum value and the lai of mz3 was marginally smaller than that of the other two subregions 3 2 performance evaluation of the field and regional scale ceres maize models on the basis of the results of sensitivity analysis the p2 p5 and sowing date jin et al 2016 wang et al 2021 which had the highest sensitivity index values were re estimated during data assimilation and the other parameters including p1 g2 g3 and phint were derived from the calibrated field scale ceres maize model to obtain the parameters of the field scale ceres maize model table 3 this model was calibrated using field data for 2016 and 2020 fig 8 and then validated using field data for 2017 and 2021 fig 8 during the calibration stage the lai fig 8 a and yield fig 8 b simulated using the calibrated field scale ceres maize model matched well with the measured lai and yield respectively the corresponding r2 and rmse for lai were 0 97 and 0 21 m2 m2 and for yield they were 0 95 and 178 80 kg ha respectively during the validation stage fig 8 b the field scale crop model also performed well in simulating lai and yield the corresponding r2 and rmse for lai were 0 94 and 0 29 m2 m2 and for yield they were 0 94 and 316 03 kg ha respectively subsequently the efast was used to identify sensitive parameters sowing date p2 and p5 that affect daily lai three sensitive parameters were re estimated for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions and the entire region by using data assimilation methods table 3 differences in cultivar coefficients and sowing dates were found between the regional and field scales and among subregion mz1 subregion mz2 subregion mz3 and the entire study area the aforementioned parameters in table 3 were used to simulate lai plant height swc depth of 0 20 cm and yield for the 56 sampling areas fig 9 as displayed in fig 9 the simulation performance of the regional scale ceres maize model was better than that of the field scale ceres maize model in terms of the r 2 rmse and mre of the growth indicators of summer maize lai plant height swc and yield in addition the simulation performance of the regional scale ceres maize model was better when the study area was divided into three subregions than when the study area was not divided into subregions the r2 values for lai plant height swc and yield increased by 0 02 0 04 0 10 and 0 15 respectively while the rmse values decreased by 0 36 m2 m2 0 04 m 0 01 cm3 cm3 and 203 33 kg ha and the mre values decreased by 33 12 2 67 5 23 and 1 67 respectively in summary the regional scale crop model in which the crop parameters and sowing date are determined through the data assimilation method better reflected the growth characteristics of summer maize at the regional scale when the study area was divided into three subregions than when the area was not divided into subregions therefore we used the regional scale ceres maize model to determine the optimal ins for each subregion 3 3 irrigation schedule optimization before using the regional scale ceres maize model to establish an ins for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions typical rainfall years dry normal and wet years were identified according to the rainfall during the summer maize growing season in each subregion table 4 presents the average air temperature and total rainfall during the summer maize growing season for each typical rainfall year in each subregion fig 10 depicts the maximum daily air temperature minimum daily air temperature and daily rainfall for each typical rainfall year in each subregion the method described in section 2 4 2 was used for the multiobjective optimization of the ins for each subregion in three typical precipitation years and pareto solution sets for maximizing yield wue and pfpn were obtained fig 11 wue increased with yield up to a certain point before decreasing the objective of maximizing pfpn conflicted with the objectives of maximizing wue and yield therefore the weights of yield wue and pfpn for different subregions in three typical rainfall years were determined separately by using the critic method we found that the differences in weights were small in each case to reflect the overall relevance of and conflict among the three objectives in different typical rainfall years in different subregions we integrated the pareto solution sets in nine cases to determine the weights the final determined weights for yield wue and pfpn were 0 41 0 28 and 0 31 respectively after the weights were determined the optimal solutions for different subregions in a dry year normal year and wet year were determined using the topsis black triangles in fig 11 the corresponding optimal inss are presented in table 5 for comparison the current inss used by farmers are also included in table 5 as presented in table 5 compared with the current inss used by farmers the optimized inss were associated with marginally higher irrigation quantities average increase of 2 66 but considerably lower nitrogen application rates average decrease of 31 6 except for the dry year in mz1 and the dry and normal years in mz2 the optimized inss were associated with more frequent irrigation than were the currently used inss in the currently used inss nitrogen is applied during the maize jointing stage whereas in the optimized inss nitrogen is applied during irrigation which increases the frequency of nitrogen application reduces the nitrogen application rate in each instance of nitrogen application and reduces the total nitrogen application rate the average ratio of base fertilizer to top dressing corresponding to the currently used inss was 2 3 and the ratio of base fertilizer to top dressing corresponding to the optimized inss varied in different subregions and typical rainfall years fig 12 depicts the yield wue and pfpn of summer maize under the optimal ins in each subregion in different typical rainfall years the maize yield was lower in mz2 than in mz1 and mz3 in different typical rainfall years because of the higher rainfall higher number of cloudy days and lower temperature in mz2 table 4 fig 10 therefore the wue for mz2 was lower than that for mz1 and mz3 in the wet year the pfpn for mz1 was generally lower than that for mz2 and mz3 because of the sandy soils in mz1 which exhibited low effectiveness in retaining fertilizer in general yield and wue were high in most cases and pfpn was higher than 45 kg kg in most cases for the dry normal and wet years the average yields in the study area were 9429 9465 and 10218 kg ha respectively the average wues were 2 48 2 53 and 2 31 kg m3 respectively and the average pfpns were 54 46 55 23 and 58 49 kg kg respectively fig 13 depicts the percentage changes in yield wue and pfpn between the optimum and currently used inss yield and wue increased in the majority of the areas with the average increases in yield being 12 51 6 35 and 8 93 during the dry normal and wet years respectively and the average increases in wue being 10 41 2 64 and 5 58 during the dry normal and wet years respectively in particular yield and wue increased more in mz1 than in the other subregions in the dry year pfpn increased in all cases with the average increase being 66 17 62 35 and 61 81 for the dry normal and wet years respectively the mz2 subregion exhibited the highest overall increase in pfpn the mz1 subregion exhibited the highest increase in pfpn in the dry year and some areas in the mz3 subregion exhibited the highest increase in pfpn in the normal and wet years certain areas exhibited increases in pfpn but decreases in yield and wue the percentages of the study area that exhibited a decrease of more than 3 in yield were 13 89 8 53 and 2 80 in the dry normal and wet years respectively moreover the percentages of the study area that exhibited a decrease of more than 3 in wue were 9 39 6 53 and 3 41 for the dry normal and wet years respectively in the dry normal and wet years the maximum yield reduction rates were 14 12 11 31 and 11 47 respectively and the maximum reduction rates of wue were 13 11 6 35 and 8 86 respectively in general the optimized inss increased yield wue and pfpn 4 discussion 4 1 increase in the regional simulation accuracy of the regional scale ceres maize model when using remotely sensed lai the calibrated field scale ceres maize model performed well in simulating field scale yield and lai fig 8 because this model is developed for fields with a single maize cultivar and homogeneous maize growing environment jones and kiniry 1986 the ceres maize model can reproduce maize growth as long as the user can accurately input soil data meteorological data field management data and cultivar coefficients into the model amouzou et al 2018 malik et al 2019 the regional scale ceres maize model calibrated using remotely sensed lai performed much better in the simulation of regional scale maize growth than did the field scale ceres maize model calibrated using field trial data fig 9 this result was obtained because the spatial variability in the soil and meteorological conditions in each sampling area considerably decreased when the study area was divided into multiple simulation units guo et al 2021 and shelia et al 2019 have demonstrated that decreases in the spatial variability of soil and meteorological conditions cause an increase in the regional simulation accuracy of a crop model when the study area was not divided into three subregions the regional scale crop model could not simulate the regional crop growth well this result indicates that a single set of crop parameters cannot accurately represent a large area therefore large study regions must be divided into different subregions and crop parameters must be determined for each subregion therond et al 2011 conducted a study using crop models to simulate the growth of maize and wheat in 12 regions of the european union which also confirmed the necessity of this approach consequently we re estimated the satisfactory maize cultivar coefficients and sowing dates for the mz1 mz2 and mz3 subregions by using the lai estimated from microwave remote sensing data table 3 ndvi and soil characteristics should be considered when dividing a large region into subregions because these parameters reflect the combined effect of the crop growth environment and cultivar guo et al 2018 further exploration is required on how large areas can be reasonably subdivided when simulating regional crop growth 4 2 irrigation schedule optimization compared with the current inss used by farmers in the study area the optimized inss were associated with a marginally higher irrigation quantity average increase of 2 66 but considerably lower nitrogen application rate average decrease of 31 6 when the optimized inss were used yield and wue increased in the majority of areas and pfpn increased in all areas these results indicate that the optimized schedules are effective and increase yield wue and pfpn in this study the nitrogen application rate was 150 210 kg ha yang et al 2017 compared the effects of different nitrogen rates on summer maize yield nue nitrogen leaching and nitrogen residue through field trials and recommended a nitrogen application rate of 180 200 kg ha this is because the nitrogen application rates derived using a regional scale crop model can account for the crop yield wue and nue at a regional scale whereas the nitrogen application rates derived through field trials can only reflect the situation at a point scale and for a limited number of years thus we believed that the optimized inss were reasonable the optimized inss resulted in an increase in pfpn but decreases in yield and wue in some areas fig 11 which might be attributed to a combination of soil and climatic conditions additional detailed studies are required to improve yield and wue in these locations the results of this study suggest that regional scale crop models can adequately characterize regional soil meteorological and crop cultivar differences to reflect the effects of irrigation and fertilization on crop yield thus these models can be used to develop optimized inss that are suitable for the regional scale the irrigation quantity was marginally higher in the optimized inss than in the presently used inss because we reduced the nitrogen application rate to reduce environmental pollution this step was not performed when developing the presently used inss compared with the currently used inss the optimized inss exhibited marginally higher irrigation quantities considerably lower nitrogen application rates and higher yields and wues thus the optimized schedules are reasonable the objectives of saving water and fertilizer and increasing yield can be achieved by changing their weights in the currently used inss nitrogen is applied only once after sowing and in the optimized inss nitrogen is applied during irrigation which increases irrigation frequency reduces the nitrogen application rate during each instance of nitrogen application reduces total nitrogen application rate and thus increases pfpn the aforementioned results are obtained because split nitrogen application can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching and increase nitrogen uptake by crops mueller et al 2017 the current practice of applying nitrogen only during the sowing and jointing stages of maize growth can cause nitrate nitrogen to move downward in the soil because of rainfall and irrigation thus the nitrogen fertilizer needs of maize cannot be met during the later stages of growth and soil contamination occurs zhao et al 2006 lu et al 2021a overall the constructed regional scale crop models can characterize regional soil meteorological and crop cultivar differences to reflect the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on crop yield it should be pointed out that when formulating inss at the regional scale we have taken special consideration of the spatial representativeness of crop parameters which has been rare in previous studies therefore regional scale crop models can be used to develop inss that are suitable for the regional scale 5 conclusions we developed a framework for optimizing regional inss that consists of the ceres maize model microwave remote sensing data and a multiobjective optimization algorithm this framework can be used to optimize the ins for crops grown over a large area the conclusions of this study are as follows first microwave backscatter intensity microwave incidence angle and date of lai measurement can be input into an svr model to obtain accurate predictions of the lai of summer maize microwave remote sensing data are less affected by cloud and rain than are optical remote sensing data thus microwave remote sensing data can be feasibly used to estimate lai in areas with high cloud cover and rainfall second the estimated regional lai was input into an assimilation algorithm to determine the key cultivar coefficients of the ceres maize model the crop model parameters determined using remote sensing data enabled more accurate simulations of lai plant height swc and yield at the regional scale than did the crop model parameters determined using field scale experiments third the regional scale ceres maize model was coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the inss for summer maize in different typical rainfall years in different subregions compared with the inss currently used by farmers the optimized inss were associated with an average increase of 2 66 in the irrigation quantity an average decrease of 31 6 in the nitrogen application rate and increases of 6 35 12 51 2 64 10 41 and 61 8 66 2 in the yield wue and pfpn respectively depending on the typical rainfall year the aforementioned results indicate that the optimized inss increased maize yield wue and pfpn this phenomenon occurred mainly because the developed regional scale ceres maize model fully accounts for the spatial variability in meteorological and soil parameters and the spatial representativeness of crop parameters in the study area optimized inss established using regional scale crop model parameters and remote sensing data can provide guidance to irrigation management departments based on the irrigation amounts identified in this paper the government can encourage farmers to reduce nitrogen application and adopt a split nitrogen application approach to provide nitrogen nutrition to maize however this study did not directly address the costs associated with irrigation nitrogen application crop yield and environmental impacts

8867,the plant water relationship of maize under conservation practices needs to be assessed to quantify the effectiveness of the practices in conserving soil water for crop production this study evaluated in three trials how straw and plastic film mulching and organic manure application could potentially change water fluxes in the root zone and increase maize yield a mathematical model hydrus

performance rmse of 0 6 2 3 cd of 0 37 1 41 nse of 0 18 0 88 and r2 of 0 62 0 91 during both the calibration and validation periods the model predicted the observed drainage in a lysimeter with only a 5 5 11 7 bias and actual evapotranspiration etc with a 2 6 6 7 bias for the control conditions in all three trials when the model was provided with measured plant growth soil properties and weather data both measurement and modeling confirmed that mulching augmented soil water storage by reducing etc i e 0 24 0 37 mm d 1 by straw mulching and 0 05 0 24 mm d 1 by plastic mulching during the trials manure application did not affect the etc rate and resulted in the highest grain yield 6 8 8 3 mg ha 1 followed by plastic mulching 6 1 8 1 mg ha 1 and straw mulching 5 3 7 5 mg ha 1 manure application increased the harvest index by optimally allocating biomass because of a steady supply of water and nutrients the straw mulch plastic mulch and manure treatments increased grain yield by 13 24 and 35 respectively compared to the control condition large scale implementation of these practices would lessen blue water scarcity in agriculture keywords maize yield soil water content evapotranspiration drainage soil water simulation rainfed maize data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize production in bangladesh and many other asian countries is increasing because of its increasing demand for the burgeoning food and feed industries knoema 2018 it can supply food feed and fuel in relatively large quantities compared with other cereal crops

rice in this region hoque and hossain 2018 bbs bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 mahmud et al 2021 maize cultivation is also becoming popular because of its lower water footprint the volume of

should be stabilized and enhanced there is a worldwide effort to curb the unsustainable use of blue water resources to protect the environmental and ecological balance huhmann et al 2017 higher yields in rainfed conditions would reduce the need for blue water use in agriculture rockstr√∂m and barron 2007 water conservation practices in rainfed agriculture such as mulching and organic matter incorporation can increase yield by the effective use of rainfall green water hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 conservation practices can have multifaceted effects on the plant water relationship such as crop water uptake patterns so an assessment of these practices will improve agricultural water management decisions nouri et al 2019 in the region maize is a dry winter crop sown after the monsoon season or during january february in coastal and young deltaic areas maize is usually grown as a rainfed crop because of the unavailability of fresh water in addition the suitable soil and climate in some regions allow rainfed maize production with a reasonable yield supplying the crop water demand from soil water storage often becomes critical because the residual soil water content depletes steadily after the sowing of maize and the rain rarely falls until mid april ali et al 2009 maize plants that have suffered from water stress at the vegetative stage cannot produce optimum yields so maintaining soil water availability is very important rong et al 2013 conservation techniques can increase effective rainfall and augment soil water availability by increasing the infiltration opportunity time and water holding capacity of the soil and reducing soil evaporation loss quintanilla tornel et al 2016 yin et al 2018 conservation practices such as mulching or animal manure application as a source of organic matter can help plants use the residual soil water content effectively and ease the water stress condition in maize cultivation jjagwe et al 2020 kumar and bhopl 2017 mulching provides many benefits to the soil by reducing evaporation improving temperature adjusting the microbial biomass maintaining the soil organic carbon balance increasing nutrient cycling promoting soil enzyme activity enhancing soil aggregate stability and suppressing weed infestations rong et al 2013 wang et al 2019 organic mulch may also increase rainwater infiltration which augments soil water storage at various depths deper et al 2014 in addition it provides organic matter and nutrients to the soil when it decomposes chakraborty et al 2010 however mulching can increase nutrient leaching and affect pest infestation gill et al 2011 quintanilla tornel et al 2016 yin et al 2018 suggested that high soil temperature with plastic film mulching can cause premature ripening by enhancing root respiration and root activity most of the soils in bangladesh are low 1 5 in organic matter frg 2018 but soils rich in organic matter can hold more water amin et al 2014a organic matter also supplies crop available nutrients through mineralization and improves soil physicochemical and biological properties rahman 2014 therefore it was hypothesized that mulching and animal manure application enhance soil water storage and maize yield by altering root water uptake and evaporation from the soil we need to assess and quantify the effects of mulching and manure application on the plant water relationship for the large scale implementation of these practices therefore this study was conducted with the following specific objectives i to quantify the water fluxes in a rainfed maize field and ii to assess the effects of straw and plastic mulching and manure amendments on the yield of maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was carried out

rainfall www bmd gov bd the major crops grown in the study area are rice maize mustard wheat and vegetables in the wet season crops can grow as rainfed but dry season crops usually need irrigation alternate wetting and drying irrigation or 1 5 cm ponding water irrigation is applied in rice fields whereas other crops receive flooding or furrow irrigation at 2 4 week intervals depending on the weather groundwater is the main source of irrigation water in this area the groundwater level in an on site observation well installed in the shallow aquifer fluctuated between 5 6 and 6 2 m from the ground surface during the experiment 2 2 experimental design the first trial of the experiment was conducted from 18 february to 6 june 2018 2018 trial and then it was repeated from 7 february to 26 may 2019 2019a trial and 26 february to 15 june 2019 2019b trial the experiment was repeated with two different sowing dates in 2019 to estimate the variability of the results and to increase the accuracy of the estimate under different weather conditions the experimental designs in all three trials were identical the soil water conservation treatments in the study were as follows i mulch and manure were not applied to simulate usual farmers practices control treatment ii rice straw was applied at a rate of 6 0 mg ha 1 straw mulch treatment iii black plastic film was rolled over the soil plastic mulch treatment and iv cow manure stored in an open pit of a local dairy farm was applied to the land surface during final land preparation at a rate of 60 mg ha 1 before the sowing of maize manure treatment the manure had 30 8 dry matter 4 0 0 6 kg n mg 1 5 0 16 kg p mg and 2 3 0 19 kg k mg the manure was immediately incorporated into the top 15 cm of soil mulching was not applied to the manure applied plots the estimated crop available nitrogen 240 kg ha 1 for all these treatments was the same the rice straw used in the straw mulch treatment was not fully decomposed during the study period a required number of holes were made in the plastic mulch to sow the seeds these holes also facilitated the infiltration of rainwater a 15 cm field ridge surrounded each plot to stop runoff generation and thereby enhance infiltration and groundwater recharge potential as a part of the water conservation effort the field plots were 4 m 4 m a randomized complete block design with three replications of each treatment was adopted in each trial 2 3 agronomic operations weeds crop residues and stubbles were removed from the experimental plots and the lands were prepared to simulate local tillage conditions hybrid maize variety kaveri 3696 seeds were sown at 5 cm below the soil surface maintaining a 60 cm line to line and 20 cm plant to plant distance two seeds were placed in each position after the germination of seeds some seedlings under the straw mulch treatment were affected by insect infestation however we managed to have at least one healthy plant in each position excess seedlings were thinned out the plots were fertilized with phosphorus 110 kg ha 1 potash 240 kg ha 1 sulfur 15 kg ha 1 and zinc 5 kg ha 1 only once before sowing nitrogen 3 80 kg ha 1 was applied three times one basal application prior to sowing and two side dressings at 35 and 60 days after sowing das manual weeding and plant protection measures were carried out whenever needed no irrigation was applied 2 4 sampling and data collection 2 4 1 soil water and weather data the soil water content at 5 15 and 30 cm depths of each plot was measured at 10 to 15 day intervals during the growing periods using the gravimetric method placing the samples at 105 c in an oven for 24 h in the first trial soil water contents at a 10 cm interval of 1 m depth in the lysimeter were measured by an automatic device called sentek diviner 2000 this device measures volumetric soil water content by responding to changes in the dielectric constant of the soil haberland et al 2015 the diviner was calibrated against the observed gravimetric soil water content soil was sampled using a core sampler after a heavy rain event to measure the saturated soil water content and bulk density drainage below the root zone of three major rain events was measured using field lysimeters during the experimental period the groundwater level in an on site observation well was monitored at 15 day intervals using a water level recorder rainfall maximum and minimum temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity data were recorded at a weather station adjacent to the field plot 2 4 2 agronomic data the full matured maize plants of the 2018 2019a and 2019b trials were harvested on 6 june 2018 26 may 2019 and 15 june 2019 respectively the cobs of the harvested plants were air dried and shelled manually the 1000 grain weight and grain yield were recorded the total biomass including the plant cover and woody parts of the maize for each plot was weighed the harvest index was calculated by dividing the grain yield by the shoot dry matter grain and biomass which is a measure of reproductive efficiency 2 5 water flux estimation 2 5 1 soil water balance method the following soil water balance equation was used to estimate actual evapotranspiration etc 1 etc rainfall Œ¥sws gwc runoff drainage where Œ¥sws represents the soil water storage change in the root zone and gwc represents the groundwater contribution to the root zone soil this soil water balance method was applied during 0 40 das in the 2018 trial 0 70 das in the 2019 a trial and 20 70 das in the 2019 b trial to estimate the variation in etc under different mulching and manure applications we did not apply the water balance equation after 70 das to avoid uncertainties in estimating the water drainage loss of heavy rainfall events in addition in the later parts of the growing periods the effects of mulching and manure application on the soil water balance were insignificant because of these heavy rainfall events and the fully grown plant canopy to corroborate the measurements and to determine the data for the whole season a mathematical model as described in the following section calculated all the water fluxes and water balance components for the whole season such as seasonal total etc drainage losses and capillary rise of groundwater to the root zone in the field conditions 2 5 2 selection of a simulation model a widely used soil water transport model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2013 amin et al 2014b hou et al 2017 chen et al 2018a zhou and zhao 2019 was used to simulate the soil water dynamics and to estimate the water balance components of the experiments under the control conditions a detailed description of the model is given in the hydrus 1d manual ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2013 the model simulates water movement based on the standard richards equation for unsaturated Ô¨Çow eq 2 2 Œ∏ t x k h x cos Œ± s where h is the water pressure head l Œ∏ the volumetric water content l3 l 3 t the time t x the spatial coordinate l Œ± the angle between the flow direction and vertical axis and s is the sink term in the flow equation l3 l 3 t 1 which is the volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit time due to plant water uptake and k the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function lt 1 given by 3 k h x k s x k r h x where k r is the relative hydraulic conductivity and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 2 5 3 model setup and calibration the hydrus 1d model was calibrated against the soil water content of 90 data points drainage and etc rate observed in the first trial meteorological conditions were provided as the upper boundary of the model the boundary condition requires daily data of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine and wind speed mulching can partly influence the upper boundary condition but we could not incorporate such influences in the simulation because there is no built in option in the hydrus 1d model for simulating mulching effects free drainage was selected as the lower boundary condition of the lysimeter experiment fig 1a the observed water content prior to sowing was incorporated into the model as the initial condition the van genuchten mualem hydraulic model was chosen the water stress response function suggested by the following s shaped function eq 4 was used to reduce the potential root water uptake to actual root water uptake 4 Œ± h h 1 1 h h h 50 p where Œ± is the water stress response function h and h œï represent the pressure and osmotic head respectively p is an exponent and h 50 represents the pressure head at which the water extraction rate is reduced by 50 during conditions of negligible osmotic stress to estimate root water uptake the built in s shape model was used with the observed average plant growth data including the leaf area index ten observation nodes were assigned in the simulation domain so that we could compare the simulated data with the observed data for a specific location to simulate water transport through the soil using hydrus 1d the parameters of the soil water retention curves are the primary parameters to be calibrated these parameters can be obtained by using any of the three methods i the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 if soil textural and bulk density data are available ii the inverse solution technique based on the observed soil water content data and iii manual calibration of the parameters to get a desired level of agreement between observed and predicted soil water content data in this current study we tried all three calibration options and they gave similar modeling efficiency the soil hydraulic properties and the parameters of the soil water retention curves determined using the rosetta pedotransfer function based on the observed data on the percentage of sand silt and clay and bulk density were finally used in this study table 1 the penman monteith equation was chosen to calculate et0 actual geographical and meteorological parameters of the location latitude of 24 7 n altitude of 19 m measurement heights of meteorological parameters of 2 m radiation extinction of 0 53 albedo of 0 23 were incorporated into the model the cloudiness was measured from the sunshine hour data between the built in feddes and s shape root water uptake models the latter gave higher accuracy against the observed data in this study the h50 parameter of the s shape model was 800 cm with a p exponent of 3 2 5 4 model validation this calibrated model was validated against the soil water contents of 12 data points and the etc rate measured during the 2nd and 3rd trials so that the model predicted soil water balance components especially for the unmeasured period and space could be used confidently for the field experiments water transport in the vadose zone from the bottom of the root zone to the top of the groundwater zone was also simulated fig 1b so the saturated water content was incorporated as the lower boundary condition in the model the rosetta pedotransfer function predicted the soil hydraulic properties of the vadose zone below 1 m depth to the saturation zone based on the percentage of sand silt and clay in soil samples collected from different depths of the vadose zone during test drilling prior to the experiment table 1 the parameters found for the root zone soil and vadose zone were slightly different 2 5 5 model output the hydrus 1d model estimated the soil water content at the predefined depths observation nodes soil water storage in the root zone actual root water uptake evaporation groundwater contribution and drainage below the root zone the sum of actual root water uptake and evaporation gave the etc value the seasonal total etc was calculated from the etc values measured using the soil water balance method and the model estimated etc values during the unmeasured period 2 5 6 model performance assessment model performance was evaluated by the root mean square error rmse coefficient of model determination cd and nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse values moriasi et al 2007

the coefficient of determination r2 was also calculated to indicate the precision of the model 2 6 statistical analysis the widely used statistical analysis software sas 9 4 sas institute inc 2017 was used to perform an analysis of variance anova to evaluate differences between means of yield 1000 grain weight grain yield and biomass yield yield attributes cob plant 1 cob length cob perimeter grain cob 1 and column cob 1 and etc using a multiple linear model trials and treatments were considered as factors fixed effects of treatment and trial and the interaction of trial and treatment levels were analyzed duncan s multiple range test dmrt was conducted using the agricolae library de mendiburu 2009 in r 4 0 2 software r core team 2020 to separate the means a significance level of 5 was used for statistical decision making throughout the study 3 results 3 1 water fluxes 3 1 1 model performance the hydrus 1d model accurately simulated the observed soil water contents at various depths of the lysimeter as shown by the good agreement between the observed and simulated soil water contents fig 2 the results suggest that the model was parameterized accurately during the calibration the model performance indicators were also satisfactory table 2 the low values of rmse 0 6 2 3 and cd values close to one 0 37 1 41 indicate satisfactory accuracy of the model gonz√°lez et al 2015 also found low rmse values 1 4 2 5 the nse values 0 18 0 88 and r2 0 62 0 91 were close to one which also indicates that the model performed well moriasi et al 2007 in the validation period the predicted soil water contents in the root zone matched well with the observed values for the control condition fig 3b and c the performance of the model was also satisfactory with an rmse of 2 57 cd of 0 83 and r2 of 0 78 in 2019a and rmse of 2 53 cd of 0 53 and r2 of 0 71 in 2019b the model predicted the observed etc values for the control condition with only a 3 9 bias in the 2019a trial and a 2 6 bias in the 2019b trial table 3 as the model accurately predicted the soil water content and etc values for the control condition the model predicted water fluxes were considered representative and appropriate for the control condition 3 1 2 soil water dynamics the calibrated model satisfactorily predicted the changes in soil water content during the experimental periods especially under the control condition in all three trials fig 3 the model underpredicted the soil water content observed under the mulching and manure application treatments mulching increased the soil water content by up to 3 2 in some events by reducing soil evaporation on the other hand manure application increased the soil water storage by reducing the bulk density and increasing the water holding capacity of the manure borne organic matter mulching did not affect the soil hydraulic properties but manure application reduced the soil bulk density from 1 33 to 1 25 g cm 3 and increased the saturated volumetric soil water content by 2 7 5 in the top 15 cm soil layer since the model simulated the soil water dynamics with good accuracy it should predict the other water balance components evapotranspiration and drainage reasonably well 3 1 3 drainage loss the drainage loss measured at the outlet of the lysimeters in the three rainfall events of the 2018 trial matched well with the model predicted values with only 5 5 11 7 bias fig 4 the amount of drainage below the root zone 1 1 m depth was significantly affected by the rainfall amount approximately 40 43 of infiltrated rainwater drained out in 2018 and 2019b when the total rainfall was 690 692 mm but only 14 of water drained out when the total rainfall was 449 mm in 2019a major drainage occurred mainly during the last 30 40 days of the growing seasons due to some heavy rain events fig 4 zhou and zhao 2019 estimated that percolation amounted to approximately 32 3 and 42 9 of the total water input the drainage rate significantly varies with soil texture frequency and intensity of rainfall and irrigation and evapotranspiration demand the drainage in this silt loam soil was relatively higher 3 1 4 evapotranspiration the etc values estimated using the soil water balance method under the control condition matched well with the model predicted values with only 6 7 bias in 2018 3 9 in 2019a and 2 6 in 2019b table 3 the etc values under the mulched treatments were lower than the simulated values because the built in boundary conditions of the hydrus 1d model chosen in this simulation do not intrinsically simulate the mulching effects on etc the straw and plastic mulch reduced etc on average by 0 24 0 37 mm d 1 and 0 05 0 24 mm d 1 respectively during the three trials compared with the control condition in contrast manure application did not have any sturdy effect on the etc rate the manure applied plots had a slightly lower etc 0 17 mm d 1 in 2018 but had a marginally higher etc i e 0 05 mm d 1 in 2019a and 0 01 mm d 1 in 2019b compared with the control treatment the model simulated total seasonal etc ranged 363 403 mm for the three trials table 4 the seasonal average daily etc rates were 3 30 3 66 mm d 1 during the three trials the seasonal average etc value of different seasons did not vary considerably because of similar soil water plant atmosphere conditions and relationships however there were significantly different etc rates at different growth stages in a season fig 4 the evapotranspiration rate gradually increased after the plant s establishment and reached its peak after two months the 2019a trial had a slightly lower ratio of etc and et0 potential evapotranspiration values 0 66 1 10 mean 0 87 than the 2018 trial 0 55 1 23 mean 0 92 and the 2019b trial 0 48 1 28 mean 0 92 although the plants experienced water stress conditions for several days the ratio of etc and et0 values agreed with the reported kc values equal to the ratio of etc and et0 at a no stress condition of different growth stages of maize in previous studies such as 0 53 1 21 in iran by abedinpour 2015 0 3 1 2 by fao 2021 and 0 2 1 2 trout and dejonge 2018 these results suggest that the model predicted et0 and etc values closely matched the experimental data transpiration considering equal to root water uptake t to etc ratio t etc during the maize growing seasons as estimated by the hydrus 1d model is shown in fig 5 the model predicted t etc over the maize growing seasons shows that the ratio ranged from approx 0 2 in the early vegetative stage 0 30 das to approx 0 8 in the flowering and grain filling stages 60 90 das the results suggest that the evaporation loss from the soil during 0 50 das was considerable 25 80 of total etc which indicates that there was potential to reduce this evaporation loss therefore both straw and plastic mulching reduced etc by reducing the evaporation from the soil especially in the early periods table 3 3 1 5 soil heat fluxes straw mulching decreased the daily maximum soil temperature consistently in all trials table 5 in contrast the plastic mulch treatment increased the daily maximum soil temperature the temperature of the manure treated soil showed a varying response compared with the control treatment table 5 in 2018 and 2019a the manure treated soil had an overall lower maximum soil temperature than the control treatment in contrast the manure treatment in 2019b had a higher temperature than the control treatment table 5 3 2 yield and yield components both mulching and manure application produced taller plants in most of the cases compared with the control treatment supplemental fig s1 in 2019a and 2019b the plastic mulch treatment outperformed the other treatments in producing taller plants plants in 2018 were generally shorter than those in 2019a and 2019b fig s1 straw mulching produced significantly higher grain cob 1 in 2019a than in the control treatment supplemental table s1 plastic mulching resulted in higher grain cob 1 in all trials column cob 1 in 2018 and cob length in 2019b than the control treatment manure application significantly increased column cob 1 and grain cob 1 in 2018 cob length and grain cob 1 in 2019a and grain cob 1 in 2019b table s1 these results were attributed to the increased vegetative growth of maize because of higher soil water availability and consequently higher nutrient uptake by plants under the mulch and manure treatments the manure and plastic mulch treatments increased grain yield in all trials compared with the control treatment whereas the straw mulch treatment had a higher grain yield in 2019a and 2019b table 6 in 2018 the effect of straw mulching on grain yield was not significant but plastic mulching increased grain yield by 23 manure application increased grain yield by 47 26 and 13 in 2018 2019a and 2019b respectively table 6 the straw mulch and manure treatments increased the 1000 grain weight in 2018 and plastic mulching gave a higher value in 2019a than the control treatment the straw and plastic mulch treatments significantly increased biomass yield only in 2019a table 6 manure application increased biomass yield by 14 and 48 in 2018 and 2019a respectively but the differences were insignificant straw mulching did not increase the harvest index of maize in any of the trials but plastic mulching did so only in 2018 compared to the control treatment table 6 the manure treatment gave the highest harvest index in all three trials with a significant effect in 2018 and 2019b the conservation practices in the study were more effective in the 2019a trial because of the relatively dry weather among the trials the 2019a trial provided the highest growth and yield of maize table 6 frequent rainfall in the second half of the growth period especially at the flowering and grain filling stages in the 2018 and 2019b trials negatively affected the yield and yield components of maize compared with the 2019a trial the estimated etc for the control treatment ranged 363 403 mm for the three trials the highest in 2019b and the lowest in 2019a table 6 4 discussion 4 1 water fluxes the seasonal average etc for the control condition was 3 48 mm d 1 this measured rate was within the etc range reported in previous studies a lower etc value 2 3 mm d 1 was found in a more humid region using a weighing lysimeter adeogun and ogunlela 2013 and higher etc rates 3 7 4 5 mm d 1 were reported for drier semiarid climates hou et al 2017 djaman et al 2018 because dry weather facilitates both evaporation and transpiration straw mulching reduced etc by 0 32 0 07 mm d 1 compared with the control condition this mulching augmented soil water storage in all three trials by reducing soil evaporation loss table 3 the soil under the straw mulch treatment absorbed less heat energy and remained 1 12 1 97 c cooler than the control treatment table 5 this low temperature also affected the evaporation from the soil surface akhtar et al 2019 also stated that straw mulch treatment decreased soil temperature by 8 and retained more soil water 23 than a control treatment straw mulching intercepted the incoming solar radiation so less energy was available to evaporate the soil water plastic mulching reduced etc by 0 16 0 10 mm d 1 during the trials which helped increase the soil water availability compared with the control condition ma et al 2018 reported that plastic mulching increased the soil water content by 2 9 in rainfed maize fields in northwestern china by reducing soil evaporation loss the reduction in etc under the plastic mulch treatment was lower than that under the straw mulch treatment in this study because of the following two reasons i rainfall interception and ii relatively higher temperature under the plastic mulch treatment plastic mulching intercepted a portion of rainwater and that portion never reached the root zone soil which can modify the soil water balance as suggested by cook et al 2006 rainfall and dewfall intercepted by the crop canopies partly reached the topsoil flowing over the trunk and through the holes of the mulch plastic mulching intercepted incoming solar radiation as straw mulching did but acted like a greenhouse chamber by retarding outgoing long wave radiation thereby having a higher daily maximum soil temperature than the control condition table 5 cook et al 2006 also found an increased soil temperature under plastic mulching and they argued that the heat trapped under the plastic mulch was responsible for the increased temperature the changes in soil temperature due to plastic mulching were correlated r2 0 93 with the prevailing soil water contents because wet soils have greater heat capacity than dry soils the overall difference between the etc values of the control and mulched treatments was low table 3 because the higher root water uptake transpiration due to the higher plant growth in the mulched plots presumably offset the water saving effect of the mulches he et al 2016 also observed that straw retention and plastic mulching did not have much lower etc than unmulched soils the ratio between transpiration and soil evaporation is important for the effectiveness of mulching because this practice can reduce evaporation but not transpiration the ratio depends on the crop canopy i e a dense crop canopy reduces soil evaporation but increases transpiration therefore the effects of mulching on soil conditions were high in the early vegetative stage and then diminished as also found by yan et al 2019 the t etc value increased with the time after sowing indicating that the higher vegetation cover reduced evaporation from soil fig 5 the evaporation loss decreased with the growth stage because of the growth of the crop canopy which reduced the solar radiation and wind speed near the soil surface fatichi and pappas 2017 found that the t etc value increased in the range of 0 0 8 with the extent of vegetation cover and leaf area index the mean t etc was 0 58 in the current study previous studies reported a global value of t etc of 0 57 062 wei et al 2017 lian et al 2018 fatichi and pappas 2017 reviewed previous studies on t etc and stated that it can vary between 0 35 and 0 80 since evaporation was relatively higher during the first 40 days in this current study mulching was more effective in reducing etc in the early stage table 3 manure application increased soil water storage due to the effects of altered soil hydraulic properties reduced bulk density induced by the organic matter of the manure performing a meta analysis of 774 comparisons du et al 2020 concluded that manure application decreased soil bulk density 3 9 manure amendments reduced bulk density and increased porosity which increased the water holding capacity of the manure applied soil wortman and shapiro 2008 amin et al 2014a based on a meta analysis of 60 published studies minasny and mcbratney 2017 found that a 1 mass increase in soil organic carbon significantly increased the soil water content the magnitudes of changes in soil temperature due to manure application table 5 showed a positive correlation r2 0 88 with the prevailing soil water contents because wet soils have higher thermal conductivity than dry soils during the temperature recording events the soil water content was 23 in 2018 31 in 2019a and 37 in 2019b which introduced the observed variations in the soil temperature changes among these trials table 5 the lower bulk density and higher porosity in the manure applied soil increased the air volume in dry soil and the water volume in wet soil compared to the unamended soil wortman and shapiro 2008 consequently the more air filled pockets in relatively dry soils reduced heat absorption transport and the increased number of connected water filled pores in comparatively wet soils enhanced heat transport in the manure applied soil the higher plant growth and augmented soil water availability in the manure applied soil tended to increase the etc rate by 0 01 0 05 mm d 1 in the 2019a b trials table 3 the hydrus 1d model predicted the observed soil water dynamics etc and drainage rate for the control condition with high accuracy in all three trials the results suggest that it is a robust tool for predicting water fluxes in such crop fields the model predicted results helped understand the water flux processes more clearly by providing some un measured components such as etc and soil water content at a daily scale separate estimation of evaporation and transpiration ratio of etc to et0 and drainage below the root zone during different years with different rainfall patterns to avoid uncertainties we did not attempt to simulate the effects of different treatments separately because the model does not innately simulate mulching or manure application effects however some researchers have tried different surrogate approaches to incorporate those effects amin et al 2014b chen et al 2018a mulching can partly influence the upper boundary condition whereas manure application does not considerably affect it there is no built in option in the hydrus 1d model for simulating the boundary condition of mulching mulching does not usually alter the parameters of the soil water retention curve but manure application can affect it slightly especially for the top layer soil the effects of manure application on the parameters could be studied by calibrating the parameters for this treatment separately as was done in a previous study amin et al 2014b however we did not calibrate separately for only one manure treatment among the four treatments a dedicated modeling study is needed to find how to better simulate the water dynamics under such agricultural practices 4 2 maize yield the mulch treatments produced higher maize yields because of the enhanced plant growth and better yield components supplemental fig s1 and table s1 similarly mupangwa et al 2016 reported that mulching increased grain yield by increasing plant height cob plant 1 and cob length the augmented soil water availability helped plants grow faster and produce better yield components jiang et al 2018 argued that higher soil water storage under mulching was the main reason for an improved maize grain yield in addition the increased soil water content under mulching can retard ammonia volatilization thereby enhancing the nitrate uptake opportunity for plants wang et al 2020 aulakh et al 2000 suggested that mulch increased maize grain yield by increasing plant n uptake efficiency reducing n losses and improving nutrient preservation over unmulched plots guo et al 2019 suggested that plastic mulching improves n use efficiency in maize production because it increases both plant n uptake and residual n recovery in 0 120 cm soil therefore the higher maize yield can be attributed to the increased availability of both water and nutrients for plants the straw and plastic mulch treatments increased maize yield by 13 and 24 respectively the effectiveness of mulching can vary with soil and weather conditions and management practices wang et al 2016 haque et al 2018 liu et al 2014 observed that ridge tillage with plastic mulch increased maize yield by 9 5 compared with ridge tillage without mulch in north china in saline soils haque et al 2018 found huge variation in maize yield under different mulching options such as 161 113 89 and 36 grain yield increases under white blue and black plastic film and rice straw mulch over the control respectively the plastic mulch treatment resulted in a higher grain yield than straw mulching in 2018 table 6 similarly mahajan et al 2007 revealed that plastic mulch increased maize yield by 18 9 and 77 5 over rice straw and unmulched treatments respectively wang et al 2016 found that plastic mulching was more effective in producing maize yield than other mulches especially under low rainfall and low temperature conditions moderately higher soil temperature under plastic mulching helps seeds germinate 2 3 days earlier and may influence microbial activities and nutrient cycling in soil compared to that under straw mulching wang et al 2021 stated that film mulching hastened maize emergence and growth by improving soil temperature and water content during the early growth period the hastened maize emergence induced by the elevated soil temperature under plastic mulching increased the biomass and yield by accelerating the rate of full leaf expansion and maximum leaf area attainment stone et al 1999 plastic mulching increased the harvest index only in 2018 this result agrees with the findings of kamar et al 2018 who reported that plastic mulching provided a higher harvest index 45 6 than no mulching 42 7 however wang et al 2016 suggested that plastic mulch may reduce harvest index in warmer climates manure application increased maize yield 25 47 and yield components in all three trials table 6 the increased plant water availability in soil helped the plants grow relatively faster and produce higher grain yields mahmood et al 2017 reported that high manure application increased maize yield by significantly improving soil health and water storage capacity such as increasing soil organic carbon and total nitrogen and decreasing soil ph and bulk density jing et al 2019 found a 13 higher yield for maize grown on soil receiving manure compared with mineral fertilizer probably because of higher phosphorus uptake and supply of manure borne micronutrients du et al 2020 concluded based on a meta analysis that manure application increased crop yield by an average of 7 6 compared with mineral fertilizer because of the increased nutrient pool and decompositional capacity of manure applied soil the manure treatment gave the highest harvest index in all trials the steady supply of nutrients in the manure applied soil optimally allocated biomass into shoots and grains which increased the harvest index as suggested by wang et al 2017 the trials in the study showed variation in maize yield plant height and grain yield in 2019a were generally higher than those in 2018 and 2019b fig s1 table 6 the treatment effects on plant heights were less pronounced in 2019b than in the other trials rashid and rasul 2008 stated that the yield of maize decreases with the increase in rainfall beyond a threshold value of 300 mm during a growing season because maize is sensitive to moisture surplus the effective rainfall in 2018 and 2019b was 365 and 371 mm respectively which exceeded the 300 mm threshold moreover these trials received less sunshine 5 7 and 6 0 h d 1 respectively than the 2019a trial 6 1 h d 1 the higher temperature and wind speed in the late trial 2019b increased evapotranspiration these findings agree with baoyuan et al 2016 who observed that variations in temperature and radiation during different growth seasons were the primary factors that influenced the yield components of maize the results suggest that such late sowing of maize in the region may result in yield losses due to heavy monsoon rainfall 4 3 water management implications the cumulative etc of maize ranged 325 404 mm for different treatments in different trials under this subtropical weather table 6 a slightly higher range of etc was found by wang et al 2017 who reported that seasonal cumulative etc varied 358 485 mm in a four year experiment in a semiarid region the conservation treatments in the current study increased the effective use of rainwater either by reducing unproductive soil evaporation loss or by increasing the soil water holding capacity straw mulching increased grain yield and reduced the water consumption of rainfed maize as also observed by shen et al 2012 in northeast china manure amendments most likely improved hydraulic conductivity stimulated root physiological function and adjusted the soil water distribution mkhabela and materechera 2013 as indicated by the reduced bulk density and increased saturated water content in this study these processes facilitated root water uptake from broader bulk soil and enhanced plant growth which helped increase the grain yield the conservation practices presumably enhanced nutrient use efficiency and thus grain yield the increased maize yield reduced etc loss per unit grain production the increased maize productivity due to the conservation practices in the rainfed system will lessen the need for irrigated maize production which would help mitigate blue water scarcity however additional inputs such as mulch materials and manure are needed to implement them in the region rice straw is readily available because the widely cultivated wet season rice covering 50 of the gross planted rice area is harvested immediately before the maize sowing period bbs bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 plastic film is not expensive but appropriate disposal is needed there is enormous potential to use animal manure in crop production because only a small portion of available organic manure returns to croplands in this region bai et al 2016 chen et al 2018b approximately 70 80 of animal manure is inappropriately handled which causes environmental pollution ilmm 2015 in addition to other benefits fertilization with organic manure saves the cost of chemical fertilizer 5 conclusions the mulch treatments had higher soil water storage due to reduced soil evaporation whereas the manure treatment augmented soil water storage by reducing the bulk density of the soil the altered pore structure in the manure amended soil changed its thermal conductivity and heat capacity i e higher in wet conditions and lower in dry conditions compared to the unamended soil the straw and plastic mulch reduced etc by 0 24 0 37 mm d 1 and 0 05 0 24 mm d 1 respectively during the three trials in contrast manure application did not have any sturdy effect on the etc rate compared to the control condition the hydrus 1d model predicted the observed soil water dynamics etc 2 6 6 7 bias and drainage rate 5 5 11 7 bias for the control condition with satisfactory accuracies the observed findings of three field trials and the model predicted results helped to adequately understand the processes both mulch and manure treatments resulted in higher grain yields by producing better yield components grain cob 1 column cob 1 and 1000 grain weight than the control treatment among the treatments manure application resulted in the highest grain yield and harvest index in all trials among the trials 2019a resulted in the highest growth and yield of maize because maize is sensitive to moisture surplus as well as moisture deficit frequent rainfall at the mid and late growth stages during the 2018 and 2019b trials negatively affected maize growth and yield future research might focus more closely on the complex interplay of soil nutrient dynamics and soil water retention characteristics as affected by these conservation practices large scale implementation of these practices would help mitigate blue water scarcity and create climate resilient

8867,the plant water relationship of maize under conservation practices needs to be assessed to quantify the effectiveness of the practices in conserving soil water for crop production this study evaluated in three trials how straw and plastic film mulching and organic manure application could potentially change water fluxes in the root zone and increase maize yield a mathematical model hydrus 1d was calibrated against the observed soil water content and drainage data to predict the water fluxes in the root zone soil the model simulated soil water dynamics in the root zone with satisfactory performance rmse of 0 6 2 3 cd of 0 37 1 41 nse of 0 18 0 88 and r2 of 0 62 0 91 during both the calibration and validation periods the model predicted the observed drainage in a lysimeter with only a 5 5 11 7 bias and actual evapotranspiration etc with a 2 6 6 7 bias for the control conditions in all three trials when the model was provided with measured plant growth soil properties and weather data both measurement and modeling confirmed that mulching augmented soil water storage by reducing etc i e 0 24 0 37 mm d 1 by straw mulching and 0 05 0 24 mm d 1 by plastic mulching during the trials manure application did not affect the etc rate and resulted in the highest grain yield 6 8 8 3 mg ha 1 followed by plastic mulching 6 1 8 1 mg ha 1 and straw mulching 5 3 7 5 mg ha 1 manure application increased the harvest index by optimally allocating biomass because of a steady supply of water and nutrients the straw mulch plastic mulch and manure treatments increased grain yield by

as crop water uptake patterns so an assessment of these practices will improve agricultural water management decisions nouri et al 2019 in the region maize is a dry winter crop sown after the monsoon season or during january february in coastal and young deltaic areas maize is usually grown as a rainfed crop because of the unavailability of fresh water in addition the suitable soil and climate in some regions allow rainfed maize production with a reasonable yield supplying the crop water demand from soil water storage often becomes critical because the residual soil water content depletes steadily after the sowing of maize and the rain rarely falls until mid april ali et al 2009 maize plants that have suffered from water stress at the vegetative stage cannot produce optimum yields so maintaining soil water availability is very important rong et al 2013 conservation techniques can increase effective rainfall and augment soil water availability by increasing the infiltration opportunity time and water holding capacity of the soil and reducing soil evaporation loss quintanilla tornel et al 2016 yin et al 2018 conservation practices such as mulching or animal manure application as a source of organic matter can help plants use the residual soil water content effectively and ease the water stress condition in maize cultivation jjagwe et al 2020 kumar and bhopl 2017 mulching provides many benefits to the soil by reducing evaporation improving temperature adjusting the microbial biomass maintaining the soil organic carbon balance increasing nutrient cycling promoting soil enzyme activity enhancing soil aggregate stability and suppressing weed infestations rong et al 2013 wang et al 2019 organic mulch may also increase rainwater infiltration which augments soil water storage at various depths deper et al 2014 in addition it provides organic matter and nutrients to the soil when it decomposes chakraborty et al 2010 however mulching can increase nutrient leaching and affect pest infestation gill et al 2011 quintanilla tornel et al 2016 yin et al 2018 suggested that high soil temperature with plastic film mulching can cause premature ripening by enhancing root respiration and root activity most of the soils in bangladesh are low 1 5 in organic matter frg 2018 but soils rich in organic matter can hold more water amin et al 2014a organic matter also supplies crop available nutrients through mineralization and improves soil physicochemical and biological properties rahman 2014 therefore it was hypothesized that mulching and animal manure application enhance soil water storage and maize yield by altering root water uptake and evaporation from the soil we need to assess and quantify the effects of mulching and manure application on the plant water relationship for the large scale implementation of these practices therefore this study was conducted with the following specific objectives i to quantify the water fluxes in a rainfed maize field and ii to assess the effects of straw and plastic mulching and manure amendments on the yield of maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was carried out during the 2018 and 2019 maize growing seasons at the field irrigation laboratory department of irrigation and water management bangladesh agricultural university 24 55 to 25 55 n and 90 10 to 90 30 e and 18 m above mean sea level the experimental field is a medium high land belonging to the old brahmaputra floodplain with noncalcareous dark gray floodplain soil the 2018 trial was conducted on a field lysimeter with a drainage water measuring facility fig 1a a detailed description of this lysimeter is given in amin et al 2021 soil samples from the experimental plots were collected before the experiment and analyzed for selected physicochemical properties the soil was silt loam with 35 5 4 1 sand 55 4 2 silt and 9 5 1 clay the average soil ph and electrical conductivity were 6 49 0 13 and 219 41 8 ¬µs cm 1 respectively it was low in total nitrogen 1 1 g kg 1 exchangeable potassium 0 013 g kg 1 available phosphorus 0 011 g kg 1 and organic matter 1 26 0 07 according to k√∂ppen geiger s classification the study site is located in the tropical savanna climate aw zone the summer here is humid whereas the winter november to february is moderate with occasional rainfall the monthly mean minimum and maximum temperatures vary 11 25 8 c and 24 33 4 c respectively april is the warmest month with a daily average temperature of 22 3 33 4 c while january is the coldest month with 11 24 c temperature the annual average rainfall in this area is 2249 mm but the main vegetative growth period of maize january march receives only 75 mm and then the monsoon starts in april with 110 mm normal rainfall www bmd gov bd the major crops grown in the study area are rice maize mustard wheat and vegetables in the wet season crops can grow as rainfed but dry season crops usually need irrigation alternate wetting and drying irrigation or 1 5 cm ponding water irrigation is applied in rice fields whereas other crops receive flooding or furrow irrigation at 2 4 week intervals depending on the weather groundwater is the main source of irrigation water in this area the groundwater level in an on site observation well installed in the shallow aquifer fluctuated between 5 6 and 6 2 m from the ground surface during the experiment 2 2 experimental design the first trial of the experiment was conducted from 18 february to 6 june 2018 2018 trial and then it was repeated from 7 february to 26 may 2019 2019a trial and 26 february to 15 june 2019 2019b trial the experiment was repeated with two different sowing dates in 2019 to estimate the variability of the results and to increase the accuracy of the estimate under different weather conditions the experimental designs in all three trials were identical the soil water conservation treatments in the study were as follows i mulch and manure were not applied to simulate usual farmers practices control treatment ii rice straw was applied at a rate of 6 0 mg ha 1 straw mulch treatment iii black plastic film was rolled over the soil plastic mulch treatment and iv cow manure stored in an open pit of a local dairy farm was applied to the land surface during final land preparation at a rate of 60 mg ha 1 before the sowing of maize manure treatment the manure had 30 8 dry matter 4 0 0 6 kg n mg 1 5 0 16 kg p mg and 2 3 0 19 kg k mg the manure was immediately incorporated into the top 15 cm of soil mulching was not applied to the manure applied plots the estimated crop available nitrogen 240 kg ha 1 for all these treatments was the same the rice straw used in the straw mulch treatment was not fully decomposed during the study period a required number of holes were made in the plastic mulch to sow the seeds these holes also facilitated the infiltration of rainwater a 15 cm field ridge surrounded each plot to stop runoff generation and thereby enhance infiltration and groundwater recharge potential as a part of the water conservation effort the field plots were 4 m 4 m a randomized complete block design with three replications of each treatment was adopted in each trial 2 3 agronomic operations weeds crop residues and stubbles were removed from the experimental plots and the lands were prepared to simulate local tillage conditions hybrid maize variety kaveri 3696 seeds were sown at 5 cm below the soil surface maintaining a 60 cm line to line and 20 cm plant to plant distance two seeds were placed in each position after the germination of seeds some seedlings under the straw mulch treatment were affected by insect infestation however we managed to have at least one healthy plant in each position excess seedlings were thinned out the plots were fertilized with phosphorus 110 kg ha 1 potash 240 kg ha 1 sulfur 15 kg ha 1 and zinc 5 kg ha 1 only once before sowing nitrogen 3 80 kg ha 1 was applied three times one basal application prior to sowing and two side dressings at 35 and 60 days after sowing das manual weeding and plant protection measures were carried out whenever needed no irrigation was applied 2 4 sampling and data collection 2 4 1 soil water and weather data the soil water content at 5 15 and 30 cm depths of each plot was measured at 10 to 15 day intervals during the growing periods using the gravimetric method placing the samples at 105 c in an oven for 24 h in the first trial soil water contents at a 10 cm interval of 1 m depth in the lysimeter were measured by an automatic device called sentek diviner 2000 this device measures volumetric soil water content by responding to changes in the dielectric constant of the soil haberland et al 2015 the diviner was calibrated against the observed gravimetric soil water content soil was sampled using a core sampler after a heavy rain event to measure the saturated soil water content and bulk density drainage below the root zone of three major rain events was measured using field lysimeters during the experimental period the groundwater level in an on site observation well was monitored at 15 day intervals using a water level recorder rainfall maximum and minimum temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity data were recorded at a weather station adjacent to the field plot 2 4 2 agronomic data the full matured maize plants of the 2018 2019a and 2019b trials were harvested on 6 june 2018 26 may 2019 and 15 june 2019 respectively the cobs of the harvested plants were air dried and shelled manually the 1000 grain weight and grain yield were recorded the total biomass including the plant cover and woody parts of the maize for each plot was weighed the harvest index was calculated by dividing the grain yield by the shoot dry matter grain and biomass which is a measure of reproductive efficiency 2 5 water flux estimation 2 5 1 soil water balance method the following soil water balance equation was used to estimate actual evapotranspiration etc 1 etc rainfall Œ¥sws gwc runoff drainage where Œ¥sws represents the soil water storage change in the root zone and gwc represents the groundwater contribution to the root zone soil this soil water balance method was applied during 0 40 das in the 2018 trial 0 70 das in the 2019 a trial and 20 70 das in the 2019 b trial to estimate the variation in etc under different mulching and manure applications we did not apply the water balance equation after 70 das to avoid uncertainties in estimating the water drainage loss of heavy rainfall events in addition in the later parts of the growing periods the effects of mulching and manure application on the soil water balance were insignificant because of these heavy rainfall events and the fully grown plant canopy to corroborate the measurements and to determine the data for the whole season a mathematical model as described in the following section calculated all the water fluxes and water balance components for the whole season such as seasonal total etc drainage losses and capillary rise of groundwater to the root zone in the field conditions 2 5 2 selection of a simulation model a widely used soil water transport model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2013 amin et al 2014b hou et al 2017 chen et al 2018a zhou and zhao 2019 was used to simulate the soil water dynamics and to estimate the water balance components of the experiments under the control conditions a detailed description of the model is given in the hydrus 1d manual ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2013 the model simulates water movement based on the standard richards equation for unsaturated Ô¨Çow eq 2 2 Œ∏ t x k h x cos Œ± s where h is the water pressure head l Œ∏ the volumetric water content l3 l 3 t the time t x the spatial coordinate l Œ± the angle between the flow direction and vertical axis and s is the sink term in the flow equation l3 l 3 t 1 which is the volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit time due to plant water uptake and k the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function lt 1 given by 3 k h x k s x k r h x where k r is the relative hydraulic conductivity and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 2 5 3 model setup and calibration the hydrus 1d model was calibrated against the soil water content of 90 data points drainage and etc rate observed in the first trial meteorological conditions were provided as the upper boundary of the model the boundary condition requires daily data of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine and wind speed mulching can partly influence the upper boundary condition but we could not incorporate such influences in the simulation because there is no built in option in the hydrus 1d model for simulating mulching effects free drainage was selected as the lower boundary condition of the lysimeter experiment fig 1a the observed water content prior to sowing was incorporated into the model as the initial condition the van genuchten mualem hydraulic model was chosen the water stress response function suggested by the following s shaped function eq 4 was used to reduce the potential root water uptake to actual root water uptake 4 Œ± h h 1 1 h h h 50 p where Œ± is the water stress response function h and h œï represent the pressure and osmotic head respectively p is an exponent and h 50 represents the pressure head at which the water extraction rate is reduced by 50 during conditions of negligible osmotic stress to estimate root water uptake the built in s shape model was used with the observed average plant growth data including the leaf area index ten observation nodes were assigned in the simulation domain so that we could compare the simulated data with the observed data for a specific location to simulate water transport through the soil using hydrus 1d the parameters of the soil water retention curves are the primary parameters to be calibrated these parameters can be obtained by using any of the three methods i the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 if soil textural and bulk density data are available ii the inverse solution technique based on the observed soil water content data and iii manual calibration of the parameters to get a desired level of agreement between observed and predicted soil water content data in this current study we tried all three calibration options and they gave similar modeling efficiency the soil hydraulic properties and the parameters of the soil water retention curves determined using the rosetta pedotransfer function based on the observed data on the percentage of sand silt and clay and bulk density were finally used in this study table 1 the penman monteith equation was chosen to calculate et0 actual geographical and meteorological parameters of the location latitude of 24 7 n altitude of 19 m measurement heights of meteorological parameters of 2 m radiation extinction of 0 53 albedo of 0 23 were incorporated into the model the cloudiness was measured from the sunshine hour data between the built in feddes and s shape root water uptake models the latter gave higher accuracy against the observed data in this study the h50 parameter of the s shape model was 800 cm with a p exponent of 3 2 5 4 model validation this calibrated model was validated against the soil water contents of 12 data points and the etc rate measured during the 2nd and 3rd trials so that the model predicted soil water balance components especially for the unmeasured period and space could be used confidently for the field experiments water transport in the vadose zone from the bottom of the root zone to the top of the groundwater zone was also simulated fig 1b so the saturated water content was incorporated as the lower boundary condition in the model the rosetta pedotransfer function predicted the soil hydraulic properties of the vadose zone below 1 m depth to the saturation zone based on the percentage of sand silt and clay in soil samples collected from different depths of the vadose zone during test drilling prior to the experiment table 1 the parameters found for the root zone soil and vadose zone were slightly different 2 5 5 model output the hydrus 1d model estimated the soil water content at the predefined depths observation nodes soil water storage in the root zone actual root water uptake evaporation groundwater contribution and drainage below the root zone the sum of actual root water uptake and evaporation gave the etc value the seasonal total etc was calculated from the etc values measured using the soil water balance method and the model estimated etc values during the unmeasured period 2 5 6 model

the coefficient of determination r2 was also calculated to indicate the precision of the model 2 6 statistical analysis the widely used statistical analysis software sas 9 4 sas institute inc 2017 was used to perform an analysis of variance anova to evaluate differences between means of yield 1000 grain weight grain yield and biomass yield yield attributes cob plant 1 cob length cob perimeter grain cob 1 and column cob 1 and etc using a multiple linear model trials and treatments were considered as factors fixed effects of treatment and trial and the interaction of trial and treatment levels

used for statistical decision making throughout the study 3 results 3 1 water fluxes 3 1 1 model performance the hydrus 1d model accurately simulated the observed soil water contents at various depths of the lysimeter as shown by the good agreement between the observed and simulated soil water contents fig 2 the results suggest that the model was parameterized accurately during the calibration the model performance indicators were also satisfactory table 2 the low values of rmse 0 6 2 3 and cd values close to one 0 37 1 41 indicate satisfactory accuracy of the model gonz√°lez et al 2015 also found low rmse values 1 4 2 5 the nse values 0 18 0 88 and r2 0 62 0 91 were close to one which also indicates that the model performed well moriasi et al 2007 in the validation period the predicted soil water contents in the root zone matched well with the observed values for the control condition fig 3b and c the performance of the model was also satisfactory with an rmse of 2 57 cd of 0 83 and r2 of 0 78 in 2019a and rmse of 2 53 cd of 0 53 and r2 of 0 71 in 2019b the model predicted the observed etc values for the control condition with only a 3 9 bias in the 2019a trial and a 2 6 bias in the 2019b trial table 3 as the model accurately predicted the soil water content and etc values for the control condition the model predicted water fluxes were considered representative and appropriate for the control condition 3 1 2 soil water dynamics the calibrated model satisfactorily predicted the changes in soil water content during the experimental periods especially under the control condition in all three trials fig 3 the model underpredicted the soil water content observed under the mulching and manure application treatments mulching increased the soil water content by up to 3 2 in some events by reducing soil evaporation on the other hand manure application increased the soil water storage by reducing the bulk density and increasing the water holding capacity of the manure borne organic matter mulching did not affect the soil hydraulic properties but manure application reduced the soil bulk density from 1 33 to 1 25 g cm 3 and increased the saturated volumetric soil water content by 2 7 5 in the top 15 cm soil layer since the model simulated the soil water dynamics with good accuracy it should predict the other water balance components evapotranspiration and drainage reasonably well 3 1 3 drainage loss the drainage loss measured at the outlet of the lysimeters in the three rainfall events of the 2018 trial matched well with the model predicted values with only 5 5 11 7 bias fig 4 the amount of drainage below the root zone 1 1 m depth was significantly affected by the rainfall amount approximately 40 43 of infiltrated rainwater drained out in 2018 and 2019b when the total rainfall was 690 692 mm but only 14 of water drained out when the total rainfall was 449 mm in 2019a major drainage occurred mainly during the last 30 40 days of the growing seasons due to some heavy rain events fig 4 zhou and zhao 2019 estimated that percolation amounted to approximately 32 3 and 42 9 of the total water input the drainage rate significantly varies with soil texture frequency and intensity of rainfall and irrigation and evapotranspiration demand the drainage in this silt loam soil was relatively higher 3 1 4 evapotranspiration the etc values estimated using the soil water balance method under the control condition matched well with the model predicted values with only 6 7 bias in 2018 3 9 in 2019a and 2 6 in 2019b table 3 the etc values under the mulched treatments were lower than the simulated values because the built in boundary conditions of the hydrus 1d model chosen in this simulation do not intrinsically simulate the mulching effects on etc the straw and plastic mulch reduced etc on average by 0 24 0 37 mm d 1 and 0 05 0 24 mm d 1 respectively during the three trials compared with the control condition in contrast manure application did not have any sturdy effect on the etc rate the manure applied plots had a slightly lower etc 0 17 mm d 1 in 2018 but had a marginally higher etc i e 0 05 mm d 1 in 2019a and 0 01 mm d 1 in 2019b compared with the control treatment the model simulated total seasonal etc ranged 363 403 mm for the three trials table 4 the seasonal average daily etc rates were 3 30 3 66 mm d 1 during the three trials the seasonal average etc value of different seasons did not vary considerably because of similar soil water plant atmosphere conditions and relationships however there were significantly different etc rates at different growth stages in a season fig 4 the evapotranspiration rate gradually increased after the plant s establishment and reached its peak after two months the 2019a trial had a slightly lower ratio of etc and et0 potential evapotranspiration values 0 66 1 10 mean 0 87 than the 2018 trial 0 55 1 23 mean 0 92 and the 2019b trial 0 48 1 28 mean 0 92 although the plants experienced water stress conditions for several days the ratio of etc and et0 values agreed with the reported kc values equal to the ratio of etc and et0 at a no stress condition of different growth stages of maize in previous studies such as 0 53 1 21 in iran by abedinpour 2015 0 3 1 2 by fao 2021 and 0 2 1 2 trout and dejonge 2018 these results suggest that the model predicted et0 and etc values closely matched the experimental data transpiration considering equal to root water uptake t to etc ratio t etc during the maize growing seasons as estimated by the hydrus 1d model is shown in fig 5 the model predicted t etc over the maize growing seasons shows that the ratio ranged from approx 0 2 in the early vegetative stage 0 30 das to approx 0 8 in the flowering and grain filling stages 60 90 das the results suggest that the evaporation loss from the soil during 0 50 das was considerable 25 80 of total etc which indicates that there was potential to reduce this evaporation loss therefore both straw and plastic mulching reduced etc by reducing the evaporation from the soil especially in the early periods table 3 3 1 5 soil heat fluxes straw mulching decreased the daily maximum soil temperature consistently in all trials table 5 in contrast the plastic mulch treatment increased the daily maximum soil temperature the temperature of the manure treated soil showed a varying response compared with the control treatment table 5 in 2018 and 2019a the manure treated soil had an overall lower maximum soil temperature than the control treatment in contrast the manure treatment in 2019b had a higher temperature than the control treatment table 5 3 2 yield and yield components both mulching and manure application produced taller plants in most of the cases compared with the control treatment supplemental fig s1 in 2019a and 2019b the plastic mulch treatment outperformed the other treatments in producing taller plants plants in 2018 were generally shorter than those in 2019a and 2019b fig s1 straw mulching produced significantly higher grain cob 1 in 2019a than in the control treatment supplemental table s1 plastic mulching resulted in higher grain cob 1 in all trials column cob 1 in 2018 and cob length in 2019b than the control treatment manure application significantly increased column cob 1 and grain cob 1 in 2018 cob length and grain cob 1 in 2019a and grain cob 1 in 2019b table s1 these results were attributed to the increased vegetative growth of maize because of higher soil water availability and consequently higher nutrient uptake by plants under the mulch and manure treatments the manure and plastic mulch treatments increased grain yield in all trials compared with the control treatment whereas the straw mulch treatment had a higher grain yield in 2019a and 2019b table 6 in 2018 the effect of straw mulching on grain yield was not significant but plastic mulching increased grain yield by 23 manure application increased grain yield by 47 26 and 13 in 2018 2019a and 2019b respectively table 6 the straw mulch and manure treatments increased the 1000 grain weight in 2018 and plastic mulching gave a higher value in 2019a than the control treatment the straw and plastic mulch treatments significantly increased biomass yield only in 2019a table 6 manure application increased biomass yield by 14 and 48 in 2018 and 2019a respectively but the differences were insignificant straw mulching did not increase the harvest index of maize in any of the trials but plastic mulching did so only in 2018 compared to the control treatment table 6 the manure treatment gave the highest harvest index in all three trials with a significant effect in 2018 and 2019b the conservation practices in the study were more effective in the 2019a trial because of the relatively dry weather among the trials the 2019a trial provided the highest growth and yield of maize table 6 frequent rainfall in the second half of the growth period especially at the flowering and grain filling stages in the 2018 and 2019b trials negatively affected the yield and yield components of maize compared with the 2019a trial the estimated etc for the control treatment ranged 363 403 mm for the three trials the highest in 2019b and the lowest in 2019a table 6 4 discussion 4 1 water fluxes the seasonal average etc for the control condition was 3 48 mm d 1 this measured rate was within the etc range reported in previous studies a lower etc value 2 3 mm d 1 was found in a more humid region using a weighing lysimeter adeogun and ogunlela 2013 and higher etc rates 3 7 4 5 mm d 1 were reported for drier semiarid climates hou et al 2017 djaman et al 2018 because dry weather facilitates both evaporation and transpiration straw mulching reduced etc by 0 32 0 07 mm d 1 compared with the control condition this mulching augmented soil water storage in all three trials by reducing soil evaporation loss table 3 the soil under the straw mulch treatment absorbed less heat energy and remained 1 12 1 97 c cooler than the control treatment table 5 this low temperature also affected the evaporation from the soil surface akhtar et al 2019 also stated that straw mulch treatment decreased soil temperature by 8 and retained more soil water 23 than a control treatment straw mulching intercepted the incoming solar radiation so less energy was available to evaporate the soil water plastic mulching reduced etc by 0 16 0 10 mm d 1 during the trials which helped increase the soil water availability compared with the control condition ma et al 2018 reported that plastic mulching increased the soil water content by 2 9 in rainfed maize fields in northwestern china by reducing soil evaporation loss the reduction in etc under the plastic mulch treatment was lower than that under the straw mulch treatment in this study because of the following two reasons i rainfall interception and ii relatively higher temperature under the plastic mulch treatment plastic mulching intercepted a portion of rainwater and that portion never reached the root zone soil which can modify the soil water balance as suggested by cook et al 2006 rainfall and dewfall intercepted by the crop canopies partly reached the topsoil flowing over the trunk and through the holes of the mulch plastic mulching intercepted incoming solar radiation as straw mulching did but acted like a greenhouse chamber by retarding outgoing long wave radiation thereby having a higher daily maximum soil temperature than the control condition table 5 cook et al 2006 also found an increased soil temperature under plastic mulching and they argued that the heat trapped under the plastic mulch was responsible for the increased temperature the changes in soil temperature due to plastic mulching were correlated r2 0 93 with the prevailing soil water contents because wet soils have greater heat capacity than dry soils the overall difference between the etc values of the control and mulched treatments was low table 3 because the higher root water uptake transpiration due to the higher plant growth in the mulched plots presumably offset the water saving effect of the mulches he et al 2016 also observed that straw retention and plastic mulching did not have much lower etc than unmulched soils the ratio between transpiration and soil evaporation is important for the effectiveness of mulching because this practice can reduce evaporation but not transpiration the ratio depends on the crop canopy i e a dense crop canopy reduces soil evaporation but increases transpiration therefore the effects of mulching on soil conditions were high in the early vegetative stage and then diminished as also found by yan et al 2019 the t etc value increased with the time after sowing indicating that the higher vegetation cover reduced evaporation from soil fig 5 the evaporation loss decreased with the growth stage because of the growth of the crop canopy which reduced the solar radiation and wind speed near the soil surface fatichi and pappas 2017 found that the t etc value increased in the range of 0 0 8 with the extent of vegetation cover and leaf area index the mean t etc was 0 58 in the current study previous studies reported a global value of t etc of 0 57 062 wei et al 2017 lian et al 2018 fatichi and pappas 2017 reviewed previous studies on t etc and stated that it can vary between 0 35 and 0 80 since evaporation was relatively higher during the first 40 days in this current study mulching was more effective in reducing etc in the early stage table 3 manure application increased soil water storage due to the effects of altered soil hydraulic properties reduced bulk density induced by the organic matter of the manure performing a meta analysis of 774 comparisons du et al 2020 concluded that manure application decreased soil bulk density 3 9 manure amendments reduced bulk density and increased porosity which increased the water holding capacity of the manure applied soil wortman and shapiro 2008 amin et al 2014a based on a meta analysis of 60 published studies minasny and mcbratney 2017 found that a 1 mass increase in soil organic carbon significantly increased the soil water content the magnitudes of changes in soil temperature due to manure application table 5 showed a positive correlation r2 0 88 with the prevailing soil water contents because wet soils have higher thermal conductivity than dry soils during the temperature recording events the soil water content was 23 in 2018 31 in 2019a and 37 in 2019b which introduced the observed variations in the soil temperature changes among these trials table 5 the lower bulk density and higher porosity in the manure applied soil increased the air volume in dry soil and the water volume in wet soil compared to the unamended soil wortman and shapiro 2008 consequently the more air filled pockets in relatively dry soils reduced heat absorption transport and the increased number of connected water filled pores in comparatively wet soils enhanced heat transport in the manure applied soil the higher plant growth and augmented soil water availability in the manure applied soil tended to increase the etc rate by 0 01 0 05 mm d 1 in the 2019a b trials table 3 the hydrus 1d model predicted the observed soil water dynamics etc and drainage rate for the control condition with high accuracy in all three trials the results suggest that it is a robust tool for predicting water fluxes in such crop fields the model predicted results helped understand the water flux processes more clearly by providing some un measured components such as etc and soil water content at a daily scale separate estimation of evaporation and transpiration ratio of etc to et0 and drainage below the root zone during different years with different rainfall patterns to avoid uncertainties we did not attempt to simulate the effects of different treatments separately because the model does not innately simulate mulching or manure application effects however some researchers have tried different surrogate approaches to incorporate those effects amin et al 2014b chen et al 2018a mulching can partly influence the upper boundary condition whereas manure application does not considerably affect it there is no built in option in the hydrus 1d model for simulating the boundary condition of mulching mulching does not usually alter the parameters of the soil water retention curve but manure application can affect it slightly especially for the top layer soil the effects of manure application on the parameters could be studied by calibrating the parameters for this treatment separately as was done in a previous study amin et al 2014b however we did not calibrate separately for only one manure treatment among the four treatments a dedicated modeling study is needed to find how to better simulate the water dynamics under such agricultural practices 4 2 maize yield the mulch treatments produced higher maize yields because of the enhanced plant growth and better yield components supplemental fig s1 and table s1 similarly mupangwa et al 2016 reported that mulching increased grain yield by increasing plant height cob plant 1 and cob length the augmented soil water availability helped plants grow faster and produce better yield components jiang et al 2018 argued that higher soil water storage under mulching was the main reason for an improved maize grain yield in addition the increased soil water content under mulching can retard ammonia volatilization thereby enhancing the nitrate uptake opportunity for plants wang et al 2020 aulakh et al 2000 suggested that mulch increased maize grain yield by increasing plant n uptake efficiency reducing n losses and improving nutrient preservation over unmulched plots guo et al 2019 suggested that plastic mulching improves n use efficiency in maize production because it increases both plant n uptake and residual n recovery in 0 120 cm soil therefore the higher maize yield can be attributed to the increased availability of both water and nutrients for plants the straw and plastic mulch treatments increased maize yield by 13 and 24 respectively the effectiveness of mulching can vary with soil and weather conditions and management practices wang et al 2016 haque et al 2018 liu et al 2014 observed that ridge tillage with plastic mulch increased maize yield by 9 5 compared with ridge tillage without mulch in north china in saline soils haque et al 2018 found huge variation in maize yield under different mulching options such as 161 113 89 and 36 grain yield increases under white blue and black plastic film and rice straw mulch over the control respectively the plastic mulch treatment resulted in a higher grain yield than straw mulching in 2018 table 6 similarly mahajan et al 2007 revealed that plastic mulch increased maize yield by 18 9 and 77 5 over rice straw and unmulched treatments respectively wang et al 2016 found that plastic mulching was more effective in producing maize yield than other mulches especially under low rainfall and low temperature conditions moderately higher soil temperature under plastic mulching helps seeds germinate 2 3 days earlier and may influence microbial activities and nutrient cycling in soil compared to that under straw mulching wang et al 2021 stated that film mulching hastened maize emergence and growth by improving soil temperature and water content during the early growth period the hastened maize emergence induced by the elevated soil temperature under plastic mulching increased the biomass and yield by accelerating the rate of full leaf expansion and maximum leaf area attainment stone et al 1999 plastic mulching increased the harvest index only in 2018 this result agrees with the findings of kamar et al 2018 who reported that plastic mulching provided a higher harvest index 45 6 than no mulching 42 7 however wang et al 2016 suggested that plastic mulch may reduce harvest index in warmer climates manure application increased maize yield 25 47 and yield components in all three trials table 6 the increased plant water availability in soil helped the plants grow relatively faster and produce higher grain yields mahmood et al 2017 reported that high manure application increased maize yield by significantly improving soil health and water storage capacity such as increasing soil organic carbon and total nitrogen and decreasing soil ph and bulk density jing et al 2019 found a 13 higher yield for maize grown on soil receiving manure compared with mineral fertilizer probably because of higher phosphorus uptake and supply of manure borne micronutrients du et al 2020 concluded based on a meta analysis that manure application increased crop yield by an average of 7 6 compared with mineral fertilizer because of the increased nutrient pool and decompositional capacity of manure applied soil the manure treatment gave the highest harvest index in all trials the steady supply of nutrients in the manure applied soil optimally allocated biomass into shoots and grains which increased the harvest index as suggested by wang et al 2017 the trials in the study showed variation in maize yield plant height and grain yield in 2019a were generally higher than those in 2018 and 2019b fig s1 table 6 the treatment effects on plant heights were less pronounced in 2019b than in the other trials rashid and rasul 2008 stated that the yield of maize decreases with the increase in rainfall beyond a threshold value of 300 mm during a growing season because maize is sensitive to moisture surplus the effective rainfall in 2018 and 2019b was 365 and 371 mm respectively which exceeded the 300 mm threshold moreover these trials received less sunshine 5 7 and 6 0 h d 1 respectively than the 2019a trial 6 1 h d 1 the higher temperature and wind speed in the late trial 2019b increased evapotranspiration these findings agree with baoyuan et al 2016 who observed that variations in temperature and radiation during different growth seasons were the primary factors that influenced the yield components of maize the results suggest that such late sowing of maize in the region may result in yield losses due to heavy monsoon rainfall 4 3 water management implications the cumulative etc of maize ranged 325 404 mm for different treatments in different trials under this subtropical weather table 6 a slightly higher range of etc was found by wang et al 2017 who reported that seasonal cumulative etc varied 358 485 mm in a four year experiment in a semiarid region the conservation treatments in the current study increased the effective use of rainwater either by reducing unproductive soil evaporation loss or by increasing the soil water holding capacity straw mulching increased grain yield and reduced the water consumption of rainfed maize as also observed by shen et al 2012 in northeast china manure amendments most likely improved hydraulic conductivity stimulated root physiological function and adjusted the soil water distribution mkhabela and materechera 2013 as indicated by the reduced bulk density and increased saturated water content in this study these processes facilitated root water uptake from broader bulk soil and enhanced plant growth which helped increase the grain yield the conservation practices presumably enhanced nutrient use efficiency and thus grain yield the increased maize yield reduced etc loss per unit grain production the increased maize productivity due to the conservation practices in the rainfed system will lessen the need for irrigated maize production which would help mitigate blue water scarcity however additional inputs such as mulch materials and manure are needed to implement them in the region rice straw is readily available because the widely cultivated wet season rice covering 50 of the gross planted rice area is harvested immediately before the maize sowing period bbs bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 plastic film is not expensive but appropriate disposal is needed there is enormous potential to use animal manure in crop production because only a small portion of available organic manure returns to croplands in this region bai et al 2016 chen et al 2018b approximately 70 80 of animal manure is inappropriately handled which causes environmental pollution ilmm 2015 in addition to other benefits fertilization with organic manure saves the cost of chemical fertilizer 5 conclusions the mulch treatments had higher soil water storage due to reduced soil evaporation whereas the manure treatment augmented soil water storage by reducing the bulk density of the soil the altered pore structure in the manure amended soil changed its thermal conductivity and heat capacity i e higher in wet conditions and lower in dry conditions compared to the unamended soil the straw and plastic mulch reduced etc by 0 24 0 37 mm d 1 and 0 05 0 24 mm d 1 respectively during the three trials in contrast manure application did not have any sturdy effect on the etc rate compared to the control condition the hydrus 1d model predicted the observed soil water dynamics etc 2 6 6 7 bias and drainage rate 5 5 11 7 bias for the control condition with satisfactory accuracies the observed findings of three field trials and the model predicted results helped to adequately understand the processes both mulch and manure treatments resulted in higher grain yields by producing better yield components grain cob 1 column cob 1 and 1000 grain weight than the control treatment among the treatments manure application resulted in the highest grain yield and harvest index in all trials among the trials 2019a resulted in the highest growth and yield of maize because maize is sensitive to moisture surplus as well as moisture deficit frequent rainfall at the mid and late growth stages during the 2018 and 2019b trials negatively affected maize growth and yield future research might focus more closely on the complex interplay of soil nutrient dynamics and soil water retention characteristics as affected by these conservation practices large scale implementation of these practices would help mitigate blue water scarcity and create climate resilient

8868,the high loss of foliar applied fertilizers in the wet season and other extreme weather conditions reduces fertilizer use efficiency remarkably low emerging nano iron materials owing to their highly desirable properties such as exceptionally small size particle surface and interface attributes strong adhesion and high iron ratio could overcome the limitations of traditional fertilizers however their anti leaching property leaching resistance mechanism iron nutrition enrichment capacity and cost effectiveness remain unclear in this study four nano iron materials fe nanoparticles fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps were compared with traditional iron fertilizers feso4 and fe edta the results showed that the efficiency of traditional iron fertilizers decreased greatly under simulated rainfall conditions due to their poor leaching resistance in contrast nano iron fertilizers performed exceptionally well under simulated rainfall conditions with significant increase in leaf iron concentration photosynthesis and growth of peanut this was mainly attributed to their decreased contact angle increased wetting capacity and increased adhesion on plant surface which collectively decreased fertilizer leaching remarkably the adhesion capacity of fe3o4 nps 53 5 mn m was nearly three times that of traditional iron fertilizer 18 3 mn m therefore only a small amount of fe3o4 nps 4 mg plant was needed relative to traditional iron fertilizers feso4 59 mg plant to achieve comparable high leaf fe concentration 1076 96 Œºg g under rainfall conditions cost evaluation suggests that the cost competitiveness of fe3o4 nps will become comparable to that of feso4 when its price comes down from the current cost of 139 kg to 36 kg the cost of feso4 which is likely considering the pace of nano material technology development together these results demonstrate the remarkable potential of nano iron fertilizers in mitigating the escalating fertilizer cost and improving the environmental outcomes of peanut as well as potentially other crops grown in wet season graphical abstract ga1 keywords nano iron fertilizer peanut anti leaching iron nutrition cost

extreme environmental externalities linked to climate change shortage of fertilizers and the rise in fertilizer cost jalilov et al 2022 according to the wind database the current costs of urea mono

respectively greater than their price in 2021 developing a new generation of affordable fertilizers with desirable environmental features such as low application rate and leaching loss is critical for realising green sustainable agriculture food self sufficiency and ultimately the united nation s sustainable development goals ciceri and allanore 2019 noman et al 2022 pauw 2022 application of iron fertilizer is a common and effective method to remedy iron deficiency in plants and iron biofortification for humans zhang et al 2018 globally more than one third of the land is covered by high ph alkaline or calcareous soils which are not conducive to agricultural use sabet and mortazaeinezhad 2018 taherian et al 2019 in the soil soil applied iron fertilizers are easily fixed or oxidized into insoluble iron mineral forms which are unavailable to plants and trace elements in ultramafic soils have an impact on human health guerinot and yi 1994 vithanage et al 2019 based on the poor efficacy of soil applied iron fertilizers foliar application is more commonly practiced in crop production fageria et al 2009 malhotra et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 however foliar application has several challenges such as large leaching loss low nutrient availability relatively high cost of application and short duration of fertilizer effect especially in high temperature and rainy environment fageria et al 2009 ruiz navarro et al 2019 hence the effectiveness of traditional iron fertilizers in supplementing iron is still unsatisfactory therefore taking the advantages of nanotechnology to design and develop a new generation long acting foliar micronutrient fertilizers to overcome the current challenges of foliar fertilization would be a very desirable outcome hu et al 2017 li et al 2016 noman et al 2022 nanotechnology is an important driver of the current agricultural technology revolution enabling more sustainable efficient and resilient agricultural systems while promoting food security lowry et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 rai et al 2018 in recent years use of nanomaterials for agricultural applications has gained momentum and they are considered to have great potential in agricultural production kah et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2017 wang et al 2020 previous studies have shown that iron nanoparticles nps can promote plant growth under both stress and non stress conditions cui et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 at present the nano iron materials applied to plants are mainly oxidized iron nanoparticles such as fe nps fe2o3 nps and fe3o4 nps xu et al 2022 in an earlier study ghafariyan and co workers ghafariyan et al 2013 reported a significant increase in leaf chlorophyll content in soybean treated with 30 60 mg l fe2o3 nps in hydroponic conditions also root applied fe2o3 nps increased root length plant height biomass and spad of peanuts rui et al 2016 and Œ± fe2o3 Œ≥ fe2o3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles entered root cells in nanoforms through diapirism and endocytosis li et al 2018 further researchers have found that iron nanoparticles can promote plant growth by regulating the growth and function of commensal microbes for example foliar spraying of iron oxide nanomaterials promoted nitrogen fixation crop yield and seed nutritional quality of soybean through enhanced root nodulation cao et al 2022 also manganese ferrite nanomaterials enhanced the activity of reactive oxygen species ros and bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens nodulation in soybean ma et al 2022 nanomaterials have strong adhesion on leaves which greatly reduces leaching loss for example cunp composite alginate nanogel cunp algnp ctac with strong leaf surface adsorption showed good antibacterial effect ma et al 2022 similarly leaf applied of Œ≥ fe2o3 nps showed strong adsorption and low nutrient loss in citrus hu et al 2017 in the previous studies contact angle was studied to visualize the adhesion state of foliar fertilizers on leaves leaching resistance of nanomaterials was found to be strongly related to their contact angle li et al 2020 wen et al 2022 the adhesion of nps on leaf surface can be calculated by determining the solution surface tension and contact angle the contact angle model and the specific formula used here are shown in section 2 7 of this article it is worth noting that the nano iron materials have a high iron atomic ratio with that of fe nps being 100 table s2 thus under rainfall conditions the cost effectiveness of nano iron materials could be significantly higher than that of the traditional fe fertilizers due to their high iron atomic ratio and strong adhesion resulting in less fertilization and low leaching loss for agricultural and environmental sustainability the economic feasibility of the nano fertilizers must be adequately addressed and proposed babu et al 2022 therefore here we hypothesise that the foliar applied nano iron fertilizers will be far superior to conventional iron fertilizers for reducing leaching loss and improving iron nutrition and cost effectiveness under rainfall conditions the anti leaching effect leaching resistance mechanism iron nutrition effect and cost effectiveness of nano iron materials are still unclear in the previous reports a single type of nano iron material was studied and its performance was not compared with different traditional iron fertilizers in this paper four typical nano iron materials fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps and two traditional iron fertilizers feso4 and fe edta were studied peanut is a typical crop prone to iron deficiency here we studied the effects of leaf applied nano iron materials and the traditional iron fertilizers on iron starved peanut plants grown under rainfall and non rainfall conditions using micro x ray fluorescence Œº xrf and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes we studied iron concentration and its distribution in plant tissues simultaneously the contact angle model is used to understand and explain the leaf adhesion capacity the anti leaching property and the anti leaching control mechanism of nano iron particles under rainfall conditions finally the cost effectiveness of nano iron fertilizers was compared with traditional iron fertilizers and the predicted price of nano iron fertilizers is estimated using the cost of feso4 as a reference the results provide important insights for the selection and improvement of anti leaching and iron nutrition properties and cost control of nano iron fertilizers for crop production 2 materials and methods 2 1 nano iron and other iron information and characterization all four nano iron materials used were in the form of dry powder fe nps size 50 nm purity 99 9 density 7 86 g ml fe3o4 nps size 20 nm purity

usa 2 2 plant cultivation and foliar iron fertilization details of peanut seeds used hydroponic plant cultivation method and the experimental design are given in the supplementary information the experiment included three treatments i complete nutrient application ct1 ii iron nutrient starvation ct2 foliar spray of 0 1 tween 80 as control and iii leaf application of 4 nano iron materials and 2 traditional iron fertilizers in iron starved plants ct3 ct8 all nano iron materials were suspended in aqueous 0 1 tween 80 and ultrasonicated for 30 min to achieve uniform nano material dispersion before foliar application the concentration of each iron fertilizer used was 300 mg l fe equivalent table s2 the fe concentration is based on the recommended amount of 0 1 1 feso4 ramzan et al 2020 avoiding the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of nano iron particles those iron fertilizers were sprayed on leaves once every 10 days for three times fig s3 and the volume of iron fertilizer applied in each successive sprays was 1 67 ml plant 3 33 ml plant and 5 ml plant respectively three successive foliar fertilizer applications were performed on 23 33 and 43 days after sowing the total fertilizer volume and the total fe equivalent dose were 10 ml plant and 3 mg plant respectively the application amount of each plant is determined until just before runoff according to the pre experiment the aerated nutrient solution was replaced every 10 days and plants were harvested after growing for 53 days 2 3 experiment with simulated rainfall conditions after 1 h of foliar fertilization 100 ml of water was sprayed onto the leaves to simulate rainfall the volume of simulated rainfall was ten times the fertilizer application 10 ml following the method described by li et al li et al 2020 in order to prevent the iron containing runoff water from entering the hydroponic nutrient solution an appropriate experimental system was designed and used for growing peanut plants fig s15 also in order get closer to crop field production rainfall condition the simulated rainfall was repeated every 5th day from the first day of foliar fertilizer application i e the 23rd 28th 33rd 38th 43rd and 48th day after sowing fig s3 peanut samples were harvested 53 days after sowing 2 4 plant sampling and analysis 2 4 1 plant sampling briefly in each treatment at least 18 plantlets were used plant samples were collected and rinsed initially with 0 1 m hcl and then with distilled water to remove the attached nano iron particles on the leaf surface the cleaning process for the plants involved three washes once with 0 1 m hcl and twice with distilled water this washing method has been proven effective as the fe content of water from the final wash was below 0 02 mg l icp oes analysis which is substantially lower than that of the test sample 1 mg l from each experiment a minimum of 4 seedlings were selected for peanut growth biomass and nutrient analysis icp oes and Œº xrf six seedlings were used for leaf spad and photosynthesis tests and the remaining ones were used for tissue sections and other analyses the main symptom of iron deficiency in peanuts is interveinal chlorosis of young leaves with symptoms not being obvious in old leaves as they were produced while seedlings were growing in iron containing medium therefore we tested the old leaves leaves of seedlings grown in 1 2 strength nutrient solution about 16 leaves and the young leaves leaves produced in seedlings grown in iron free nutrient solution and without cotyledons 2 4 2 plant analysis the methodology for biomass of roots and above ground part of peanut plants plant morphology spad leaf photosynthesis parameters leaf tissue enzyme activity measurements and leaf tissue structure analysis

nutrient digestion and analysis methods were tested by analyzing certified standard substances gbw10020 pr china of citrus leaves ‚Ö± Œº xrf the washed fresh leaves were placed in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized using a freeze dryer leaves were fixed on the sample holder by 3 m tape for measurement elemental distribution in leaves were determined by x ray fluorescence microscopy Œº xrf at the 4w1b beamline of beijing synchrotron radiation facility bsrf china the beam was focused to measure a spot size of 50 50 ¬µm2 by a kirkpatrick baez reflector and a poly capillary lens a leaf area of 4000 4000 ¬µm2 was selected for element distribution measurements two dimensional mapping was performed in step mode with a step size of 50 ¬µm at an incident energy of 15 kev the Œº xrf data were collected by a si li solid state detector with an exposure time of 1 s the Œº xrf maps were analyzed with pymca software to determine the element distribution 2 6 nano iron particle leaf adhesion and anti leaching test nano iron particle leaf adhesion and anti leaching test is divided into four stages namely a b c d fig 1 stage a is the plant culture period before foliar application in this stage plants were iron starved by growing them in iron free nutrient medium for 10 days the iron content of peanut leaves in stage a was taken as the background leaf iron content in stage b 10 ml of iron fertilizer prepared in 0 1 tween 80 or 0 1 tween 80 for control was sprayed on 6 peanut leaves in each plant in this stage the iron content of peanut leaves includes the background iron and the iron taken up from the sprayed iron fertilizer in stage c 100 ml h2o was sprayed on the leaves to simulate rainfall 1 h after foliar fertilizer spray stage b with water spray part of the iron fertilizer sprayed onto the leaves will be lost by leaching in the stage d leaves were separated and washed with 0 01 m hcl at this stage peanut leaves had their own background iron content and the nano iron taken up by the leaf tissue the leaves from all four states were digested by hno3 h2o2 and the iron concentration was determined by icp oes the effective foliar application amount the leaching amount and the effective adhesion amount of nano iron were calculated using the formulae given below 1 the effective foliar application amount b a 2 the leaching amount b c 3 the effective adhesion amount c d 2 7 contact angle model test the contact angle model refers to taking peanut leaves as solid and iron fertilizer preparation as liquid when the iron fertilizer solution is sprayed on the leaves

three parts the cost effectiveness the predicted fe fertilizer amount and the predicted fe fertilizer price the cost effectiveness quantifies and compares the nano iron fertilizers with the traditional iron fertilizers and the calculation steps are shown in table 1 s6 and s7 feso4 is the currently recommended and commonly used iron fertilizer in agriculture in our study it was found that foliar spraying of feso4 significantly increased leaf fe concentration and it was better than that obtained with root fertilization fig 4 this agronomic biofortification method will significantly enhanced the iron content of fruits which is consistent with most other research results zhang et al 2018 thus taking feso4 as a reference the predicted price of nano iron fertilizer forecast the affordable application cost in our estimate the predicted cost effectiveness is comparable to that of feso4 in nano agriculture in the future calculation of the predicted fe fertilizer amount and price is shown in supplementary information 2 9 statistical analysis of experimental data experiments were repeated with at least 3 duplicate samples all data were analysed by analysis of variance anova test using ibm spss19 0 software spss inc chicago il usa and presented as mean with the standard deviation mean sd one way anova was used to analyse the effect of iron fertilizer types on different dependent variables statistical significance p 0 05 of mean difference was determined using duncan s multiple range test 3 results 3 1 material characterization nano iron materials used were pristine and stable with a purity of 98 and they did not contain any other surface modification substances tem analysis showed that fe nps fe3o4 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps were granular and their mean size

respectively their ph values were similar to that of 0 1 tween 80 table s3 3 2 peanut plant growth and iron nutrition enrichment under simulated rainfall conditions foliar application of nano iron fertilizer alleviated iron deficiency and growth inhibition resulting in an increase above ground biomass of iron deficient peanut seedlings grown in iron free nutrient solution fig 3 compared with the non rainfall conditions the efficiency of nano iron fertilizers was hardly reduced indeed it has increased to a certain extent remarkably the iron nutrition performance of traditional iron fertilizers feso4 and fe edta under simulated rainfall conditions was clearly inferior to nano iron fertilizers fig 3 these results indicate that the anti leaching effect of traditional iron fertilizer is poorer than that of the nano iron fertilizer fe is an essential cofactor of photosystem complex and it is present in almost all components of the electron transport chain in the chloroplast briat et al 2015 significantly under simulated rainfall conditions foliar application of nano iron fertilizers further increased the iron content of peanut leaves compared with non rainfall conditions fig 4 a c b d also the iron content of leaves supplied with nano iron fertilizers was higher than those treated with traditional iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions detailed characterization of nano iron activity on leaf surface confirmed that it could enter the leaves and effectively increase iron content for example fe concentration and distribution in peanut leaves sprayed with fe3o4 nps were also significantly greater than those of iron deficient control plants ct2 fig s5 compared with ct1 and ct2 leaves treated with nano fertilizers were found to have similar nano iron particle aggregation in both leaf cells and chloroplasts by tem analysis fig s6 and eds was used to confirm higher fe signal in aggregation particles fig 4 g h i j these results suggest that iron nanoparticles can enter peanut leaf tissue and effectively increase tissue iron concentration 3 3 spad and photosynthesis in leaves iron deficiency inhibits chlorophyll synthesis causes leaf chlorosis and reduces the number of photosynthetic units per leaf area thereby reducing leaf photosynthetic capacity kabir et al 2016 spad is an indicator of chlorophyll content in leaves and it is used for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in plants under non rainfall and simulated rainfall conditions spad reading of old leaves of iron deficient and non deficient peanut plants were not different and they did not show iron deficiency symptoms as well fig s7 this is because the iron concentration of the old leaves was still high in all treatments fig 4 a c however under simulated rainfall conditions spad values and the number of young leaves sprayed with traditional iron fertilizers were significantly lower in plants than those received nano iron foliar spray fig 5 a c b d it also indicates that the effect of traditional iron fertilizer decreases significantly under rainy conditions clearly foliar sprayed nano iron particles were more effective than traditional iron fertilizers in alleviating iron chlorosis under simulated rainfall conditions by their increased spad values higher leaf iron concentration fig 5 c d and fig 4 b d net photosynthetic rate p n is related to leaf chlorophyll content and it directly affects plant growth under non rainfall and simulated rainfall conditions p n of old leaves did not change significantly due to the insignificant change in chlorophyll content in the old leaves fig s7 under non rainfall conditions chlorophyll content and p n of young leaves sprayed with traditional iron fertilizer increased significantly fig 5 d and f however an opposite trend was evident under simulated rainfall conditions fig 5 c and e moreover the number of young leaves also decreased significantly in plants supplied with traditional iron fertilizer compared with nano iron fertilizer under simulated rainfall conditions fig 5 a spad and p n readings were slightly increased by foliar applied nano iron fertilizer under rainfall condition fig 5 c e d f the stomatal guard cells were wrinkled and damaged by 300 mg l nano iron fertilizer under non rainfall conditions the stomatal guard cells of leaves in the control group ct1 were intact and open fig s9 we also found that the transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance g s of nano fertilizer applied leaves were decreased compared with ct1 under non rainfall conditions fig s8 these results indicate that the photosynthetic capacity of peanut leaves was significantly enhanced by foliar applied nano iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions 3 4 nano iron particle adhesion contact angle and anti leaching effect in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of the anti leaching effect and adhesion control mechanism of nano iron fertilizers different aspects of nano iron attachment and their anti leaching properties were studied we found that the effective foliar spraying amount of all iron fertilizers were high with plants treated with fe3o4 nps having the highest iron content which reached to 0 19 mg plant fig 6 a the leaching amount of traditional iron fertilizers was significantly higher than that of nano iron fertilizers fig 6 b the effective adhesion amounts of nano iron fertilizers were significantly higher than that of traditional iron fertilizers especially fe3o4 nps which amounts to 0 15 mg plant fig 6 c moreover these results were corroborated by the sem eds data of nano iron and traditional iron treated peanut leaves under simulated rainfall conditions there was no deposition of feso4 or fe edta on leaf surface sprayed with them after simulated rainfall however a large amount of iron fertilizer deposition was observed on the leaf surface sprayed with nano iron fertilizer even after simulated rainfall conditions suggesting the strong anti leaching and adhesion ability of nano iron particles fig 6 d k in the contact angle experiment Œ∏ of nano iron fertilizer was smaller than that of traditional iron fertilizer while wa of nano iron fertilizer was larger than that of traditional iron fertilizer fig 7 more notably the adhesion property of fe3o4 nps 53 5 mn m was nearly three times that of traditional iron fertilizer 18 3 mn m these results suggest that the wetting degree of leaf surface of nano iron particles was increased by lowering Œ∏ which in turn increased the effective adhesion of nano iron fertilizer on leaf surface resulting in greater anti leaching capacity 3 5 cost assessment of nano iron fertilizer and traditional iron fertilizer from the cost effectiveness analysis it is clear that foliar application is better than root application under non rainfall and simulated rainfall conditions this is because root fertilization requires nearly 30 times as much fertilizer as required for foliar fertilization resulting in a significant increase in cost ct1 fe edta table 1 under non rainfall conditions feso4 was the most cost effective compared with other iron fertilizers which is consistent with the current agricultural recommendation of iron fertilization niyigaba et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as the data show improvement of fe concentration per unit fertilization cost and improvement of above ground biomass growth per were 7729 and 2184 respectively table 1 and s7 although the application of nano iron fertilizers at low amounts leads to higher biomass production per unit amount of fertilizer the high selling cost of nano iron fertilizer reduced its cost effectiveness table s6 and s7 despite its high cost the high tissue iron concentration and biomass production obtained with nano iron fertilizer under simulated rainfall conditions make it cost competitive in the test condition table 1 and s7 thus we speculate that when the selling cost of nano iron materials is further reduced its cost effectiveness will exceed that of traditional iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions nano iron fertilizers were found to be highly effective in increasing iron content in iron deficient peanut leaves in particular the fe concentration of fe3o4 nps 1072 14 Œºg g in peanut leaves under rainfall conditions was comparable to that of feso4 1076 96 Œºg g under non rainfall conditions this is a very significant finding with considerable commercial application potential considering this result a very likely scenario is that the cost of nano iron fertiliser can be reduced even further with the ongoing advancements in nano particle production and its delivery technologies to the extent that enables a complete replacement of traditional iron fertilizers with nano iron fertilisers feso4 is currently the most economical effective and recommended traditional iron fertilizer zhang et al 2018 and it is also reflected in our cost effectiveness assessment therefore the predicted improvement of fe concentration in leaves improvement of fe concentration in young leaves with feso4 under non rainfall conditions is 277 and the predicted improvement of fe concentration per improvement of fe concentration per with feso4 under non rainfall conditions is 7729 are based on the response obtained with feso4 application table 1 from the predicted fertilizer application amount per plant under the simulated rainfall conditions a large increase in the amount of traditional iron fertilizer would be required to achieve the leaf iron enrichment effect obtained with feso4 under non rainfall conditions in contrast owing to their unique advantages the amount of nano iron fertilizers required to achieve the same result would be very minimal fig 8 a from our analysis based on the current selling price the predicted price of fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps would be 31 8 kg 36 0 kg 15 6 kg and 32 4 kg respectively fig 8 b the current selling price of fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps are 199 2 kg 139 0 kg 129 0 kg and 218 0 kg respectively fig 8 b it should be noted that the predicted price of fe3o4 nps will be very close to the actual selling price under simulated rainfall conditions these results indicate that fe3o4 nps have the greatest application potential to reverse peanut iron deficiency under simulated rainfall conditions 4 discussion 4 1 foliar applied nano iron fertilizers alleviated iron deficiency and improved growth in peanut most of the iron taken up is located in the chloroplasts of leaves so the foliar application of iron fertilizers remains a superior method for managing iron nutrition in crops in this study foliar applied traditional and nano iron fertilizers have significantly increased the biomass production and iron content of iron deficient peanut plants fig 3 and 4 more significantly this iron deficiency alleviation and growth response to foliar applied nano iron fertilizers were more pronounced under simulated rainfall conditions compared with non rainfall conditions this is likely due to superior iron nutrition improvement obtained with foliar applied nano iron fertilizers under rainfall conditions which was also reflected in leaf photosynthesis arising from the increased stomatal opening stomatal conductance and transpiration rate fig 5 s8 and s9 it is speculated that rainfall conditions might have facilitated the entry of iron nanoparticles attached to leaves for example hu et al hu et al 2017 found that in citrus maxima leaves foliar applied Œ≥ fe2o3 nps have increased the utilization and use efficiency of inorganic iron due to the strong adsorption ability and its gradual release following hourly water spray for 10 h in another study the application chi loaded alginate based nanogel chi algnp improved pesticide use efficiency and prolonged pesticide effect in nicotiana benthamiana in addition to supplying ca2 and mg2 which possibly promoted plant growth lv et al 2021 these results indicate that nanomaterials can reduce leaching loss and also continuously supply nutrient ions under rainfall conditions in addition we also found that foliar application of nano iron fertilizers not only increased iron nutrition but also effectively avoided antagonism between iron and other elements commonly occurring with root application cu mn zn content in old and young leaves of peanut have increased compared with ct1 fig s13 and s14 this is because root applied iron fertilizer can significantly increase the root iron content table s4 and s5 as the plant irt1 protein as an iron transporter found in the root epidermis is a broad spectrum metal ion transporter such as cu mn zn which alters the uptake of different metal ions in the presence of iron korshunova et al 1999 foliar spraying of iron fertilizers is an effective way to achieve multiple nutrient uptake and positive plant growth outcomes for example foliar spraying of iron fertilizer not only corrected the chlorosis of pea leaves but also promoted the iron content in pea grains under iron deficiency conditions thus achieving the dual effects of chlorosis correction and agronomic biofortification kabir et al 2016 ma et al ma et al 2020 applied cuo nanosheets and commercial cuo nanoparticles to soybean leaves at seedling stage which effectively regulated mineral nutrition and enhanced immunity to diseases in a similar study fe3o4 nps induced ros production enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity activated sa synthesis dependent signaling pathways and increased leaf iron concentration thereby achieving a dual effect of nutrient disease control cai et al 2020 in summary nanomaterials can be used as foliar fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture production especially in rainy climatic conditions the long distance iron transportation in plants is complicated it consists of co ordinated transport through the casparian strips xylem loading and unloading iron migration from xylem to phloem phloem loading and unloading and co ordinated transport to target sites accompanied by complex iron related oxidation reduction reactions and valency changes malhotra et al 2020 on the one hand fe3 is reduced to fe2 in the apoplast ph 5 5 by ferric chelate reductase oxidase fro light or ascorbic acid in order to transport through iron regulatory transporter irt1 into the cytoplasm or to other adjacent cells on the other hand fe3 can also directly enter the phloem via membrane bound yellow stripe like ysl transporter and binds to proteins for long distance phloem transport however during phloem unloading fe3 must be reduced to fe2 again and binds to nicotinamide na which enters the sink cell through either symplast or apoplast and finally reaches the target organelles malhotra et al 2020 thus the rate at which fe3 is converted into fe2 is the key factor that regulates the overall absorption of iron nutrients in plants the results of our experiments also showed that fe3o4 nps including fe2 and fe3 are better than other iron nanoparticles in alleviating the growth inhibition observed in iron deficient peanut plants fig 3 this finding suggests that the change of valence state of foliar applied iron could affect their efficacy alleviating iron deficiency although iron has a variety of valence states it has little bearing on its leaching adhesion amount as it is mainly related to the size surface roughness and contact angle of nano materials which will be discussed in the following part 4 2 effect of nano iron fertilizers on adhesion anti leaching effect and leaching resistance mechanism in peanut leaves under simulated rainy conditions the outer wax layer is an important part of the leaf and its plays an adaptive and defence role it reduces leaf water loss and improves resistance to cold insects and radiation however it seriously affects the absorption and utilization efficiency of foliar fertilizers and pesticides especially in high temperature and rainy conditions shah and bhattarai 2020 wang et al 2009 nano iron materials have strong anti leaching ability which can effectively reduce leaching loss in our study in contrast to traditional foliar iron fertilizers nano iron fertilizer utilization rate has greatly increased under simulated rainfall conditions fig 6 all nano iron materials are in the size range of 20 50 nm and are pristine without surface modification substances so size and surface roughness have little effect from the analysis of the contact angle it was concluded that nano iron materials have a smaller contact angle on peanut leaves which provides good wetting effect and excellent adhesion effect fig 7 the wetting effect of nano iron fertilizer on leaves is an important mechanism underpinning its anti leaching ability these properties clearly facilitated the attachment of much greater amounts of nano iron materials on leaves than that of the traditional iron fertilizers under rainfall conditions other nanomaterials also showed a similar effect for example different surface roughness engineering of nano silica support materials used for nitrogen fertilizer application in corn and peanut leaves reduced the contact angle of nano silica spheres which in turn increased their wetting effect and the adhesion ability in both corn and peanut leaves li et al 2020 a similar finding was also found that the contact angle of chi algnp was reduced from 61 to 39 as compared to the control group resulting in significant improvements in its adhesion to leaves lv et al 2021 from our results and the examples noted above it can be seen that the reduction in contact angle and increase in wettability and adhesion are important for leaching resistance mechanism of foliar applied nano fertilizer under rainfall conditions these results collectively indicate that nanomaterials have good leaching resistance under rainfall conditions and could play an important role in future agricultural applications 4 3 environmental biosafety and cost assessments of nano iron fertilizer use in agriculture environmental biosafety and cost assessments are necessary to determine the potential for application of nano iron fertilizers in agriculture the amount of foliar iron fertilizers 3 22 62 mg plant is only 1 30 of the root application ct1 631 58 mg plant and the amount of nano iron fertilizers 3 4 29 mg plant is 1 5 1 3 of the traditional iron fertilizer feso4 14 93 mg plant used at 300 mg l fe equivalent table s6 moreover the leaching amount of nano iron fertilizers mean 0 017 mg plant fertilized only once was only about 3 of the traditional iron fertilization mean 0 65 mg plant fertilize only once due to the strong adsorption capacity fig 6 and table s6 due to such desirable properties nano iron fertilizers are required in much smaller quantities which greatly reduced fertilizer loss and have much less impact on other biological organisms compared with traditional iron fertilizers in this study foliar application of nano iron fertilizers increased leaf iron concentration much greater than that obtained with the traditional iron fertilizers fig 4 causing fe toxicity induced oxidative stress in leaf tissues that received high concentration nano iron sprays used in this study fig s11 and s12 several studies have shown that the accumulation of nanoparticles in plants at supra optimal levels can induce the production of reactive oxygen species ros which cause oxidative damages in affected tissues for example hu et al hu et al 2017 working with Œ≥ fe2o3 nps found no oxidative stress in citrus maxima leaves when used at low amounts but it did occur when plants were sprayed with 100 mg l Œ≥ fe2o3 in another report chen et al chen et al 2019 observed damaged leaf photosystem ii and oxidative stress following the entry of large amounts graphene in the leaves these reports and our results suggest the need for optimising the dosage of foliar applied nps to maximise the desirable outcomes of this technology in biological systems antioxidant metabolites namely glutathione gsh and nadph plays a key role in h2o2 detoxification through glutathione ascorbic acid cycle for example ram√≠rez et al ramirez et al 2013 showed that gsh and ascorbic acid asa supplementation protected arabidopsis from the adverse effects of iron deficiency and their leaves remained green in another study asa content of arabidopsis leaves was reduced significantly after fe starvation for 52 h nam et al 2021 in this study we also found that foliar application of nano iron did not significantly increase antioxidant metabolites pod and cat to mitigate the oxidative damage it caused fig s12 thus reducing the oxidative stress induced by nano materials must also be considered while improving their properties during product development cost is a key factor for all agricultural product innovations to be successful commercially although the amount required and leaching loss of nano iron fertilizers were low in this study it is not cost effective as their high cost table s6 in this context three scenarios can be considered firstly the cost of iron nanoparticles would be reduced due to the ongoing improvements in product quality scale of production and application technologies in this study we speculate that when the cost of fe3o4 nps comes down to 36 kg its cost effectiveness will become comparable to that of the traditional iron fertilizers fig 8 we believe that the cost of fe3o4 nps will be the same or lower than the predicted price secondly the amount of nano iron needed for effective management of iron nutrition will be further reduced with the current developments in application technology and nano iron particle designs especially with the modifications for increasing its uptake and metabolic efficiency finally governments or environmental organisations may provide assistance to subsidize the cost in order to improve the overall environmental outcomes for agriculture we believe that nano fertilizers will play an important role in sustainable and green agriculture development 5 conclusion nano iron fertilizers are expected to reduce the cost and iron fertilizer leaching and enhance iron nutrition management in peanut under rainfall and non rainfall production conditions the results showed that the iron concentration in leaves and the anti leaching ability of nano iron fertilizers have increased significantly and greatly improved iron fertilizer use efficiency compared with traditional iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions the anti leaching property of nano iron appears to be due to its decreased contact angle resulting in increased wetting and adhesion though it is currently not cost effective the nano iron fertilizers will become cost competitive with the on going developments and innovations in product and production technology and nano particle application systems taken together these results indicate a bright prospect for nano iron fertilizers in sustainable and green agricultural development credit authorship

8868,the high loss of foliar applied fertilizers in the wet season and other extreme weather conditions reduces fertilizer use efficiency remarkably low emerging nano iron materials owing to their highly desirable properties such as exceptionally small size particle surface and interface attributes strong adhesion and high iron ratio could overcome the limitations of traditional fertilizers however their anti leaching property leaching resistance mechanism iron nutrition enrichment capacity and cost effectiveness remain unclear in this study four nano iron materials fe nanoparticles fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps were compared with traditional iron fertilizers feso4 and fe edta the results showed that the efficiency of traditional iron fertilizers decreased greatly under simulated rainfall conditions due to their poor leaching resistance in contrast nano iron fertilizers performed exceptionally well under simulated rainfall conditions with significant increase in leaf iron concentration photosynthesis and growth of peanut this was mainly attributed to their decreased contact angle increased wetting capacity and increased adhesion on plant surface which collectively decreased fertilizer leaching remarkably the adhesion capacity of fe3o4 nps 53 5 mn m was nearly three times that of traditional iron fertilizer 18 3 mn m therefore only a small amount of fe3o4 nps 4 mg plant was needed relative to traditional iron fertilizers feso4 59 mg plant to achieve comparable high leaf fe concentration 1076 96 Œºg g under rainfall conditions cost evaluation suggests that the cost competitiveness of fe3o4 nps will become comparable to that of feso4 when its price comes down from the current cost of 139 kg to 36 kg the cost of feso4 which is likely considering the pace of nano material technology development together these results demonstrate the remarkable potential of nano iron fertilizers in mitigating the escalating fertilizer cost and improving the environmental outcomes of peanut as well as potentially other crops grown in wet season graphical abstract ga1 keywords nano iron fertilizer peanut anti leaching iron nutrition cost

insecurity in many geographical regions particularly in low income countries globally bonilla cedrez et al 2021 ciceri and allanore 2019 hossain and singh 2000 this is further exacerbated by the extreme environmental externalities linked to climate change shortage of fertilizers and the rise in fertilizer cost jalilov et al 2022 according to the wind database the current costs of urea mono ammonium phosphate di ammonium phosphate and potassium fertilizers are reported to be 411 505 558 and 694 ton http www wind com accessed on 14 april 2022 which are 57 3 77 3 60 1 and 148 2 respectively greater than their price in 2021 developing a new generation of affordable fertilizers with desirable environmental features such as low application rate and leaching loss is critical for realising green sustainable agriculture food self sufficiency and ultimately the united nation s sustainable development goals ciceri and allanore 2019 noman et al 2022 pauw 2022 application of iron fertilizer is a common and effective method to remedy iron deficiency in plants and iron biofortification for humans zhang et al 2018 globally more than one third of the land is covered by high ph alkaline or calcareous soils which are not conducive to agricultural use sabet and mortazaeinezhad 2018 taherian et al 2019 in the soil soil applied iron fertilizers are easily fixed or oxidized into insoluble iron mineral forms which are unavailable to plants and trace elements in ultramafic soils have an impact on human health guerinot and yi 1994 vithanage et al 2019 based on the poor efficacy of soil applied iron fertilizers foliar application is more commonly practiced in crop production fageria et al 2009 malhotra et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 however foliar application has several challenges such as large leaching loss low nutrient availability relatively high cost of application and short duration of fertilizer effect especially in high temperature and rainy environment fageria et al 2009 ruiz navarro et al 2019 hence the effectiveness of traditional iron fertilizers in supplementing iron is still unsatisfactory therefore taking the advantages of nanotechnology to design and develop a new generation long acting foliar micronutrient fertilizers to overcome the current challenges of foliar fertilization would be a very desirable outcome hu et al 2017 li et al 2016 noman et al 2022 nanotechnology is an important driver of the current agricultural technology revolution enabling more sustainable efficient and resilient agricultural systems while promoting food security lowry et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 rai et al 2018 in recent years use of nanomaterials for agricultural applications has gained momentum and they are considered to have great potential in agricultural production kah et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2017 wang et al 2020 previous studies have shown that iron nanoparticles nps can promote plant growth under both stress and non stress conditions cui et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 at present the nano iron materials applied to plants are mainly oxidized iron nanoparticles such as fe nps fe2o3 nps and fe3o4 nps xu et al 2022 in an earlier study ghafariyan and co workers ghafariyan et al 2013 reported a significant increase in leaf chlorophyll content in soybean treated with 30 60 mg l fe2o3 nps in hydroponic conditions also root applied fe2o3 nps increased root length plant height biomass and spad of peanuts rui et al 2016 and Œ± fe2o3 Œ≥ fe2o3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles entered root cells in nanoforms through diapirism and endocytosis li et al 2018 further researchers have found that iron nanoparticles can promote plant growth by regulating the growth and function of commensal microbes for example foliar spraying of iron oxide nanomaterials promoted nitrogen fixation crop yield and seed nutritional quality of soybean through enhanced root nodulation cao et al 2022 also manganese ferrite nanomaterials enhanced the activity of reactive oxygen species ros and bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens nodulation in soybean ma et al 2022 nanomaterials have strong adhesion on leaves which greatly reduces leaching loss for example cunp composite alginate nanogel cunp algnp ctac with strong leaf surface adsorption showed good antibacterial effect ma et al 2022 similarly leaf applied of Œ≥ fe2o3 nps showed strong adsorption and low nutrient loss in citrus hu et al 2017 in the previous studies contact angle was studied to visualize the adhesion state of foliar fertilizers on leaves leaching resistance of nanomaterials was found to be strongly related to their contact angle li et al 2020 wen et al 2022 the adhesion of nps on leaf surface can be calculated by determining the solution surface tension and contact angle the contact angle model and the specific formula used here are shown in section 2 7 of this article it is worth noting that the nano iron materials have a high iron atomic ratio with that of fe nps being 100 table s2 thus under rainfall conditions the cost effectiveness of nano iron materials could be significantly higher than that of the traditional fe fertilizers due to their high iron atomic ratio and strong adhesion resulting in less fertilization and low leaching loss for agricultural and environmental sustainability the economic feasibility of the nano fertilizers must be adequately addressed and proposed babu et al 2022 therefore here we hypothesise that the foliar applied nano iron fertilizers will be far superior to conventional iron fertilizers for reducing leaching loss and improving iron nutrition and cost effectiveness under rainfall conditions the anti leaching effect leaching resistance mechanism iron nutrition effect and cost effectiveness of nano iron materials are still unclear in the previous reports a single type of nano iron material was studied and its performance was not compared with different traditional iron fertilizers in this paper four typical nano iron materials fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps and two traditional iron fertilizers feso4 and fe edta were studied peanut is a typical crop prone to iron deficiency here we studied the effects of leaf applied nano iron materials and the traditional iron fertilizers on iron starved peanut plants grown under rainfall and non rainfall conditions using micro x ray fluorescence Œº xrf and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes we studied iron concentration and its distribution in plant tissues simultaneously the contact angle model is used to understand and explain the leaf adhesion capacity the anti leaching property and the anti leaching control mechanism of nano iron particles under rainfall conditions finally the cost effectiveness of nano iron fertilizers was compared with traditional iron fertilizers and the predicted price of nano iron fertilizers is estimated using the cost of feso4 as a reference the results provide important insights for the selection and improvement of anti leaching and iron nutrition properties and cost control of nano iron fertilizers for crop production 2 materials and methods 2 1

traditional iron fertilizers in iron starved plants ct3 ct8 all nano iron materials were suspended in aqueous 0 1 tween 80 and ultrasonicated for 30 min to achieve uniform nano material dispersion before foliar application the concentration of each iron fertilizer used was 300 mg l fe equivalent table s2 the fe concentration is based on the recommended amount of 0 1 1 feso4 ramzan et al 2020 avoiding the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of nano iron particles those iron fertilizers were sprayed on leaves once every 10 days for three times fig s3 and the volume of iron fertilizer applied in each successive sprays was 1 67 ml plant 3 33 ml plant and 5 ml plant respectively three successive foliar fertilizer applications were performed on 23 33 and 43 days after sowing the total fertilizer volume and the total fe equivalent dose were 10 ml plant and 3 mg plant respectively the application amount of each plant is determined until just before runoff according to the pre experiment the aerated nutrient solution was replaced every 10 days and plants were harvested after growing for 53 days 2 3 experiment with simulated rainfall conditions after 1 h of foliar fertilization 100 ml of water was sprayed onto the leaves to simulate rainfall the volume of simulated rainfall was ten times the fertilizer application 10 ml following the method described by li et al li et al 2020 in order to prevent the iron containing runoff water from entering the hydroponic nutrient solution an appropriate experimental system was designed and used for growing peanut plants fig s15 also in order get closer to crop field production rainfall condition the simulated rainfall was repeated every 5th day from the first day of foliar fertilizer application i e the 23rd 28th 33rd 38th 43rd and 48th day after sowing fig s3 peanut samples were harvested 53 days after sowing 2 4 plant sampling and analysis 2 4 1 plant sampling briefly in each treatment at least 18 plantlets were used plant samples were collected and rinsed initially with 0 1 m hcl and then with distilled water to remove the attached nano iron particles on the leaf surface the cleaning process for the plants involved three washes once with 0 1 m hcl and twice with distilled water this washing method has been proven effective as the fe content of water from the final wash was below 0 02 mg l icp oes analysis which is substantially lower than that of the test sample 1 mg l from each experiment a minimum of 4 seedlings were selected for peanut growth biomass and nutrient analysis icp oes and Œº xrf six seedlings were used for leaf spad and photosynthesis tests and the remaining ones were used for tissue sections and other analyses the main symptom of iron deficiency in peanuts is interveinal chlorosis of young leaves with symptoms not being obvious in old leaves as they were produced while seedlings were growing in iron containing medium therefore we tested the old leaves leaves of seedlings grown in 1 2 strength nutrient solution about 16 leaves and the young leaves leaves produced in seedlings grown in iron free nutrient solution and without cotyledons 2 4 2 plant analysis the

anti leaching test nano iron particle leaf adhesion and anti leaching test is divided into four stages namely a b c d fig 1 stage a is the plant culture period before foliar application in this stage plants were iron starved by growing them in iron free nutrient medium for 10 days the iron content of peanut leaves in stage a was taken as the background leaf iron content in stage b 10 ml of iron fertilizer prepared in 0 1 tween 80 or 0 1 tween 80 for control was sprayed on 6 peanut leaves in each plant in this stage the iron content of peanut leaves includes the background iron and the iron taken up from the sprayed iron fertilizer in stage c 100 ml h2o was sprayed on the leaves to simulate rainfall 1 h after foliar fertilizer spray stage b with water spray part of the iron fertilizer sprayed onto the leaves will be lost by leaching in the stage d leaves were separated and washed with 0 01 m hcl at this stage peanut leaves had their own background iron content and the nano iron taken up by the leaf tissue the leaves from all four states were digested by hno3 h2o2 and the iron concentration was determined by icp oes the effective foliar application amount the leaching amount and the effective adhesion amount of nano iron were calculated using the formulae given below 1 the effective foliar application amount b a 2 the leaching amount b c 3 the effective adhesion amount c d 2 7 contact angle model test the contact angle model refers to taking peanut leaves as solid and iron fertilizer preparation as liquid when the iron fertilizer solution is sprayed on the leaves three interfacial tensions i e solid gas liquid gas and solid liquid are formed fig 2 the surface free energies solid gas solid liquid and liquid gas interfaces are expressed as Œ≥sg Œ≥sl and Œ≥lg respectively the angle from the solid interface through the liquid interior to the gas liquid interface is called the contact angle Œ∏ the relationship between Œ≥sg Œ≥sl Œ≥lg and Œ∏ conforms to the wetting equation young equation shown in eq 4 li et al 2020 lv et al 2021 the contact angle Œ∏ is directly related to the wetting degree of the solution the smaller the Œ∏ the better the degree of wetting and easier to attach to the leaves this formula is shown in eq 4 4 Œ≥ sg Œ≥ sl Œ≥ lg cos Œ∏ the formula for the adhesion work wa is shown in eq 5 which can be calculated by testing Œ≥lg solution surface tension and cosŒ∏ contact angle Œ∏ and Œ≥lg were determined by the contact angle measurement pz 200 sd pinzhi chuangsi precision instrument co ltd beijing china it quantifies the adhesion ability of the solution on the solid surface 5 w a Œ≥ sg Œ≥ lg Œ≥ sl Œ≥ lg 1 cos Œ∏ 2 8 cost assessment of nano iron and traditional iron fertilizers the cost assessment mainly consists of three parts the cost effectiveness the predicted fe fertilizer amount and the predicted fe fertilizer price the cost effectiveness quantifies and compares the nano iron fertilizers with the traditional iron fertilizers and the calculation steps are shown in table 1 s6 and s7 feso4 is the currently recommended and commonly used iron fertilizer in agriculture in our study it was found that foliar spraying of feso4 significantly increased leaf fe concentration and it was better than that obtained with root fertilization fig 4 this agronomic biofortification method will significantly enhanced the iron content of fruits which is consistent with most other research results zhang et al 2018 thus taking feso4 as a reference the predicted price of nano iron fertilizer forecast the affordable application cost in our estimate the predicted cost effectiveness is comparable to that of feso4 in nano agriculture in the future calculation of the predicted fe fertilizer amount and price is shown in supplementary information 2 9 statistical analysis of experimental data experiments were repeated with at least 3 duplicate samples all data were analysed by analysis of variance anova test using ibm spss19 0 software spss inc chicago il usa and presented as mean with the standard deviation mean sd one way anova was used to analyse the effect of iron fertilizer types on different dependent variables statistical significance p 0 05 of mean difference was determined using duncan s multiple range test 3 results 3 1 material characterization nano iron materials used were pristine and stable with a purity of 98 and they did not contain any other surface modification substances tem analysis showed that fe nps fe3o4 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps were granular and their mean size were 52 98 nm 17 17 nm and 15 43 nm respectively Œ± fe2o3 nps was needle shaped and it s mean size was 4 79 thickness 33 36 length nm fig s1 a2 d2 eds results were shown in fig s1 a3 d3 fe nps had a fe atom ratio of 92 32 and an o atom ratio of 7 68 fe3o4 nps had a fe atom ratio of 37 29 and an o atom ratio of 62 71 Œ± fe2o3 nps had a fe atom ratio of 31 99 and an o atom ratio of 68 01 Œ≥ fe2o3 nps had a fe atom ratio of 36 15 and an o atom ratio of 68 35 xrd results were in agreement with the corresponding crystal structure of iron materials as shown in fig s1 a4 d4 the obvious peaks for fe nps at 2Œ∏ 52 05 and 77 45 were consistent with iron syn pdf 06 0696 zhou et al 2015 the obvious peaks for fe3o4 nps at 2Œ∏ 21 38 35 27 42 64 51 77 63 27 67 64 and 74 62 were consistent with magnetite syn pdf 19 0629 koli et al 2019 the obvious peaks for Œ± fe2o3 nps at 2Œ∏ 28 14 38 55 41 64 47 84 58 01 63 73 67 89 74 01 and 75 96 were consistent with hematite syn pdf 33 0664 srivastava kumar 2020 the obvious peaks for Œ≥ fe2o3 nps at 2Œ∏ 28 06 38 55 41 61 47 80 50 88 58 11 63 73 74 05 and 76 02 were consistent with hematite syn pdf 33 0664 kumar et al 2021 hydrated particle size of fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps were 611 180 nm 1472 166 nm 237 11 nm and 1222 885 nm respectively and their zeta potential were 16 82 2 82 mv 10 34 4 12 mv 12 31 3 88 mv and 13 05 5 00 mv respectively their ph values were similar to that of 0 1 tween 80 table s3 3 2 peanut plant growth and iron nutrition enrichment under simulated rainfall conditions foliar application of nano iron fertilizer alleviated iron deficiency and growth inhibition resulting in an increase above ground biomass of iron deficient peanut seedlings grown in iron free nutrient solution fig 3 compared with the non rainfall conditions the efficiency of nano iron fertilizers was hardly reduced indeed it has increased to a certain extent remarkably the iron nutrition performance of traditional iron fertilizers feso4 and fe edta under simulated rainfall conditions was clearly inferior to nano iron fertilizers fig 3 these results indicate that the anti leaching effect of traditional iron fertilizer is poorer than that of the nano iron fertilizer fe is an essential cofactor of photosystem complex and it is present in almost all components of the electron transport chain in the chloroplast briat et al 2015 significantly under simulated rainfall conditions foliar application of nano iron fertilizers further increased the iron content of peanut leaves compared with non rainfall conditions fig 4 a c b d also the iron content of leaves supplied with nano iron fertilizers was higher than those treated with traditional iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions detailed characterization of nano iron activity on leaf surface confirmed that it could enter the leaves and effectively increase iron content for example fe concentration and distribution in peanut leaves sprayed with fe3o4 nps were also significantly greater than those of iron deficient control plants ct2 fig s5 compared with ct1 and ct2 leaves treated with nano fertilizers were found to have similar nano iron particle aggregation in both leaf cells and chloroplasts by tem analysis fig s6 and eds was used to confirm higher fe signal in aggregation particles fig 4 g h i j these results suggest that iron nanoparticles can enter peanut leaf tissue and effectively increase tissue iron concentration 3 3 spad and photosynthesis in leaves iron deficiency inhibits chlorophyll synthesis causes leaf chlorosis and reduces the number of photosynthetic units per leaf area thereby reducing leaf photosynthetic capacity kabir et al 2016 spad is an indicator of chlorophyll content in leaves and it is used for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in plants under non rainfall and simulated rainfall conditions spad reading of old leaves of iron deficient and non deficient peanut plants were not different and they did not show iron deficiency symptoms as well fig s7 this is because the iron concentration of the old leaves was still high in all treatments fig 4 a c however under simulated rainfall conditions spad values and the number of young leaves sprayed with traditional iron fertilizers were significantly lower in plants than those received nano iron foliar spray fig 5 a c b d it also indicates that the effect of traditional iron fertilizer decreases significantly under rainy conditions clearly foliar sprayed nano iron particles were more effective than traditional iron fertilizers in alleviating iron chlorosis under simulated rainfall conditions by their increased spad values higher leaf iron concentration fig 5 c d and fig 4 b d net photosynthetic rate p n is related to leaf chlorophyll content and it directly affects plant growth under non rainfall and simulated rainfall conditions p n of old leaves did not change significantly due to the insignificant change in chlorophyll content in the old leaves fig s7 under non rainfall conditions chlorophyll content and p n of young leaves sprayed with traditional iron fertilizer increased significantly fig 5 d and f however an opposite trend was evident under simulated rainfall conditions fig 5 c and e moreover the number of young leaves also decreased significantly in plants supplied with traditional iron fertilizer compared with nano iron fertilizer under simulated rainfall conditions fig 5 a spad and p n readings were slightly increased by foliar applied nano iron fertilizer under rainfall condition fig 5 c e d f the stomatal guard cells were wrinkled and damaged by 300 mg l nano iron fertilizer under non rainfall conditions the stomatal guard cells of leaves in the control group ct1 were intact and open fig s9 we also found that the transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance g s of nano fertilizer applied leaves were decreased compared with ct1 under non rainfall conditions fig s8 these results indicate that the photosynthetic capacity of peanut leaves was significantly enhanced by foliar applied nano iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions 3 4 nano iron particle adhesion contact angle and anti leaching effect in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of the anti leaching effect and adhesion control mechanism of nano iron fertilizers different aspects of nano iron attachment and their anti leaching properties were studied we found that the effective foliar spraying amount of all iron fertilizers were high with plants treated with fe3o4 nps having the highest iron content which reached to 0 19 mg plant fig 6 a the leaching amount of traditional iron fertilizers was significantly higher than that of nano iron fertilizers fig 6 b the effective adhesion amounts of nano iron fertilizers were significantly higher than that of traditional iron fertilizers especially fe3o4 nps which amounts to 0 15 mg plant fig 6 c moreover these results were corroborated by the sem eds data of nano iron and traditional iron treated peanut leaves under simulated rainfall conditions there was no deposition of feso4 or fe edta on leaf surface sprayed with them after simulated rainfall however a large amount of iron fertilizer deposition was observed on the leaf surface sprayed with nano iron fertilizer even after simulated rainfall conditions suggesting the strong anti leaching and adhesion ability of nano iron particles fig 6 d k in the contact angle experiment Œ∏ of nano iron fertilizer was smaller than that of traditional iron fertilizer while wa of nano iron fertilizer was larger than that of traditional iron fertilizer fig 7 more notably the adhesion property of fe3o4 nps 53 5 mn m was nearly three times that of traditional iron fertilizer 18 3 mn m these results suggest that the wetting degree of leaf surface of nano iron particles was increased by lowering Œ∏ which in turn increased the effective adhesion of nano iron fertilizer on leaf surface resulting in greater anti leaching capacity 3 5 cost assessment of nano iron fertilizer and traditional iron fertilizer from the cost effectiveness analysis it is clear that foliar application is better than root application under non rainfall and simulated rainfall conditions this is because root fertilization requires nearly 30 times as much fertilizer as required for foliar fertilization resulting in a significant increase in cost ct1 fe edta table 1 under non rainfall conditions feso4 was the most cost effective compared with other iron fertilizers which is consistent with the current agricultural recommendation of iron fertilization niyigaba et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as the data show improvement of fe concentration per unit fertilization cost and improvement of above ground biomass growth per were 7729 and 2184 respectively table 1 and s7 although the application of nano iron fertilizers at low amounts leads to higher biomass production per unit amount of fertilizer the high selling cost of nano iron fertilizer reduced its cost effectiveness table s6 and s7 despite its high cost the high tissue iron concentration and biomass production obtained with nano iron fertilizer under simulated rainfall conditions make it cost competitive in the test condition table 1 and s7 thus we speculate that when the selling cost of nano iron materials is further reduced its cost effectiveness will exceed that of traditional iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions nano iron fertilizers were found to be highly effective in increasing iron content in iron deficient peanut leaves in particular the fe concentration of fe3o4 nps 1072 14 Œºg g in peanut leaves under rainfall conditions was comparable to that of feso4 1076 96 Œºg g under non rainfall conditions this is a very significant finding with considerable commercial application potential considering this result a very likely scenario is that the cost of nano iron fertiliser can be reduced even further with the ongoing advancements in nano particle production and its delivery technologies to the extent that enables a complete replacement of traditional iron fertilizers with nano iron fertilisers feso4 is currently the most economical effective and recommended traditional iron fertilizer zhang et al 2018 and it is also reflected in our cost effectiveness assessment therefore the predicted improvement of fe concentration in leaves improvement of fe concentration in young leaves with feso4 under non rainfall conditions is 277 and the predicted improvement of fe concentration per improvement of fe concentration per with feso4 under non rainfall conditions is 7729 are based on the response obtained with feso4 application table 1 from the predicted fertilizer application amount per plant under the simulated rainfall conditions a large increase in the amount of traditional iron fertilizer would be required to achieve the leaf iron enrichment effect obtained with feso4 under non rainfall conditions in contrast owing to their unique advantages the amount of nano iron fertilizers required to achieve the same result would be very minimal fig 8 a from our analysis based on the current selling price the predicted price of fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps would be 31 8 kg 36 0 kg 15 6 kg and 32 4 kg respectively fig 8 b the current selling price of fe nps fe3o4 nps Œ± fe2o3 nps and Œ≥ fe2o3 nps are 199 2 kg 139 0 kg 129 0 kg and 218 0 kg respectively fig 8 b it should be noted that the predicted price of fe3o4 nps will be very close to the actual selling price under simulated rainfall conditions these results indicate that fe3o4 nps have the greatest application potential to reverse peanut iron deficiency under simulated rainfall conditions 4 discussion 4 1 foliar applied nano iron fertilizers alleviated iron deficiency and improved growth in peanut most of the iron taken up is located in the chloroplasts of leaves so the foliar application of iron fertilizers remains a superior method for managing iron nutrition in crops in this study foliar applied traditional and nano iron fertilizers have significantly increased the biomass production and iron content of iron deficient peanut plants fig 3 and 4 more significantly this iron deficiency alleviation and growth response to foliar applied nano iron fertilizers were more pronounced under simulated rainfall conditions compared with non rainfall conditions this is likely due to superior iron nutrition improvement obtained with foliar applied nano iron fertilizers under rainfall conditions which was also reflected in leaf photosynthesis arising from the increased stomatal opening stomatal conductance and transpiration rate fig 5 s8 and s9 it is speculated that rainfall conditions might have facilitated the entry of iron nanoparticles attached to leaves for example hu et al hu et al 2017 found that in citrus maxima leaves foliar applied Œ≥ fe2o3 nps have increased the utilization and use efficiency of inorganic iron due to the strong adsorption ability and its gradual release following hourly water spray for 10 h in another study the application chi loaded alginate based nanogel chi algnp improved pesticide use efficiency and prolonged pesticide effect in nicotiana benthamiana in addition to supplying ca2 and mg2 which possibly promoted plant growth lv et al 2021 these results indicate that nanomaterials can reduce leaching loss and also continuously supply nutrient ions under rainfall conditions in addition we also found that foliar application of nano iron fertilizers not only increased iron nutrition but also effectively avoided antagonism between iron and other elements commonly occurring with root application cu mn zn content in old and young leaves of peanut have increased compared with ct1 fig s13 and s14 this is because root applied iron fertilizer can significantly increase the root iron content table s4 and s5 as the plant irt1 protein as an iron transporter found in the root epidermis is a broad spectrum metal ion transporter such as cu mn zn which alters the uptake of different metal ions in the presence of iron korshunova et al 1999 foliar spraying of iron fertilizers is an effective way to achieve multiple nutrient uptake and positive plant growth outcomes for example foliar spraying of iron fertilizer not only corrected the chlorosis of pea leaves but also promoted the iron content in pea grains under iron deficiency conditions thus achieving the dual effects of chlorosis correction and agronomic biofortification kabir et al 2016 ma et al ma et al 2020 applied cuo nanosheets and commercial cuo nanoparticles to soybean leaves at seedling stage which effectively regulated mineral nutrition and enhanced immunity to diseases in a similar study fe3o4 nps induced ros production enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity activated sa synthesis dependent signaling pathways and increased leaf iron concentration thereby achieving a dual effect of nutrient disease control cai et al 2020 in summary nanomaterials can be used as foliar fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture production especially in rainy climatic conditions the long distance iron transportation in plants is complicated it consists of co ordinated transport through the casparian strips xylem loading and unloading iron migration from xylem to phloem phloem loading and unloading and co ordinated transport to target sites accompanied by complex iron related oxidation reduction reactions and valency changes malhotra et al 2020 on the one hand fe3 is reduced to fe2 in the apoplast ph 5 5 by ferric chelate reductase oxidase fro light or ascorbic acid in order to transport through iron regulatory transporter irt1 into the cytoplasm or to other adjacent cells on the other hand fe3 can also directly enter the phloem via membrane bound yellow stripe like ysl transporter and binds to proteins for long distance phloem transport however during phloem unloading fe3 must be reduced to fe2 again and binds to nicotinamide na which enters the sink cell through either symplast or apoplast and finally reaches the target organelles malhotra et al 2020 thus the rate at which fe3 is converted into fe2 is the key factor that regulates the overall absorption of iron nutrients in plants the results of our experiments also showed that fe3o4 nps including fe2 and fe3 are better than other iron nanoparticles in alleviating the growth inhibition observed in iron deficient peanut plants fig 3 this finding suggests that the change of valence state of foliar applied iron could affect their efficacy alleviating iron deficiency although iron has a variety of valence states it has little bearing on its leaching adhesion amount as it is mainly related to the size surface roughness and contact angle of nano materials which will be discussed in the following part 4 2 effect of nano iron fertilizers on adhesion anti leaching effect and leaching resistance mechanism in peanut leaves under simulated rainy conditions the outer wax layer is an important part of the leaf and its plays an adaptive and defence role it reduces leaf water loss and improves resistance to cold insects and radiation however it seriously affects the absorption and utilization efficiency of foliar fertilizers and pesticides especially in high temperature and rainy conditions shah and bhattarai 2020 wang et al 2009 nano iron materials have strong anti leaching ability which can effectively reduce leaching loss in our study in contrast to traditional foliar iron fertilizers nano iron fertilizer utilization rate has greatly increased under simulated rainfall conditions fig 6 all nano iron materials are in the size range of 20 50 nm and are pristine without surface modification substances so size and surface roughness have little effect from the analysis of the contact angle it was concluded that nano iron materials have a smaller contact angle on peanut leaves which provides good wetting effect and excellent adhesion effect fig 7 the wetting effect of nano iron fertilizer on leaves is an important mechanism underpinning its anti leaching ability these properties clearly facilitated the attachment of much greater amounts of nano iron materials on leaves than that of the traditional iron fertilizers under rainfall conditions other nanomaterials also showed a similar effect for example different surface roughness engineering of nano silica support materials used for nitrogen fertilizer application in corn and peanut leaves reduced the contact angle of nano silica spheres which in turn increased their wetting effect and the adhesion ability in both corn and peanut leaves li et al 2020 a similar finding was also found that the contact angle of chi algnp was reduced from 61 to 39 as compared to the control group resulting in significant improvements in its adhesion to leaves lv et al 2021 from our results and the examples noted above it can be seen that the reduction in contact angle and increase in wettability and adhesion are important for leaching resistance mechanism of foliar applied nano fertilizer under rainfall conditions these results collectively indicate that nanomaterials have good leaching resistance under rainfall conditions and could play an important role in future agricultural applications 4 3 environmental biosafety and cost assessments of nano iron fertilizer use in agriculture environmental biosafety and cost assessments are necessary to determine the potential for application of nano iron fertilizers in agriculture the amount of foliar iron fertilizers 3 22 62 mg plant is only 1 30 of the root application ct1 631 58 mg plant and the amount of nano iron fertilizers 3 4 29 mg plant is 1 5 1 3 of the traditional iron fertilizer feso4 14 93 mg plant used at 300 mg l fe equivalent table s6 moreover the leaching amount of nano iron fertilizers mean 0 017 mg plant fertilized only once was only about 3 of the traditional iron fertilization mean 0 65 mg plant fertilize only once due to the strong adsorption capacity fig 6 and table s6 due to such desirable properties nano iron fertilizers are required in much smaller quantities which greatly reduced fertilizer loss and have much less impact on other biological organisms compared with traditional iron fertilizers in this study foliar application of nano iron fertilizers increased leaf iron concentration much greater than that obtained with the traditional iron fertilizers fig 4 causing fe toxicity induced oxidative stress in leaf tissues that received high concentration nano iron sprays used in this study fig s11 and s12 several studies have shown that the accumulation of nanoparticles in plants at supra optimal levels can induce the production of reactive oxygen species ros which cause oxidative damages in affected tissues for example hu et al hu et al 2017 working with Œ≥ fe2o3 nps found no oxidative stress in citrus maxima leaves when used at low amounts but it did occur when plants were sprayed with 100 mg l Œ≥ fe2o3 in another report chen et al chen et al 2019 observed damaged leaf photosystem ii and oxidative stress following the entry of large amounts graphene in the leaves these reports and our results suggest the need for optimising the dosage of foliar applied nps to maximise the desirable outcomes of this technology in biological systems antioxidant metabolites namely glutathione gsh and nadph plays a key role in h2o2 detoxification through glutathione ascorbic acid cycle for example ram√≠rez et al ramirez et al 2013 showed that gsh and ascorbic acid asa supplementation protected arabidopsis from the adverse effects of iron deficiency and their leaves remained green in another study asa content of arabidopsis leaves was reduced significantly after fe starvation for 52 h nam et al 2021 in this study we also found that foliar application of nano iron did not significantly increase antioxidant metabolites pod and cat to mitigate the oxidative damage it caused fig s12 thus reducing the oxidative stress induced by nano materials must also be considered while improving their properties during product development cost is a key factor for all agricultural product innovations to be successful commercially although the amount required and leaching loss of nano iron fertilizers were low in this study it is not cost effective as their high cost table s6 in this context three scenarios can be considered firstly the cost of iron nanoparticles would be reduced due to the ongoing improvements in product quality scale of production and application technologies in this study we speculate that when the cost of fe3o4 nps comes down to 36 kg its cost effectiveness will become comparable to that of the traditional iron fertilizers fig 8 we believe that the cost of fe3o4 nps will be the same or lower than the predicted price secondly the amount of nano iron needed for effective management of iron nutrition will be further reduced with the current developments in application technology and nano iron particle designs especially with the modifications for increasing its uptake and metabolic efficiency finally governments or environmental organisations may provide assistance to subsidize the cost in order to improve the overall environmental outcomes for agriculture we believe that nano fertilizers will play an important role in sustainable and green agriculture development 5 conclusion nano iron fertilizers are expected to reduce the cost and iron fertilizer leaching and enhance iron nutrition management in peanut under rainfall and non rainfall production conditions the results showed that the iron concentration in leaves and the anti leaching ability of nano iron fertilizers have increased significantly and greatly improved iron fertilizer use efficiency compared with traditional iron fertilizers under simulated rainfall conditions the anti leaching property of nano iron appears to be due to its decreased contact angle resulting in increased wetting and adhesion though it is currently not cost effective the nano iron fertilizers will become cost competitive with the on going developments and innovations in product and production technology and nano particle application systems taken together these results indicate a bright prospect for nano iron fertilizers in sustainable and green agricultural development credit authorship

8869,the knowledge about the behaviour of different fruit tree species when subjected to water shortage is pivotal to pair correctly the species with the environment as well as to choose the most reliable index for monitoring the plant water status net photosynthesis pn and stomatal conductance gs are considered some of the most reliable variables describing the plant water status functionality and potential productivity but their measurement are actually time consuming complex and expensive the aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of a progressive water stress on leaf functioning and plant water status of two stone fruit trees species to study the water relations within the soil plant atmosphere continuum to assess a pool of indices for estimating pn and gs by means of other variables quick to be measured potentially through less expensive and user friendly sensors the trial was carried out on an early ripening apricot variety prunus armeniaca l cv primius and on a late ripening peach variety prunus persica l batsch cv calred subjected to progressive dry down trees were monitored for stem water potential leaf temperature chlorophyl fluorescence pn and gs primius and calred behaved as near anisohydric and near isohydric plants respectively in primius pn and gs were more affected by soil water content than vapour pressure deficit

and the quality of the product fern√°ndez 2014 levidow et al 2014 especially in the warmer seasons st√∂ckle et al 2011 snyder 2017 managing water supply is crucial for fruit tree as production and quality are strictly related to an appropriate tree water status the starting investment to realize the orchard is very high and as perennial fruit tree can bear the consequences of water stress occurring in one season even in the next one manfrini et al 2018 trees affected by water stress show a reduction in the rate of co2 assimilation above all during the hottest hours of the day chaves 1991 this decrease has been attributed to the partial stomata closure in the hottest hours of summers days resulting from imbalance between the high water demand of the air and the low water supply due to the low soil moisture in addition the decrease of the transpiration rate reduces the cooling effect increasing the leaf temperature as a consequence photoinhibition the recovery from photodamage and above all photorespiration whose activity increases with leaf temperature could lead to an additional loss of carbon fixed foyer and harbinson 1994 losciale et al 2011a murata and nishiyama 2018 yi et al 2022 the scientific community is already at work to answer to this request by developing a variety of methods and technologies aiming at reducing water supply and water losses and at scheduling irrigation in an efficient way nowadays the agronomists have to rely on information from several sources soil plant and atmosphere to properly manage the irrigation requirements of the crops however it is necessary to keep in mind the characteristics related to the types of data acquired microclimate variables can be representative of a large area and can be easily measured by few stations for a vast land extension however they may not be nearby a given farm thus the local microclimate is not taken into account allen et al 1998 jones 2004 soil water content monitoring is usually used for irrigation scheduling cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 soulis et al 2015 but where the soil is very heterogenous a large number of sensors is necessary to cover its variability and to have a good representativeness of the measure jones 2004 the plant based indices and the related sensors which directly measure the plant water status are not often taken into consideration because of several constrains time consuming expensiveness of the instruments difficulty of results interpretation a not fully mature technology fern√°ndez 2017 in fact some among the plant based sensors are widely used mainly in scientific area due to the instrument complexity but also their costs in addition it is important to choose the plant based index and sensor according to the specie to monitor for example the stem water potential is a very informative index naor 2006 however it is necessary to carefully interpret the data above all when an isohydric species is monitored isohydric plants tend to maintain a stable water potential closing stomata and reducing stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis turner et al 1985 soc√≠as et al 1997 as a consequence this behaviour masks the real reduction of carbon fixation as a slight decrease of stem water potential is observed apricot prunus armeniaca l and peach prunus persica l batsch for example are considered stone fruit species having a contrasting behaviour in regulating their water relations apricots was considered able to maintain stomata opened by osmotic adjusment even when water potential is low loveys et al 1987 however its drought avoidance behaviour linked to stomatal closure was also observed in other experiments torrecillas et al 1999 ruiz s√°nchez et al 2007 also peach considered an isohydric in some studies xiloyannis et al 1980 showed a good stomatal regulation preventing the decay of water potential in other experiments steinberg et al 1989 losciale et al 2020 as for other species like grapevine also in these cases the strategies for regulating the water relations could be cultivar and specie dependent shultz 2003 nevertheless plant based measurements are widely considered the most reliable indicators to assess water status and to schedule irrigation lakso et al 2022 the reason is that plant based measurement and the related sensors relies on using the plant as a biosensor which integrates the soil and atmosphere water status as well as the plant physiological response to available water fern√°ndez 2017 levin and nackley 2021 several research groups reported that some of the most informative variables on the plant water status would be the net photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance flexas and medrano 2002 jones 2004 cifre et al 2005 hernandez santanaa et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as they are strictly related to plant water status and consumption as well as to potential productivity however the direct measure of net photosynthesis by means of infra red gas analysers irgas is time consuming and needs very expensive instruments and skilled personnel the aims of the present study were i to elucidate the effect of a progressive water stress on leaf functioning and plant water status of two different stone fruit trees species apricot prunus armeniaca l and peach prunus persica l batsch ii to set up one or more indices able to estimate the leaf functioning on plant species potentially having different strategies to cope with the water shortage the indices should be reliable fast to be measured and potentially exploitable in new generation decision support systems for smart agriculture 2 materials and methods the trial was carried out in the summer 2019 at the research centre for agriculture and environment of the council for agricultural research and economics bari crea aa bari on 3 years old peach prunus persica l batsch cv calred and apricot prunus armeniaca l cv primius grafted on gf677 and tetra rootstocks respectively in addition to belong to different species the two cultivars under investigation were also divergent for the fruit ripening period and for the time of presence of fruit attached to the tree primius is an early ripening cultivar with a short time range between flowering and ripening vice versa for calred trees were planted in pots 30 litres of volume with the same amount and type of soil soil texture was classified as clay loam with a dry bulk density of 1 15 t m 3 and soil water content in volume at field capacity fc 0 03 mpa and wilting point wp 1 5 mpa were 0 34 and 0 19 m3m 3 respectively in order to have an uniform canopy trees were pruned back every year maintaining about 8 10 shoots per tree without fruits plants were managed according to the regular practices and irrigation was provided daily restoring the field capacity ten plants per species were selected for the trial on july 24th 205 day of the year doy all the potted plants were irrigated to field capacity allowing the drainage of the free water in order to reduce the soil evaporation the soil of each pot was covered with a plastic film in turn covered with aluminium foil to avoid any increase of soil temperature due to light absorption a half of them continued to be irrigated daily till the field capacity while the remaining trees were left without irrigation in order to allow their dehydration starting from 205 doy from 11 00 to 14 00 the following measures were taken on each plant soil water content swc m3m 3 expressed as volume of water per volume of soil stem water potential

performed on the daily irrigated trees allow us to check the presence of some variation of leaf functionality not linked to water limitations this routine was repeated for 3 consecutive cycles of dehydration cycle i from 205 to 207 doy with 2 days of dehydration cycle ii from 211 to 214 doy with 3 days of dehydration cycle iii from 238 to 248 with 10 days of dehydration 2 1 preliminary statistical analysis descriptive statistics were first computed to synthesize the main features of data distribution indices of central tendency and position mean median dispersion sum of squares variance standard deviation and shape skewness and kurtosis were computed for the variables selected as response variables describing plant water status and functionality leaf net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in addition normality test of kolmogorov smirnov was applied in order to verify the assumption of gaussian distribution 2 2 leaf functionality and water relations within the soil plant atmosphere continuum the relation between stomata closure gs and jpsii jco2 jnc as well as the relation between stem water potential œàs vs pn and gs were analysed for both the species a correlation analysis was also performed between pn and gs with swc expressing the water availability in the soil and with vpd representing the water demand of the environment 2 3 stepwise linear regression analysis in order to investigate the relationships between net photosynthesis stomata conductance and predictor variables and to select the predictors most influencing their estimation linear regression models were fitted and the stepwise selection algorithm was used the methods were applied considering leaf net photosynthesis pn and stomatal conductance gs as dependent variables and as predictors the soil water content vpd tleaf tair Œ¥t fm fs jpsii pko kc the significant level to entry and to stay was set to 0 05 the variables chosen as candidate predictors for net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance had to have the following peculiarities fast measurement possibility to be detected by a future cost affordable sensor physiological meaning stem water potential variable was not considered as an appropriate predictor in the stepwise analysis since its detection by means of a pressure chamber did not match the peculiarities reported below studies on the development and calibration of instruments for measuring the stem water potential continuously and at low cost are in progress lakso et al 2022 pagay 2022 but in the present research it was not possible to test them models developed for each crop and for both the variables were trained on the 75 of the dataset randomly collected for each species afterwards validation was performed on the remaining 25 of the dataset not used for training the model comparing the estimated values of pn and gs with their direct observed measures the prediction performance of the models developed was tested by means of the residual prediction deviation rpd calculated as the ratio between the standard deviation of the observed variables and the root mean square error for the training and for validation respectively according to chang et al 2001 and bellon maurel et al 2010 rpd higher than 2 0 indicated an excellent prediction performance with values between 1 4 and 2 0 models were considered fair models and below 1 4 they were classified unreliable descriptive statistic and regression analyses were performed with statistica 7 0 software 3 results the three cycles of measurements were characterized by different weather conditions table 1 during the time of measure the highest values of air temperature tair and vpd were recorded in the second cycle whereas in the third cycle tair and vpd reached their lowest values table 1 at the beginning of each cycle all the trees were irrigated till the field capacity and half of them were allowed to lose water via transpiration not adding water during the first two cycles after two days of dehydration the soil water content was 0 25 m3m 3 in both the species reducing the available water by about 60 during the cycle ii after three days of dehydration the available water was further reduced by 20 and 27 for apricot and peach respectively the third dehydration cycle was longer than the previous ones lasting 10 days at the end of cycle iii swc was 0 23 and 0 22 m3m 3 for apricot and peach respectively 3 1 descriptive statistic the data recorded along the experiment for each species 128 records for each one showed a range of variation for pn and gs of 20 06 ¬µmol m 2s 1 and 0 215 mol m 2s 1 for apricot and of 27 24 ¬µmol m 2s 1 and 0 37 mol m 2s 1 for peach table 2 pn and gs for both species were normally distributed or with slight deviation from the normal distribution as indicated by the normality test results and by the analysis of the skewness and kurtosis coefficients which were close to zero table 2 3 2 water relations and leaf functionality in the two species stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn were linearly related in the two species as well as the electron transport rate exiting psii jpsii and gs fig 1 the homogeneity of the slopes test showed no differences between the two species when gs was related to pn jco2 f 0 0059 p 0 94 jpsii f 0 0043 p 0 95 and jnc 0 0014 p 0 97 the relation between stomatal conductance and jpsii appeared more scattered and the reduction of jpsii with gs was less pronounced than the decrease of net photosynthesis expressed as the electron flux density fixed as organic co2 jco2 the electron transport rate exiting psii and funnelled to non net carboxylative transports jnc remained quite stable not changing with gs variation fig 1c d the variation of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance as a function of stem water potential was different between the two species in primius apricot pn and gs remained quite stable while the stem water potential œàs decreased with the progressive water shortage net photosynthesis and stomata conductance slightly decreased with œàs when it reached values lower than 1 5 mpa fig 2a c in calred cultivar with values of stem water potential around 1 0 mpa gs and pn varied from 0 27 0 08 mol m 2s 1 for gs and from 22 5 ¬µmol m 2s 1 for pn afterwards net photosynthesis and stomata conductance did not further decrease while œàs showed a reduction till values around 2 7 mpa fig 2b d stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis appeared more related to soil water content r2 0 69 and 0 70 respectively than to air vapour pressure deficit r2 0 03 and 0 07 respectively in apricot fig 3 in calred peach gs and pn were more related with vpd r2 0 46 and 0 49 respectively than with swc showing r2 of 0 34 and 0 31 respectively fig 4 the species caused a significant difference in the relationship vpd vs pn f 9 09 p 0 003 and vpd vs gs f 13 91 p 0 01 3 3 stepwise regression analysis 3 3 1 net photosynthesis estimation the stepwise regression analysis selected pko kc Œ¥t and vpd for pn estimation in both the species the adjusted r2 adj r2 increased progressively with the inclusion of the variables table 3 adj r2 reached 0 7 when pko kc and Œ¥t were added and it increased to 0 75 and 0 78 for apricot and peach respectively when vpd was also included table 3 considering the relatively small increase of adj r2 recorded with the inclusion of vpd and according to the aim of the present study the prediction performance of the models assessed taking in account pko kc Œ¥t or adding also vpd were evaluated when the three variables were considered as predictors f 3 92 values were 98 73 and 116 49 for apricot and peach respectively with a p value 0 00001 for both the species the standard error of estimate was 1 93 and 2 90 ¬µmol m 2s 1 for primius and calred cultivars respectively the durbin watson dw index 1 99 for apricot and 1 92 for peach together with the distribution of the residuals revealed the absence of serial autocorrelation and the homoscedasticity of the residuals considering pko kc and Œ¥t as predictors f 2 93 was 108 65 and 13 48 for apricot and peach respectively and the p value remained 0 0001 the standard error of estimate was 2 16 and 3 4 mol m 2s 1 for primius and calred respectively the distribution of the residuals was homoscedastic and dw was around 2 0 1 96 and 1 90 for apricot and peach respectively indicating the absence of serial autocorrelation the residual prediction deviation rpd used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models showed values of 2 06 for apricot and 2 2 for peach when the three variables were included in the model rpd was 1 84 and 1 86 for apricot and peach when vpd was removed table 3 validation performed on the remaining 25 of dataset showed a residual prediction deviation of 1 84 for apricot and 1 56 for peach when pko kc Œ¥t and vpd were used as predictors rpd was 1 62 and 1 69 for primius and calred respectively considering pko kc and Œ¥t as independent variables for the models table 3 the resulting relation between the observed and the estimated net photosynthesis was linear with a 1 1 relation for both the species and taking into account all the three variables or pko kc and Œ¥t figs 5 6 3 3 2 stomatal conductance estimation the stepwise analysis selected Œ¥t vpd pko kc and Œ¥t vpd considering apricot and peach dataset respectively the adjusted r2 reached values of 0 81 in apricot and 0 78 in peach when Œ¥t and vpd were considered in apricot it further increased at 0 84 including also pko kc as predictor as mentioned for pn estimation considering the relatively small increase of adj r2 with pko kc inclusion and since this variable was excluded in the stepwise for peach the linear regression models for gs estimation were finally performed using Œ¥t and vpd to refine the estimation parameters during the training step values of f 2 93 recorded for apricot and peach were 209 88 and 153 15 respectively with a p value 0 00001 the standard errors for estimate were 0 019 and 0 04 mol m 2s 1 for primius and calred respectively the durbin watson index values around 2 0 1 96 and 2 10 for apricot and preach respectively revealed the absence of serial autocorrelation homoscedastic distribution of the residuals was observed for both the species fig 7 the residual prediction deviation calculated on 75 of dataset used for training the models showed values of 2 36 and 2 08 for apricot and peach respectively rpd was 2 36 and 1 77 for primius and calred cultivars when the 25 of the remaining dataset was used for validating the obtained models table 4 the relation between the observed and the estimated values of stomatal conductance was linear with a 1 1 relation for both the species fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 water relations and leaf functionality in the two species stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn were linearly related and with the same slope in primius and calred suggesting the high influence of stomatal activity on leaf carboxylation and a similar behaviour of both the species fig 1a b the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue calculated as the ratio between pn and gs the slope of the line remained quite constant indicating that water productivity due to stomatal conductance did not change with the increase of gs and that the stomatal threshold to reach the maximum photosynthesis was not reached yet a similar behaviour was also observed in apple cv fuji but when it was covered with a blue shading net iwue decreased with the increase of gs bast√≠as et al 2021 this last pattern is in accordance with several studies where a curvilinear relation between pn and gs was observed cheng et al 1996 torrecillas et al 1999 flexas et al 2002 cifre et al 2005 in this case water productivity due to stomatal conductance decreased with the increase of gs indicating an extra water consumption for the same amount of co2 fixed the quenching partitioning analysis fig 1c d showed how the reduction in stomatal opening limited the electron transport rate fixed by net photosynthesis jco2 as well as the overall electron transport rate exiting psii jpsii however the relation between jpsii and gs appeared more scattered and the rate of reduction of jpsii was lower than that of jco2 fig 1c d this reduction was attenuated by the increased activity of non net carboxylative transports like photorespiration alternative electron transports and dark respiration jnc despite the reduction of jpsii the electron transport rate exiting from psii and funnelled to non net carboxylative transports jnc remained quite stable fig 1c d and it assumed a greater importance while the electron sink of carboxylation was reduced with stomatal closure photorespiration and alternative electron transports acted as photoprotective mechanisms dissipating the excessive energy no more used for carbon fixation this behaviour seemed to be quite common in c3 plants seaton and walker 1990 osmond and grace 1995 cifre et al 2005 and it was observed in other fruit tree species subjected to progressive water shortages like grapevine apple pear and peach flexas et al 2002 losciale et al 2008 2011b 2014 calred peach cultivar behaved as a near isohydric plant as the stem water potential œàs remained quite stable while gs and pn were reduced fig 2b d the pessimistic conservative attitude of this late ripening cultivar was hypothesized in a previous field study where the effect of different soil water contents was compared on plant functionality and productivity losciale et al 2020 stomatal closure reducing the connection with air concurred to maintain stem water potential at a safety threshold against the risk of cavitation tardieu and simonneau 1998 lauri et al 2016 instead a near anisohydric behaviour was observed in primius apricot cultivar where stomatal closure was not so effective in maintaining a stable œàs fig 2a c stomatal conductance and leaf photosynthesis were differently related to soil water content the water source and to the evapotranspirative demand of the air vpd the water sink in calred peach gs and pn seemed to be more related to vpd fig 4b than to soil water content fig 4a while the opposite was observed in primius apricot fig 3a b this knowledge could be useful to manage the orchard properly the use of stem water potential measures to drive irrigation could be appropriate in primius apricot but not in calred peach where œàs remained quite stable while pn was strongly reduced furthermore under moderate water stress conditions calred peach could benefit from vpd modulation under semi arid conditions where vpd values could be limiting the use of moderate shading net shading power of 30 reduced the vpd of about 15 from an average of 3 4 2 9kpa during the summer period favouring the fruit growth and yield campi et al 2020 on the other hand for primius apricot it is very important to maintain a high soil water content to have a good carbon fixation 4 2 stepwise multiple regression analysis 4 2 1 net photosynthesis the stepwise regression analysis selected the same 3 variables for both the species pko kc Œ¥t and vpd and the adjusted r2 increased progressively while the variables were added into the model in particular when the first two variables pko kc and Œ¥t entered in the model the adjusted r2 reached values of about 0 70 table 3 while in the training step the residual prediction deviation rpd lowered from values 2 0 to around 1 8 considering three or two variables respectively during the validation step a more restrictive phase of model assessment rpd remained within the range 1 4 2 0 using pko kc and Œ¥t or also adding vpd as predictors table 3 in both the cases the models were considered fair models chang et al 2001 bellon maurel et al 2010 the use of two variables instead of three did not affect very much the prediction performance of the models table 3 this was also confirmed by the resulting relationship between the observed and the estimated pn linear and with a 1 1 relation figs 5b 6b a similar stepwise approach selected the same variables to estimate net photosynthesis ipl index in apple and pear losciale et al 2015 suggesting the high physiological meaning of these variables in describing leaf functionality and water status laurens et al 2018 coupel ledru et al 2019 yang et al 2021 in pear the use of estimated pn as plant indicator to drive irrigation allowed to reduce water supply of about 50 in comparison with the full irrigated treatments not affecting productivity losciale et al 2022 in general pn is affected by i the amount of electrons exiting from the psii and partly used for carboxylation ii the carboxylative and photorespiratory activity of rubisco in turn dependent by leaf temperature iii and by the amount of the entering co2 dependent by stomatal conductance and related to the leaf to air temperature difference Œ¥t pko kc variable integrates the amount of electrons exiting from the psii jpsii measured by means of chlorophyll fluorescence protocols and the carboxylative and photorespiratory activity of rubisco strictly linked to the michaelis menten activity of this enzyme for the two processes in turn dependent by leaf temperature von caemmerer 2000 foyer et al 2009 according to the principle of parsimony and considering that the same variables have been already selected for other species linear regression models were finally performed using pko kc Œ¥t as predictors for pn for primius apricot and calred peach the resulting linear equations for apricot and peach were the following 1 apricot pn est 5 86 0 19 p ko kc 3 63 Œ¥ t 2 peach pn est 2 42 0 30 p ko kc 1 84 Œ¥ t the standardized predictors coefficients Œ≤ which consider the weight of each variable in the model regardless their order of magnitude were 0 46 and 0 51 for pko kc and Œ¥t respectively in apricot and 0 75 pko kc and 0 22 Œ¥t for peach 4 2 2 stomatal conductance the stepwise regression analysis for stomatal conductance estimation selected Œ¥t and vpd as predictors for both the species with adjusted r2 values of around 0 8 table 4 the residual prediction deviation higher than 2 and between 1 4 and 2 for apricot and peach respectively during the validation step revealed an excellent fair prediction performance of the models assessed these results were further confirmed by the linear and the 1 1 relation between observed and estimated gs fig 7 the following linear equations were established 3 apricot gs est 0 27 0 07 Œ¥ t 0 03 vpd 4 peach gs est 0 49 0 07 Œ¥ t 0 10 vpd with Œ≤ of 0 88 and 0 38 for Œ¥t and vpd in apricot and of 0 67 Œ¥t and 0 62 vpd for peach even in this case the two variables selected had a clear physiological meaning in determining the degree of stomatal opening the vapour pressure deficit indicates the drying power of the atmosphere the tree tried to cope with water loss modulating the stomatal closure the leaf to air temperature difference is strictly linked to the passage of water from liquid to gaseous phase thus also to the degree of the stomatal opening both the variables are used for assessing vegetative indices like the crop water stress index idso et al 1981 and the index of stomatal conductance jones 1999 ciccarese et al 2011 strongly linked to the plant water status 5 conclusions primius an early ripening apricot cultivar behaved as a near anisohydric plant and vice versa calred a late ripening peach cultivar appeared to be near isohydric this knowledge could be interesting for choosing the tools for driving irrigation accordingly in primius the information about stem water potential and soil water content could be useful to drive irrigation since a good relationship with leaf functionality was found on the other hand the reduction of leaf functionality appeared weakly related to stem water potential in calred suggesting that this index would be not so useful to drive irrigation in pessimistic genotypes another difference between the two genotypes was that in calred peach gs and pn seemed to be more related to vpd than soil water content while the opposite was observed in apricot this knowledge could be useful to better manage the orchard in primius apricot for example soil water content should be maintained high in order to prevent a reduction of carbon fixation in peach in high water demanding environments a moderate reduction of vpd could be positive for leaf photosynthesis and for the potential productivity the study aimed to identify a pool of indices that would describe the plant water status and the related performances net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were chosen as candidate dependent variables summarizing the potential productivity of a tree it was possible to identify two predictive variables pko kc Œ¥t that arranged properly using a multivariate linear regression approach were able to estimate net photosynthesis in both the genotypes under study pko kc and Œ¥t meet the criteria previously described physiological sound variables quick to be measured potentially implemented in a price affordable sensor the measurement of these variables is faster than the direct detection of pn with an infra red gas analyzer analyzer irga as chlorophyll fluorescence leaf and air temperature could be acquired in less than 10 s per leaf instead of 3 min at the moment the simultaneous detection of these variables can be performed only proximally as pko kc requires the measurement of jpsii in turn dependent on the measure of fm this latter is obtained using a saturating light pulse and therefore it needs a proximal measurement vapour pressure deficit and Œ¥t were identified as stomatal conductance predictors showing a satisfactory prediction performance also in this case the selected variables had a well known physiological meaning and their detection could be easy inexpensive and gathered both proximally and remotely further research should be oriented at managing irrigation considering the cultivar attitude and its relation with soil water content and air water demand calibrating the models on other species finding valid alternatives for fm estimation without the proximal measurement i e the use of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif could be interesting and developing practical protocols using pn and gs as plant based indicators for managing efficiently some agro practices first of

8869,the knowledge about the behaviour of different fruit tree species when subjected to water shortage is pivotal to pair correctly the species with the environment as well as to choose the most reliable index for monitoring the plant water status net photosynthesis pn and stomatal conductance gs are considered some of the most reliable variables describing the plant water status functionality and potential productivity but their measurement are actually time consuming complex and expensive the aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of a progressive water stress on leaf functioning and plant water status of two stone fruit trees species to study the water relations within the soil plant atmosphere continuum to assess a pool of indices for estimating pn and gs by means of other variables quick to be measured potentially through less expensive and user friendly sensors the trial was carried out on an early ripening apricot variety prunus armeniaca l

1991 this decrease has been attributed to the partial stomata closure in the hottest hours of summers days resulting from imbalance between the high water demand of the air and the low water supply due to the low soil moisture in addition the decrease of the transpiration rate reduces the cooling effect increasing the leaf temperature as a consequence photoinhibition the recovery from photodamage and above all photorespiration whose activity increases with leaf temperature could lead to an additional loss of carbon fixed foyer and harbinson 1994 losciale et al 2011a murata and nishiyama 2018 yi et al 2022 the scientific community is already at work to answer to this request by developing a variety of methods and technologies aiming at reducing water supply and water losses and at scheduling irrigation in an efficient way nowadays the agronomists have to rely on information from several sources soil plant and atmosphere to properly manage the irrigation requirements of the crops however it is necessary to keep in mind the characteristics related to the types of data acquired microclimate variables can be representative of a large area and can be easily measured by few stations for a vast land extension however they may not be nearby a given farm thus the local microclimate is not taken into account allen et al 1998 jones 2004 soil water content monitoring is usually used for irrigation scheduling cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 soulis et al 2015 but where the soil is very heterogenous a large number of sensors is necessary to cover its variability and to have a good representativeness of the measure jones 2004 the plant based indices and the related sensors which directly measure the plant water status are not often taken into consideration because of several constrains time consuming expensiveness of the instruments difficulty of results interpretation a not fully mature technology fern√°ndez 2017 in fact some among the plant based sensors are widely used mainly in scientific area due to the instrument complexity but also their costs in addition it is important to choose the plant based index and sensor according to the specie to monitor for example the stem water potential is a very informative index naor 2006 however it is necessary to carefully interpret the data above all when an isohydric species is monitored isohydric plants tend to maintain a stable water potential closing stomata and reducing stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis turner et al 1985 soc√≠as et al 1997 as a consequence this behaviour masks the real reduction of carbon fixation as a slight decrease of stem water potential is observed apricot prunus armeniaca l and peach prunus persica l batsch for example are considered stone fruit species having a contrasting behaviour in regulating their water relations apricots was considered able to maintain stomata opened by osmotic adjusment even when water potential is low loveys et al 1987 however its drought avoidance behaviour linked to stomatal closure was also observed in other experiments torrecillas et al 1999 ruiz s√°nchez et al 2007 also peach considered an isohydric in some studies xiloyannis et al 1980 showed a good stomatal regulation preventing the decay of water potential in other experiments steinberg et al 1989 losciale et al 2020 as for other species like grapevine also in these cases the strategies for regulating the water relations could be cultivar and specie dependent shultz 2003 nevertheless plant based measurements are widely considered the most reliable indicators to assess water status and to schedule irrigation lakso et al 2022 the reason is that plant based measurement and the related sensors relies on using the plant as a biosensor which integrates the soil and atmosphere water status as well as the plant physiological response to available water fern√°ndez 2017 levin and nackley 2021 several research groups reported that some of the most informative variables on the plant water status would be the net photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance flexas and medrano 2002 jones 2004 cifre et al 2005 hernandez santanaa et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as they are strictly related to plant water status and consumption as well as to potential productivity however the direct measure of net photosynthesis by means of infra red gas analysers irgas is time consuming and needs very expensive instruments and skilled personnel the aims of the present study were i to elucidate the effect of a progressive water stress on leaf functioning and plant water status of two different stone fruit trees species apricot prunus armeniaca l and peach prunus persica l batsch ii to set up one or more indices able to estimate the leaf functioning on plant species potentially having different strategies to cope with the water shortage the indices should be reliable fast to be measured and potentially exploitable in new generation decision support systems for smart agriculture 2 materials and methods the trial was carried out in the summer 2019 at the research centre for agriculture and environment of the council for agricultural research and economics bari crea aa bari on 3 years old peach prunus persica l batsch cv calred and apricot prunus armeniaca l cv primius grafted on gf677 and tetra rootstocks respectively in addition to belong to different species the two cultivars under investigation were also divergent for the fruit ripening period and for the time of presence of fruit attached to the tree primius is an early ripening cultivar with a short time range between flowering and ripening vice versa for calred trees were planted in pots 30 litres of volume with the same amount and type of soil soil texture was classified as clay loam with a dry bulk density of 1 15 t m 3 and soil water content in volume at field capacity fc 0 03 mpa and wilting point wp 1 5 mpa were 0 34 and 0 19 m3m 3 respectively in order to have an uniform canopy trees were pruned back every year maintaining about 8 10 shoots per tree without fruits plants were managed according to the regular practices and irrigation was provided daily restoring the field capacity ten plants per species were selected for the trial on july 24th 205 day of the year doy all the potted plants were irrigated to field capacity allowing the drainage of the free water in order to reduce the soil evaporation the soil of each pot was covered with a plastic film in turn covered with aluminium foil to avoid any increase of soil temperature due to light absorption a half of them continued to be irrigated daily till the field capacity while the remaining trees were left without irrigation in order to allow their dehydration starting from 205 doy from 11 00 to 14 00 the following measures were taken on each plant soil water content swc m3m 3 expressed as volume of water per volume of soil stem water potential

performed on the daily irrigated trees allow us to check the presence of some variation of leaf functionality not linked to water limitations this routine was repeated for 3 consecutive cycles of dehydration cycle i from 205 to 207 doy with 2 days of dehydration cycle ii from 211 to 214 doy with 3 days of dehydration cycle iii from 238 to 248 with 10 days of dehydration 2 1 preliminary statistical analysis descriptive statistics were first computed to synthesize the main features of data distribution indices of central tendency and position mean median dispersion sum of squares variance standard deviation and shape skewness and kurtosis were computed for the variables selected as response variables describing plant water status and functionality leaf net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in addition normality test of kolmogorov smirnov was applied in order to verify the assumption of gaussian distribution 2 2 leaf functionality and water relations within the soil plant atmosphere continuum the relation between stomata closure gs and jpsii jco2 jnc as well as the relation between stem water potential œàs vs pn and gs were analysed for both the species a correlation analysis was also performed between pn and gs with swc expressing the water availability in the soil and with vpd representing the water demand of the environment 2 3 stepwise linear regression analysis in order to investigate the relationships between net photosynthesis stomata conductance and predictor variables and to select the predictors most influencing their estimation linear regression models were fitted and the stepwise selection algorithm was used the methods were applied considering leaf net photosynthesis pn and stomatal conductance gs as dependent variables and as predictors the soil water content vpd tleaf tair Œ¥t fm fs jpsii pko kc the significant level to entry and to stay was set to 0 05 the variables chosen as candidate predictors for net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance had to have the following peculiarities fast measurement possibility to be detected by a future cost affordable sensor physiological meaning stem water potential variable was not considered as an appropriate predictor in the stepwise analysis since its detection by means of a pressure chamber did not match the peculiarities reported below studies on the development and calibration of instruments for measuring the stem water potential continuously and at low cost are in progress lakso et al 2022 pagay 2022 but in the present research it was not possible to test them models developed for each crop and for both the variables were trained on the 75 of the dataset randomly collected for each species afterwards validation was performed on the remaining 25 of the dataset not used for training the model comparing the estimated values of pn and gs with their direct observed measures the prediction performance of the models developed was tested by means of the residual prediction deviation rpd calculated as the ratio between the standard deviation of the observed variables and the root mean square error for the training and for validation respectively according to chang et al 2001 and bellon maurel et al 2010 rpd higher than 2 0 indicated an excellent prediction performance with values between 1 4 and 2 0 models were considered fair models and below 1 4 they were classified unreliable descriptive statistic and regression analyses were performed with statistica 7 0 software 3 results the three cycles of measurements were characterized by different weather conditions table 1 during the time of measure the highest values of air temperature tair and vpd were recorded in the second cycle whereas in the third cycle tair and vpd reached their lowest values table 1 at the beginning of each cycle all the trees were irrigated till the field capacity and half of them were allowed to lose water via transpiration not adding water during the first two cycles after two days of dehydration the soil water content was 0 25 m3m 3 in both the species reducing the available water by about 60 during the cycle ii after three days of dehydration the available water was further reduced by 20 and 27 for apricot and peach respectively the third dehydration cycle was longer than the previous ones lasting 10 days at the end of cycle iii swc was 0 23 and 0 22 m3m 3 for apricot and peach respectively 3 1 descriptive statistic the data recorded along the experiment for each species 128 records for each one showed a range of variation for pn and gs of 20 06 ¬µmol m 2s 1 and 0 215 mol m 2s 1 for apricot and of 27 24 ¬µmol m 2s 1 and 0 37 mol m 2s 1 for peach table 2 pn and gs for both species were normally distributed or with slight deviation from the normal distribution as indicated by the normality test results and by the analysis of the skewness and kurtosis coefficients which were close to zero table 2 3 2 water relations and leaf functionality in the two species stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn were linearly related in the two species as well as the electron transport rate exiting psii jpsii and gs fig 1 the homogeneity of the slopes test showed no differences between the two species when gs was related to pn jco2 f 0 0059 p 0 94 jpsii f 0 0043 p 0 95 and jnc 0 0014 p 0 97 the relation between stomatal conductance and jpsii appeared more scattered and the reduction of jpsii with gs was less pronounced than the decrease of net photosynthesis expressed as the electron flux density fixed as organic co2 jco2 the electron transport rate exiting psii and funnelled to non net carboxylative transports jnc remained quite stable not changing with gs variation fig 1c d the variation of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance as a function of stem water potential was different between the two species in primius apricot pn and gs remained quite stable while the stem water potential œàs decreased with the progressive water shortage net photosynthesis and stomata conductance slightly decreased with œàs when it reached values lower than 1 5 mpa fig 2a c in calred cultivar with values of stem water potential around 1 0 mpa gs and pn varied from 0 27 0 08 mol m 2s 1 for gs and from 22 5 ¬µmol m 2s 1 for pn afterwards net photosynthesis and stomata conductance did not further decrease while œàs showed a reduction till values around 2 7 mpa fig 2b d stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis appeared more related to soil water content r2 0 69 and 0 70 respectively than to air vapour pressure deficit r2 0 03 and 0 07 respectively in apricot fig 3 in calred peach gs and pn were more related with vpd r2 0 46 and 0 49 respectively than with swc showing r2 of 0 34 and 0 31 respectively fig 4 the species caused a significant difference in the relationship vpd vs pn f 9 09 p 0 003 and vpd vs gs f 13 91 p 0 01 3 3 stepwise regression analysis 3 3 1 net photosynthesis estimation the stepwise regression analysis selected pko kc Œ¥t and vpd for pn estimation in both the species the adjusted r2 adj r2 increased progressively with the inclusion of the variables table 3 adj r2 reached 0 7 when pko kc and Œ¥t were added and it increased to 0 75 and 0 78 for apricot and peach respectively when vpd was also included table 3 considering the relatively small increase of adj r2 recorded with the inclusion of vpd and according to the aim of the present study the prediction performance of the models assessed taking in account pko kc Œ¥t or adding also vpd were evaluated when the three variables were considered as predictors f 3 92 values were 98 73 and 116 49 for apricot and peach respectively with a p value 0 00001 for both the species the standard error of estimate was 1 93 and 2 90 ¬µmol m 2s 1 for primius and calred cultivars respectively the durbin watson dw index 1 99 for apricot and 1 92 for peach together with the distribution of the residuals revealed the absence of serial autocorrelation and the homoscedasticity of the residuals considering pko kc and Œ¥t as predictors f 2 93 was 108 65 and 13 48 for apricot and peach respectively and the p value remained 0 0001 the standard error of estimate was 2 16 and 3 4 mol m 2s 1 for primius and calred respectively the distribution of the residuals was homoscedastic and dw was around 2 0 1 96 and 1 90 for apricot and peach respectively indicating the absence of serial autocorrelation the residual prediction deviation rpd used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models showed values of 2 06 for apricot and 2 2 for peach when the three variables were included in the model rpd was 1 84 and 1 86 for apricot and peach when vpd was removed table 3 validation performed on the remaining 25 of dataset showed a residual prediction deviation of 1 84 for apricot and 1 56 for peach when pko kc Œ¥t and vpd were used as predictors rpd was 1 62 and 1 69 for primius and calred respectively considering pko kc and Œ¥t as independent variables for the models table 3 the resulting relation between the observed and the estimated net photosynthesis was linear with a 1 1 relation for both the species and taking into account all the three variables or pko kc and Œ¥t figs 5 6 3 3 2 stomatal conductance estimation the stepwise analysis selected Œ¥t vpd pko kc and Œ¥t vpd considering apricot and peach dataset respectively the adjusted r2 reached values of 0 81 in apricot and 0 78 in peach when Œ¥t and vpd were considered in apricot it further increased at 0 84 including also pko kc as predictor as mentioned for pn estimation considering the relatively small increase of adj r2 with pko kc inclusion and since this variable was excluded in the stepwise for peach the linear regression models for gs estimation were finally performed using Œ¥t and vpd to refine the estimation parameters during the training step values of f 2 93 recorded for apricot and peach were 209 88 and 153 15 respectively with a p value 0 00001 the standard errors for estimate were 0 019 and 0 04 mol m 2s 1 for primius and calred respectively the durbin watson index values around 2 0 1 96 and 2 10 for apricot and preach respectively revealed the absence of serial autocorrelation homoscedastic distribution of the residuals was observed for both the species fig 7 the residual prediction deviation calculated on 75 of dataset used for training the models showed values of 2 36 and 2 08 for apricot and peach respectively rpd was 2 36 and 1 77 for primius and calred cultivars when the 25 of the remaining dataset was used for validating the obtained models table 4 the relation between the observed and the estimated values of stomatal conductance was linear with a 1 1 relation for both the species fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 water relations and leaf functionality in the two species stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn were linearly related and with the same slope in primius and calred suggesting the high influence of stomatal activity on leaf carboxylation and a similar behaviour of both the species fig 1a b the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue calculated as the ratio between pn and gs the slope of the line remained quite constant indicating that water productivity due to stomatal conductance did not change with the increase of gs and that the stomatal threshold to reach the maximum photosynthesis was not reached yet a similar behaviour was also observed in apple cv fuji but when it was covered with a blue shading net iwue decreased with the increase of gs bast√≠as et al 2021 this last pattern is in accordance with several studies where a curvilinear relation between pn and gs was observed cheng et al 1996 torrecillas et al 1999 flexas et al 2002 cifre et al 2005 in this case water productivity due to stomatal conductance decreased with the increase of gs indicating an extra water consumption for the same amount of co2 fixed the quenching partitioning analysis fig 1c d showed how the reduction in stomatal opening limited the electron transport rate fixed by net photosynthesis jco2 as well as the overall electron transport rate exiting psii jpsii however the relation between jpsii and gs appeared more scattered and the rate of reduction of jpsii was lower than that of jco2 fig 1c d this reduction was attenuated by the increased activity of non net carboxylative transports like photorespiration alternative electron transports and dark respiration jnc despite the reduction of jpsii the electron transport rate exiting from psii and funnelled to non net carboxylative transports jnc remained quite stable fig 1c d and it assumed a greater importance while the electron sink of carboxylation was reduced with stomatal closure photorespiration and alternative electron transports acted as photoprotective mechanisms dissipating the excessive energy no more used for carbon fixation this behaviour seemed to be quite common in c3 plants seaton and walker 1990 osmond and grace 1995 cifre et al 2005 and it was observed in other fruit tree species subjected to progressive water shortages like grapevine apple pear and peach flexas et al 2002 losciale et al 2008 2011b 2014 calred peach cultivar behaved as a near isohydric plant as the stem water potential œàs remained quite stable while gs and pn were reduced fig 2b d the pessimistic conservative attitude of this late ripening cultivar was hypothesized in a previous field study where the effect of different soil water contents was compared on plant functionality and productivity losciale et al 2020 stomatal closure reducing the connection with air concurred to maintain stem water potential at a safety threshold against the risk of cavitation tardieu and simonneau 1998 lauri et al 2016 instead a near anisohydric behaviour was observed in primius apricot cultivar where stomatal closure was not so effective in maintaining a stable œàs fig 2a c stomatal conductance and leaf photosynthesis were differently related to soil water content the water source and to the evapotranspirative demand of the air vpd the water sink in calred peach gs and pn seemed to be more related to vpd fig 4b than to soil water content fig 4a while the opposite was observed in primius apricot fig 3a b this knowledge could be useful to manage the orchard properly the use of stem water potential measures to drive irrigation could be appropriate in primius apricot but not in calred peach where œàs remained quite stable while pn was strongly reduced furthermore under moderate water stress conditions calred peach could benefit from vpd modulation under semi arid conditions where vpd values could be limiting the use of moderate shading net shading power of 30 reduced the vpd of about 15 from an average of 3 4 2 9kpa during the summer period favouring the fruit growth and yield campi et al 2020 on the other hand for primius apricot it is very important to maintain a high soil water content to have a good carbon fixation 4 2 stepwise multiple regression analysis 4 2 1 net photosynthesis the stepwise regression analysis selected the same 3 variables for both the species pko kc Œ¥t and vpd and the adjusted r2 increased progressively while the variables were added into the model in particular when the first two variables pko kc and Œ¥t entered in the model the adjusted r2 reached values of about 0 70 table 3 while in the training step the residual prediction deviation rpd lowered from values 2 0 to around 1 8 considering three or two variables respectively during the validation step a more restrictive phase of model assessment rpd remained within the range 1 4 2 0 using pko kc and Œ¥t or also adding vpd as predictors table 3 in both the cases the models were considered fair models chang et al 2001 bellon maurel et al 2010 the use of two variables instead of three did not affect very much the prediction performance of the models table 3 this was also confirmed by the resulting relationship between the observed and the estimated pn linear and with a 1 1 relation figs 5b 6b a similar stepwise approach selected the same variables to estimate net photosynthesis ipl index in apple and pear losciale et al 2015 suggesting the high physiological meaning of these variables in describing leaf functionality and water status laurens et al 2018 coupel ledru et al 2019 yang et al 2021 in pear the use of estimated pn as plant indicator to drive irrigation allowed to reduce water supply of about 50 in comparison with the full irrigated treatments not affecting productivity losciale et al 2022 in general pn is affected by i the amount of electrons exiting from the psii and partly used for carboxylation ii the carboxylative and photorespiratory activity of rubisco in turn dependent by leaf temperature iii and by the amount of the entering co2 dependent by stomatal conductance and related to the leaf to air temperature difference Œ¥t pko kc variable integrates the amount of electrons exiting from the psii jpsii measured by means of chlorophyll fluorescence protocols and the carboxylative and photorespiratory activity of rubisco strictly linked to the michaelis menten activity of this enzyme for the two processes in turn dependent by leaf temperature von caemmerer 2000 foyer et al 2009 according to the principle of parsimony and considering that the same variables have been already selected for other species linear regression models were finally performed using pko kc Œ¥t as predictors for pn for primius apricot and calred peach the resulting linear equations for apricot and peach were the following 1 apricot pn est 5 86 0 19 p ko kc 3 63 Œ¥ t 2 peach pn est 2 42 0 30 p ko kc 1 84 Œ¥ t the standardized predictors coefficients Œ≤ which consider the weight of each variable in the model regardless their order of magnitude were 0 46 and 0 51 for pko kc and Œ¥t respectively in apricot and 0 75 pko kc and 0 22 Œ¥t for peach 4 2 2 stomatal conductance the stepwise regression analysis for stomatal conductance estimation selected Œ¥t and vpd as predictors for both the species with adjusted r2 values of around 0 8 table 4 the residual prediction deviation higher than 2 and between 1 4 and 2 for apricot and peach respectively during the validation step revealed an excellent fair prediction performance of the models assessed these results were further confirmed by the linear and the 1 1 relation between observed and estimated gs fig 7 the following linear equations were established 3 apricot gs est 0 27 0 07 Œ¥ t 0 03 vpd 4 peach gs est 0 49 0 07 Œ¥ t 0 10 vpd with Œ≤ of 0 88 and 0 38 for Œ¥t and vpd in apricot and of 0 67 Œ¥t and 0 62 vpd for peach even in this case the two variables selected had a clear physiological meaning in determining the degree of stomatal opening the vapour pressure deficit indicates the drying power of the atmosphere the tree tried to cope with water loss modulating the stomatal closure the leaf to air temperature difference is strictly linked to the passage of water from liquid to gaseous phase thus also to the degree of the stomatal opening both the variables are used for assessing vegetative indices like the crop water stress index idso et al 1981 and the index of stomatal conductance jones 1999 ciccarese et al 2011 strongly linked to the plant water status 5 conclusions primius an early ripening apricot cultivar behaved as a near anisohydric plant and vice versa calred a late ripening peach cultivar appeared to be near isohydric this knowledge could be interesting for choosing the tools for driving irrigation accordingly in primius the information about stem water potential and soil water content could be useful to drive irrigation since a good relationship with leaf functionality was found on the other hand the reduction of leaf functionality appeared weakly related to stem water potential in calred suggesting that this index would be not so useful to drive irrigation in pessimistic genotypes another difference between the two genotypes was that in calred peach gs and pn seemed to be more related to vpd than soil water content while the opposite was observed in apricot this knowledge could be useful to better manage the orchard in primius apricot for example soil water content should be maintained high in order to prevent a reduction of carbon fixation in peach in high water demanding environments a moderate reduction of vpd could be positive for leaf photosynthesis and for the potential productivity the study aimed to identify a pool of indices that would describe the plant water status and the related performances net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were chosen as candidate dependent variables summarizing the potential productivity of a tree it was possible to identify two predictive variables pko kc Œ¥t that arranged properly using a multivariate linear regression approach were able to estimate net photosynthesis in both the genotypes under study pko kc and Œ¥t meet the criteria previously described physiological sound variables quick to be measured potentially implemented in a price affordable sensor the measurement of these variables is faster than the direct detection of pn with an infra red gas analyzer analyzer irga as chlorophyll fluorescence leaf and air temperature could be acquired in less than 10 s per leaf instead of 3 min at the moment the simultaneous detection of these variables can be performed only proximally as pko kc requires the measurement of jpsii in turn dependent on the measure of fm this latter is obtained using a saturating light pulse and therefore it needs a proximal measurement vapour pressure deficit and Œ¥t were identified as stomatal conductance predictors showing a satisfactory prediction performance also in this case the selected variables had a well known physiological meaning and their detection could be easy inexpensive and gathered both proximally and remotely further research should be oriented at managing irrigation considering the cultivar attitude and its relation with soil water content and air water demand calibrating the models on other species finding valid alternatives for fm estimation without the proximal measurement i e the use of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif could be interesting and developing practical protocols using pn and gs as plant based indicators for managing efficiently some agro practices first of
