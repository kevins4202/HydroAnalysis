18965,the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a waste stabilization pond wsp system to reduce pathogen contaminants in sludge this included examining the factors that influence the fate and concentration of human pathogens and their indicators in two sludge layers the decay rates of five study microorganisms were determined under in situ conditions at a wsp the background levels of fecal origin microorganisms were consistently detected ranging escherichia coli 104 to 106 enterococci 101 to 103 f specific bacteriophage ms2 101 to 103 and somatic coliphage 101 to 104 colony forming units cfu ml 1 as well as 101 to 102 human adenovirus gene copies ml 1 in the primary facultative pond among microorganisms tested the bacteria generally decayed faster than adenovirus and bacteriophage particularly in the upper sludge layer due to the observed regrowth of e coli it may have a limited value as an indicator for pathogen removal in the wastewater stabilization ponds the abundance of e coli numbers within the pond biome followed changes in pond temperature over time the results of the study suggest that viruses could survive for a long time particularly in deeper layers 1 metre in the sludge during winter months t 90 156 d the presence of human pathogens in wsp sludge in particular viruses may be a barrier to its beneficial reuse in agriculture the results indicate that additional treatment of sludge may be required to mitigate potential public health risks from reuse of sludge for agricultural purposes graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater stabilization pond sludge adenovirus bacteriophage pathogen decay 1 introduction global demand for potable and non potable water continues to increase due to the impacts of climate change population growth and anthropogenic pollutants which all threaten the sustainability of water supplies in order to reuse wastewater and sludge for beneficial purposes such as soil amendment and nutrient source pritchard et al 2010 a better understanding of the factors which influence the decay of pathogens in waste stabilization pond wsp systems is essential the ability to reuse wastewater is attracting more interest where demands on freshwater need to be reduced sato et al 2013 waste stabilization ponds are frequently used around the world for wastewater treatment in small communities towns and regions with large areas of land but limited capital investment verbyla et al 2016 they are effective and provide a cost effective method of treating sewage effluent in rural communities coggins et al 2017 the majority of regional communities in western australian use wsp technology however it is not known how efficient the first stage of the treatment process in pathogen removal treated water from wsp systems is often used for irrigation and the extent to which concomitant health risks may occur to the public from contaminants is unknown hamilton et al 2006 rhind 2009 toze 2006 with a better understanding of parameters to monitor for quality and their interactions further potential reuse options may exist to convert wsp sludge into a valuable resource the primary purpose of the facultative pond in a wastewater treatment system is to stabilize organic matter reduce nutrient load and to remove biochemical oxygen demand bod in the effluent a lesser objective is to reduce pathogens this usually occurs further in the series such as the maturation pond which is often subject to further disinfection processes i e chlorination orruño et al 2014 in contrast to large urban wastewater treatment plants with more advanced treatment processes rural treatment plants use simpler technologies such as wsp systems or lagoons ho et al 2017 ouedraogo et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 there is limited scientific data available on the effectiveness of the primary facultative pond to reduce pathogens in sludge the lack of information on factors influencing sludge quality has made the management of sludge an environmental challenge particularly in regards to pathogen reduction an analysis of environmental factors relating to pathogen decay could provide critical information for the management of wastewater and could assist with reuse options hamilton et al 2006 information on pathogen removal in sludge layers is limited in this paper the surface layer 1 m is referred to as wastewater 98 water and the thicker viscous wastewater regarded as sludge 1 m with up to 12 dry solids 87 water the sediment fraction is regarded as the most hazardous since pathogens associated with particles settle over time into the sediment where survival may be prolonged due to the prevalence of anoxic to anaerobic conditions pathogens may become resuspended and be transported due to environmental events such as high rainfall or high water inflow events keffala et al 2013 the conditions in wastewater treatment ponds may be adverse to the survival of pathogenic microorganisms sah et al 2012 von sperling 2007 the environmental factors that may influence decay include ultraviolet uv light high ph dissolved oxygen levels pond temperature and nutrient level byappanahalli et al 2012 a number of studies have investigated the decay of pathogenic microorganisms in reed beds aquifers seawater and freshwater sources examining effects of temperature and solar radiation on pathogen decay deller et al 2006 noble et al 2004 sidhu and toze 2012 sidhu et al 2010 sinton et al 1999 young et al 2016 little is known about pathogen fate and concentrations in particular viruses and fecal indicator organisms in sludge from wsp systems using naturally occurring inoculants as target microorganisms kitajima et al 2014 maynard et al 1999 verbyla et al 2016 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 the aim of this research was to study the efficacy of a primary facultative pond to reduce enteric microorganisms in the sludge layer specific objectives included i determine decay rates using diffusion chambers for viruses f specific bacteriophage ms2 somatic coliphage enteric bacteria e coli and enterococci and human adenovirus hadv ii examine change in decay rates rate at two sludge depths iii compare decay rates with the prevalence of the same viruses and bacteria from the sludge iv correlation between routinely monitored physicochemical parameters uv intensity temperature ph and electrical conductivity with decay rates over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a pathogen decay experiment was conducted over 3 months at a restricted wwtp in western australia in may 2017 the plant treats sewage from a regional town with 346 connections the site is located 100 km east of perth 3 km from the township servicing 1304 residential water connections and 95 residential sewer connections with an estimated sludge accumulation rate of 0 027 to 0 032 m3 person 1 year 1 the site comprised of three ponds in a combination of facultative and maturation ponds in series with an average flow rate capacity of 110 m3 d 1 and a total storage volume of 24 ml the system is designed to treat wastewater to secondary standard nitrogen and phosphorus removal the system contained one primary 7245 m3 facultative ponds used in study one secondary 3105 m3 facultative pond and one tertiary 1987 m3 facultative pond all parallel with one 11250 m3 storage pond the primary pond used in this study had a design depth of 2 10 m profiled depth of 1 60 m with an average sludge depth of 0 40 m 1 0 average solids resulting in 11 tonnes dry solids in situ the system is evacuated desludged approximately every 8 years and at the time of sampling sludge was due to be removed the sludge that had accumulated in the ponds receiving wastewater was estimated to occupy 22 of the pond s volume the total theoretical hrt for this system at the time of sampling was considered to be 26 30 days treated wastewater from the storage pond is used for woodlot irrigation on agricultural land 2 2 microorganisms used in the study the five microorganisms tested were isolates derived from sludge sampled collected from the study pond wild type escherichia coli e coli enterococcus spp bacteriophage ms2 somatic coliphage and adenovirus hadv e coli numbers were previously determined as 105 to 106 colony forming units cfu ml 1 environmental isolates were plated onto selective culture media chromocult coliform agar and chromocult enterococci agar merck kenilworth usa incubated at 37 c overnight purified cultures were stored in nutrient broth containing 10 glycerol at 80 c ms2 isolates were cultured using e coli host hs pfamp r atcc 700891 cells american type culture collection manassas va usa in tryptone yeast broth oxoid limited hampshire uk as outlined in sidhu et al 2008 somatic coliphage isolates were cultured in tryptone yeast extract broth oxoid limited hampshire uk with an e coli c atcc 13706 host the standard double layer agar method was used for both as described in sidhu et al 2008 coliphage suspensions were washed twice in 25 ml sterile phosphate buffer and centrifuged adenovirus strain 41 atcc vr 930 was cultured in llk cell line by the pathology centre wa the virus was then harvested and frozen at 80 c as described by sidhu et al 2013 2 3 diffusion chambers the decay study was conducted in situ using diffusion chambers the chambers were a modification of the chambers used in toze et al 2012 briefly teflon chambers 25 mm diameter internal capacity of 7 ml were constructed two mesh discs 47 5 mm 1525 1000 mm stainless woven mesh 0 71 aperture and 0 32 wire were fitted either end two 47 mm glass fibre filters with a binder ap2504700 were fitted with a pore size of 0 025 μm merck millipore burlington ma to prevent the loss of seeded microbial pathogens two pegasus sv4 virus removal membrane filter discs pall corporation pall port washington ny usa with pore size 20 nm capable of the retention of bacteriophage pp7 4 log tr 1 1 claims based on challenge with parvovirus model bacteriophage bacterial virus pp7 4 lrv for pp7 bacteriophage per parenteral drug association pda tr 41 rating method for small virus retentive filters were placed alongside glass filters ftksv4047025 filters were sealed with 47 mm rubber o ring on the outside fig 1 the membranes allowed diffusion of water through the chambers while retaining seeded microorganisms inside chambers due to the narrow width of chambers and fibrous membranes allowing for fluidity the conditions inside the chambers were assumed to be in equilibrium with pond conditions outside the chambers sidhu and toze 2012 sufficient chambers 64 were assembled with sludge from the respective wsp seeded with bacteria viruses and coliphage assembled chambers were inserted into racks and attached to a steel platform the platform accommodated two levels 22 cm apart housing the racks containing the chambers the platform was positioned into the sludge layer with 32 chambers placed at the lower sludge level 30 cm from the bottom of the pond b30 and 32 chambers placed at the upper sludge level 50 cm from the bottom of the pond b50 the platform was deployed 13 m from the edge of the pond from a suspended line that had been fixed across a corner of the pond supp fig 2 grab samples 12 were collected from the influent of the facultative pond at 3 5 locations in the pond at approximately 30 50 cm from the base of the pond to comprise a composite sludge sample 5 l to set up the chambers a 500 ml sludge sample was inoculated with 30 ml each of e coli enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage cultures as well as 50 ml of hadv to a total of 230 ml of inoculant to 500 ml sludge prior to the setting up the pathogen decay chambers the bacterial isolates were cultured in nutrient broth on a shaking platform at 37 c all bacterial cultures were washed twice in 25 ml sterile phosphate buffer by centrifugation at 3381 g for 3 min and then resuspended in phosphate buffer

ms2 1 1010 of somatic coliphage pfu ml 1 and 1 106 pcr detectable units pdu ml 1 of hadv inoculants and sludge were homogenized and used to fill chambers 6 8 ml sludge used inside chambers contained an average of 12 5 dry solids ds g 1 while sludge outside chambers tested at each event contained an average of 1 98 ds g 1 2 4 collection of samples a number of chambers 64 were prepared so that destructive sampling could occur over the entire experiment chambers were placed into steel racks and positioned at two levels 32 upper 32 lower sample chambers were collected at time 0 and then every week until week 3 sampling frequency was then reduced to fortnightly intervals and then sampled at weeks 10 and 15 until the rate of inactivation could be extrapolated from the slope of the inactivation curve and the winter period was complete at each sampling event 1 chamber was randomly selected from each of the racks in each treatment to a total of 4 chambers per depth 4 2 sludge from the pond was also sampled from three to five locations in the wsp at each event a total of six to eight grab samples of untreated wastewater were analyzed for each of the microbiological parameters to compare changes in the number of indicators and pathogens outside chambers with those inside chambers all samples were transported on ice to csiro dutton park queensland and processed within 24 h 2 5 quantification of e coli enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage contents from the collected chambers 6 8 ml were transferred into pre weighed sterile tubes and the net weights obtained a serial tenfold dilution was made in phosphate buffer for 1 ml sludge sample for the detection of e coli enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage all target bacteria were quantified by spread plating 100 μl of serial dilutions onto the appropriate selective agar plates in triplicate as described by sidhu et al 2008 2010 e coli were quantified on chromocult coliform agar merck kenilworth usa and enterococcus spp on chromocult enterococci agar merck kenilworth usa inoculated plates were incubated at 37 c overnight after which typical colonies were counted and numbers expressed as cfu ml 1 the quantification of ms2 and somatic coliphage was carried out by the standard double layer agar method using e coli hs pfamp r atcc 700891 and e coli c atcc 13706 as hosts with the standard double overlay method havelaar and hogeboom 1984 clear plaques were counted to determine the average pfu ml 1 after overnight incubation at 37 c 2 6 molecular quantification of hadv by rt qpcr at the time of nucleic acid extraction

all 51 types of human adenovirus standard curves were prepared for each run using purified plasmid dna containing the hadv inserts as described in sidhu et al 2013 amplicons for the quantification of hadv were custom synthesised by idt custom gene synthesis coralville ia usa purified recombinant plasmids containing target amplicon was produced by integrated dna technologies pidtsmart with ampicillin idt and cloned into a vector followed by plasmid extraction coralville ia usa a 10 fold serial dilution ranging from 1 106 to 1 100 copies per μl of dna extract was prepared from the synthesized plasmid dna a 1 μl template from each dilution was used to prepare a standard curve for each standard the pdu were plotted against the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal increased above the quantification cycle value cq value the amplification efficiency e was determined by analysis of the standards and was estimated from the slope of the standard curve as e 10 1 slope thermal cycling conditions were as outlined in sidhu et al 2010 melt curves were generated as described in sidhu et al 2013 to eliminate false positives 2 7 qpcr limit of detection reproducibility and evaluation of pcr inhibition to determine the qpcr limit of the detection known gene copies i e 107 to 100 of the hadv dna were tested with qpcr the lowest numbers of gene copies

described in sidhu et al 2013 the coefficient of variation cv was calculated using seven dilutions 107 to 100 gene copies of the hadv dna each dilution was tested in triplicate the cv for evaluation of intra assay repeatability was calculated based on the ct value by testing the seven dilutions to obtain information on the level of pcr inhibition sludge dna samples were spiked with known numbers of hadv dna was extracted from inoculants and tested with the qpcr assay as described previously no significant inhibition was observed molecular water blanks were run on each qpcr 96 well plate for negative control and all qpcr measurements were replicated a minimum of three times 2 8 physical wastewater measurements the basic water quality parameters ph temperature dissolved oxygen and

of extraction procedures from sludge were determined by seeding known numbers of the individual target microorganism into sludge samples collected from the site as described in schwarz et al 2014 briefly one g sludge samples n 6 collected from wsp at each sample event t 0 to t 9 from b50 upper depth n 3 and b30 lower depth n 3 were spiked with 500 μl 1 of each of the study microorganisms seeded sludge samples were mixed well bacteria and coliphage were quantified according to section 2 5 for hadv dna was extracted according to section 2 6 in parallel milliq water sample 1 ml was seeded with same number of target microorganisms and cultured or dna was extracted accordingly the cfu ml 1 pfu ml 1 and pdu ml 1 were used to determine the recovery efficiencies after seeding from the sludge all samples were tested separately for the presence of background target microorganisms and background numbers were taken into consideration while determining recovery efficiency recovery efficiency concentration recovered concentration seeded x 100 recovery rates are shown in table 1 2 10 statistical analysis prior to analysis the microbial numbers in each replicate were converted to log10 values using log10 n 1 in which n is the microbial number of each organism the associated standard deviations trend lines and logarithmic transformations of raw data were performed in origin 7 originlab corporation northampton ma 1991 2000 for each individual microorganism a generalized linear model of analysis of variance anova fitting a number of fixed effects was applied using sas version 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa 2002 2012 to identify significant sources of variation affecting pathogen counts log10 count within the individual site these variation sources comprised effects of chamber 4 replicates depth two levels upper lower interaction between depth and chamber linear and quadratic terms of a covariate sampling time linear time and quadratic terms of sampling time time2 that nested either in the chamber or depth or the interaction between depth and chamber the estimated least square effects of fixed factors were then produced overall regression coefficients of linear and quadratic terms of sampling time were used to indicate the average first and second orders of pathogen decay rate across all chambers and depths the specific decay rate within a depth or a chamber was represented by the regression coefficient of the sampling time within the treatment of the individual site based on the estimated linear and quadratic decay rates for either upper or lower depths the decay time for one log10 90 reduction of pathogen count t 90 values was then estimated using the quadratic equation t 90 b b 2 4 a c 2 a a generalized linear model of anova was applied to compare decay rates of each microorganism inside chambers with that outside chambers to determine any relationship between pond temperature ph conductivity or rainfall with decay patterns of individual microorganisms a multiple regression anova analysis was performed by fitting environmental variables as covariates in the model described above the critical p value for declaring a statistical significance was set as 0 05 3 results 3 1 sludge characteristics and climatic conditions basic sludge parameters temperature and rainfall at each sampling event are provided in tables 2 and 3 temperatures in the pond influent ranged from 10 3 to 21 0 c at the upper sludge level b50 and 10 1 21 0 c at the lower sludge level b30 with an average of 13 5 c wind speeds were 4 37 km h 1 median 15 km h 1 mean daily solar exposure ranged from 2 7 to 3 6 kwh m2 average 3 1 kwh m2 3 2 enteric microorganism decay inside diffusion chambers all seeded microorganisms except for ms2 and hadv showed significant decay figs 2 and 3 table 4 comparative rates of decay and one log reduction times t 90 are presented in table 5 enterococci numbers showed a consistent decline of 5 log10 inside the chambers at both depths in general bacteria had shorter decay times t 90 than viruses varying from 13 to 54 days compared with 41 122 days for coliphages and 180 days for hadv ms2 decay times ranged from 69 to 122 days and somatic coliphage ranged from 41 to 42 days a slow reduction of hadv occurred i e 156 d however this decay rate was non significant p 0 5256 regrowth of e coli was observed after 70 days inside chambers as well as an increase in e coli prevalence in the influent in pond outside chambers over the same period these patterns followed the decrease and then increase in pond influent temperature across the winter figs 2a and 3b supp fig 1 3 3 prevalence and abundance of enteric microorganisms in sludge layer the background numbers of target microorganisms in the sludge were monitored over the duration of the experiment and any relationships with the numbers of seeded microorganisms in the diffusion chambers compared table 6 decay patterns of seeded microorganisms were all significantly different p 0 0001 to the abundance or prevalence of microorganisms that occurred naturally in the sludge layer outside of the chambers figs 2 and 3 3 4 influence of pond conditions on microorganisms pond temperatures are shown in fig 3b statistical relationships between sludge parameters and numbers of seeded microorganisms in the chambers are shown in table 4 there was no light intensity recorded by the dataloggers at either of the sludge depths b30 and b50 as attributed to turbidity inside chambers conductivity levels were significantly related to the decline of enterococci p 0 0111 bacteriophage ms2 p 0 0001 and somatic coliphage p 0 0159 table 4 the decline in pond temperature of 10 c from may to july and then slight increase in temperature to 15 c to the end of the experiment fig 3b was statistically related to the changes in ms2 p 0 0001 and somatic coliphage p 0 0161 the ph of the pond was relatively stable over time 6 95 7 35 tables 2 and 3 and significantly related to the consistent rate of decay of ms2 p 0 0001 inside the chambers table 4 there was no influence of rainfall events on bacteria decay patterns the statistical relationships between pond conditions and abundance of microorganisms in the pond influent are shown in table 6 in the pond sludge outside chambers conductivity was significantly related to the stability of enterococci p 0 0026 and the decay of ms2 p 0 0001 changes in pond temperature were significantly correlated with the prevalence of somatic coliphage p 0 0244 regular rainfall events with increasing rainfall levels were significantly correlated to the decreasing numbers of ms2 p 0 0013 3 5 influence of depth e coli decay was significantly faster in the chambers placed at the upper sludge layer p 0 0215 time depth table 4 there was no significant difference in decay rates between depths for the other study microorganisms indicating that depth did not influence their decay or survival patterns 4 discussion despite advanced wastewater treatment technologies the removal efficiency of pathogenic microorganisms micro pollutants and organic contaminants presents a major challenge in sludge gomez et al 2017 hai et al 2016 luo et al 2014 the emphasis of this study was to examine the efficacy of wsp systems to reduce a range of microbial contaminants and to identify any environmental factors that may influence decay from within the pond ecosystem decay rates of fecal indicator bacteria fib and pathogenic bacteria are related to microorganism type nelson and darby 2002 sinton et al 2002 in the present study all study microorganisms inside the diffusion chambers showed unique patterns of decay except hadv the overall decay rate k d from fastest to slowest was enterococci e coli somatic coliphage f specific bacteriophage and hadv this ranking was partially influenced by the quantitation methodology culture vs pcr adenoviruses were most abundant and persistent in wastewater and were found to have the longest survival times this is in agreement with previous studies in which adenovirus are known to show very little decay in sludge recreational water and biosolids thus posing a greater health risk eregno et al 2018 ogorzaly et al 2010 schwarz et al 2014 toze et al 2012 both temperature and season are known to influence decay rates lucena et al 2005 at lower temperatures i e 4 c degradation of organic matter and decay rates of bacteria and viruses are significantly slowed eregno et al 2018 schneiter et al 1993 in the present study the changes in temperature were statistically related to changes in somatic coliphage as well as bacteriophage ms2 numbers bacteriophage ms2 have been reported to be influenced by temperature and ph with phage inactivation being higher at 30 c than 15 c chandran et al 2009 in the present study minimum mean temperatures in the influent in pond ranged from 10 to 13 c during the winter which may have also contributed to the low rate of decay of hadv the bacteria tested in the present study had similar decay rates across winter which was in agreement with sinton et al 2002 the authors found that fecal coliform and enterococci had similar decay rates across the winter but enterococci were inactivated more rapidly during the summer chandran et al 2009 found that enterococcus faecalis displayed better survival at 15 c compared to the rapid declines that occurred at 30 c oxidation of organics in the water column settling of suspended solids and benthal solids digestion proceed simultaneously in wsp systems and temperature can play a key role in controlling these processes as it is closely related to the microbial activity and the net rate of solids accumulation papadopoulos et al 2003 schneiter et al 1993 it is possible that pathogen decay during the summer could be faster and this warrants further investigation particularly across different temperate zones and climates in general a lack of correlation exists between decay rates for bacterial indicators and decay rates of adenovirus and bacteriophage in environmental water samples due to different survival and transport characteristics inactivation rates and regrowth potential and as such their presence is not well represented by fib bushon 2003 dobrowsky et al 2014 ferguson et al 2012 okoh et al 2010 most bacterial pathogens decay within months whereas the decay of viral pathogens can take several years nelson et al 2004 wsps have been reported to be efficient in the removal of e coli and other fib within the sludge column nelson et al 2004 in the present study the bacteria had shorter decay times than the viruses the observed decay rates were slower than the range reported in the literature for wastewater noble et al 2004 rose et al 1996 toze 1997 wen et al 2009 the observed lower enterococci removal efficiency could be due to facultative conditions in our study pond data reported in the literature is mostly from the maturation ponds which tend to be shallower or well aerated large systems enterococcus spp and fecal coliforms have been considered good indicators for assessing the effectiveness of municipal waste treatment and display some resistance to temperature lepeuple et al 2004 in the present study enterococci showed consistent decay over time which was not statistically related to changes in pond temperature coliphages may be a more reliable indicator for human viruses in sludge than bacteria arraj et al 2005 bushon 2003 ferguson et al 2012 mocé llivina et al 2003 and are easy to enumerate lepeuple et al 2004 a novel feature in this study was the ability to seed and contain the study microorganisms within diffusion chambers so that no new bacteria or viruses could be introduced during the experiment and inactivation rates could be calculated because of the chamber design no loss of microorganisms could occur across the membranes and therefore the reduction of numbers was attributed to either die off or recovery efficiency from the samples it should be noted that the sludge contained within the diffusion chambers was slightly higher 12 5 ds g 1 see section 2 3 than that of the surrounding sludge fraction 2 ds g 1 thus providing for a worse case scenario the placement of the experiment during the winter was also to capture worse case decay times whereby the conditions i e cooler temperatures longer cloud cover reduced uv light increased rainfall events would be more favorable for survival this was also the deciding factor in the pond selection the first pond in the series depth from 1 6 to 2 1 m to test pathogen decay times where the sludge accumulation would be greatest and closest to an evacuation event inside the chambers conductivity had a significant relationship p 0 003 with enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage decay rates but not e coli or hadv in the sludge fraction outside chambers conductivity was also significantly related to enterococci and ms2 decay patterns but not somatic coliphage the conductivity of water is directly related to the concentration of ions in the water conductive ions come from dissolved salts and inorganic materials such as alkalis chlorides sulphides and carbonate compounds ms2 have been shown to decrease in survivability in differing levels of salinity and ion concentrations governal and gerba 1997 sunlight inactivation has also been shown to increase with increasing salinity john and rose 2005 sinton et al 2002 also salinity has been known to influence the deposition of coliform bacteria into sediments thus prolonging their survival roper and marshall 2009 the decay rates of bacteria can be influenced by their ability to repopulate in ponds e coli decay patterns abundance and regrowth were observed to follow similar pattern both inside and outside the chambers this indicates that the results obtained using the decay chambers were comparable to the natural environment within the pond for this study the levels and types of nutrients present may support persistence and even repopulation of enteric bacterial pathogens in this study regrowth was observed for e coli after 70 days inside the chambers with an increase in e coli prevalence in the influent in the pond over the same period these patterns also followed increases in pond temperature supp fig 1 regrowth of fecal coliforms salmonella and opportunistic pathogens such as mycobacterium aeromonas pseudomonas and legionella in wastewater matrices have been reported previously gibbs et al 1997 jjemba et al 2010 schwarz et al 2014 sidhu et al 2001 zaleski et al 2005 this needs to be taken into consideration in warmer climatic conditions when using e coli as an indicator for pathogen removal efficacy in this study bacteria decayed fastest in the upper layer of the sludge whereas hadv and bacteriophage showed no or very little significant decay at depth enteric viruses have been reported to remain stable in the environment for prolonged periods when associated with solids in sediments bosch 1998 okoh et al 2010 prolonged survival in the deep sludge may also be explained by aggregation or attachment to other particles da silva et al 2011 this warrants further investigation into the factors that may influence virus persistence at depths below 1 m since viruses in sludge layers could later be resuspended or transported during associated movement events keffala et al 2013 okoh et al 2010 acidity is an important factor influencing phage stability in aquatic environments jończyk et al 2011 the optimum for physical stability of bacteriophage t7 phage has been reported in buffer as ph 6 to 8 kerby et al 1949 with the lowest inactivation of ms2 observed at ph 6 to 8 and temperatures of 5 to 35 c feng et al 2003 some insignificant losses of infectivity occur near ph 7 sharp et al 1946 jończyk et al 2011 in the present study the sludge ph levels ranged 6 7 to 8 5 over the duration of the experiment tables 2 and 3 with the steady decline of bacteriophage ms2 inside the chambers statistically correlated with ph this suggests that neutral ph may provide a more stable environment for the bacteriophage to persist while resulting in a consistent rate of decay as ph increases above 7 0 protozoan and helminth parasites tend to survive for a long time in sludge despite not examined in this study they may also be of concern which warrants further investigation consideration must also be given to helminth parasites such as hookworm ancylostoma duodenale and threadworm strongyloides stercoralis which may pose public health risks in agricultural soil depending on the management reuse options stevens et al 2017 verbyla et al 2016 5 conclusion pathogen content in the sludge fraction of wastewater is a serious issue particularly due to extensive use of wsp in regional areas of australia many rural and regional municipalities rely on wsp systems as cost efficient modes for wastewater treatment the novel findings for this study demonstrate decay rates are influenced by a number of physicochemical and environmental indices such as pond temperature conductivity ph season and rainfall bacteria decayed faster than the viruses and virus survival is prolonged with the depth of the sludge fraction hadv removal is difficult due to very slow decay treatment pond sludge conditions may be favorable to the survival and even repopulation of some pathogenic contaminants particularly bacteria and as such e coli is not a reliable indicator for pathogenic

18965,the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a waste stabilization pond wsp system to reduce pathogen contaminants in sludge this included examining the factors that influence the fate and concentration of human pathogens and their indicators in two sludge layers the decay rates of five study microorganisms were determined under in situ conditions at a wsp the background levels of fecal origin microorganisms were consistently detected ranging escherichia coli 104 to 106 enterococci 101 to 103 f specific bacteriophage ms2 101 to 103 and somatic coliphage 101 to 104 colony forming units cfu ml 1 as well as 101 to 102 human adenovirus gene copies ml 1 in the primary facultative pond among microorganisms tested the bacteria generally decayed faster than adenovirus and bacteriophage particularly in the upper sludge layer due to the observed regrowth of e coli it may have a limited value as an indicator for pathogen removal in the wastewater stabilization ponds the abundance of e coli numbers within the pond biome followed changes in pond temperature over time the results of the study suggest that viruses could survive for a long time particularly in deeper layers 1 metre in the sludge during winter months t 90 156 d the presence of human pathogens in wsp sludge in particular viruses may be a barrier to its beneficial reuse in agriculture the results indicate that additional treatment of sludge may be required to mitigate potential public health risks from reuse of sludge for agricultural purposes graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater stabilization pond sludge adenovirus bacteriophage pathogen decay 1 introduction global demand for potable and non potable water continues to increase due to the impacts of climate change population growth and anthropogenic pollutants which all threaten the sustainability of water supplies in order to reuse wastewater and sludge for beneficial purposes such as soil amendment and nutrient source pritchard et al 2010 a better understanding of the factors which influence the decay of pathogens in waste stabilization pond wsp systems is essential the ability to reuse wastewater is attracting more interest where demands on freshwater need to be reduced sato et al 2013 waste stabilization ponds are frequently used around the world for wastewater treatment in small communities towns and regions with large areas of land but limited capital investment verbyla et al 2016 they are effective and provide a cost effective method of treating sewage effluent in rural communities coggins et al 2017 the majority of regional communities in western australian use wsp technology however it is not known how efficient the first stage of the treatment process in pathogen removal treated water from wsp systems is often used for irrigation and the extent to which concomitant health risks may occur to the public from contaminants is unknown hamilton et al 2006 rhind 2009 toze 2006 with a better understanding of parameters to monitor for quality and their interactions further potential reuse options may exist to convert wsp sludge into a valuable resource the primary purpose of the facultative pond in a wastewater treatment system is to stabilize organic matter reduce nutrient load and to remove biochemical oxygen demand bod in the effluent a lesser objective is to reduce pathogens this usually occurs further in the series such as the maturation pond which is often subject to further disinfection processes i e chlorination orruño et al 2014 in contrast to large urban wastewater treatment plants with more advanced treatment processes rural treatment plants use simpler technologies such as wsp systems or lagoons ho et al 2017 ouedraogo et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 there is limited scientific data available on the effectiveness of the primary facultative pond to reduce pathogens in sludge the lack of information on factors influencing sludge quality has made the management of sludge an environmental challenge particularly in regards to pathogen reduction an analysis of environmental factors relating to pathogen decay could provide critical information for the management of wastewater and could assist with reuse options hamilton et al 2006 information on pathogen removal in sludge layers is limited in this paper the surface layer 1 m is referred to as wastewater 98 water and the thicker viscous wastewater regarded as sludge 1 m with up to 12 dry solids 87 water the sediment fraction is regarded as the most hazardous since pathogens associated with particles settle over time into the sediment where survival may be prolonged due to the prevalence of anoxic to anaerobic conditions pathogens may become resuspended and be transported due to environmental events such as high rainfall or high water inflow events keffala et al 2013 the conditions in wastewater treatment ponds may be adverse to the survival of pathogenic microorganisms sah et al 2012 von sperling 2007 the environmental factors that may influence decay include ultraviolet uv light high ph dissolved oxygen levels pond temperature and nutrient level byappanahalli et al 2012 a number of studies have investigated the decay of pathogenic microorganisms in reed beds aquifers seawater and freshwater sources examining effects of temperature and solar radiation on pathogen decay deller et al 2006 noble et al 2004 sidhu and toze 2012 sidhu et al 2010 sinton et al 1999 young et al 2016 little is known about pathogen fate and concentrations in particular viruses and fecal indicator organisms in sludge from wsp systems using naturally occurring inoculants as target microorganisms kitajima et al 2014 maynard et al 1999 verbyla et al 2016 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 the aim of this research was to study the efficacy of a primary facultative pond to reduce enteric microorganisms in the sludge layer specific objectives included i determine decay rates using diffusion chambers for viruses f specific bacteriophage ms2 somatic coliphage enteric bacteria e coli and enterococci and human adenovirus hadv ii examine change in decay rates rate at two sludge depths iii compare decay rates with the prevalence of the same viruses and bacteria from the sludge iv correlation between routinely monitored physicochemical parameters uv intensity temperature ph and electrical conductivity with decay rates over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a pathogen decay experiment was conducted over 3 months at a restricted wwtp in western australia in may 2017 the plant treats sewage from a regional town with 346 connections the site is located 100 km east of perth 3 km from the township servicing 1304 residential water connections and 95 residential sewer connections with an estimated sludge accumulation rate of 0 027 to 0 032 m3 person 1 year 1 the site comprised of three ponds in a combination of facultative and maturation ponds in series with an average flow rate capacity of 110 m3 d 1 and a total storage volume of 24 ml the system is designed to treat wastewater to secondary standard nitrogen and phosphorus removal the system contained one primary 7245 m3 facultative ponds used in study one secondary 3105 m3 facultative pond and one tertiary 1987 m3 facultative pond all parallel with one 11250 m3 storage pond the primary pond used in this study had a design depth of 2 10 m profiled depth of 1 60 m with an average sludge depth of 0 40 m 1 0 average solids resulting in 11 tonnes dry solids in situ the system is evacuated desludged approximately every 8 years and at the time of sampling sludge was due to be removed the sludge that had accumulated in the ponds receiving wastewater was estimated to occupy 22 of the pond s volume the total theoretical hrt for this system at the time of sampling was considered to be 26 30 days treated wastewater from the storage pond is used for woodlot irrigation on agricultural land 2 2 microorganisms used in the study the five microorganisms tested were isolates derived from sludge sampled collected from the study pond wild type escherichia coli e coli enterococcus spp bacteriophage ms2 somatic coliphage and adenovirus hadv e coli numbers were previously determined as 105 to 106 colony forming units cfu ml 1 environmental isolates were plated onto selective culture media chromocult coliform agar and chromocult enterococci agar merck kenilworth usa incubated at 37 c overnight purified cultures were stored in nutrient broth containing 10 glycerol at 80 c ms2 isolates were cultured using e coli host hs pfamp r atcc 700891 cells american type culture collection manassas va usa in tryptone yeast broth oxoid limited hampshire uk as outlined in sidhu et al 2008 somatic coliphage isolates were cultured in tryptone yeast extract broth oxoid limited hampshire uk with an e coli c atcc 13706 host the standard double layer agar method was used for both as described in sidhu et al 2008 coliphage suspensions were washed twice in 25 ml sterile phosphate buffer and centrifuged adenovirus strain 41 atcc vr 930 was cultured in llk cell line by the pathology centre wa the virus was then harvested and frozen at 80 c as described by sidhu et al 2013 2 3 diffusion chambers the decay study was conducted in situ using diffusion chambers the chambers were a modification of the chambers used in toze et al 2012 briefly teflon chambers 25 mm diameter internal capacity of 7 ml were constructed two mesh discs 47 5 mm 1525 1000 mm stainless woven mesh 0 71 aperture and 0 32 wire were fitted either end two 47 mm glass fibre filters with a binder ap2504700 were fitted with a pore size of 0 025 μm merck millipore burlington ma to prevent the loss of seeded microbial pathogens two pegasus sv4 virus removal membrane filter discs pall corporation pall port washington ny usa with pore size 20 nm capable of the retention of bacteriophage pp7 4 log tr 1 1 claims based on challenge with parvovirus model bacteriophage bacterial virus pp7 4 lrv for pp7 bacteriophage per parenteral drug association pda tr 41 rating method for small virus retentive filters were placed alongside glass filters ftksv4047025 filters were sealed with 47 mm rubber o ring on the outside fig 1 the membranes allowed diffusion of water through the chambers while retaining seeded microorganisms inside chambers due to the narrow width of chambers and fibrous membranes allowing for fluidity the conditions inside the chambers were assumed to be in equilibrium with pond conditions outside the chambers sidhu and toze 2012 sufficient chambers 64 were assembled with sludge from the respective wsp seeded with bacteria viruses and coliphage assembled chambers were inserted into racks and attached to a steel platform the platform accommodated two levels 22 cm apart housing the racks containing the chambers the platform was positioned into the sludge layer with 32 chambers placed at the lower sludge level 30 cm from the bottom of the pond b30 and 32 chambers placed at the upper sludge level 50 cm from the bottom of the pond b50 the platform was deployed 13 m from the edge of the pond from a suspended line that had been fixed across a corner of the pond supp fig 2 grab samples 12 were collected from the influent of the facultative pond at 3 5 locations in the pond at approximately 30 50 cm from the base of the pond to comprise a composite sludge sample 5 l to set up the chambers a 500 ml sludge sample was inoculated with 30 ml each of e coli enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage cultures as well as 50 ml of hadv to a total of 230 ml of inoculant to 500 ml sludge prior to the setting up the pathogen decay chambers the bacterial isolates were cultured in nutrient broth on a shaking platform at 37 c all bacterial cultures were washed twice in 25 ml sterile phosphate buffer by centrifugation at 3381 g for 3 min and then resuspended in phosphate buffer to remove culture media sidhu et al 2010 the suspension was used to seed pond sludge to achieve a final number of 108 cfu ml 1 of each bacteria and more than 1 1011 plaque forming units pfu ml 1 of ms2 1 1010 of somatic coliphage pfu ml 1 and 1 106 pcr detectable units pdu ml 1 of hadv inoculants and sludge were homogenized and used to fill chambers 6 8 ml sludge used inside chambers contained an average of 12 5 dry solids ds g 1 while sludge outside chambers tested at each event contained an average of 1 98 ds g 1 2 4 collection of samples a number of chambers 64 were prepared so that destructive sampling could occur over the entire experiment chambers were placed into steel racks and positioned at two levels 32 upper 32 lower sample chambers were collected at time 0 and then every week until week 3 sampling frequency was then reduced to fortnightly intervals and then sampled at weeks 10 and 15 until the rate of inactivation could be extrapolated from the slope of the inactivation curve and the winter period was complete at each sampling event 1 chamber was randomly selected from each of the racks in each treatment to a total of 4 chambers per depth 4 2 sludge from the pond was also sampled from three to five locations in the wsp at each event a total of six to eight grab samples of untreated wastewater were analyzed for each of the microbiological parameters to compare changes in the number of indicators and pathogens outside chambers with those inside chambers all samples were transported on ice to csiro dutton park queensland and processed within 24 h 2 5 quantification of e coli enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage contents from the collected chambers 6 8 ml were transferred into pre weighed sterile tubes and the net weights obtained a serial tenfold dilution was made in phosphate buffer for 1 ml sludge sample for the detection of e coli enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage all target bacteria were quantified by spread plating 100 μl of serial dilutions onto the appropriate selective agar plates in triplicate as described by sidhu et al 2008 2010 e coli were quantified on chromocult coliform agar merck kenilworth usa and enterococcus spp on chromocult enterococci agar merck kenilworth usa inoculated plates were incubated at 37 c overnight after which typical colonies were counted and numbers expressed as cfu ml 1 the quantification of ms2 and somatic coliphage was carried out by the standard double layer agar method using e coli hs pfamp r atcc 700891 and e coli c atcc 13706 as hosts with the standard double overlay method havelaar and hogeboom 1984 clear plaques were counted to determine the average pfu ml 1 after overnight incubation at 37 c 2 6 molecular quantification of hadv by rt qpcr at the time of nucleic acid extraction

all 51 types of human adenovirus standard curves were prepared for each run using purified plasmid dna containing the hadv inserts as described in sidhu et al 2013 amplicons for the quantification of hadv were custom synthesised by idt custom gene synthesis coralville ia usa purified recombinant plasmids containing target amplicon was produced by integrated dna technologies pidtsmart with ampicillin idt and cloned into a vector followed by plasmid extraction coralville ia usa a 10 fold serial dilution ranging from 1 106 to 1 100 copies per μl of dna extract was prepared from the synthesized plasmid dna a 1 μl template from each dilution was used to prepare a standard curve for each standard the pdu were plotted against the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal increased above the quantification cycle value cq value the amplification efficiency e was determined by analysis of the standards and was estimated from the slope of the standard curve as e 10 1 slope thermal cycling conditions were as outlined in sidhu et al 2010 melt curves were generated as described in sidhu et al 2013 to eliminate false positives 2 7 qpcr limit of detection reproducibility and evaluation of pcr inhibition to determine the qpcr limit of the detection known gene copies i e 107 to 100 of the hadv dna were tested with qpcr the lowest numbers of gene copies

of extraction procedures from sludge were determined by seeding known numbers of the individual target microorganism into sludge samples collected from the site as described in schwarz et al 2014 briefly one g sludge samples n 6 collected from wsp at each sample event t 0 to t 9 from b50 upper depth n 3 and b30 lower depth n 3 were spiked with 500 μl 1 of each of the study microorganisms

seeded with same number of target microorganisms and cultured or dna was extracted accordingly the cfu ml 1 pfu ml 1 and pdu ml 1 were used to determine the recovery efficiencies after seeding from the sludge all samples were tested separately for the presence of background target microorganisms and background numbers were taken into consideration while determining recovery efficiency recovery efficiency concentration recovered concentration seeded x 100 recovery rates are shown in table 1 2 10 statistical analysis prior to analysis the microbial numbers in each replicate were converted to log10 values using log10 n 1 in which n is the microbial number of each organism the associated standard deviations trend lines and logarithmic transformations of raw data were performed in origin 7 originlab corporation northampton ma 1991 2000 for each individual microorganism a generalized linear model of analysis of variance anova fitting a number of fixed effects was applied using sas version 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa 2002 2012 to identify significant sources of variation affecting pathogen counts log10 count within the individual site these variation sources comprised effects of chamber 4 replicates depth two levels upper lower interaction between depth and chamber linear and quadratic terms of a covariate sampling time linear time and quadratic terms of sampling time time2 that nested either in the chamber or depth or the interaction between depth and chamber the estimated least square effects of fixed factors were then produced overall regression coefficients of linear and quadratic terms of sampling time were used to indicate the average first and second orders of pathogen decay rate across all chambers and depths the specific decay rate within a depth or a chamber was represented by the regression coefficient of the sampling time within the treatment of the individual site based on the estimated linear and quadratic decay rates for either upper or lower depths the decay time for one log10 90 reduction of pathogen count t 90 values was then estimated using the quadratic equation t 90 b b 2 4 a c 2 a a generalized linear model of anova was applied to compare decay rates of each microorganism inside chambers with that outside chambers to determine any relationship between pond temperature ph conductivity or rainfall with decay patterns of individual microorganisms a multiple regression anova analysis was performed by fitting environmental variables as covariates in the model described above the critical p value for declaring a statistical significance was set as 0 05 3 results 3 1 sludge characteristics and climatic conditions basic sludge parameters temperature and rainfall at each sampling event are provided in tables 2 and 3 temperatures in the pond influent ranged from 10 3 to 21 0 c at the upper sludge level b50 and 10 1 21 0 c at the lower sludge level b30 with an average of 13 5 c wind speeds were 4 37 km h 1 median 15 km h 1 mean daily solar exposure ranged from 2 7 to 3 6 kwh m2 average 3 1 kwh m2 3 2 enteric microorganism decay inside diffusion chambers all seeded microorganisms except for ms2 and hadv showed significant decay figs 2 and 3 table 4 comparative rates of decay and one log reduction times t 90 are presented in table 5 enterococci numbers showed a consistent decline of 5 log10 inside the chambers at both depths in general bacteria had shorter decay times t 90 than viruses varying from 13 to 54 days compared with 41 122 days for coliphages and 180 days for hadv ms2 decay times ranged from 69 to 122 days and somatic coliphage ranged from 41 to 42 days a slow reduction of hadv occurred i e 156 d however this decay rate was non significant p 0 5256 regrowth of e coli was observed after 70 days inside chambers as well as an increase in e coli prevalence in the influent in pond outside chambers over the same period these patterns followed the decrease and then increase in pond influent temperature across the winter figs 2a and 3b supp fig 1 3 3 prevalence and abundance of enteric microorganisms in sludge layer the background numbers of target microorganisms in the sludge were monitored over the duration of the experiment and any relationships with the numbers of seeded microorganisms in the diffusion chambers compared table 6 decay patterns of seeded microorganisms were all significantly different p 0 0001 to the abundance or prevalence of microorganisms that occurred naturally in the sludge layer outside of the chambers figs 2 and 3 3 4 influence of pond conditions on microorganisms pond temperatures are shown in fig 3b statistical relationships between sludge parameters and numbers of seeded microorganisms in the chambers are shown in table 4 there was no light intensity recorded by the dataloggers at either of the sludge depths b30 and b50 as attributed to turbidity inside chambers conductivity levels were significantly related to the decline of enterococci p 0 0111 bacteriophage ms2 p 0 0001 and somatic coliphage p 0 0159 table 4 the decline in pond temperature of 10 c from may to july and then slight increase in temperature to 15 c to the end of the experiment fig 3b was statistically related to the changes in ms2 p 0 0001 and somatic coliphage p 0 0161 the ph of the pond was relatively stable over time 6 95 7 35 tables 2 and 3 and significantly related to the consistent rate of decay of ms2 p 0 0001 inside the chambers table 4 there was no influence of rainfall events on bacteria decay patterns the statistical relationships between pond conditions and abundance of microorganisms in the pond influent are shown in table 6 in the pond sludge outside chambers conductivity was significantly related to the stability of enterococci p 0 0026 and the decay of ms2 p 0 0001 changes in pond temperature were significantly correlated with the prevalence of somatic coliphage p 0 0244 regular rainfall events with increasing rainfall levels were significantly correlated to the decreasing numbers of ms2 p 0 0013 3 5 influence of depth e coli decay was significantly faster in the chambers placed at the upper sludge layer p 0 0215 time depth table 4 there was no significant difference in decay rates between depths for the other study microorganisms indicating that depth did not influence their decay or survival patterns 4 discussion despite advanced wastewater treatment technologies the removal efficiency of pathogenic microorganisms micro pollutants and organic contaminants presents a major challenge in sludge gomez et al 2017 hai et al 2016 luo et al 2014 the emphasis of this study was to examine the efficacy of wsp systems to reduce a range of microbial contaminants and to identify any environmental factors that may influence decay from within the pond ecosystem decay rates of fecal indicator bacteria fib and pathogenic bacteria are related to microorganism type nelson and darby 2002 sinton et al 2002 in the present study all study microorganisms inside the diffusion chambers showed unique patterns of decay except hadv the overall decay rate k d from fastest to slowest was enterococci e coli somatic coliphage f specific bacteriophage and hadv this ranking was partially influenced by the quantitation methodology culture vs pcr adenoviruses were most abundant and persistent in wastewater and were found to have the longest survival times this is in agreement with previous studies in which adenovirus are known to show very little decay in sludge recreational water and biosolids thus posing a greater health risk eregno et al 2018 ogorzaly et al 2010 schwarz et al 2014 toze et al 2012 both temperature and season are known to influence decay rates lucena et al 2005 at lower temperatures i e 4 c degradation of organic matter and decay rates of bacteria and viruses are significantly slowed eregno et al 2018 schneiter et al 1993 in the present study the changes in temperature were statistically related to changes in somatic coliphage as well as bacteriophage ms2 numbers bacteriophage ms2 have been reported to be influenced by temperature and ph with phage inactivation being higher at 30 c than 15 c chandran et al 2009 in the present study minimum mean temperatures in the influent in pond ranged from 10 to 13 c during the winter which may have also contributed to the low rate of decay of hadv the bacteria tested in the present study had similar decay rates across winter which was in agreement with sinton et al 2002 the authors found that fecal coliform and enterococci had similar decay rates across the winter but enterococci were inactivated more rapidly during the summer chandran et al 2009 found that enterococcus faecalis displayed better survival at 15 c compared to the rapid declines that occurred at 30 c oxidation of organics in the water column settling of suspended solids and benthal solids digestion proceed simultaneously in wsp systems and temperature can play a key role in controlling these processes as it is closely related to the microbial activity and the net rate of solids accumulation papadopoulos et al 2003 schneiter et al 1993 it is possible that pathogen decay during the summer could be faster and this warrants further investigation particularly across different temperate zones and climates in general a lack of correlation exists between decay rates for bacterial indicators and decay rates of adenovirus and bacteriophage in environmental water samples due to different survival and transport characteristics inactivation rates and regrowth potential and as such their presence is not well represented by fib bushon 2003 dobrowsky et al 2014 ferguson et al 2012 okoh et al 2010 most bacterial pathogens decay within months whereas the decay of viral pathogens can take several years nelson et al 2004 wsps have been reported to be efficient in the removal of e coli and other fib within the sludge column nelson et al 2004 in the present study the bacteria had shorter decay times than the viruses the observed decay rates were slower than the range reported in the literature for wastewater noble et al 2004 rose et al 1996 toze 1997 wen et al 2009 the observed lower enterococci removal efficiency could be due to facultative conditions in our study pond data reported in the literature is mostly from the maturation ponds which tend to be shallower or well aerated large systems enterococcus spp and fecal coliforms have been considered good indicators for assessing the effectiveness of municipal waste treatment and display some resistance to temperature lepeuple et al 2004 in the present study enterococci showed consistent decay over time which was not statistically related to changes in pond temperature coliphages may be a more reliable indicator for human viruses in sludge than bacteria arraj et al 2005 bushon 2003 ferguson et al 2012 mocé llivina et al 2003 and are easy to enumerate lepeuple et al 2004 a novel feature in this study was the ability to seed and contain the study microorganisms within diffusion chambers so that no new bacteria or viruses could be introduced during the experiment and inactivation rates could be calculated because of the chamber design no loss of microorganisms could occur across the membranes and therefore the reduction of numbers was attributed to either die off or recovery efficiency from the samples it should be noted that the sludge contained within the diffusion chambers was slightly higher 12 5 ds g 1 see section 2 3 than that of the surrounding sludge fraction 2 ds g 1 thus providing for a worse case scenario the placement of the experiment during the winter was also to capture worse case decay times whereby the conditions i e cooler temperatures longer cloud cover reduced uv light increased rainfall events would be more favorable for survival this was also the deciding factor in the pond selection the first pond in the series depth from 1 6 to 2 1 m to test pathogen decay times where the sludge accumulation would be greatest and closest to an evacuation event inside the chambers conductivity had a significant relationship p 0 003 with enterococci ms2 and somatic coliphage decay rates but not e coli or hadv in the sludge fraction outside chambers conductivity was also significantly related to enterococci and ms2 decay patterns but not somatic coliphage the conductivity of water is directly related to the concentration of ions in the water conductive ions come from dissolved salts and inorganic materials such as alkalis chlorides sulphides and carbonate compounds ms2 have been shown to decrease in survivability in differing levels of salinity and ion concentrations governal and gerba 1997 sunlight inactivation has also been shown to increase with increasing salinity john and rose 2005 sinton et al 2002 also salinity has been known to influence the deposition of coliform bacteria into sediments thus prolonging their survival roper and marshall 2009 the decay rates of bacteria can be influenced by their ability to repopulate in ponds e coli decay patterns abundance and regrowth were observed to follow similar pattern both inside and outside the chambers this indicates that the results obtained using the decay chambers were comparable to the natural environment within the pond for this study the levels and types of nutrients present may support persistence and even repopulation of enteric bacterial pathogens in this study regrowth was observed for e coli after 70 days inside the chambers with an increase in e coli prevalence in the influent in the pond over the same period these patterns also followed increases in pond temperature supp fig 1 regrowth of fecal coliforms salmonella and opportunistic pathogens such as mycobacterium aeromonas pseudomonas and legionella in wastewater matrices have been reported previously gibbs et al 1997 jjemba et al 2010 schwarz et al 2014 sidhu et al 2001 zaleski et al 2005 this needs to be taken into consideration in warmer climatic conditions when using e coli as an indicator for pathogen removal efficacy in this study bacteria decayed fastest in the upper layer of the sludge whereas hadv and bacteriophage showed no or very little significant decay at depth enteric viruses have been reported to remain stable in the environment for prolonged periods when associated with solids in sediments bosch 1998 okoh et al 2010 prolonged survival in the deep sludge may also be explained by aggregation or attachment to other particles da silva et al 2011 this warrants further investigation into the factors that may influence virus persistence at depths below 1 m since viruses in sludge layers could later be resuspended or transported during associated movement events keffala et al 2013 okoh et al 2010 acidity is an important factor influencing phage stability in aquatic environments jończyk et al 2011 the optimum for physical stability of bacteriophage t7 phage has been reported in buffer as ph 6 to 8 kerby et al 1949 with the lowest inactivation of ms2 observed at ph 6 to 8 and temperatures of 5 to 35 c feng et al 2003 some insignificant losses of infectivity occur near ph 7 sharp et al 1946 jończyk et al 2011 in the present study the sludge ph levels ranged 6 7 to 8 5 over the duration of the experiment tables 2 and 3 with the steady decline of bacteriophage ms2 inside the chambers statistically correlated with ph this suggests that neutral ph may provide a more stable environment for the bacteriophage to persist while resulting in a consistent rate of decay as ph increases above 7 0 protozoan and helminth parasites tend to survive for a long time in sludge despite not examined in this study they may also be of concern which warrants further investigation consideration must also be given to helminth parasites such as hookworm ancylostoma duodenale and threadworm strongyloides stercoralis which may pose public health risks in agricultural soil depending on the management reuse options stevens et al 2017 verbyla et al 2016 5 conclusion pathogen content in the sludge fraction of wastewater is a serious issue particularly due to extensive use of wsp in regional areas of australia many rural and regional municipalities rely on wsp systems as cost efficient modes for wastewater treatment the novel findings for this study demonstrate decay rates are influenced by a number of physicochemical and environmental indices such as pond temperature conductivity ph season and rainfall bacteria decayed faster than the viruses and virus survival is prolonged with the depth of the sludge fraction hadv removal is difficult due to very slow decay treatment pond sludge conditions may be favorable to the survival and even repopulation of some pathogenic contaminants particularly bacteria and as such e coli is not a reliable indicator for pathogenic contaminants in wsp systems further treatment of sludge may be required to mitigate potential health risks from persistent enteric pathogens prior to the release and or reuse of sludge

18966,as one group of emerging pollutants the threat of organophosphate esters flame retardants and plasticizers opes to drinking water safety is not well recognized now the oral reference dose rfd and oral cancer slope factor sfo of opes have been updated by uspea therefore the threat of opes to drinking water safety could be assessed in this study occurrence health risk and key impact factor of opes in drinking water of china were analyzed covering 79 cities whose population and gross domestic product gdp accounted for 28 8 and 44 1 of them in china respectively total concentration of 14 common opes in drinking water was 13 42 265 48 ng l the exposure level of opes via ingestion of drinking water was much lower than that of food ingestion but was comparable with dust ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption a health assessment for opes via ingestion of drinking water suggested that the potential cancer risk occurred 1 00e 6 but no obvious non carcinogenic effects occurred 1 tris 2 3 dibromopropyl phosphate tdbpp contributed to about 72 4 of carcinogenic risk which should be treated as prior monitoring opes in further studies the occurrence and distribution of opes in drinking water of china have a good corresponding relationship with the aihui tengchong line and drinking water treatment technology dwtt was found to be a key factor total opes halogeno opes and alkyl opes in drinking water from advanced dwtt cities were much lower than those of conventional dwtt cities compared with conventional dwtt advanced dwtt could reduce about 65 6 and 36 5 of carcinogenic risk and non carcinogenic risk of opes respectively considering the annual growth of opes consumption in china and world further studies regarding the environmental threat of opes are required graphical abstract image 1 keywords organophosphate esters drinking water safety national scale exposure health risk key factor 1 introduction organophosphate esters opes are one group of chemical additives which have been used as flame retardants and plasticizers in past decades because of their excellent chemical and physical properties and low cost ali et al 2012 van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2015 kurt karakus et al 2018 since polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecane are in the process of being globally phased out as a substitute the production and consumption of opes are greatly increased in the world anim et al 2017 statistical results showed that opes had a global consumption of 500 000 tons in 2011 and were expected to reach 680 000 tons in 2015 li et al 2018 wang et al 2015 opes can easily release into environmental media during the process of production usage and dismantling because they are additive type retardants without chemical bonding reemtsma et al 2008 as a result opes have been frequently detected in various environmental media khan et al 2016 lee et al 2016 li et al 2014 greaves et al 2016 yadav et al 2018 schreder et al 2016 the importance of water for the sustenance of life cannot be overemphasized since it is a basic requirement for human beings owa 2014 lu et al 2015 previous studies suggested that water pollution had significant influences on human health since it could cause disease increase the usage of medication and reduce the average life of human beings han et al 2016 li et al 2016a wang et al 2016 tap water is the most important subsistence good and is also one of the most important public health products due to the important role of tap water in the national economy and human health the standards and guidelines regarding the concentrations of contaminants in tap water have been established based on the toxicological epidemiological and clinical evidence in china since 1985 mho 1985 the latest sanitary standards for drinking water containing 106 targets in china was provided by the ministry of health in 2006 mho 2006 however as a type of emerging organic micro pollutant opes are not listed in this standard in 2015 the uspea completed a toxicity assessment of main and common opes and confirmed that five ope compounds had potential carcinogenicity and seven opes were deemed to have potential non carcinogenic effects usepa 2017 li et al 2018 therefore a comprehensive study regarding opes in drinking water is extremely essential for understanding the threat of these emerging micro pollutants to human health tap water is the commonest and cheapest drinking water in the cities and drinking water has been regarded as one of the major exposure pathways for opes to humans li et al 2014 lee et al 2016 however the data of opes in drinking water are extremely lacking in the world even though they are extremely essential and important until now just seven studies reported the concentration and pollution of opes in drinking water globally and even fewer studies on the national scale have been reported benotti et al 2009 rodil et al 2012 li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 lee et al 2016 kim and kannan 2018 park et al 2018 besides tris 2 3 dibromopropyl phosphate tdbpp is the most toxic compound among known ope compounds whose carcinogenicity is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other opes usepa 2017 however the data of tdbpp in global drinking water are quite limited to our knowledge just kim and kannan 2018 reported the occurrence and concentration of it in tap water of new york state usa up to now a lot of studies about the health risk of opes exposure to human being have been conducted however almost all of these studies were based on the reference dose rfd from van den eede et al 2011 or ali et al 2012 and the carcinogenic risk cr was rarely assessed especially drinking water after several new toxicological studies the united states environmental protection agency usepa has updated the rfd and oral cancer slope factor sfo values for opes therefore the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects from daily exposure of opes via drink water could be re analyzed this study was aimed to fulfil the national scale data of opes in drinking water especially tdbpp to assess the threat of opes to drinking water safety and to determine the keys factors on concentration and health risk of opes in drinking water accordingly 1 the occurrence composition and spatial distribution of 14 opes in drinking water were investigated including 31 provincial capitals or municipalities pcms 22 prefecture level cities plcs and 26 county level cities clcs in 2017 2 exposure and health risk levels of opes via ingestion of drinking water were assessed 3 the key influence factors on the health risk of opes were determined and 4 the prior monitoring opes in further studies were highlighted this result contributes to a good understanding about environmental threats of opes to human health and risk management of opes in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection of tap water drinking water tap water was sampled in 79 cities throughout china from july to august in 2017 locations of sampling sites are shown in fig 1 in our study sampling cities were located in one province included three city types pcms plcs and clcs for most sampling provinces however due to some difficulties of remote regions in sampling process water samples in some provinces of western china were obtained only from pcms finally drinking water samples were collected in 79 cities whose population and gross domestic product gdp accounted for 28 8 and 44 1 of them in china respectively furthermore previous study suggested that concentrations and profiles of pollutants in different drinking water samples from the same city were similar with each other li et al 2014 besides the seasonal variations were not considered in previous studies about opes in drinking water lee et al 2016 benotti et al 2009 rodil et al 2012 li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 therefore considering the difficult in sample collection transportation and analysis one drinking water sample was collected in each city tap water sample 5 l was collected in the kitchen of a family before sample collection the outflow in the first 3 min was discarded and the pre cleared bottles were rinsed with the tap water three times the influences of sampling bottle on opes were analyzed based on procedural blank experiments using ultrapure water all water samples were stored at 4 c before analysis and were analyzed within 7 days after sampling detailed information about the population gdp per capita gdp region administrative level and drinking water treatment technology dwtt is listed in tables s1 and s2 2 2 analytical process the enrichment of opes is based on liquid liquid extraction detailed treatment process is described as follows 500 ml water sample was spiked with 5 ng triphenyl phosphate d15 tphp d15 and tri n butyl phosphate d27 tnbp d27 for internal standards then the spiked samples were extracted by liquid liquid extraction with 50 ml dichloromethane dcm the extraction was repeated twice and the extraction phases were combined together the dcm layer was dried by anhydrous na2so4 and transferred into a 250 ml flat bottom flask the extract was concentrated to 1 2 ml with a rotary evaporator and concentrated to near dryness under a gentle n2 purging finally the extract was re dissolved with 200 μl dcm and quantified using an internal standard method six points calibration curves 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 ng ml in dcm were utilized for the quantification and the r2 of calibration curves were 0 99 the analysis of opes was performed with agilent 7890b gas chromatography flame photometric detection gc fpd using a fused silica capillary column db 5 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm fig s1 the initial temperature of column temperature was 60 c for 2 min then increased from 60 c to 250 c at a rate of 30 c min for 5 min and then was adjusted to 300 c at a rate of 10 c min in column splitless injection mode was adopted for opes analysis the injection volume is 1 μl at 250 c and the column flow rate is 1 2 ml min 2 3 quality assurance qa and quality control qc to enforce the date quality parallel samples procedural blank samples solvent blanks and matrix spiked samples were processed and analyzed along with field samples the background concentrations of opes were checked and determined by 3 procedural blank samples tep tnbp tcep tcipp tdbpp tdcipp and tphp were detected in procedural blank samples and mean concentrations of them were 1 74 0 15 1 15 1 89 1 75 0 70 and 0 64 ng l which were subtracted from the concentrations of samples 5 groups of parallel samples were analyzed for reproducibility analysis and the relative standard deviation values were lower than 30 n 3 to avoid the false positives of opes in gc fpd and to analyze the recoveries of opes in analytical process matrix spiked samples were processed and analyzed along with field samples at three levels 5 10 and 20 ng and the recoveries of 14 opes in spiked samples ranged from 60 to 125 besides the recoveries of two internal standards were 72 26 21 04 and 107 88 34 22 for tphp d15 and tnbp d27 respectively the instrument limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of opes were estimated by a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and 10 at the lowest point of calibration curves respectively table s3 according to the suggestion of previous studies ope concentrations below the lod were recorded as zero and ope concentrations between the lod and loq were recorded as 1 2 loq subedi et al 2015 xing et al 2009 2 4 health risk assessment among the 14 studied ope compounds five ope compounds are regarded as carcinogens and have the corresponding sfo including tmp tnbp tcep tdbpp and tehp therefore cr assessment of opes was focused on these five carcinogenic ope compounds the crs caused by ope exposure through drink water were calculated by eq 1 li et al 2014 2018 ding et al 2015 1 cr i 1 5 c i ir ed ef bw at sfo i where cr is the total cancer risk of carcinogenic ope compounds for different exposed populations ci is the concentration of carcinogenic ope compounds in drinking water ng l in china some people directly drink tap water and some people drink boiled tap water in daily life previous studies about effects of boiling on opes in tap water of china suggested that the concentrations of most opes were increased in boiling process but the change of opes did not have a regularity li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 therefore in this study ope concentrations in tap water was used to assess health risks of opes exposure being similar with the previous studies in china li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 ir is the intake rate of tap water l day ed is the exposure duration year ef is the exposure frequency 365 day year bw is the body weight kg at is the average time day and sfoi is the oral cancer slope factor of corresponding carcinogenic ope mg kg day 1 the parameters in the risk assessment method are listed in tables s4 and s5 among the 14 studied ope compounds seven ope compounds have the corresponding rfd values therefore the non cr assessment was focused on these ope compounds the non cr assessment was based on the hazard index hi which was calculated by eq 2 2 hi i 1 7 c i ir ed ef bw at rfd i where hi is the total non carcinogenic effects of tmp tnbp tcipp tcep tdcipp tehp and tmpp in tap water for different exposed populations rfdi is the oral cancer slope factor of each ope compound mg kg day 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence composition and distribution of opes the concentration and composition of opes are shown in fig 2 we can see that opes widely occurred in drinking water and the concentrations varied greatly in different cities the total concentrations of 14 opes ranged from 13 42 to 265 48 ng l with a mean of 77 40 ng l for halogeno opes tcipp tcep tdbpp and tdcipp the total concentrations varied from 3 13 to 207 04 man 50 30 ng l with a contribution of 13 91 7 65 0 to the total opes and were the dominant contributors to total opes in drinking water of china for alkyl opes and aryl opes the total concentrations of 6 alkyl ope compounds tmp tep tnbp tboep trmp tpp and tehp and 3 aryl ope compounds tphp tmpp and ehdpp were 2 21 121 89 mean 20 81 and nd 38 25 mean 6 30 ng l which accounted for about 26 9 and 8 1 of total opes respectively in addition the concentrations of halogeno opes were much higher than those of alkyl opes and aryl opes this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that halogeno opes were the most common products of opes in china shi et al 2016 halogeno opes were more persistent than non halogeno opes wolschke et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and the current water treatment technologies in drinking and waste water plants have limited removal capacity of opes especially for halogeno opes ding et al 2015 meyer et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2008 moreover a significant correlation between total opes and halogeno opes in drinking water occurred fig s1 which revealed that the halogeno opes were an effective indicator for conventional monitoring of the pollution of opes in drinking water of china r 0 91 n 79 as shown in fig 2 tcipp showed the highest concentration among the 14 opes whose contribution to total opes was 7 9 64 0 with a mean of 26 2 tcep and tdbpp were also the dominant contributors of opes which accounted for 18 2 and 15 1 of total opes respectively the sum of these three dominant contributors accounted for 59 5 of total opes for 14 ope compounds the average contribution to the total opes in drinking water of china was as follows in a decreasing order of tcipp 26 2 tcep 18 2 tdbpp 15 1 tep 10 1 tdcipp 5 2 tmp 4 7 tphp 4 6 tnbp 4 2 tehp 4 1 ehdpp 3 2 tboep 1 9 tpp 1 2 trmp 0 8 tmpp 0 2 the distributions in drinking water are shown in fig 3 a the serious pollution occurred in northeast china pearl river delta yangtze delta hebei province and chongqing city this could be due to that northeast china and pearl river delta are important industry bases of china where many factories need to use the flame retardants and plasticizers for instances synthetic glass manufacture and plank factory in addition previous study about soil pollution of opes in the important cities of northeast china and pearl river delta suggested that the pollution levels were higher than those in other cities of china cui et al 2017 luo et al 2018 besides all studied cities in northeast china and pearl river delta did not have the advanced dwtts in waterworks except guangzhou table s2 in addition the yangtze delta is a major flame retardants production region where one of the largest ope manufacturers of china 20 000 ton year is located in this region taihu lake lying in the yangtze delta was previously reported that serious opes pollution in sediment partially contributed by ope related industries wang et al 2018 moreover chongqing city is a province level municipality of china with prosperous economy and intensive human activity but dwtt is not at advanced level which could be a key factor on opes contamination in drinking water as shown in fig 3 a and b the occurrence and distribution of opes in drinking water of china have a good corresponding relationship with the aihui tengchong line which marks a striking difference in the distribution of china s population tong et al 2017 the concentration of total opes on the left of the aihui tengchong were lower than that on right of the aihui tengchong this could be due to the fact that the opes were mainly from the polymer materials which were closely related to the population and economy 3 2 exposure assessment of opes in drinking water of china an exposure assessment is a useful tool for assessing the daily exposure doses of pollutants via different routes in this study the estimated daily intake edi of opes via ingestion of drinking water from different areas of china for adults and children is listed in table 1 the 50 and 95 edi of opes via drinking water at the national scale of china was 2 52 and 4 73 ng kg day for adults and 2 60 and 4 88 ng kg day for children respectively in addition the edis of opes via drinking water from different administrative level cities of china for adults and children were compared and the results suggested that the 50 edis of opes via drinking water in pcls for both age groups were the greatest followed by pcms and clcs moreover the influences of the regional factors on edis of opes via drinking water for adults and children were also analyzed the results suggested that the 50 and 95 edis of opes in northeast china for adults and children were the highest followed by ecc central china and western china further the average edis of opes in northern china ecc central china and western china were 3 38 2 89 2 16 and 2 03 ng kg day for adults and 3 49 2 98 2 23 and 2 10 ng kg day for children respectively to develop a good understanding about exposure levels of opes in drinking water a comparison of the ope exposure via different routes was conducted table 2 for adults the edis of ope via dust ingestion ranged from 0 01 to 16 ng kg day and most of studies suggested that the average edis of opes via dust ingestion were at the level of several ng kg day therefore edis of opes via drinking water were comparable with those of dust ingestion especially in asia which suggested that drink water was also a main route of exposure for adults to opes for children the average edis of opes via global dust ingestion ranged from 0 1 to 133 ng kg day which suggested that the exposure data of opes via drinking water for children were higher than those of dust ingestion in pakistan and were comparable with those of dust ingestion in china german and philippines but were much lower than those of dust ingestion in new zealand sweden norway egypt and kuwait for food ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption the exposure data of opes were globally quite limited especially for children for food ingestion the average edis of opes for adults were much higher than those of drink water in addition the average edis of opes via drink water for adults were comparable with those of inhalation in turkey china and norway moreover the average edis of opes via drinking water for adults were much higher than those of dermal absorption in china but were much lower than those of dermal absorption in nepal and norway 3 3 health risk map of opes in drinking water of china in this study the comprehensive health risks of opes in drinking water were quantitatively assessed using monte carlo simulation previous studies suggested that some of parameters may be overestimated in risk assessment method therefore the 90 health risks were used as high end estimation in health risk assessment process the cr and non cr of opes in drinking water of china for men and women are listed in tables s6 and s7 the 90 crs of carcinogenic opes in drinking water for men and women were 1 45e 06 and 1 25e 06 and 6 71e 07 and 5 76e 07 for 50 cr values respectively previous studies suggested that if the cr value is higher than virtually safe level 1 00e 6 a potential cancer risk could occur ding et al 2015 pongpiachan et al 2015 li et al 2018 in our study the 90 crs were slightly higher than 1 00e 6 but the 50 crs were lower than 1 00e 6 suggesting that a potential cancer risk occurred but the risks were not serious the total his 90 of seven opes for men and women were 3 05e 04 and 2 62e 04 respectively previous studies suggested that if the total his via all the exposure pathways e g drinking water food dust etc below 1 the exposed population would not have obvious non carcinogenic effects ding et al 2015 li et al 2017 2018 in our study his were much lower than 1 which indicated that the non carcinogenic effects via intake of drinking water could be neglected to have a good understanding of the cr of opes in drinking water cr and non cr maps were drawn from fig 4 the serious cr was observed in jilin province followed by the pearl river delta and yangtze delta which are important industrial bases in china in the vast area of central and western china the crs were at relatively low levels for non cr jilin province the pearl river delta and the yangtze delta also have relatively higher risk and the non cr of opes in drinking water in northern china and in middle reach of the yangtze river was also much higher than that in other areas as shown in fig 4 the areas for relatively high non cr were different from that of cr this is due to that the contributors of non cr is different with cr especially dominant contributors for cr the contributors included tmp tnbp tcep tdbpp and tehp of which tdbpp was the dominant contributor to cr accounting for about 72 4 of the total cr due to its extreme high sfo value fig s2 however for non cr its contributors included tmp tnbp tcipp tcep tdcipp tehp and tmpp and the dominant contributors was tcipp and tcep 3 4 the influences of administrative regional and socioeconomic factors on health risks of opes as shown in fig 5 the crs of opes in drinking water from different administrative level cities and different regions have slight differences suggesting the influences of administrative and regional factors on health risks of opes is limited the cr and non cr of opes in plcs were slightly higher than those in pcms and clcs in addition for northern china the crs of opes in drinking water were the greatest and 50 and 90 crs of opes were exceeded 1 00e 6 which indicated that opes in these areas should be given much more attention in addition for ecc central china and western china the 90 crs of opes also slightly exceeded 1 00e 6 suggesting a potential cancer risk occurred moreover the sequence for cr and non cr of opes from different regions was northern china ecc western china central china urbanization and industrialization have been reported to play major roles in the pollutants concentration and distribution and population density and gdp have been confirmed to important influential factors liu et al 2014 li et al 2016b to have a good understanding about the relation of concentration and health risk of opes in drinking water with population density total gdp and per capita gdp a qualitative analysis was conducted however concentrations cr and non cr of opes in drinking water did not have significant correlations with three socioeconomic parameters suggesting that the impact factors were complex p 0 05 based on analysis of variance 3 5 key impact factor on opes in drinking water of china the detailed information about dwtt in waterworks of studied cities is listed table s2 we can see that quite limited cities are equipped with advanced dwtt in waterworks among studied cities expect some well developed cities beijing shanghai guangzhou tianjin hongkong taiyuan suzhou and chongming however the opes in guangzhou were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than another 7 cities which could be due to serious pollution in source water or other reasons therefore the opes in guangzhou were not considered as shown in fig 6 a total opes halogeno opes alkyl opes and aryl opes in drinking water from cities equipped with advanced dwtt were 43 06 41 92 arithmetic mean standard deviation 28 07 26 88 12 39 14 52 and 2 60 2 13 ng l respectively however in conventional dwtt cities total opes halogeno opes alkyl opes and aryl opes in drinking water were 80 37 58 11 52 13 41 48 21 60 26 91 and 6 64 7 03 ng l respectively compared with opes in conventional dwtt cities advanced dwtt could reduce about 47 8 48 4 32 8 and 67 9 of total opes halogeno opes alkyl opes and aryl opes respectively suggesting advanced dwtt could effectively reduce the opes in drinking water especially aryl opes obviously opes in drinking water from advanced dwtt cities were much lower than those from conventional dwtt cities suggesting that dwtt has play a significant role on opes in drinking water and is a key factor to impact opes in drinking water of china the influences of dwtt on health risk of opes in drinking water are shown in fig 6 b the mean cr and non cr of opes for men from advanced dwtt cities were 2 51e 07 and 1 15e 04 and were 2 15e 07 and 9 90e 05 for women respectively however in conventional dwtt cities mean cr and non cr of opes for men were 7 30e 07 and 1 81e 04 and were 6 270e 07 and 1 56e 04 for women respectively compared with the health risk of opes in conventional dwtt cities advanced dwtt could reduce about 65 6 and 36 5 of cr and non cr respectively indicating that the level of dwtt is also a key factor on health risk of opes in drinking water of china especially cr above phenomenon could be due to the following reasons in conventional dwtt the removal of opes mainly based on physical removal in coagulation and sand filtration processes previous studies suggested that removal efficiency of opes in conventional dwtt was limited reemtsma et al 2008 ding et al 2015 however the advanced dwtt is combined by conventional dwtt and o3 ozonation bio act c bio activated carbon adsorption or act c bio activated carbon adsorption or bio contact oxidation which have been shown very promising removal effect of opes andresen and bester 2006 in addition an analysis of variance anova was used to analyze if the concentrations and health risk of opes have statistical significant difference between conventional and advanced dwtt the results suggested that the concentrations and health risk of opes in drinking water between conventional and advanced dwtt did not have statistical significant difference p 0 05 and f f crit this phenomenon could be due to that 1 the number of data of opes from advanced dwtt were much lower than that of conventional dwtt 7 v s 72 which influenced the degree of freedom and f crit value and 2 the values of the error bars in conventional dwtt and advanced dwtt were large especially conventional dwtt which greatly increased the value of within group error and then decreased the f value wikipedia 2018 3 6 risk management until now there are three studies reported the health risk of opes in global drinking water in china li et al 2014 assessed the health risk of opes in tap water from 8 cities and found that non cr of most opes were at least two orders of magnitude lower than 1 indicating human exposure to opes through drinking water may not be a critical issue in china lee et al 2016 assessed the health risks of opes associated with the consumption of drinking water in korea and found that exposure to opes via drinking water posed limited health risk to korean populations ding et al 2015 evaluated the health risk both cr and non cr of opes in drinking water from eastern china and indicated that there was currently low risk to human health from exposure to opes through drinking water it is seemed that opes in drinking water is not a serious threat to human health however in our study although the his of opes via drink water were about 3 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding threshold value 1 the crs of opes via drink water have already exceeded the corresponding virtually safe level 1 00e 06 indicating human exposure to opes through drinking water may be a critical issue in china above phenomenon could be explained by the fact that li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 and lee et al 2016 assessed the non cr based on the rfd of opes from van den eede et al 2011 and ali et al 2012 our previous study has confirmed that the differences of non crs are less than one order of magnitude between the rfd from van den eede et al 2011 ali et al 2012 and usepa 2017 therefore the non cr among four studies did not have significant differences additionally li s et al 2014 and lee s et al 2016 study did not consider crs of opes and ding s 2015 study just considered the crs of tcep while the crs of tmp tnbp tdbpp and tehp are not calculated therefore the results of ding s et al 2015 study have significant differences with our study moreover we also found that tdbpp was the dominant contributor to cr among the five carcinogenic ope compounds and accounted for about 72 4 of the total cr fig s2 this phenomenon is attributed that the sfo of tdbpp is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other opes therefore tdbpp should be treated as prior monitoring opes in further studies in addition advanced dwtt could effectively reduce the concentration and health risk of opes in drinking water and about 65 6 of cr could be reduced therefore upgrading the dwtt in waterworks is an effective way to reduce the threat of opes to drinking water safety 4 conclusion our study suggests that human exposure to opes through drinking water may be a critical issue in china tdbpp should be treated as prior monitoring opes in further studies and upgrading the dwtt in waterworks is an effective way to reduce the threat of opes to drinking water safety this result contributes to a good understanding of environmental threats of opes to human health and risk management of opes in drinking water of china considering the annual growth of opes consumption in china and world further studies regarding the environmental threat of opes to human health via different exposure pathways

18966,as one group of emerging pollutants the threat of organophosphate esters flame retardants and plasticizers opes to drinking water safety is not well recognized now the oral reference dose rfd and oral cancer slope factor sfo of opes have been updated by uspea therefore the threat of opes to drinking water safety could be assessed in this study occurrence health risk and key impact factor of opes in drinking water of china were analyzed covering 79 cities whose population and gross domestic product gdp accounted for 28 8 and 44 1 of them in china respectively total concentration of 14 common opes in drinking water was 13 42 265 48 ng l the exposure level of opes via ingestion of drinking water was much lower than that of food ingestion but was comparable with dust ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption a health assessment for opes via ingestion of drinking water suggested that the potential cancer risk occurred 1 00e 6 but no obvious non carcinogenic effects occurred 1 tris 2 3 dibromopropyl phosphate tdbpp contributed to about 72 4 of carcinogenic risk which should be treated as prior monitoring opes in further studies the occurrence and distribution of opes in drinking water of china have a good corresponding relationship with the aihui tengchong line and drinking water treatment technology dwtt was found to be a key factor total opes halogeno opes and alkyl opes in drinking water from advanced dwtt cities were much lower than those of conventional dwtt cities compared with conventional dwtt advanced dwtt could reduce about 65 6 and 36 5 of carcinogenic risk and non carcinogenic risk of opes respectively considering the annual growth of opes consumption in china and world further studies regarding the environmental threat of opes are required graphical abstract image 1 keywords organophosphate esters drinking water safety national scale exposure health risk key factor 1 introduction organophosphate esters opes are one group of chemical additives which have been used as flame retardants and plasticizers in past decades because of their excellent chemical and physical properties and low cost ali et al 2012 van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2015 kurt karakus et al 2018 since polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecane are in the process of being globally phased out as a substitute the production and consumption of opes are greatly increased in the world anim et al 2017 statistical results showed that opes had a global consumption of 500 000 tons in 2011 and were expected to reach 680 000 tons in 2015 li et al 2018 wang et al 2015 opes can easily release into environmental media during the process of production usage and dismantling because they are additive type retardants without chemical bonding reemtsma et al 2008 as a result opes have been frequently detected in various environmental media khan et al 2016 lee et al 2016 li et al 2014 greaves et al 2016 yadav et al 2018 schreder et al 2016 the importance of water for the sustenance of life cannot be overemphasized since it is a basic requirement for human beings owa 2014 lu et al 2015 previous studies suggested that water pollution had significant influences on human health since it could cause disease increase the usage of medication and reduce the average life of human beings han et al 2016 li et al 2016a wang et al 2016 tap water is the most important subsistence good and is also one of the most important public health products due to the important role of tap water in the national economy and human health the standards and guidelines regarding the concentrations of contaminants in tap water have been established based on the toxicological epidemiological and clinical evidence in china since 1985 mho 1985 the latest sanitary standards for drinking water containing 106 targets in china was provided by the ministry of health in 2006 mho 2006 however as a type of emerging organic micro pollutant opes are not listed in this standard in 2015 the uspea completed a toxicity assessment of main and common opes and confirmed that five ope compounds had potential carcinogenicity and seven opes were deemed to have potential non carcinogenic effects usepa 2017 li et al 2018 therefore a comprehensive study regarding opes in drinking water is extremely essential for understanding the threat of these emerging micro pollutants to human health tap water is the commonest and cheapest drinking water in the cities and drinking water has been regarded as one of the major exposure pathways for opes to humans li et al 2014 lee et al 2016 however the data of opes in drinking water are extremely lacking in the world even though they are extremely essential and important until now just seven studies reported the concentration and pollution of opes in drinking water globally and even fewer studies on the national scale have been reported benotti et al 2009 rodil et al 2012 li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 lee et al 2016 kim and kannan 2018 park et al 2018 besides tris 2 3 dibromopropyl phosphate tdbpp is the most toxic compound among known ope compounds whose carcinogenicity is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other opes usepa 2017 however the data of tdbpp in global drinking water are quite limited to our knowledge just kim and kannan 2018 reported the occurrence and concentration of it in tap water of new york state usa up to now a lot of studies about the health risk of opes exposure to human being have been conducted however almost all of these studies were based on the reference dose rfd from van den eede et al 2011 or ali et al 2012 and the carcinogenic risk cr was rarely assessed especially drinking water after several new toxicological studies the united states environmental protection agency usepa has updated the rfd and oral cancer slope factor sfo values for opes therefore the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects from daily exposure of opes via drink water could be re analyzed this study was aimed to fulfil the national scale data of opes in drinking water especially tdbpp to assess the threat of opes to drinking water safety and to determine the keys factors on concentration and health risk of opes in drinking water accordingly 1 the occurrence composition and spatial distribution of 14 opes in drinking water were investigated including 31 provincial capitals or municipalities pcms 22 prefecture level cities plcs and 26 county level cities clcs in 2017 2 exposure and health risk levels of opes via ingestion of drinking water were assessed 3 the key influence factors on the health risk of opes were determined and 4 the prior monitoring opes in further studies were highlighted this result contributes to a good understanding about environmental threats of opes to human health and risk management of opes in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection of tap water drinking water tap water was sampled in 79 cities throughout china from july to august in 2017 locations of sampling sites are shown in fig 1 in our study sampling cities were located in one province included three city types pcms plcs and clcs for most sampling provinces however due to some difficulties of remote regions in sampling process water samples in some provinces of western china were obtained only from pcms finally drinking water samples were collected in 79 cities whose population and gross domestic product gdp accounted for 28 8 and 44 1 of them in china respectively furthermore previous study suggested that concentrations and profiles of pollutants in different drinking water samples from the same city were similar with each other li et al 2014 besides the seasonal variations were not considered in previous studies about opes in drinking water lee et al 2016 benotti et al 2009 rodil et al 2012 li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 therefore considering the difficult in sample collection transportation and analysis one drinking water sample was collected in each city tap water sample 5 l was collected in the kitchen of a family before sample collection the outflow in the first 3 min was discarded and the pre cleared bottles were rinsed with the tap water three times the influences of sampling bottle on opes were analyzed based on procedural blank experiments using ultrapure water all water samples were stored at 4 c before analysis and were analyzed within 7 days after sampling detailed information about the population gdp per capita gdp region administrative level and drinking water treatment technology dwtt is listed in tables s1 and s2 2 2 analytical process the enrichment of opes is based on liquid liquid extraction detailed treatment process is described as follows 500 ml water sample was spiked with 5 ng triphenyl phosphate d15 tphp d15 and tri n butyl phosphate d27 tnbp d27 for internal standards then the spiked samples were extracted by liquid liquid extraction with 50 ml dichloromethane dcm the extraction was repeated twice and the extraction phases were combined together the dcm layer was dried by anhydrous na2so4 and transferred into a 250 ml flat bottom flask the extract was concentrated to 1 2 ml with a rotary evaporator and concentrated to near dryness under a gentle n2 purging finally the extract was re dissolved with 200 μl dcm and quantified using an internal standard method six points calibration curves 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 ng ml in dcm were utilized for the quantification and the r2 of calibration curves were 0 99 the analysis of opes was performed with agilent 7890b gas chromatography flame photometric detection gc fpd using a fused silica capillary column db 5 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm fig s1 the initial temperature of column temperature was 60 c for 2 min then increased from 60 c to 250 c at a rate of 30 c min for 5 min and then was adjusted to 300 c at a rate of 10 c min in column splitless injection mode was adopted for opes analysis the injection volume is 1 μl at 250 c and the column flow rate is 1 2 ml min 2 3 quality assurance qa and quality control qc to enforce the date quality parallel samples procedural blank samples solvent blanks and matrix spiked samples were processed and analyzed along with field samples the background concentrations of opes were checked and determined by 3 procedural blank samples tep tnbp tcep tcipp tdbpp tdcipp and tphp were detected in procedural blank samples and mean concentrations of them were 1 74 0 15 1 15 1 89 1 75 0 70 and 0 64 ng l which were subtracted from the concentrations of samples 5 groups of parallel samples were analyzed for reproducibility analysis and the relative standard deviation values were lower than 30 n 3 to avoid the false positives of opes in gc fpd and to analyze the recoveries of opes in analytical process matrix spiked samples were processed and analyzed along with field samples at three levels 5 10 and 20 ng and the recoveries of 14 opes in spiked samples ranged from 60 to 125 besides the recoveries of two internal standards were 72 26 21 04 and 107 88 34 22 for tphp d15 and tnbp d27 respectively the instrument limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of opes were estimated by a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and 10 at the lowest point of calibration curves respectively table s3 according to the suggestion of previous studies ope concentrations below the lod were recorded as zero and ope concentrations between the lod and loq were recorded as 1 2 loq subedi et al 2015 xing et al 2009 2 4 health risk assessment among the 14 studied ope compounds five ope compounds are regarded as carcinogens and have the corresponding sfo including tmp tnbp tcep tdbpp and tehp therefore cr assessment of opes was focused on these five carcinogenic ope compounds the crs caused by ope exposure through drink water were calculated by eq 1 li et al 2014 2018 ding et al 2015 1 cr i 1 5 c i ir ed ef bw at sfo i where cr is the total cancer risk of carcinogenic ope compounds for different exposed populations ci is the concentration of carcinogenic ope compounds in drinking water ng l in china some people directly drink tap water and some people drink boiled tap water in daily life previous studies about effects of boiling on opes in tap water of china suggested that the concentrations of most opes were increased in boiling process but the change of opes did not have a regularity li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 therefore in this study ope concentrations in tap water was used to assess health risks of opes exposure being similar with the previous studies in china li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 ir is the intake rate of tap water l day ed is the exposure duration year ef is the exposure frequency 365 day year bw is the body weight kg at is the average time day and sfoi is the oral cancer slope factor of corresponding carcinogenic ope mg kg day 1 the parameters in the risk assessment method are listed in tables s4 and s5 among the 14 studied ope compounds seven ope compounds have the corresponding rfd values therefore the non cr assessment was focused on these ope compounds the non cr assessment was based on the hazard index hi which was calculated by eq 2 2 hi i 1 7 c i ir ed ef bw at rfd i where hi is the total non carcinogenic effects of tmp tnbp tcipp tcep tdcipp tehp and tmpp in tap water for different exposed populations rfdi is the oral cancer slope factor of each ope compound mg kg day 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence composition and distribution of opes the concentration and composition of opes are shown in fig 2 we can see that opes widely occurred in drinking water and the concentrations varied greatly in different cities the total concentrations of 14 opes ranged from 13 42 to 265 48 ng l with a mean of 77 40 ng l for halogeno opes tcipp tcep tdbpp and tdcipp the total concentrations varied from 3 13 to 207 04 man 50 30 ng l with a contribution of 13 91 7 65 0 to the total opes and were the dominant contributors to total opes in drinking water of china for alkyl opes and aryl opes the total concentrations of 6 alkyl ope compounds tmp tep tnbp tboep trmp tpp and tehp and 3 aryl ope compounds tphp tmpp and ehdpp were 2 21 121 89 mean 20 81 and nd 38 25 mean 6 30 ng l which accounted for about 26 9 and 8 1 of total opes respectively in addition the concentrations of halogeno opes were much higher than those of alkyl opes and aryl opes this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that halogeno opes were the most common products of opes in china shi et al 2016 halogeno opes were more persistent than non halogeno opes wolschke et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and the current water treatment technologies in drinking and waste water plants have limited removal capacity of opes especially for halogeno opes ding et al 2015 meyer et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2008 moreover a significant correlation between total opes and halogeno opes in drinking water occurred fig s1 which revealed that the halogeno opes were an effective indicator for conventional monitoring of the pollution of opes in drinking water of china r 0 91 n 79 as shown in fig 2 tcipp showed the highest concentration among the 14 opes whose contribution to total opes was 7 9 64 0 with a mean of 26 2 tcep and tdbpp were also the dominant contributors of opes which accounted for 18 2 and 15 1 of total opes respectively the sum of these three dominant contributors accounted for 59 5 of total opes for 14 ope compounds the average contribution to the total opes in drinking water of china was as follows in a decreasing order of tcipp 26 2 tcep 18 2 tdbpp 15 1 tep 10 1 tdcipp 5 2 tmp 4 7 tphp 4 6 tnbp 4 2 tehp 4 1 ehdpp 3 2 tboep 1 9 tpp 1 2 trmp 0 8 tmpp 0 2 the distributions in drinking water are shown in fig 3 a the serious pollution occurred in northeast china pearl river delta yangtze delta hebei province and chongqing city this could be due to that northeast china and pearl river delta are important industry bases of china where many factories need to use the flame retardants and plasticizers for instances synthetic glass manufacture and plank factory in addition previous study about soil pollution of opes in the important cities of northeast china and pearl river delta suggested that the pollution levels were higher than those in other cities of china cui et al 2017 luo et al 2018 besides all studied cities in northeast china and pearl river delta did not have the advanced dwtts in waterworks except guangzhou table s2 in addition the yangtze delta is a major flame retardants production region where one of the largest ope manufacturers of china 20 000 ton year is located in this region taihu lake lying in the yangtze delta was previously reported that serious opes pollution in sediment partially contributed by ope related industries wang et al 2018 moreover chongqing city is a province level municipality of china with prosperous economy and intensive human activity but dwtt is not at advanced level which could be a key factor on opes contamination in drinking water as shown in fig 3 a and b the occurrence and distribution of opes in drinking water of china have a good corresponding relationship with the aihui tengchong line which marks a striking difference in the distribution of china s population tong et al 2017 the concentration of total opes on the left of the aihui tengchong were lower than that on right of the aihui tengchong this could be due to the fact that the opes were mainly from the polymer materials which were closely related to the population and economy 3 2 exposure assessment of opes in drinking water of china an exposure assessment is a useful tool for assessing the daily exposure doses of pollutants via different routes in this study the estimated daily intake edi of opes via ingestion of drinking water from different areas of china for adults and children is listed in table 1 the 50 and 95 edi of opes via drinking water at the national scale of china was 2 52 and 4 73 ng kg day for adults and 2 60 and 4 88 ng kg day for children respectively in addition the edis of opes via drinking water from different administrative level cities of china for adults and children were compared and the results suggested that the 50 edis of opes via drinking water in pcls for both age groups were the greatest followed by pcms and clcs moreover the influences of the regional factors on edis of opes via drinking water for adults and children were also analyzed the results suggested that the 50 and 95 edis of opes in northeast china for adults and children were the highest followed by ecc central china and western china further the average edis of opes in northern china ecc central china and western china were 3 38 2 89 2 16 and 2 03 ng kg day for adults and 3 49 2 98 2 23 and 2 10 ng kg day for children respectively to develop a good understanding about exposure levels of opes in drinking water a comparison of the ope exposure via different routes was conducted table 2 for adults the edis of ope via dust ingestion ranged from 0 01 to 16 ng kg day and most of studies suggested that the average edis of opes via dust ingestion were at the level of several ng kg day therefore edis of opes via drinking water were comparable with those of dust ingestion especially in asia which suggested that drink water was also a main route of exposure for adults to opes for children the average edis of opes via global dust ingestion ranged from 0 1 to 133 ng kg day which suggested that the exposure data of opes via drinking water for children were higher than those of dust ingestion in pakistan and were comparable with those of dust ingestion in china german and philippines but were much lower than those of dust ingestion in new zealand sweden norway egypt and kuwait for food ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption the exposure data of opes were globally quite limited especially for children for food ingestion the average edis of opes for adults were much higher than those of drink water in addition the average edis of opes via drink water for adults were comparable with those of inhalation in turkey china and norway moreover the average edis of opes via drinking water for adults were much higher than those of dermal absorption in china but were much lower than those of dermal absorption in nepal and norway 3 3 health risk map of opes in drinking water of china in this study the comprehensive health risks of opes in drinking water were quantitatively assessed using monte carlo simulation previous studies suggested that some of parameters may be overestimated in risk assessment method therefore the 90 health risks were used as high end estimation in health risk assessment process the cr and non cr of opes in drinking water of china for men and women are listed in tables s6 and s7 the 90 crs of carcinogenic opes in drinking water for men and women were 1 45e 06 and 1 25e 06 and 6 71e 07 and 5 76e 07 for 50 cr values respectively previous studies suggested that if the cr value is higher than virtually safe level 1 00e 6 a potential cancer risk could occur ding et al 2015 pongpiachan et al 2015 li et al 2018 in our study the 90 crs were slightly higher than 1 00e 6 but the 50 crs were lower than 1 00e 6 suggesting that a potential cancer risk occurred but the risks were not serious the total his 90 of seven opes for men and women were 3 05e 04 and 2 62e 04 respectively previous studies suggested that if the total his via all the exposure pathways e g drinking water food dust etc below 1 the exposed population would not have obvious non carcinogenic effects ding et al 2015 li et al 2017 2018 in our study his were much lower than 1 which indicated that the non carcinogenic effects via intake of drinking water could be neglected to have a good understanding of the cr of opes in drinking water cr and non cr maps were drawn from fig 4 the serious cr was observed in jilin province followed by the pearl river delta and yangtze delta which are important industrial bases in china in the vast area of central and western china the crs were at relatively low levels for non cr jilin province the pearl river delta and the yangtze delta also have relatively higher risk and the non cr of opes in drinking water in northern china and in middle reach of the yangtze river was also much higher than that in other areas as shown in fig 4 the areas for relatively high non cr were different from that of cr this is due to that the contributors of non cr is different with cr especially dominant contributors for cr the contributors included tmp tnbp tcep tdbpp and tehp of which tdbpp was the dominant contributor to cr accounting for about 72 4 of the total cr due to its extreme high sfo value fig s2 however for non cr its contributors included tmp tnbp tcipp tcep tdcipp tehp and tmpp and the dominant contributors was tcipp and tcep 3 4 the influences of administrative regional and socioeconomic factors on health risks of opes as shown in fig 5 the crs of opes in drinking water from different administrative level cities and different regions have slight differences suggesting the influences of administrative and regional factors on health risks of opes is limited the cr and non cr of opes in plcs were slightly higher than those in pcms and clcs in addition for northern china the crs of opes in drinking water were the greatest and 50 and 90 crs of opes were exceeded 1 00e 6 which indicated that opes in these areas should be given much more attention in addition for ecc central china and western china the 90 crs of opes also slightly exceeded 1 00e 6 suggesting a potential cancer risk occurred moreover the sequence for cr and non cr of opes from different regions was northern china ecc western china central china urbanization and industrialization have been reported to play major roles in the pollutants concentration and distribution and population density and gdp have been confirmed to important influential factors liu et al 2014 li et al 2016b to have a good understanding about the relation of concentration and health risk of opes in drinking water with population density total gdp and per capita gdp a qualitative analysis was conducted however concentrations cr and non cr of opes in drinking water did not have significant correlations with three socioeconomic parameters suggesting that the impact factors were complex p 0 05 based on analysis of variance 3 5 key impact factor on opes in drinking water of china the detailed information about dwtt in waterworks of studied cities is listed table s2 we can see that quite limited cities are equipped with advanced dwtt in waterworks among studied cities expect some well developed cities beijing shanghai guangzhou tianjin hongkong taiyuan suzhou and chongming however the opes in guangzhou were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than another 7 cities which could be due to serious pollution in source water or other reasons therefore the opes in guangzhou were not considered as shown in fig 6 a total opes halogeno opes alkyl opes and aryl opes in drinking water from cities equipped with advanced dwtt were 43 06 41 92 arithmetic mean standard deviation 28 07 26 88 12 39 14 52 and 2 60 2 13 ng l respectively however in conventional dwtt cities total opes halogeno opes alkyl opes and aryl opes in drinking water were 80 37 58 11 52 13 41 48 21 60 26 91 and 6 64 7 03 ng l respectively compared with opes in conventional dwtt cities advanced dwtt could reduce about 47 8 48 4 32 8 and 67 9 of total opes halogeno opes alkyl opes and aryl opes respectively suggesting advanced dwtt could effectively reduce the opes in drinking water especially aryl opes obviously opes in drinking water from advanced dwtt cities were much lower than those from conventional dwtt cities suggesting that dwtt has play a significant role on opes in drinking water and is a key factor to impact opes in drinking water of china the influences of dwtt on health risk of opes in drinking water are shown in fig 6 b the mean cr and non cr of opes for men from advanced dwtt cities were 2 51e 07 and 1 15e 04 and were 2 15e 07 and 9 90e 05 for women respectively however in conventional dwtt cities mean cr and non cr of opes for men were 7 30e 07 and 1 81e 04 and were 6 270e 07 and 1 56e 04 for women respectively compared with the health risk of opes in conventional dwtt cities advanced dwtt could reduce about 65 6 and 36 5 of cr and non cr respectively indicating that the level of dwtt is also a key factor on health risk of opes in drinking water of china especially cr above phenomenon could be due to the following reasons in conventional dwtt the removal of opes mainly based on physical removal in coagulation and sand filtration processes previous studies suggested that removal efficiency of opes in conventional dwtt was limited reemtsma et al 2008 ding et al 2015 however the advanced dwtt is combined by conventional dwtt and o3 ozonation bio act c bio activated carbon adsorption or act c bio activated carbon adsorption or bio contact oxidation which have been shown very promising removal effect of opes andresen and bester 2006 in addition an analysis of variance anova was used to analyze if the concentrations and health risk of opes have statistical significant difference between conventional and advanced dwtt the results suggested that the concentrations and health risk of opes in drinking water between conventional and advanced dwtt did not have statistical significant difference p 0 05 and f f crit this phenomenon could be due to that 1 the number of data of opes from advanced dwtt were much lower than that of conventional dwtt 7 v s 72 which influenced the degree of freedom and f crit value and 2 the values of the error bars in conventional dwtt and advanced dwtt were large especially conventional dwtt which greatly increased the value of within group error and then decreased the f value wikipedia 2018 3 6 risk management until now there are three studies reported the health risk of opes in global drinking water in china li et al 2014 assessed the health risk of opes in tap water from 8 cities and found that non cr of most opes were at least two orders of magnitude lower than 1 indicating human exposure to opes through drinking water may not be a critical issue in china lee et al 2016 assessed the health risks of opes associated with the consumption of drinking water in korea and found that exposure to opes via drinking water posed limited health risk to korean populations ding et al 2015 evaluated the health risk both cr and non cr of opes in drinking water from eastern china and indicated that there was currently low risk to human health from exposure to opes through drinking water it is seemed that opes in drinking water is not a serious threat to human health however in our study although the his of opes via drink water were about 3 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding threshold value 1 the crs of opes via drink water have already exceeded the corresponding virtually safe level 1 00e 06 indicating human exposure to opes through drinking water may be a critical issue in china above phenomenon could be explained by the fact that li et al 2014 ding et al 2015 and lee et al 2016 assessed the non cr based on the rfd of opes from van den eede et al 2011 and ali et al 2012 our previous study has confirmed that the differences of non crs are less than one order of magnitude between the rfd from van den eede et al 2011 ali et al 2012 and usepa 2017 therefore the non cr among four studies did not have significant differences additionally li s et al 2014 and lee s et al 2016 study did not consider crs of opes and ding s 2015 study just considered the crs of tcep while the crs of tmp tnbp tdbpp and tehp are not calculated therefore the results of ding s et al 2015 study have significant differences with our study moreover we also found that tdbpp was the dominant contributor to cr among the five carcinogenic ope compounds and accounted for about 72 4 of the total cr fig s2 this phenomenon is attributed that the sfo of tdbpp is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other opes therefore tdbpp should be treated as prior monitoring opes in further studies in addition advanced dwtt could effectively reduce the concentration and health risk of opes in drinking water and about 65 6 of cr could be reduced therefore upgrading the dwtt in waterworks is an effective way to reduce the threat of opes to drinking water safety 4 conclusion our study suggests that human exposure to opes through drinking water may be a critical issue in china tdbpp should be treated as prior monitoring opes in further studies and upgrading the dwtt in waterworks is an effective way to reduce the threat of opes to drinking water safety this result contributes to a good understanding of environmental threats of opes to human health and risk management of opes in drinking water of china considering the annual growth of opes consumption in china and world further studies regarding the environmental threat of opes to human health via different exposure pathways

18967,to evaluate and mitigate odor formation and emission in sewers several sewer models have been developed although these models can predict the immediate effects of chemical dosing on odor emission control the long term effects due to the variation of biofilm dynamics were generally underestimated therefore in this study we developed a dynamic model to simulate sewer processes initiated by sewer the dynamic sewer process model was calibrated and validated with experimental data collected from two pressurized mains in actual operation in hong kong tcs and mh17 the results show that the dynamic model can satisfactorily predict the dynamic concentrations of sulfide and ammonium with measured and simulated values differing by less than 6 the model was employed to systematically assess the long term effects of three commonly used control strategies i e addition of nitrate salts addition of biocides and hydraulic flushing on sulfide formation and to predict sewer biofilm compositions the modeling results reveal that the effect of odor mitigation measures on sulfide control varied with time due to the re establishment of sulfate reducing bacteria community in sewer biofilm the long term effect of nitrate addition would be diminishing because of the growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms increased from 7 to 21 after 55 days of nitrate addition to consumed more nitrate after dosing biocide or hydraulic flushing in sewers sulfide production would rebound in the following several days due to the regrowth of sewer biofilms indicating that the optimization of odor mitigation strategies is necessary this study highlights that the biofilm dynamics shall be involved in the simulation of odor formation and emission to evaluate and optimize the long term effects of mitigation measures graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm sewer modelling hydrogen sulfide odor control sewer management 1 introduction sewer systems are the core infrastructure of urban water management as they collect household and industrial wastewater and deliver it to centralized wastewater treatment plants for treatment hydrogen sulfide h2s is the most important odorous gas pollutant emitted from sewer systems and also pose health hazards to those living or working in the vicinity and cause severe concrete corrosion pikaar et al 2014 sulfide is produced through sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria srb colonizing the biofilms of sewer networks pikaar et al 2014 to inhibit sulfide production or eliminate sulfide emission to the atmosphere many odor control strategies have been adopted by the water industry such as air pure oxygen injection and chemical dosing using nitrate salts iron salts alkali and biocides for example ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 the dosing rates are generally determined based on empirical data which is easy to over or under dose of the costly chemicals due to the dynamic hydraulic flow in sewers ganigue et al 2011 to optimize the dosing strategies for odor control sewer process models such as wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformation in sewers wats hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 and sewex models sharma et al 2008 were developed to evaluate the effects of chemical dosing on sulfide formation in sewers the sulfide levels in sewers could be immediately suppressed by dosing with chemicals during which the sulfide control effectiveness were well simulated with the existing sewer process models hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 2013 sharma et al 2008 2013 however many experimental studies revealed that the effects of sulfide mitigation measures in sewers were not stable in the long term gutierrez et al 2009 2014 jiang et al 2009b 2013b liang et al 2016 for instance jiang et al 2009b and liang et al 2016 observed sulfide rebounds in sewers during the nitrate dosing campaigns the effect of ph shock when periodically dosing with caustic chemicals on suppressing sulfide production only lasted for 3 14 days according to gutierrez et al 2009 and gutierrez et al 2014 in a field trial jiang et al 2013b found that srb activity completely recovered 10 days after the addition of a biocide free nitrous acid fna the unsatisfactory long term effect of chemical dosing on in sewer sulfide control was likely attributed to biofilm dynamics in sewers which cannot be properly simulated by the existing sewer models the dynamic sewer processes related to sulfide formation are mainly initiated by sewer biofilms as the sewage characteristics vary across a sewer network the biofilm characteristics and microbial communities differ from one section of the network to another jin et al 2018 however the biofilm dynamics were under estimated by wats and sewex which simulate sulfide formation with a simplified assumption that the biofilm is in steady state hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 sharma et al 2008 as such the abilities of sewer process models to predict the long term effects of odor mitigation measures can be greatly improved by incorporating the simulation of biofilm dynamics although sun et al 2018a improved sewex by developing a dynamic biofilm model based on the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 the microbial competition between srb and other bacteria such as heterotrophs is not considered especially when nitrate or oxygen were present in rising mains in the case of nitrate dosing the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers in biofilms may increase the nitrate and organic carbon consumption and indirectly limit the srb activities through substrate competition jiang et al 2009b 2013c sun et al 2014 moreover hydraulic flushing a higher flow rate than normal a common practice in sewer maintenance can also reduce srb abundance in sewers by detaching sewer biofilms sediments the practice can lead to efficient sulfide control littlewood and butler 2003 but the existing sewer models are incapable of simulating the effects of hydraulic flushing on biofilm composition in sewers and the potential to produce sulfide in this light a dynamic sewer process model incorporating the simulation of biofilm dynamics is needed to predict and optimize the long term effects of odor mitigation strategies on sulfide production therefore in this study a dynamic sewer process model expanding our previous sewer biofilm model jiang et al 2009a was newly developed this modified biofilm model can simulate the dynamic development and detachment of sewer biofilms and the competition among organic oxidation denitrification sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation the biofilm initiated dynamic sewer process model was then calibrated and validated using data collected in field investigations in two large scale rising mains this validated sewer process model was then applied to systematically assess the long term effects of three odor mitigation measures such as nitrate addition biocide addition and hydraulic flushing on sulfide production and sewer biofilm compositions the results demonstrate the model s ability to simulate biofilm dynamics and sulfide formation in sewers 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development in this study a biofilm initiated sewer process model bism was developed to dynamically simulate the odorants formation and emission in sewers bism is divided into three sub models including a sewage quality model a modified biofilm model and a gas exchange model fig 1 a segmentation simulation process was employed for the development of this sewer model briefly the whole pipe is first divided into n segments and each segment is considered as a biofilm reactor in each sewer segment the heterogeneous biofilm processes and their effects on sulfur and nitrogen transformations were simulated to predict the concentration variations of sulfide sulfate ammonia nitrate and organic substrates in sewage if the water surface is exposed to the atmosphere e g in a gravity sewer or at the outlet of a rising main the emissions of h2s were also calculated using the odor emission sub model with a plug flow assumption the concentrations of pollutants at the sewer outlet can be determined 2 1 1 sub model 1 sewage quality model the changes in water quality in a sewer segment were simulated following eq 1 substrate exchanges from the segment upstream biofilms the atmosphere and transformations within biochemical reactions in the sewage segment were all considered 1 c t u c x m d x m g a s x r where c is the substrate concentration in g m3 t is the time interval in s u is the sewage flow rate in m s x is the length of a sewer segment in m m d is the mass exchange of soluble and particulate substances from and into the biofilm by diffusion and attachment detachment in g m2 s m gas is the mass exchange of gaseous substances oxygen hydrogen sulfide and ammonia between water and sewer atmosphere in g m2 s and r is the wastewater transformation by biochemical reactions in the water phase in a time interval in g m3 s a modified activated sludge model no 3 was employed to simulate r as shown in table s2 2 1 2 sub model 2 modified biofilm model a vertically layered biofilm model capable of simulating sewer biofilm dynamics under different hydraulic and wastewater conditions jiang et al 2009a was modified and used in this study in this biofilm model the biofilm in a sewer section is separated into many thin layers depending on the biofilm thickness in the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 the biofilm model is capable of simulating 22 biochemical processes to predict the concentration variations of seven soluble and seven particulate variables in each biofilm layer as shown in table s2 mass transfer and diffusion between biofilm layers and the water phase were simulated according to jiang et al 2009a to better simulate the sulfur and nitrogen transformations the biofilm model in this study was further modified by considering the anoxic sulfide oxidation process abdul talib et al 2002 yang et al 2005 as shown in table s2 biofilm formation bacterial community evolution within each biofilm layer and the changes in biofilm density and thickness induced by microbial competition and hydraulic impacts which have all been validated in a previous study jiang et al 2009a were simulated in the sewer biofilm model it should be noted that methanogenesis was not considered in the sewer biofilm model the high level of sulfate in sewage 500 1000 mg l as a result of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong jiang et al 2013a could inhibit the growth of methanogenic archaea lens et al 1998 2 1 3 sub model 3 gas exchange model in sewer manholes intersections or vortex chambers h2s emission and oxygen reaeration may occur the h2s in sewage was firstly calculated with eq 2 pan et al 2013 while the re aeration process was simulated followed a previous study jiang et al 2009a h2s emission was determined according to yongsiri et al 2003 eq s4 and table s3 in which the effect of ventilation on h2s at wet well was taken into account and calculated using eqs s3 s4 and s5 in the supporting information ph variation in sewer was not simulated in this model instead ph at sewer outlet was used as an input parameter for the model to calculate the concertation of unionized h2s for the further calculation of h2s release 2 h 2 s h h s p k a 1 6 97 a t 25 o c 2 2 field study on large scale sewer systems to calibrate and validate the proposed sewer process model field trials were performed in two rising mains mh17 and tcs fig s1 in hong kong china to collect data mh17 is located upstream of tcs and collects wastewater from the nearby residential and airport tcs transports wastewater from mh17 and the nearby residential area of tung chung the main characteristics of mh17 and tcs are presented in table 1 in mh17 calcium nitrate is used to control sulfide in the routine operation by the hong kong drainage services department hkdsd in which 4 02 kg n h of 40 w w calcium nitrate are added during 7 00 23 00 of each day and 5 74 kg n d of 40 calcium nitrate are added during the remaining period hkdsd doses tcs with 16 73 kg n h of 40 calcium nitrate to control sulfide emission to determine the applicability of the proposed sewer biofilm model in different sewers data were collected from tcs and mh17 respectively for calibration and validation of the proposed sewer model in this study a 72 h intensive sampling campaign in tcs was conducted in february 2010 starting from 11 00 07 02 2010 10 02 2010 during which water samples were taken every 2 h to measure the water parameters described below the profile of water flow rates was logged in the pumping stations as for mh17 a 48 h intensive sampling campaign was performed in july 2012 starting from 17 00 11 07 2012 13 07 2012 during which water samples were taken bihourly to measure ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and sulfate sulfide soluble chemical oxygen demand scod total chemical oxygen demand tcod volatile fatty acids vfas alkalinity ammonia nh4 n volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss concentrations of the inlet and outlet moreover the h2s and oxygen gases in the outlet manhole of mh17 were also monitored online the diameter of the outlet manhole was 1 2 m the water depth and headspace depth in the outlet manhole were 2 5 m and 1 m respectively 2 3 analytical methods tcod was measured following the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate nitrate and nitrite concentrations in water samples were measured using an ion chromatograph dionex 900 thermo fremont ca usa equipped with a dionex ionpac as18 analytical column in order to prevent volatilization and abiotic oxidation total sulfide h2s hs and s2 were preserved by sodium hydroxide naoh and zinc acetate znac according to the standard methods and then measured immediately with the methylene blue method apha 2005 tss and vss were measured by the standard methods apha 2005 ammonia was measured according to the nessler reagent method apha 2005 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was determined by the standard methods apha 2005 alkalinity and total vfas were determined by the five point titration method neytzell dewilde et al 1977 do and temperature were measured using a do meter and a thermometer ysi500 yellow spring instrument co yellow spring ohio respectively the ph in the water samples was determined with a ph meter phs 25 shanghai leici instrument factory china h2s and oxygen concentrations were logged online by the odalog instrument odalog 7000 app tek international pty ltd australia 2 4 model calibration and validation the model calibration was conducted with the data collected during the 72 h intensive sampling from tcs with the objective of fitting the simulated concentrations of ammonium and sulfide at the sewer outlet with the measured data without oxygen injection ammonium concentration is relative stable due to the insignificant nitrification process so it can be used as an indicator to verify the simulation of hydraulic fluctuation before model calibration the sewer biofilms were initialized with a pre run to simulate biofilm growth in the sewer for 60 days to reduce the works for model calibration we conducted sensitivity analysis firstly according to the method described in supporting information the most sensitive parameters to the variation of biofilm thickness and sulfide concentration were found to be specific srb growth rate biofilm attachment and detachment constants therefore the three parameters were then estimated in this model calibration according to our previous study table s4 jiang et al 2009a all the simulation parameters were described in jiang et al 2009a except for length of the pipe segment in the simulation x time interval in the computation t height of biofilm compartment z see table s5 the calibrated model was then validated using the data collected during the 48 h intensive sampling from mh17 note that the capacity of the sewer process model to simulate biofilm thickness has been well calibrated and validated in our previous study jiang et al 2009a the biofilm properties at sewer inlet and outlet were not obtained in this study due to the difficulty in taking biofilm samples in such large scale pressurized sewers however the bism was developed from a previously reported sewer biofilm model that has been verified in similar sewer condition 2 5 model application to demonstrate the capability of the proposed sewer process model to simulate the effects of different odor mitigation measures applied in sewers three scenarios in tcs or mh17 with nitrate addition biocide addition and hydraulic flushing were simulated in detail we evaluated the long term effects of nitrate dosing on sulfide production in tcs as tcs was constantly dosed with calcium nitrate in the case of hydraulic flushing low high and extremely high flow rates 1000 2000 and 4000 m3 h for 1 h were applied in mh17 to simulate their effects on biofilm transformation and sulfide control within two weeks regarding the simulation of biocide addition in the mh17 we assumed that 50 and 90 of the bacteria in biofilms were killed and simulated the recovery process and sulfide rebound 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of sulfide production in mh17 and tcs the hydraulic retention times hrts of wastewater in tcs and mh17 were calculated using the measured flow rates as shown in fig 2 a and b in tcs we observed pronounced variations in flow rates from 483 to 4026 m3 h with an average of 1573 m3 h and hrts ranging from 2 2 h to 11 h the same trends were also observed in mh17 the flow rates fluctuated from 90 to 1300 m3 h with an average of 695 m3 h resulting in a dramatic change in the hrt which varied from 0 2 h to 3 h the longest hrt occurred from midnight and lasted until morning in both tcs and mh17 fig 2a and b tcod and ammonium concentrations and ph levels in the inlet and outlet of both sewers did not vary significantly fig 2c d and fig 3a d owing to the sulfide production sulfate concentration in the outlet was in general lower than that in the inlet in both tcs and mh17 fig 3 e and f as for sulfide in tcs although nitrate was used to control sulfide production a higher effluent concentration than that in the inlet was observed the influent sulfide concentration tended to be stable with an average of 0 19 mg s l while the effluent sulfide concentration varied widely from 0 03 mg s l to 3 59 mg s l with an average of 1 31 mg s l fig 3e the unsatisfactory sulfide control in tcs could be attributed to a dramatic fluctuation in sulfide production caused by the fluctuating flow rate in the long pipe 6280 m in contrast the sulfide production in mh17 was efficiently controlled with nitrate dosing leading to a lower sulfide concentration at the outlet than at the inlet fig 3f at the mh17 inlet the sulfide concentration varied from 0 65 mg s l to 14 26 mg s l with an average of 5 23 mg s l while the sulfide concentration at the outlet ranged from 0 31 to 4 56 mg s l with an average of 1 13 mg s l the average do in the both sewers were below 0 5 mg l data not shown it seems that hrt played an important role in sulfide production but we did not see a significant correlation between them in the tcs and mh17 we also did not observe any significant correlations between sulfide concentration and tcod sulfate or vfa concentrations fig s2 indicating that sulfide production in the sewers is not a function of a single water quality parameter but a combination of parameters the dynamic sulfide production is likely attributed to sewer biofilm dynamics as described above the present steady state sewer model did not take the dynamic sewer biofilm into account thus in real sewers nitrate dosing rate determined based on a steady state sewer model or the empirical experience could be either over estimated or under estimated jiang et al 2015 therefore it is imperative to develop a comprehensive sewer process model to predict the dynamic sulfide production 3 2 model calibration and validation 3 2 1 model calibration with data pool from tcs the data collected from tcs fig 2a 2c 3a 3c and 3e during the 72 h sampling period were used to calibrate bism fig 4 shows the fit between the measured and simulated ammonium and sulfide concentrations in tcs after model calibration the deviations between the measured and simulated average ammonium and sulfide concentrations were below 5 table s6 suggesting that bism can satisfactorily describe the variations in ammonium and sulfide profiles the present results also indicate that although wastewater compositions and hydraulic conditions had dramatic diurnal variations bism can precisely simulate nitrogen transformation processes in sewer biofilms and sewage and then predict sulfide and ammonia concentrations in the sewer outlet 3 2 2 model validation with data pool from mh17 the calibrated biofilm model was further validated with the measured ammonium sulfide and h2s gas concentrations in mh17 during the 48 h sampling period the simulated results match well with the measured ammonium sulfide and h2s gas concentrations fig 5 and table s6 the differences ranged from 4 to 6 table s6 the present result confirms that the model can adequately predict sulfide production furthermore at the outlet manhole of mh17 the gaseous h2s emission was also simulated and its concentration profile was found to be similar to the measured data fig 5c although the sewer conditions of tcs and mh17 were quite different the model can still reproduce the measured data closely indicating that the developed sewer model can indeed predict the dynamics of ammonia and sulfide concentrations in real municipal sewers 3 3 model application 3 3 1 nitrate addition the validated sewer process model was employed to simulate the long term effects of nitrate addition in tcs nitrate salts are an effectively and widely used chemical for sulfide control in sewers zhang et al 2008 jiang et al 2013c auguet et al 2015 mathioudakis et al 2006 reported that the use of 6 9 15 and 27 7 kg of nitrate for a period of 4 8 h in a sewer system with a combined length of 6 7 km resulted in sulfide removal efficiencies of 84 98 and 99 respectively however the long term addition of nitrate led to unsatisfactory results jiang et al 2009b liang et al 2016 in this study we also observed that sulfide could not be effectively controlled through the long term addition of nitrate in tcs therefore the dynamic bism was employed to simulate the impacts of long term nitrate dosing 16 73 kg n h of 40 calcium nitrate on biofilm composition and sulfide formation in tcs in order to optimize the dosing strategy in the tcs we observed significant differences in biofilm compositions in between the inlet and the outlet before studying the effect of long term nitrate addition on sulfidogenic activity fig s3 indicating that the biofilm compositions varied along with the pipe the long term impact of nitrate dosing on sulfide concentration and biofilm composition at the tcs sewer outlet was then simulated by the proposed sewer process model the results fig 6 show that before nitrate addition 0 240 h the average sulfide concentration was 2 46 mg s l fig 6a subsequently tcs was continuously dosed with 16 73 kg n h of 40 calcium nitrate in the simulation and the sulfide production was reduced to 1 48 mg s l 40 reduction however the level of sulfide production then rebounded to 2 05 mg s l on average after 960 h this might have been due to the fact that nitrate did not inhibit srb activity but oxidized sulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate mohanakrishnan et al 2009 this speculation was further supported by the modeling results of the abundance of sewer biofilm compositions as shown in fig 6b and c although the abundance of srb populations decreased from 64 at 240 h to 48 at 960 h after nitrate addition it then rebounded slightly and rose to 52 at 1560 h fig 6d meanwhile the percentage of heterotrophs was approximately 7 before nitrate dosing 240 h and gradually increased to 9 at 960 h and further increased to 21 at 1560 h after nitrate dosing fig 6b c and 6d this indicates that long term nitrate addition would stimulate the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers see the xh portion in fig 6b c and 6d and increase the nitrate consumption rate which would then lower the effectiveness of nitrate dosing on sulfide oxidation in sewers fig 6a this simulation result implies that although short term nitrate addition can significantly suppress sulfide production long term nitrate addition would not lead to satisfactory sulfide control in sewers due to the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers it should be noted that the growth of heterotrophic denifiers in biofilm may not be the only reason to sulfide rebound jiang et al 2009a observed sulfur particles accumulated in biofilm due to anoxic sulfide oxidation and liang et al 2016 suggested that the sulfur reduction may produce more sulfide in sewers polysulfide plays a key role to accelerate indirect sulfur reduction which would be the main sulfidogenic pathway rather than sulfate reduction sun et al 2018b zhang et al 2018a 2018b bism simulated the formation of elemental sulfur but didn t take the indirect sulfur reduction into account which merits further improvement in further works 3 3 2 hydraulic flushing hydraulic flushing can effectively remove sewer sediments via a sudden increase in the flow rate or shear force littlewood and butler 2003 this method can also effectively detach sewer biofilms and may reduce sulfide production in this study we conducted a modeling work to investigate the effects of hydraulic flushing with different flow rates 1000 2000 and 4000 m3 h for 1 h on the control of h2s emission and dissolved sulfide at the outlet of mh17 as described above the average flow rate in mh17 was 695 m3 h during the 1 h flushing event at the 13th h the flow rates were significantly increased to 1000 and then to 2000 m3 h but the h2s concentration did not differ much from that without flushing fig 7 a with an extremely high flow rate of 4000 m3 h flushing could significantly suppress the h2s emission to just 1 1 ppm on average for 200 h fig 7a however the h2s concentration recovered to the original level after 240 h or 10 days indicating the reformation of sewer biofilms and the complete recovery of sulfidogenic activity note that there was a sudden and transitory increase in sulfide emission from approximately 11 4 ppm to between 71 1 ppm and 149 3 ppm in all flushing events which could be attributed to the run out of deposited sulfide with the detached sewer biofilms the simulation results of dissolved sulfide concentration at the outlet of mh17 had similar trends with that of h2s fig s4 subsequently the changes in biofilm compositions with time were simulated under flushing at the extremely high flow rate the modeling results show that the biofilm thickness was only 0 1 mm immediately after the flushing event which was only 15 of the original level 0 7 mm fig 7b as a result the abundance of srb in the sewer biofilm was decreased from 64 to 8 after the flushing event however the biofilm thickness gradually recovered to 0 5 mm after 240 h and the percentage of srb in the sewer biofilm increased to 49 fig 7b the modeling results suggest that only when the flow rate is extremely high can a flushing event significantly detach sewer biofilms and suppress sulfide formation in a rising main however the effects only lasted for 10 days after the flushing event in fact the flow velocity in pipes reached 2 8 m s when the flow rate was extremely high indicating that hydraulic flushing may not be a practical measure for sulfide control in mh17 to the best of our knowledge bism is the first one that can evaluate the long term effects of hydraulic flushing on sulfide formation and biofilm transformation in a sewer 3 3 3 biocide addition the addition of biocides such as fna can efficiently reduce sulfide production in sewers jiang et al 2013b in a field trial intermittent fna dosing with or without simultaneously dosing with hydrogen peroxide can reduce sulfide production by more than 80 jiang et al 2013b furthermore gutierrez et al 2014 also observed that caustic dosing to raise the ph above 10 0 for hours on end i e ph shock can effectively control sulfide formation via reducing the cell viability of the microbial communities in sewers however after the addition of biocides sulfide rebounded in the following several days earlier if the biocidal effect was less prominent accordingly in this study the effects of dosing biocides such as fna or caustic solution on sulfide control were evaluated using the newly proposed model to determine the minimum biocide dosing frequency the biocidal effects on the control of h2s emission and dissolved sulfide in mh17 were simulated using bism fig 8 and s5 when it was assumed that the cell viability of the microorganisms in the biofilms in mh17 was reduced by 50 and 90 by the addition of biocides the simulation results show that the less viable microorganisms in biofilms the lower h2s concentrations at the sewer outlet fig 8 the simulation results of dissolved sulfide concentration at the outlet of mh17 had similar trends with that of h2s fig s5 when the viable fraction of microorganisms in the biofilm was declined to 10 the h2s concentrations at the outlet of mh17 decreased to 3 2 ppm on average in the first 48 h however h2s concentrations significantly rebounded from 100 h onwards adding more biocides may kill more bacteria in biofilms and extend the effective period for sulfide control however after approximately 10 days the srb activity recovered to the original level even though 90 of the microbes in the biofilm were assumed to have been killed by biocide addition this simulation result is in agreement with jiang et al 2011 who reported that sulfate reducing activity returned to original levels approximately five days after fna addition to reduce srb activity by 65 75 4 conclusions this study proposed a dynamic sewer process model bism developed from a sewer biofilm model to simulate the formation and emission of sulfide and ammonium in sewers bism was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected from two pressurized mains that are in real operation the model can predict variations in sulfide and ammonium concentrations in the two large scale sewers under changing sewage and hydraulic conditions it can also be extended to predict the long term effects of various sulfide control strategies e g nitrate and biocide addition as well as hydraulic flushing on sulfide emission and sewer biofilm compositions according to the simulation results the substantial growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms during long term nitrate addition implied that the effect of this control strategy in a pressurized main was unsustainable when using hydraulic flushing or biocide addition to control sulfide formation the re formation of biofilms in sewers could be the fundamental factor to the long term effect of sulfide control in large scale pressurized sewers long term experimental investigation of chemical dosing or sewer flushing would be very costly the sewer process model proposed in this study bism is found to be a useful and efficient tool to assess the long term effect of odor mitigation measures on biofilm dynamics and sulfide formation in sewers since the simulation of biofilm transformation was not verified in this study due to the difficulty of biofilm sampling experimental studies on biofilm transformation in large scale sewers should be conducted to further improve the model acknowledgements the authors greatly acknowledge the drainage service department of hong kong

18967,to evaluate and mitigate odor formation and emission in sewers several sewer models have been developed although these models can predict the immediate effects of chemical dosing on odor emission control the long term effects due to the variation of biofilm dynamics were generally underestimated therefore in this study we developed a dynamic model to simulate sewer processes initiated by sewer the dynamic sewer process model was calibrated and validated with experimental data collected from two pressurized mains in actual operation in hong kong tcs and mh17 the results show that the dynamic model can satisfactorily predict the dynamic concentrations of sulfide and ammonium with measured and simulated values differing by less than 6 the model was employed to systematically assess the long term effects of three commonly used control strategies i e addition of nitrate salts addition of biocides and hydraulic flushing on sulfide formation and to predict sewer biofilm compositions the modeling results reveal that the effect of odor mitigation measures on sulfide control varied with time due to the re establishment of sulfate reducing bacteria community in sewer biofilm the long term effect of nitrate addition would be diminishing because of the growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms increased from 7 to 21 after 55 days of nitrate addition to consumed more nitrate after dosing biocide or hydraulic flushing in sewers sulfide production would rebound in the following several days due to the regrowth of sewer biofilms indicating that the optimization of odor mitigation strategies is necessary this study highlights that the biofilm dynamics shall be involved in the simulation of odor formation and emission to evaluate and optimize the long term effects of mitigation measures graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm sewer modelling hydrogen sulfide odor control sewer management 1 introduction sewer systems are the core

produced through sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria srb colonizing the biofilms of sewer networks pikaar et al 2014 to inhibit sulfide production or eliminate sulfide emission to the atmosphere many odor control strategies have been adopted by the water industry such as air pure oxygen injection and chemical dosing using nitrate salts iron salts alkali and biocides for example ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 the dosing rates are generally determined based on empirical data which is easy to over or under dose of the costly chemicals due to the dynamic hydraulic flow in sewers ganigue et al 2011 to optimize the dosing strategies for odor control sewer process models such as wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformation in sewers wats hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 and sewex models sharma et al 2008 were developed to evaluate the effects of chemical dosing on sulfide formation in sewers the sulfide levels in sewers could be immediately suppressed by dosing with chemicals during which the sulfide control effectiveness were well simulated with the existing sewer process models hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 2013 sharma et al 2008 2013 however many experimental studies revealed that the effects of sulfide mitigation measures in sewers were not stable in the long term gutierrez et al 2009 2014 jiang et al 2009b 2013b liang et al 2016 for instance jiang et al 2009b and liang et al 2016 observed sulfide rebounds in sewers during the nitrate dosing campaigns the effect of ph shock when periodically dosing with caustic chemicals on suppressing sulfide production only lasted for 3 14 days according to gutierrez et al 2009 and gutierrez et al 2014 in a field trial jiang et al 2013b found that srb activity completely recovered 10 days after the addition of a biocide free nitrous acid fna the unsatisfactory long term effect of chemical dosing on in sewer sulfide control was likely attributed to biofilm dynamics in sewers which cannot be properly simulated by the existing sewer models the dynamic sewer processes related to sulfide formation are mainly initiated by sewer biofilms as the sewage characteristics vary across a sewer network the biofilm characteristics and microbial communities differ from one section of the network to another jin et al 2018 however the biofilm dynamics were under estimated by wats and sewex which simulate sulfide formation with a simplified assumption that the biofilm is in steady state hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 sharma et al 2008 as such the abilities of sewer process models to predict the long term effects of odor mitigation measures can be greatly improved by incorporating the simulation of biofilm dynamics although sun et al 2018a improved sewex by developing a dynamic biofilm model based on the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 the microbial competition between srb and other bacteria such as heterotrophs is not considered especially when nitrate or oxygen were present in rising mains in the case of nitrate dosing the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers in biofilms may increase the nitrate and organic carbon consumption and indirectly limit the srb activities through substrate competition jiang et al 2009b 2013c sun et al 2014 moreover hydraulic flushing a higher flow rate than normal a common practice in sewer maintenance can also reduce srb abundance in sewers by detaching sewer biofilms sediments the practice can lead to efficient sulfide control littlewood and butler 2003 but the existing sewer models are incapable of simulating the effects of hydraulic flushing on biofilm composition in sewers and the potential to produce sulfide in this light a dynamic sewer process model incorporating the simulation of biofilm dynamics is needed to predict and optimize the long term effects of odor mitigation strategies on sulfide production therefore in this study a dynamic sewer process model expanding our previous sewer biofilm model jiang et al 2009a was newly developed this modified biofilm model can simulate the dynamic development and detachment of sewer biofilms and the competition among organic oxidation denitrification sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation the biofilm initiated dynamic sewer process model was then calibrated and validated using data collected in field investigations in two large scale rising mains this validated sewer process model was then applied to systematically assess the long term effects of three odor mitigation measures such as nitrate addition biocide addition and hydraulic flushing on sulfide production and sewer biofilm compositions the results demonstrate the model s ability to simulate biofilm dynamics and sulfide formation in sewers 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development in this study a biofilm initiated sewer process model bism was developed to dynamically simulate the odorants formation and emission in sewers bism is divided into three sub models including a sewage quality model a modified biofilm model and a gas exchange model fig 1 a segmentation simulation process was employed for the development of this sewer model briefly the whole pipe is first divided into n segments and each segment is considered as a biofilm reactor in each sewer segment the heterogeneous biofilm processes and their effects on sulfur and nitrogen transformations were simulated to predict the concentration variations of sulfide sulfate ammonia nitrate and organic substrates in sewage if the water surface is exposed to the atmosphere e g in a gravity sewer or at the outlet of a rising main the emissions of h2s were also calculated using the odor emission sub model with a plug flow assumption the concentrations of pollutants at the sewer outlet can be determined 2 1 1 sub model 1 sewage quality model the changes in water quality in a sewer segment were simulated following eq 1 substrate exchanges from the segment upstream biofilms the atmosphere and transformations within biochemical reactions in the sewage segment were all considered 1 c t u c x m d x m g a s x r where c is the substrate concentration in g m3 t is the time interval in s u is the sewage flow rate in m s x is the length of a sewer segment in m m d is the mass exchange of soluble and particulate substances from and into the biofilm by diffusion and attachment detachment in g m2 s m gas is the mass exchange of gaseous substances oxygen hydrogen sulfide and ammonia between water and sewer atmosphere in g m2 s and r is the wastewater transformation by biochemical reactions in the water phase in a time interval in g m3 s a modified activated sludge model no 3 was employed to simulate r as shown in table s2 2 1 2 sub model 2 modified biofilm model a vertically layered biofilm model capable of simulating sewer biofilm dynamics under different hydraulic and wastewater conditions jiang et al 2009a was modified and used in this study in this biofilm model the biofilm in a sewer section is separated into many thin layers depending on the biofilm thickness in the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 the biofilm model is capable of simulating 22 biochemical processes to predict the concentration variations of seven soluble and seven particulate variables in each biofilm layer as shown in table s2 mass transfer and diffusion between biofilm layers and the water phase were simulated according to jiang et al 2009a to better simulate the sulfur and nitrogen transformations the biofilm model in this study was further modified by considering the anoxic sulfide oxidation process abdul talib et al 2002 yang et al 2005 as shown in table s2 biofilm formation bacterial community evolution within each biofilm layer and the changes in biofilm density and thickness induced by microbial competition and hydraulic impacts which have all been validated in a previous study jiang et al 2009a were simulated in the sewer biofilm model it should be noted that methanogenesis was not considered in the sewer biofilm model the high level of sulfate in sewage 500 1000 mg l as a result of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong jiang et al 2013a could inhibit the growth of methanogenic archaea lens et al 1998 2 1 3 sub model 3 gas exchange model in sewer manholes intersections or vortex chambers h2s emission and oxygen reaeration may occur the h2s in sewage was firstly calculated with eq 2 pan et al 2013 while the re aeration process was simulated followed a previous study jiang et al 2009a h2s emission was determined according to yongsiri et al 2003 eq s4 and table s3 in which the effect of ventilation on h2s at wet well was taken into account and calculated using eqs s3 s4 and s5 in the supporting information ph variation in sewer was not simulated in this model instead ph at sewer outlet was used as an input parameter for the model to calculate the concertation of unionized h2s for the further calculation of h2s release 2 h 2 s h h s p k a 1 6 97 a t 25 o c 2 2 field study on large scale sewer systems to calibrate and validate the proposed sewer process model field trials were performed in two rising mains mh17 and tcs fig s1 in hong kong china to collect data mh17 is located upstream of tcs and collects wastewater from the nearby residential and airport tcs transports wastewater from mh17 and the nearby residential area of tung chung the main characteristics of mh17 and tcs are presented in table 1 in mh17 calcium nitrate is used to control sulfide in the routine operation by the hong kong drainage services department hkdsd in which 4 02 kg n h of 40 w w calcium nitrate are added during 7 00 23 00 of each day and 5 74 kg n d of 40 calcium nitrate are added during the remaining period hkdsd doses tcs with 16 73 kg n h of 40 calcium nitrate to control sulfide emission to determine the applicability of the proposed sewer biofilm model in different sewers data were collected from tcs and mh17 respectively for calibration and validation of the proposed sewer model in this study a 72 h intensive sampling campaign in tcs was conducted in february 2010 starting from 11 00 07 02 2010 10 02 2010 during which water samples were taken every 2 h to measure the water parameters described below the profile of water flow rates was logged in the pumping stations as for mh17 a 48 h intensive sampling campaign was performed in july 2012 starting from 17 00 11 07 2012 13 07 2012 during which water samples were taken bihourly to measure ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and sulfate sulfide soluble chemical oxygen demand scod total chemical oxygen demand tcod volatile fatty acids vfas alkalinity ammonia nh4 n volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss concentrations of the inlet and outlet moreover the h2s and oxygen gases in the outlet manhole of mh17 were also monitored online the diameter of the outlet manhole was 1 2 m the water depth and headspace depth in the outlet manhole were 2 5 m and 1 m respectively 2 3 analytical methods tcod was measured following the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate nitrate and nitrite concentrations in water samples were measured using an ion chromatograph dionex 900 thermo fremont ca usa equipped with a dionex ionpac as18 analytical column in order to prevent volatilization and abiotic oxidation total sulfide h2s hs and s2 were preserved by sodium hydroxide naoh and zinc acetate znac according to the standard methods and then measured immediately with the methylene blue method apha 2005 tss and vss were measured by the standard methods apha 2005 ammonia was measured according to the nessler reagent method apha 2005 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was determined by the standard methods apha 2005 alkalinity and total vfas were determined by the five point titration method neytzell dewilde et al 1977 do and temperature were measured using a do meter and a thermometer ysi500 yellow spring instrument co yellow spring ohio respectively the ph in the water samples was determined with a ph meter phs 25 shanghai leici instrument factory china h2s and oxygen concentrations were logged online by the odalog instrument odalog 7000 app tek international pty ltd australia 2 4 model calibration and validation the model calibration was conducted with the data collected during the 72 h intensive sampling from tcs with the objective of fitting the simulated concentrations of ammonium and sulfide at the sewer outlet with the measured data without oxygen injection ammonium concentration is relative stable due to the insignificant nitrification process so it can be used as an indicator to verify the simulation of hydraulic fluctuation before model calibration the sewer biofilms were initialized with a pre run to simulate biofilm growth in the sewer for 60 days to reduce the works for model calibration we conducted sensitivity analysis firstly according to the method described in supporting information the most sensitive parameters to the variation of biofilm thickness and sulfide concentration were found to be specific srb growth rate biofilm attachment and detachment constants therefore the three parameters were then estimated in this model calibration according to our previous study table s4 jiang et al 2009a all the simulation parameters were described in jiang et al 2009a except for length of the pipe segment in the simulation x time interval in the computation t height of biofilm compartment z see table s5 the calibrated model was then validated using the data collected during the 48 h intensive sampling from mh17 note that the capacity of the sewer process model to simulate biofilm thickness has been well calibrated and validated in our previous study jiang et al 2009a the biofilm properties at sewer inlet and outlet were not obtained in this study due to the difficulty in taking biofilm samples in such large scale pressurized sewers however the bism was developed from a previously reported sewer biofilm model that has been verified in similar sewer condition 2 5 model application to demonstrate the capability of the proposed sewer process model to simulate the effects of different odor mitigation measures applied in sewers three scenarios in tcs or mh17 with nitrate addition biocide addition and hydraulic flushing were simulated in detail we evaluated the long term effects of nitrate dosing on sulfide production in tcs as tcs was constantly dosed with calcium nitrate in the case of hydraulic flushing low high and extremely high flow rates 1000 2000 and 4000 m3 h for 1 h were applied in mh17 to simulate their effects on biofilm transformation and sulfide control within two weeks regarding the simulation of biocide addition in the mh17 we assumed that 50 and 90 of the bacteria in biofilms were killed and simulated the recovery process and sulfide rebound 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of sulfide production in mh17 and tcs the hydraulic retention times hrts of wastewater in tcs and mh17 were calculated using the measured flow rates as shown in fig 2 a and b in tcs we observed pronounced variations in flow rates from 483 to 4026 m3 h with an average of 1573 m3 h and hrts ranging from 2 2 h to 11 h the same trends were also observed in mh17 the flow rates fluctuated from 90 to 1300 m3 h with an average of 695 m3 h resulting in a dramatic change in the hrt which varied from 0 2 h to 3 h the longest hrt occurred from midnight and lasted until morning in both tcs and mh17 fig 2a and b tcod and ammonium concentrations and ph levels in the inlet and outlet of both sewers did not vary significantly fig 2c d and fig 3a d owing to the sulfide production sulfate concentration in the outlet was in general lower than that in the inlet in both tcs and mh17 fig 3 e and f as for sulfide in tcs although nitrate was used to control sulfide production a higher effluent concentration than that in the inlet was observed the influent sulfide concentration tended to be stable with an average of 0 19 mg s l while the effluent sulfide concentration varied widely from 0 03 mg s l to 3 59 mg s l with an average of 1 31 mg s l fig 3e the unsatisfactory sulfide control in tcs could be attributed to a dramatic fluctuation in sulfide production caused by the fluctuating flow rate in the long pipe 6280 m in contrast the sulfide production in mh17 was efficiently controlled with nitrate dosing leading to a lower sulfide concentration at the outlet than at the inlet fig 3f at the mh17 inlet the sulfide concentration varied from 0 65 mg s l to 14 26 mg s l with an average of 5 23 mg s l while the sulfide concentration at the outlet ranged from 0 31 to 4 56 mg s l with an average of 1 13 mg s l the average do in the both sewers were below 0 5 mg l data not shown it seems that hrt played an important role in sulfide production but we did not see a significant correlation between them in the tcs and mh17 we also did not observe any significant correlations between sulfide concentration and tcod sulfate or vfa concentrations fig s2 indicating that sulfide production in the sewers is not a function of a single water quality parameter but a combination of parameters the dynamic sulfide production is likely attributed to sewer biofilm dynamics as described above the present steady state sewer model did not take the dynamic sewer biofilm into account thus in real sewers nitrate dosing rate determined based on a steady state sewer model or the empirical experience could be either over estimated or under estimated jiang et al 2015 therefore it is imperative to develop a comprehensive sewer process model to predict the dynamic sulfide production 3 2 model calibration and validation 3 2 1 model calibration with data pool from tcs the data collected from tcs fig 2a 2c 3a 3c and 3e during the 72 h sampling period were used to calibrate bism fig 4 shows the fit between the measured and simulated ammonium and sulfide concentrations in tcs after model calibration the deviations between the measured and simulated average ammonium and sulfide concentrations were below 5 table s6 suggesting that bism can satisfactorily describe the variations in ammonium and sulfide profiles the present results also indicate that although wastewater compositions and hydraulic conditions had dramatic diurnal variations bism can precisely simulate nitrogen transformation processes in sewer biofilms and sewage and then predict sulfide and ammonia concentrations in the sewer outlet 3 2 2 model validation with data pool from mh17 the calibrated biofilm model was further validated with the measured ammonium sulfide and h2s gas concentrations in mh17 during the 48 h sampling period the simulated results match well with the measured ammonium sulfide and h2s gas concentrations fig 5 and table s6 the differences ranged from 4 to 6 table s6 the present result confirms that the model can adequately predict sulfide production furthermore at the outlet manhole of mh17 the gaseous h2s emission was also simulated and its concentration profile was found to be similar to the measured data fig 5c although the sewer conditions of tcs and mh17 were quite different the model can still reproduce the measured data closely indicating that the developed sewer model can indeed predict the dynamics of ammonia and sulfide concentrations in real municipal sewers 3 3 model application 3 3 1 nitrate addition the validated sewer process model was employed to simulate the long term effects of nitrate addition in tcs nitrate salts are an effectively and widely used chemical for sulfide control in sewers zhang et al 2008 jiang et al 2013c auguet et al 2015 mathioudakis et al 2006 reported that the use of 6 9 15 and 27 7 kg of nitrate for a period of 4 8 h in a sewer system with a combined length of 6 7 km resulted in sulfide removal efficiencies of 84 98 and 99 respectively however the long term addition of nitrate led to unsatisfactory results jiang et al 2009b liang et al 2016 in this study we also observed that sulfide could not be effectively controlled through the long term addition of nitrate in tcs therefore the dynamic bism was employed to simulate the impacts of long term nitrate dosing 16 73 kg n h of 40 calcium nitrate on biofilm composition and sulfide formation in tcs in order to optimize the dosing strategy in the tcs we observed significant differences in biofilm compositions in between the inlet and the outlet before studying the effect of long term nitrate addition on sulfidogenic activity fig s3 indicating that the biofilm compositions varied along with the pipe the long term impact of nitrate dosing on sulfide concentration and biofilm composition at the tcs sewer outlet was then simulated by the proposed sewer process model the results fig 6 show that before nitrate addition 0 240 h the average sulfide concentration was 2 46 mg s l fig 6a subsequently tcs was continuously dosed with 16 73 kg n h of 40 calcium nitrate in the simulation and the sulfide production was reduced to 1 48 mg s l 40 reduction however the level of sulfide production then rebounded to 2 05 mg s l on average after 960 h this might have been due to the fact that nitrate did not inhibit srb activity but oxidized sulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate mohanakrishnan et al 2009 this speculation was further supported by the modeling results of the abundance of sewer biofilm compositions as shown in fig 6b and c although the abundance of srb populations decreased from 64 at 240 h to 48 at 960 h after nitrate addition it then rebounded slightly and rose to 52 at 1560 h fig 6d meanwhile the percentage of heterotrophs was approximately 7 before nitrate dosing 240 h and gradually increased to 9 at 960 h and further increased to 21 at 1560 h after nitrate dosing fig 6b c and 6d this indicates that long term nitrate addition would stimulate the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers see the xh portion in fig 6b c and 6d and increase the nitrate consumption rate which would then lower the effectiveness of nitrate dosing on sulfide oxidation in sewers fig 6a this simulation result implies that although short term nitrate addition can significantly suppress sulfide production long term nitrate addition would not lead to satisfactory sulfide control in sewers due to the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers it should be noted that the growth of heterotrophic denifiers in biofilm may not be the only reason to sulfide rebound jiang et al 2009a observed sulfur particles accumulated in biofilm due to anoxic sulfide oxidation and liang et al 2016 suggested that the sulfur reduction may produce more sulfide in sewers polysulfide plays a key role to accelerate indirect sulfur reduction which would be the main sulfidogenic pathway rather than sulfate reduction sun et al 2018b zhang et al 2018a 2018b bism simulated the formation of elemental sulfur but didn t take the indirect sulfur reduction into account which merits further improvement in further works 3 3 2 hydraulic flushing hydraulic flushing can effectively remove sewer sediments via a sudden increase in the flow rate or shear force littlewood and butler 2003 this method can also effectively detach sewer biofilms and may reduce sulfide production in this study we conducted a modeling work to investigate the effects of hydraulic flushing with different flow rates 1000 2000 and 4000 m3 h for 1 h on the control of h2s emission and dissolved sulfide at the outlet of mh17 as described above the average flow rate in mh17 was 695 m3 h during the 1 h flushing event at the 13th h the flow rates were significantly increased to 1000 and then to 2000 m3 h but the h2s concentration did not differ much from that without flushing fig 7 a with an extremely high flow rate of 4000 m3 h flushing could significantly suppress the h2s emission to just 1 1 ppm on average for 200 h fig 7a however the h2s concentration recovered to the original level after 240 h or 10 days indicating the reformation of sewer biofilms and the complete recovery of sulfidogenic activity note that there was a sudden and transitory increase in sulfide emission from approximately 11 4 ppm to between 71 1 ppm and 149 3 ppm in all flushing events which could be attributed to the run out of deposited sulfide with the detached sewer biofilms the simulation results of dissolved sulfide concentration at the outlet of mh17 had similar trends with that of h2s fig s4 subsequently the changes in biofilm compositions with time were simulated under flushing at the extremely high flow rate the modeling results show that the biofilm thickness was only 0 1 mm immediately after the flushing event which was only 15 of the original level 0 7 mm fig 7b as a result the abundance of srb in the sewer biofilm was decreased from 64 to 8 after the flushing event however the biofilm thickness gradually recovered to 0 5 mm after 240 h and the percentage of srb in the sewer biofilm increased to 49 fig 7b the modeling results suggest that only when the flow rate is extremely high can a flushing event significantly detach sewer biofilms and suppress sulfide formation in a rising main however the effects only lasted for 10 days after the flushing event in fact the flow velocity in pipes reached 2 8 m s when the flow rate was extremely high indicating that hydraulic flushing may not be a practical measure for sulfide control in mh17 to the best of our knowledge bism is the first one that can evaluate the long term effects of hydraulic flushing on sulfide formation and biofilm transformation in a sewer 3 3 3 biocide addition the addition of biocides such as fna can efficiently reduce sulfide production in sewers jiang et al 2013b in a field trial intermittent fna dosing with or without simultaneously dosing with hydrogen peroxide can reduce sulfide production by more than 80 jiang et al 2013b furthermore gutierrez et al 2014 also observed that caustic dosing to raise the ph above 10 0 for hours on end i e ph shock can effectively control sulfide formation via reducing the cell viability of the microbial communities in sewers however after the addition of biocides sulfide rebounded in the following several days earlier if the biocidal effect was less prominent accordingly in this study the effects of dosing biocides such as fna or caustic solution on sulfide control were evaluated using the newly proposed model to determine the minimum biocide dosing frequency the biocidal effects on the control of h2s emission and dissolved sulfide in mh17 were simulated using bism fig 8 and s5 when it was assumed that the cell viability of the microorganisms in the biofilms in mh17 was reduced by 50 and 90 by the addition of biocides the simulation results show that the less viable microorganisms in biofilms the lower h2s concentrations at the sewer outlet fig 8 the simulation results of dissolved sulfide concentration at the outlet of mh17 had similar trends with that of h2s fig s5 when the viable fraction of microorganisms in the biofilm was declined to 10 the h2s concentrations at the outlet of mh17 decreased to 3 2 ppm on average in the first 48 h however h2s concentrations significantly rebounded from 100 h onwards adding more biocides may kill more bacteria in biofilms and extend the effective period for sulfide control however after approximately 10 days the srb activity recovered to the original level even though 90 of the microbes in the biofilm were assumed to have been killed by biocide addition this simulation result is in agreement with jiang et al 2011 who reported that sulfate reducing activity returned to original levels approximately five days after fna addition to reduce srb activity by 65 75 4 conclusions this study proposed a dynamic sewer process model bism developed from a sewer biofilm model to simulate the formation and emission of sulfide and ammonium in sewers bism was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected from two pressurized mains that are in real operation the model can predict variations in sulfide and ammonium concentrations in the two large scale sewers under changing sewage and hydraulic conditions it can also be extended to predict the long term effects of various sulfide control strategies e g nitrate and biocide addition as well as hydraulic flushing on sulfide emission and sewer biofilm compositions according to the simulation results the substantial growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms during long term nitrate addition implied that the effect of this control strategy in a pressurized main was unsustainable when using hydraulic flushing or biocide addition to control sulfide formation the re formation of biofilms in sewers could be the fundamental factor to the long term effect of sulfide control in large scale pressurized sewers long term experimental investigation of chemical dosing or sewer flushing would be very costly the sewer process model proposed in this study bism is found to be a useful and efficient tool to assess the long term effect of odor mitigation measures on biofilm dynamics and sulfide formation in sewers since the simulation of biofilm transformation was not verified in this study due to the difficulty of biofilm sampling experimental

achieved at aerobic nitrogen removal rates 80 mgn l 1 d 1 comparable to those of conventional treatment plants a simple dynamic mathematical model assuming perfect biomass segregation with aob and nob in the flocs and amx in the biofilm was able to qualitatively reproduce the selective washout of nob from the flocs in response to the decrease in do setpoint similarly numerical simulations indicated that flocs removal is an effective operational strategy to achieve the selective washout of nob the direct competition for no2 between nob and amx the latter retained in the biofilm and acting as a no2 sink was identified by the model as key mechanism leading to a difference in the actual growth rates of aob and nob i e μnob μaob in flocs and allowing for the selective nob washout over a broad

the concerted activity of aerobic aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing amx bacteria speth et al 2016 optimized microbial community engineering strategies are required to favour the growth of aob and retain the slower growing amx while out competing the undesired nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob several operational strategies implemented in sidestream applications are not feasible under mainstream conditions at mesophilic temperatures 20 c aob display higher maximum growth rates than nob which allows selective nob washout at a sufficiently low solids retention time conversely at mainstream temperatures between 10 and 20 c in temperate regions the differences in growth rates are minimal hellinga et al 1998 in addition nitrogen concentrations in the main line are too low for nob to be inhibited by free ammonia nh3 or free nitrous acid hno2 anthonisen et al 1976 jubany et al 2009 as a result nob control and washout cannot be based on maximum growth rates alone as is efficiently achieved in sidestream suspended biomass systems hellinga et al 1998 joss et al 2011 the use of biofilms either grown on carrier material or in the form of granular bio aggregates has proven effective to achieve stable and resilient pn a under mainstream conditions at laboratory scale gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 biofilms allow for the long solids retention times srt needed to retain amx while substrate gradients promote the suppression of nob activity brockmann and morgenroth 2010 gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 pérez et al 2014 nob control in biofilm systems is mainly driven by the competition for oxygen with aob with the latter usually featuring higher substrate affinities brockmann and morgenroth 2010 corbala robles et al 2016 pérez et al 2014 pn a operation under oxygen limited nh4 oxidation can favour nitritation while limiting the aerobic growth of nob brockmann and morgenroth 2010 isanta et al 2015 pérez et al 2014 however operation under oxygen limitation inherently limits the aob activity as well and thus the overall process rate laureni et al 2015 pérez et al 2014 moreover despite the generally accepted higher affinity of aob for oxygen rittmann and mccarty 2001 nob are known to adapt to low dissolved oxygen concentrations do liu and wang 2013 and several studies have recently reported higher oxygen affinities for nob than aob malovanyy et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 lastly although their activity can be suppressed nob can persist in the biofilm and become active when favourable conditions are re established making their long term suppression in solely biofilm systems challenging fux et al 2004 gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 hybrid

and numerical results hubaux et al 2015 volcke et al 2012 indicate that the faster growing aerobic guilds tend to enrich in the floc fraction with direct access to dissolved substrates in turn amx have been shown to enrich in the biofilm where anoxic conditions are achieved as a result differential control of the retention times of the bacterial guilds associated with the two biomass fractions is in principle possible wett et al 2015 moreover as flocs are less diffusion limited than biofilms significantly higher aerobic volumetric conversion rates can be achieved even at low do veuillet et al 2014 nonetheless published data on hybrid systems operated for pn a remain limited and seemingly contradictory hybrid systems at high flocs concentrations above 1 gtss l 1 have been applied at full scale to treat digester supernatant at mesophilic temperatures with negligible nob activity veuillet et al 2014 conversely increased nob activity has been reported in hybrid systems with a fraction of flocs as small as 10 of total solids hubaux et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 the implications of biomass segregation and operational conditions for microbial competition in hybrid systems are as yet largely unknown the aim of this work was to understand the dominant mechanisms controlling the interaction between biofilm and flocs the influence of operating conditions and their implications for nob control in hybrid pn a systems the effect of the do on nob was assessed experimentally in an ifas system operated on real mww at 15 c in parallel a simplified dynamic mathematical model of the hybrid system was developed to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the experimental results and to understand how the composition of the flocs and the nob concentration respond to changes in do flocs removal and amx activity in the biofilm the sensitivity of the simulation outcome to model parameters was assessed relevant scenarios for engineering practice are also discussed 2 materials and

clarifier mww was pre treated in an aerated 12 l sbr operated for high rate organic carbon as cod removal at an srt of 1 d the pre treated mww featured the following characteristics 54 13 mgcodsol l 1 23 6 mgnh4 n l 1 and 0 3 mgn l 1 of no2 and no3 prior to feeding to the pn a reactor the pre treated mww was stored in a temperature controlled 20 c external buffer tank of 50 l to equalize the hydraulic loads 2 3 control of total suspended solids tss and calculation of their dynamic srt in addition to the settling step in the sbr cycle from day 70 onwards the reactor effluent was filtered through a 10 l filter bag 50 μm mesh 3m nb series nylon monofilament placed in a 50 l barrel the content of the net was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 g and the solids were reintroduced into the reactor on a daily basis the tss in the reactor and all activities were measured one cycle after biomass reintroduction the dynamic total srt was calculated considering only the observed sludge loss in the effluent and by sampling modified from takács et al 2008 1 srt t δt srt t 1 x effluent v effluent x reactor v sample x reactor v reactor δ t where xeffluent is the average tss concentration in the filter bag effluent gtss l 1 veffluent is the total effluent volume discharged during the time interval vsample is the volume taken out for biomass sampling xreactor is the tss concentration in the reactor gtss l 1 vreactor is the volume of the bulk liquid phase in the reactor 12 l and δt is the time interval between subsequent measurements d the aerobic srt is calculated from the total srt as follows 2 srt aerobic srt t aerobic t total where taerobic ttotal is the actual fraction of aerobic time over the total batch time fig s1 the development of tss srt and srtaerobic over time is presented in fig s2 together with the volumetric particle size distribution of the flocs measured on days 451 and 465 via laser light scattering mastersizer 2000 malvern uk during the experiment srtaerobic increased from 4 7 to 49 1 days 2 4 maximum activities of aob nob and amx and their segregation between biofilm and flocs the maximum anammox activity ramx max is defined as the volumetric rate of nitrogen removal sum of nh4 and no2 in the absence of do and under non limiting concentrations of nh4 and no2 ramx max was measured in situ once or twice a week the maximum activities of aob and nob raob max and rnob max are defined respectively as the volumetric rates of nh4 oxidation and no3 production raob max and rnob max were measured via ex situ batch tests 1 l run under fully aerobic conditions 5 mgo2 l 1 and non limiting concentrations of nh4 and no2 the liquid fraction was sampled during mixing and a proportional number of random carriers were chosen manually mixing was provided with a magnetic stirrer 200 rpm and the temperature was maintained at 15 1 c after manually removing all carriers raob max and rnob max of the flocs were measured the ramx max value of the suspension was checked ex situ five times throughout the experimental period and was confirmed to be negligible nh4 and no2 were supplied as nh4cl and nano2 20 30 mgn l 1 and volumetric consumption rates were calculated by linear regression of laboratory measurements of 3 4 grab samples from the bulk liquid phase 2 5 activities of aob nob and amx during regular operation aerobic step the volumetric activities of the three main autotrophic guilds during regular operation raob cycle rnob cycle and ramx cycle expressed as mgnh4 n l 1 d 1 mgno3 n l 1 d 1 and mg nh4 no2 n l 1 d 1 respectively were estimated according to laureni et al 2016 in short during the aerated step of an sbr cycle the consumption of nh4 accumulation of no2 and production of no3 were followed by laboratory measurements of 3 4 grab samples from the bulk liquid phase the activities were estimated based on the stoichiometric and kinetic matrix presented in table 1 with parameters from table 2 heterotrophic denitrification during aeration was assumed to be negligible laureni et al 2016 2 6 nitrogen removal over the entire sbr cycle and during the aerobic step over the entire sbr cycle the volumetric n removal rate mgn l 1 d 1 was calculated by dividing the difference between the sum of the dissolved nitrogen species nh4 no2 and no3 in the influent and effluent by the hydraulic retention time hrt d the relative removals of nh4 and total nitrogen are defined as the difference between their influent and effluent concentrations divided by the influent concentrations the influent and effluent were sampled once per week fig s3 during aeration the aerobic volumetric n removal rate mgn l 1 d 1 was calculated as the difference between the nh4 consumption rate and the rates of no2 and no3 production the aerobic n removal efficiency was estimated by dividing the n removal rate during aeration by the nh4 depletion rate 2 7 growth rate of aob nob and amx the maximum growth rates of aob μaob max and nob μnob max were estimated during phase ii when substrate limitations were minor based on the measured exponential increase in their maximum activity in the flocs ri max fig 2b or in their activity during operation ri cycle fig 2c most of the activity increase occurred in suspension where diffusion limitation was assumed to be of minor importance the potential seeding of aob and nob from the biofilm was neglected the suspended solids mass balance xi with i aob nob is expressed as 3 dx i dt μ i max b i 1 srt x i μ i obs x i where μi max and μi obs are the maximum and observed growth rates respectively of the guild i d 1 bi is the decay rate of the guild i d 1 set to 0 05 μi max and srt is the solids retention time d the value of μi obs was obtained from the exponential interpolation of the measured increase in activities ri mgn l 1 d 1 4 r i t r i t δ t exp μ i obs δ t from eqs 3 and 4 and considering that growth occurs only during the aerobic time the maximum growth rate can be estimated as follows 5 μ i max μ i obs b i t total t aerobic 1 srt aerobic where taerobic ttotal is the average fraction of aerobic time over the total batch time and srtaerobic the average aerobic srt during the considered period the srt was not considered in the estimation of the maximum growth rate of amx μamx max as their growth occurred almost exclusively on the biofilm the uncertainty associated with μi max was quantified by means of monte carlo simulations as previously described laureni et al 2015 2 8 amplicon sequencing analyses of the bacterial community compositions in biofilm and flocs the amplicon sequencing method is presented in the supporting information section s1 2 9 analytical methods the concentration of nh4 was analysed using a flow injection analyser fiastar 5000 foss denmark the concentrations of no2 and no3 were analysed by ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland the cod was measured photometrically with test kits hach lange germany the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm filters macherey nagel germany prior to analysis the concentration of total and volatile suspended solids vss tss in the mixed liquors was determined according to standard methods apha 2005 the total solids ts on biofilm carriers were estimated as described previously laureni et al 2016 3 mathematical model of the hybrid system 3 1 model description a dynamic model of the hybrid mbbr operated in sbr mode was developed and implemented in matlab version r2015b mathworks inc the matlab scripts are available as open source code in the supporting information the aim of the model was to understand how the composition of the flocs and the nob concentration respond to changes in do fraction of flocs removed per sbr cycle fwas and maximum volumetric amx activity ramx max to this end perfect biomass segregation was assumed with aob and nob in the flocs and amx in the biofilm fig 1 five soluble compounds were considered ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 di nitrogen gas n2 and do the aob nob and amx processes were modelled according to the stoichiometric and kinetic matrix in table 1 unless explicitly stated parameter values were taken from the literature table 2 xaob and xnob were assumed to grow in the flocs and their abundance and activity to be influenced by growth and washout for the sake of simplicity the model excluded decay processes free ammonia and free nitrous acid inhibitions were considered negligible under mainstream concentrations and ph amx were considered to grow in a deep biofilm morgenroth 2008 the primary goal of the modelling was to understand the role of the biofilm as no2 sink the biofilm was consequently modelled as zero dimensional and spatial gradients were neglected in order to discuss the potential effects of diffusion additional simulations were run with 10 fold increased values for no2 and nh4 affinity constants of amx moreover as the activity of deep biofilms is transport limited rather than biomass limited the maximum amx process rate ρamx max μamx max xamx mgcod l 1 d 1 table 1 was assumed to be constant during each simulation this was implemented by considering the concentration of amx xamx and the process rate as constants the oxygen inhibition of amx was not explicitly modelled deep biofilms are in fact oxygen limited and the modelled amx activity is to be considered the activity resulting from the anoxic biofilm layers for consistency with the experimental part the simulation results are presented as a function of ramx max mg nh4 no2 n l 1 d 1 as obtained by the product of ρamx max and the sum of the stoichiometric coefficients for nh4 and no2 table 1 3 2 simulation strategy and scenario analysis the influent was assumed to contain 20 mgnh4 n l 1 and be devoid of no2 no3 and cod filling settling and decanting steps were assumed to be instantaneous only the aerated phase was simulated dynamically as in the operation of the experimental reactor settling was initiated each time the nh4 concentration equalled 2 mgn l 1 this resulted in variable cycle durations depending on biomass activity simulations were performed for a temperature of 15 c at which maximum growth rates were estimated in the reactor the do was assumed constant and the volumetric exchange of mww was 50 per cycle the initial concentration of nh4 at the start of each cycle was the result of mixing half of its value at the end of the previous cycle plus half of the influent concentration i e 11 mgn l 1 the no2 and no3 concentrations at the start of each simulated cycle were always equal to half of their values at the end of the previous cycle a fixed fraction of flocs fwas was removed at the end of each cycle fwas was defined as the mass removed from the reactor divided by mass of solids present in the reactor xremoved vremoved xreactor vreactor simulations were run until a pseudo steady state was reached i e constant effluent n and flocs concentration pseudo steady state were shown to be independent from the initial xaob and xnob the sensitivity of the model outputs was assessed with respect to the ratio between the o2 affinity constants of nob and aob ko2 nob ko2 aob and the ratio between the no2 affinity constants of nob and amx kno2 nob kno2 amx table s1 figure s9 a combination of different ρamx max 0 24 mgcod l 1 d 1 corresponding to ramx max 0 300 mg nh4 no2 n l 1 d 1 and fwas 0 4 1 7 were simulated for two do 0 15 and 1 5 mgo2 l 1 these modelled parameter values were explicitly chosen to fall in the range of the experimental values to assess the impact of the individual control parameters four specific scenarios are discussed table 3 3 3 interdependence between fwas hrt and srt for an sbr where the reaction phase of the cycle is always extended until the target effluent nh4 concentration is reached 2 mgn l 1 the hrt the fwas and ultimately the srt are interdependent at pseudo steady state the aob removed at the end of each cycle must equal the growth of aob during that cycle 6 f was x aob t v reactor τ 0 t μ aob τ x aob τ v reactor dτ where xaob t is the concentration of aob at the end of a cycle mgcod l 1 t is the length of the cycle d vreactor is the working volume of the reactor l μaob τ is the actual growth rate of aob at time τ during the cycle d 1 and xaob τ is the aob concentration at time τ mgcod l 1 under the simplifying assumption that over a cycle μaob const and xaob const eq 6 can be simplified to 7 f was μ aob t from eq 7 it can be seen that the hrt and the cycle time are directly linked for a given actual growth rate of aob increasing fwas increases t and thus the hrt as a result hrt and fwas cannot be controlled independently the value of fwas also impacts the pseudo steady state xaob and xnob and lower biomass concentrations result from higher fwas furthermore this has direct implications on the srt of the flocs defined as the average biomass present in the reactor divided by the biomass removed per cycle under the simplifying assumption that x const over a cycle it follows that 8 srt x v reactor f was x v reactor t t f was 1 μ aob from eq 8 after substituting eq 7 it can be seen that the srt is not an independent parameter either but is directly determined by the actual growth rate of the aob for the given environmental conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 long term operation of the hybrid mbbr and the impact of do on nob control 4 1 1 maximum volumetric activities ri max segregation between biofilm and flocs a 12 l hybrid mbbr was operated for mainstream pn a at 15 c on aerobically pre treated mww and the impact of the do on microbial competition and nob control was investigated the total and flocs associated maximum volumetric activities ri max of the three main guilds were measured as proxy for their abundance fig 2a and b over more than one year the reactor was stably operated as pn a i e prior to phase i in fig 2 laureni et al 2016 during phase ii as a result of the simultaneous increase in do from 0 17 to 1 2 mgo2 l 1 and the improved flocs retention raob max and rnob max increased exponentially fig 2b the observed increase was mainly associated with the flocs dotted line in fig 2b over the same period the total suspended solids increased from 0 2 to 1 gtss l 1 figure s2 the estimated maximum growth rate of aob μaob max and nob μnob max were 0 30 0 06 and 0 34 0 06 d 1 respectively for amx a μamx max of 0 014 0 004 d 1 was estimated the increase in raob max and rnob max stopped when the do was decreased to its initial value of 0 17 mgo2 l 1 day 115 phase iii while keeping all other operational conditions unchanged after an apparent delay of over six weeks rnob max started to decrease while the established raob max was maintained in the system fig 2b the loss in rnob max was primarily associated with the flocs during phase iv raob max and rnob max increased exponentially in particular when the do was increased to 1 6 mgo2 l 1 day 460 unfortunately the increase stopped on day 475 when a dramatic drop in all ri max was observed in correlation with a multiple day heavy rain event this also coincided with a 15 loss of tss in the system although this alone cannot explain the activity loss importantly all ri max naturally recovered in less than two months phase v fig 2 all operational conditions are presented in figure s1 4 1 2 volumetric activities during regular operation ri cycle the actual volumetric activities ri cycle of the three main guilds were measured during the aerobic step of an sbr cycle to assess the impact of the imposed operational condition on microbial competition actual activities are presented in fig 2c and the observed yields of nh4 converted to no2 and no3 are displayed in fig 2d during periods of high do phase ii and iv the volumetric activities during regular operation ri cycle were comparable to the maximum activities ri max indicating that substrate limitations were minor under these conditions fig 2a c the μaob max 0 28 0 05 d 1 and μnob max 0 30 0 06 d 1 estimated during phase ii were in good agreement with those obtained from the increase in ri max decreasing the do on day 115 phase iii resulted in an immediate decrease of raob cycle and rnob cycle as both guilds become do limited fig 2c after a delay of about two months rnob cycle started to decrease progressively in accordance with the behaviour of rnob max the decrease in rnob cycle coincided with the increase of ramx cycle indicating a progressive shift in the competition for no2 from day 285 onwards very little nob activity was detected as supported by the low no3 production the slight no2 accumulation indicated an excess of raob cycle over the available ramx cycle fig 2d the increase in do on day 375 phase iv led to a sharp increase in raob cycle and lead due to the excess aob maintained in the system to a pronounced accumulation of no2 to about 60 of the consumed nh4 fig 2d the rnob cycle also increased immediately due to the nob persisting in the biofilm and no3 started to accumulate the exponential increase of raob cycle and rnob cycle stopped on day 475 in conjunction with the heavy rain event fig 2c empty arrow 4 1 3 bacterial community composition of biofilm and flocs the relative read abundances of aob nob and amx in the biofilm and flocs are presented in fig 3 the dynamics of all individual otus detected within the three guilds are shown in figure s4 in good agreement with the observed ramx max amx were almost exclusively present in the biofilm with relative abundances of up to 15 of the total reads 0 1 in suspension interestingly four different otus were detected for amx in the biofilm and displayed different dynamics suggesting possible fine scale differentiation in the ca brocadia lineage fluorescence in situ hybridization fish micrographs of biofilm cryosections are shown in figure s7 significantly lower relative read abundances were observed for aob and nob throughout the entire operation fig 3b and c during phase iii the tss increased from 1 to over 2 5 gtss l 1 figure s2 the relative abundance of aob genus nitrosomonas progressively increased from approximately 0 5 to over 2 5 in the flocs whereas the relative abundance of nob genus nitrospira decreased progressively from 0 4 to below 0 1 thus the observed loss of nob activity fig 2 coincided with the actual washout of nob from the flocs the relative read abundances of both aob and nob guilds during phase iv increased markedly on the biofilm supporting the observed increases in raob max and rnob max fig 2 two different otus were identified for aob with distinct trends in biofilm and flocs the ratio of the relative read abundances of aob and nob is shown in fig 3d aob were selectively enriched over nob in the flocs during the period at low do phase iii the aob nob ratio increased from 5 to over 20 no major changes in the aob nob ratio were observed in the biofilm 4 1 4 nob control at low do wash out from the flocs and activity suppression in the biofilm aob and nob grew in the flocs and biofilm the enrichment of both guilds in the flocs less diffusion limited is in good agreement with previous experimental and modelling reports on pn a hubaux et al 2015 park et al 2014 veuillet et al 2014 vlaeminck et al 2010 volcke et al 2012 winkler et al 2011 also aob and nob displayed comparable maximum specific growth rates as expected at mainstream temperatures hellinga et al 1998 in principle these conditions would hinder the possibility to differentiate the actual growth rates of the two guilds and selectively wash out nob as efficiently achieved in sidestream suspended biomass systems hellinga et al 1998 joss et al 2011 nevertheless prolonged operation at low do 0 17 mgo2 l 1 did result in the selective wash out of nob from the flocs fig 2 this is explained by a distinctive characteristic of hybrid systems namely the competition for no2 between the nob in the flocs and the amx enriched in the biofilm acting as a no2 sink the proposed mechanisms for the selective nob washout are extensively discussed in the modelling section the accumulation and persistence of an nob fraction in biofilms has also been widely reported and makes the suppression of no2 oxidation challenging in solely biofilm pn a systems fux et al 2004 gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 park et al 2014 poot et al 2016 veuillet et al 2014 here the actual nitratation activity of the nob rnob cycle in the biofilm was consistently controlled by the do and was completely suppressed at 0 17 mgo2 l 1 phase iii and v presumably due to diffusion limitations to assess whether rnob cycle was suppressed only by do limitation or also by no2 limitation ri cycle were measured under non limiting no2 concentrations no increase in rnob cycle was observed confirming that do rather than no2 was the limiting substrate for nob in the biofilm fig 2c vertical black arrows in phase v as a result of the selective enrichment of aob in the flocs high no2 fluxes to the biofilm for amx can be guaranteed at sufficiently low do to suppress nob activity in the biofilm 4 1 5 effluent quality overall the wash out of nob from the flocs and the suppression of their activity in the biofilm at low do resulted in n removals over 88 4 and a residual concentration of total n below 3 mgn l 1 1 9 0 5 mgnh4 n l 1 0 3 0 2 mgno2 n l 1 and 0 5 0 3 mgno3 n l 1 this is the highest effluent quality reported so far for mainstream pn a systems de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 moreover the aerobic n removal rates achieved 79 16 mgn l 1 d 1 at an hrt of 11 2 h were comparable to those of conventional wwtp metcalf et al 2013 the dynamics of influent and effluent concentrations are presented in figure s3 4 2 mathematical modelling of the hybrid mbbr a simple dynamic model was developed to understand how the nob concentration in the flocs xnob respond to changes in do fraction of flocs removed per sbr cycle fwas and maximum volumetric amx activity in the biofilm ramx max to assess the impact of the individual control parameters four different scenarios were simulated table 3 the dynamics of xaob and xnob and effluent n concentrations are presented in fig 4 and one cycle at pseudo steady state is shown for each scenario in figure s5 the interdependences between the parameters and the impacts of substrate affinities are also discussed 4 2 1 scenario 1 baseline high aob and nob enrichment in the flocs a low initial concentration of 1 mgcod l 1 was set for xaob and xnob prolonged operation at 1 5 mgo2 l 1 resulted in the enrichment of both aob and nob in the flocs fig 4a similar to experimental observations during reactor operation phase ii fig 2 the pseudo steady state xaob and xnob obtained in scenario 1 were assumed as initial concentrations for the other scenarios 4 2 2 scenario 2 the do controls the selective washout of nob from the flocs the do has a direct impact on the growth rate of both aob and nob see process rates in table 1 aob and nob are also equally exposed to washout e g by removing a fraction of flocs at the end of each sbr cycle fwas however only the nob growth rate is impacted by the competition for no2 with the no2 sink represented by the amx in the biofilm this direct competition for no2 between nob and amx leads to a difference in the actual growth rates of aob and nob i e μnob μaob providing the basis for the selective nob washout i e μnob srt 1 μaob the impact of a do decrease to 0 15 mgo2 l 1 was assessed in scenario 2 to reflect the experimental strategy phase iii fig 2 under the imposed do limiting condition and at the fixed fwas only aob could be maintained in the system while nob were successfully washed out high n removals are achieved 84 fig 4b f at the same time due to the decreased aob activity the hrt increases from 1 6 to 5 9 h i e longer cycles are required to achieve the set effluent nh4 concentration in terms of effluent concentrations the reduction of the do limits the aerobic activity as was the case in the reactor fig 2c and results in the immediate reduction of no3 fig 4f the numerical results provide a mechanistic interpretation for the experimental observations the sole reduction of the do was sufficient to reduce the actual nob growth rate below the minimum required to prevent their washout moreover the simulations support the possibility to use do to achieve the selective washout of nob from the flocs 4 2 3 scenario 3 increasing the fraction of flocs removed per cycle is an effective strategy to achieve selective nob washout decreasing the do might not always be a viable option at full scale either because the operational do is already low or the size of the installed aerators and blowers is not suitable joss et al 2011 conversely the selective removal of the flocs from a hybrid mbbr or of fine particles from a granular sludge system may be a more feasible option e g via a separate settler veuillet et al 2014 hydrocyclone wett et al 2015 or screen han et al 2016 simulations were run to assess the effectiveness of increasing the fraction of flocs removed at the end of each sbr cycle as a strategy to achieve the selective washout of nob numerical results suggest that successful nob washout can indeed be achieved by increasing fwas while maintaining all other conditions unchanged under scenario 3 only the fwas was increased to 1 7 and as a result nob were selectively washed out at an srt of 6 8 d fig 4c in this case the actual nob growth rate function of do and no2 concentrations table 1 is no longer sufficient to compensate for the increased washout simultaneously the significantly lower aob concentrations maintained in the system result in higher hrt and thus reduced n loads that can be treated at the same effluent quality eq 7 nevertheless in comparison to lowering the do increasing fwas allows a faster nob washout from a process control perspective the proposed simulation examples highlight how in principle nob can be washed out by only controlling the removal of the flocs 4 2 4 scenario 4 variations of amx activity in the biofilm the no2 sink have a direct impact on nob concentration in the flocs the nob in the flocs compete for no2 with the amx enriched in the biofilm the no2 sink here represented by the maximum volumetric amx activity ramx max increasing ramx max i e the rate of no2 consumption by amx reduces the bulk no2 concentration and consequently the actual nob growth rate analogously to decreasing the do the possibility of achieving complete and selective nob washout from the flocs by increasing ramx max was shown numerically under scenario 4 the increase in ramx max resulted in a higher no2 consumption and thus a stronger competition with nob which are successfully washed out fig 4d at the same time simulations indicate that increasing ramx max results in slightly lower aob concentrations as amx reduce the nh4 available for aob growth with however minor implications in terms of hrt as a result a high n removal is achieved while still maintaining a low hrt the dynamics in effluent n concentrations are similar to scenario 2 an immediate decrease of the no3 concentration due to the reduced no2 available for nob is followed by a further progressive reduction as nob are washed out fig 4h at full scale the maximum amx activity can in principle be increased e g by bio augmentation from a sidestream pn a process wett et al 2015 on the other hand a partial or complete inhibition of the amx guild represents the opposite case where nob may grow in the flocs due to the reduced competition for no2 under such circumstances increasing fwas and or reducing the do may be suitable operational strategies to prevent nob proliferation as will be discussed in the next section 4 2 5 interdependent impacts of do fwas and ramx max on nob and the impact of substrates diffusion in the biofilm to better understand the interdependence between the different control parameters the pseudo steady state concentrations of xaob xnob and effluent no3 are shown in fig 5 as a function of different ramx max and fwas two do concentrations were simulated 0 15 and 1 5 mgo2 l 1 representative of the low and high do experimental periods the pseudo steady state of the four scenarios discussed in the previous sections are highlighted xnob and the effluent no3 concentration decrease with increasing ramx max i e the competing no2 sink for any given do and fwas there is a minimum ramx max required for full nob washout from the flocs fig 5b e xaob also decrease with increasing ramx max in fact by consuming nh4 amx reduce its availability for aob growth fig 5a d this effect disappears and xaob stabilizes as soon as the nob are fully washed out as a matter of fact when present in the system nob consume no2 and indirectly favour aob by decreasing nh4 depletion by amx as an example the case of partial amx inhibition would be equivalent to moving horizontally to the left in fig 5 an increased xnob is to be expected unless e g do is decreased or and fwas is increased additional simulations with a conservative ten times higher value for both nh4 and no2 affinity constants of amx were run to assess the effects of substrate diffusion through the biofilm on the modelled pseudo steady states only the case of fwas equal to 0 5 was considered as can be seen from fig 5 differences from the reference case i e with unmodified affinity constants are negligible it is therefore deemed justified to neglect diffusion effects for the purpose of this work overall when interpreting the numerical results it is important to consider the simplifying assumptions made in the modelling of the biofilm amx inhibition by oxygen was neglected and the ramx max was assumed to be the result of the active amx in the anoxic layers of a deep biofilm in addition no nob growth in the biofilm was considered in this respect it is worth noting that the nitrifying activity of nob was shown experimentally to be completely suppressed at low do additional simulations with more complex models including biomass stratification and inhibition processes are recommended here nevertheless the simplified model allowed to identify the fundamental role played by the amx enriched biofilm no2 sink in favouring the selective nob washout from the flocs 4 2 6 the possibility of successful nob washout from the flocs is not impaired by the values of the affinity constants in solely biofilm pn a systems the ratio of the oxygen affinity constants ko2 nob ko2 aob and the ratio of the no2 affinity constants kno2 nob kno2 amx are reported as the main parameters controlling microbial competition brockmann and morgenroth 2010 hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 picioreanu et al 2016 for example hao et al 2002 have reported that ko2 nob ko2 aob 0 2 and kno2 nob kno2 amx 3 is a required condition for successful nob suppression in a biofilm system modelled at 30 c in the present study the sensitivity of the simulation results and the validity of the previously drawn conclusions was tested with respect to the ratios ko2 nob ko2 aob and kno2 nob kno2 amx to ease the interpretation of the sensitivity analysis ko2 aob was maintained constant 0 6 mgo2 l 1 and the ko2 nob ko2 aob ratio was varied between 0 14 regmi et al 2014 and 2 00 pérez et al 2014 by changing ko2 nob table s1 simulations were run for the two reference do of 0 15 and 1 5 mgo2 l 1 and a fixed fwas of 0 5 the pseudo steady state xnob and effluent no2 concentrations are displayed as a function of ko2 nob ko2 aob in fig 6 an overview of xaob and xnob and the effluent concentrations of the dissolved n species is presented in fig s8 at a low do 0 15 mgo2 l 1 the value of ko2 nob ko2 aob determines the mechanisms controlling nob washout on the one hand for values of ko2 nob ko2 aob 1 low no2 concentrations are modelled i e rapidly consumed by nob and amx and the competition with amx for no2 is the dominant mechanism controlling nob washout increasing ramx max results in lower nob pseudo steady state concentrations fig 6a importantly nob are successfully washed out in the model even in the extreme case of ko2 nob ko2 aob 0 14 regmi et al 2014 which would make their control challenging in solely biofilm systems brockmann and morgenroth 2010 hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 on the other hand for higher values ko2 nob ko2 aob 1 do limitation starts to play an important role due to the reduced nob growth rate lower nob concentrations can be sustained in the system and no2 accumulates if the amx activity is not sufficiently high fig 6b interestingly for large ko2 nob ko2 nob ko2 aob 2 00 nob are washed out from the system even in the absence of amx and despite high no2 accumulation in this case the actual nob growth rate is not sufficient to maintain them in the system at the cycle length set by aob and the imposed fwas eq 7 importantly if ramx max is sufficiently high e g 65 mgn l 1 d 1 the nob washout does not depend on ko2 nob ko2 aob at a high do 1 5 mgo2 l 1 nob washout is less sensitive to the value of ko2 nob ko2 aob and the competition for no2 with amx is the dominant mechanism controlling nob washout fig 6c nevertheless in analogy to the low do case no2 accumulation occurs for high values of ko2 nob ko2 aob taken together these results provide a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the seemingly contradictory experimental observations during phase iv fig 2 when only limited nob enrichment was observed in the flocs despite high do and pronounced no2 accumulation in general higher ramx max are required for nob washout e g 237 mgn l 1 d 1 compared to the case at low do in terms of no2 affinity constants kno2 nob was decreased from a usually assumed value 100 times higher than kno2 amx hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 to a value of 0 1 kno2 amx figure s9 decreasing kno2 nob increases the competitive advantage of nob over amx and results in higher xnob at pseudo steady state for any given ramx max nevertheless within the broad range of values tested nob washout can always be achieved provided that a sufficiently high ramx max is present fig s9 in summary this work strongly support the increased operational flexibility offered by hybrid systems as compared to solely biofilm systems for the control of nob under mainstream conditions in fact irrespective of the values chosen for the affinity constants it is in principle always possible to control the selective pressure on nob via do fwas and or ramx max and achieve their complete washout 5 conclusions this study aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying microbial competition and the control of nob in hybrid pn a reactors to this end a hybrid mbbr was operated under mainstream conditions and a simple mathematical model of the system was developed experimentally amx were shown to enrich in the biofilm while aob and nob grew preferentially in the flocs amx are retained in the biofilm independent of floc removal and they act as a no2 sink conversely aob and nob are maintained in the flocs only if their actual growth rates is larger than the imposed washout i e if μ srt 1 the key mechanisms for selectively washing out nob from the system are maintaining a sufficiently low srt for the flocs and limiting no2 bulk phase concentrations by means of the amx no2 sink aob growth rates are not affected by no2 bulk phase concentrations allowing reactor operation with selective washout of nob while keeping aob experimental results and numerical simulations showed that for an imposed fraction of flocs removed per sbr cycle or given srt nob can be selectively washed out by decreasing the do setpoint e g from 1 2 to 0 17 mgo2 l 1 in this case while both aob and nob actual growth rates decrease due to the concurrent no2 limitation only nob growth rate is reduced below the washout threshold i e μnob srt 1 μaob in analogy for a given do setpoint simulations indicated that selective nob washout can be achieved also by increasing the fraction of flocs removed the actual nob growth rate remains unaffected but is no longer sufficient to compensate for the increased washout moreover differently from pure biofilm systems where nob suppression relies on a larger oxygen affinity of aob than nob modelling results suggest that it is in principle always possible to selectively wash out nob by controlling the do setpoint and or the flocs removal provided amx act as no2 sink in the biofilm ultimately this study demonstrates the high operational

achieved at aerobic nitrogen removal rates 80 mgn l 1 d 1 comparable to those of conventional treatment plants a simple dynamic mathematical model assuming perfect biomass segregation with aob and nob

that flocs removal is an effective operational strategy to achieve the selective washout of nob the direct competition for no2 between nob and amx the latter retained in the biofilm and acting as a

targeting the direct application of pn a to more dilute mww or mainstream pn a is progressing at a fast pace de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 the challenges associated with mainstream pn a relate to the highly variable dilute and cold characteristics of mww moreover mainstream pn a must guarantee volumetric n removal rates comparable to conventional wwtp i e 100 mgn l 1 d 1 metcalf et al 2013 and reliably discharge effluent to stringent water quality standards e g below 2 mgnh4 n l 1 in switzerland wpo 1998 successful pn a relies on the concerted activity of aerobic aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing amx bacteria speth et al 2016 optimized microbial community engineering strategies are required to favour the growth of aob and retain the slower growing amx while out competing the undesired nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob several operational strategies implemented in sidestream applications are not feasible under mainstream conditions at mesophilic temperatures 20 c aob display higher maximum growth rates than nob which allows selective nob washout at a sufficiently low solids retention time conversely at mainstream temperatures between 10 and 20 c in temperate regions the differences in growth rates are minimal hellinga et al 1998 in addition nitrogen concentrations in the main line are too low for nob to be inhibited by free ammonia nh3 or free nitrous acid hno2 anthonisen et al 1976 jubany et al 2009 as a result nob control and washout cannot be based on maximum growth rates alone as is efficiently achieved in sidestream suspended biomass systems hellinga et al 1998 joss et al 2011 the use of biofilms either grown on carrier material or in the form of granular bio aggregates has proven effective to achieve stable and resilient pn a under mainstream conditions at laboratory scale gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 biofilms allow for the long solids retention times srt needed to retain amx while substrate gradients promote the suppression of nob activity brockmann and morgenroth 2010 gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 pérez et al 2014 nob control in biofilm systems is mainly driven by the competition for oxygen with aob with the latter usually featuring higher substrate affinities brockmann and morgenroth 2010 corbala robles et al 2016 pérez et al 2014 pn a operation under oxygen limited nh4 oxidation can favour nitritation while limiting the aerobic growth of nob brockmann and morgenroth 2010 isanta et al 2015 pérez et al 2014 however operation under oxygen limitation inherently limits the aob activity as well and thus the overall process rate laureni et al 2015 pérez et al 2014 moreover despite the generally accepted higher affinity of aob for oxygen rittmann and mccarty 2001 nob are known to adapt to low dissolved oxygen concentrations do liu and wang 2013 and several studies have recently reported higher oxygen affinities for nob than aob malovanyy et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 lastly although their activity can be suppressed nob can persist in the biofilm and become active when favourable conditions are re established making their long term suppression in solely biofilm systems challenging fux et al 2004 gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 hybrid systems where biofilms and flocs coexist also referred to as integrated fixed film activated sludge or ifas are currently receiving increased attention for their potential advantages for pn a applications experimental evidence laureni et al 2016 leix et al 2016 malovanyy et al 2015 park et al 2014 shi et al 2016 veuillet et al 2014 vlaeminck et al 2010 wells et al 2017 winkler et al 2011 and numerical results hubaux et al 2015 volcke et al 2012 indicate that the faster growing aerobic guilds tend to enrich in the floc fraction with direct access to dissolved substrates in turn amx have been shown to enrich in the biofilm where anoxic conditions are achieved as a result differential control of the retention times of the bacterial guilds associated with the two biomass fractions is in principle possible wett et al 2015 moreover as flocs are less diffusion limited than biofilms significantly higher aerobic volumetric conversion rates can be achieved even at low do veuillet et al 2014 nonetheless published data on hybrid systems operated for pn a remain limited and seemingly contradictory hybrid systems at high flocs concentrations above 1 gtss l 1 have been applied at full scale to treat digester supernatant at mesophilic temperatures with negligible nob activity veuillet et al 2014 conversely increased nob activity has been reported in hybrid systems with a fraction of flocs as small as 10 of total solids hubaux et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 the implications of biomass segregation and operational conditions for microbial competition in hybrid systems are as yet largely unknown the aim of this work was to understand the dominant mechanisms controlling the interaction between biofilm and flocs the influence of operating conditions and their implications for nob control in hybrid pn a systems the effect of the do on nob was assessed experimentally in an ifas system operated on real mww at 15 c in parallel a simplified dynamic mathematical model of the hybrid system was developed to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the experimental results and to understand how the composition of the flocs and the nob concentration respond to changes in do flocs removal and amx activity in the biofilm the sensitivity of the simulation outcome to model parameters was assessed relevant scenarios for engineering practice are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 long term reactor operation at different do a 12 l hybrid mbbr was operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr for pn a on aerobically pre treated mww see next section the reactor was filled at a volumetric ratio of 33 with k5 biofilm carriers anoxkaldnes sweden protected surface of 800 m2 m 3 the biomass was previously acclimatised to the influent for over one year laureni et al 2016 the reactor was run for 565 days at 15 5 1 0 c each sbr cycle consisted of six steps feeding 5 l of pre treated mww 5 min anoxic mixing 10 min 200 rpm aeration and mixing variable duration in the range 60 200 min terminated at a residual nh4 concentration of 2 mgnh4 n l 1 anoxic mixing 60 min settling 60 min and effluent discharge terminated at 7 l fill level 2 min the do was varied between micro aerobic conditions phases i iii v 0 17 0 04 mgo2 l 1 gilbert et al 2015 and aerobic conditions phases ii iv 1 2 0 2 mgo2 l 1 and 1 6 0 1 mgo2 l 1 regmi et al 2014 fig 2 the total cycle duration varied between 3 5 0 5 and 5 3 0 3 h for operation at high and low do respectively the reactor was equipped with an optical oxygen sensor oxymax cos61d ion selective electrodes for nh4 and no3 concentrations and ph and temperature sensors isemax cas40d all from endress hauser switzerland the ph was not controlled and remained stable at 7 4 0 2 throughout the experimental period operational data are presented in figure s1 2 2 municipal wastewater mww the municipal wastewater was taken from the sewer of dübendorf switzerland after primary treatment screen sand removal and primary clarifier mww was pre treated in an aerated 12 l sbr operated for high rate organic carbon as cod removal at an srt of 1 d the pre treated mww featured the following characteristics 54 13 mgcodsol l 1 23 6 mgnh4 n l 1 and 0 3 mgn l 1 of no2 and no3 prior to feeding to the pn a reactor the pre treated mww was stored in a temperature controlled 20 c external buffer tank of 50 l to equalize the hydraulic loads 2 3 control of total suspended solids tss and calculation of their dynamic srt in addition to the settling step in the sbr cycle from day 70 onwards the reactor effluent was filtered through a 10 l filter bag 50 μm mesh 3m nb series nylon monofilament placed in a 50 l barrel the content of the net was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 g and the solids were reintroduced into the reactor on a daily basis the tss in the reactor and all activities were measured one cycle after biomass reintroduction the dynamic total srt was calculated considering only the observed sludge loss in the effluent and by sampling modified from takács et al 2008 1 srt t δt srt t 1 x effluent v effluent x reactor v sample x reactor v reactor δ t where xeffluent is the average tss concentration in the filter bag effluent gtss l 1 veffluent is the total effluent volume discharged during the time interval vsample is the volume taken out for biomass sampling xreactor is the tss concentration in the reactor gtss l 1 vreactor is the volume of the bulk liquid phase in the reactor 12 l and δt is the time interval between subsequent measurements d the aerobic srt is calculated from the total srt as follows 2 srt aerobic srt t aerobic t total where taerobic ttotal is the actual fraction of aerobic time over the total batch time fig s1 the development of tss srt and srtaerobic over time is presented in fig s2 together with the volumetric particle size distribution of the flocs measured on days 451 and 465 via laser light scattering mastersizer 2000 malvern uk during the experiment srtaerobic increased from 4 7 to 49 1 days 2 4 maximum activities of aob nob and amx and their segregation between biofilm and flocs the maximum anammox activity ramx max is defined as the volumetric rate of nitrogen removal sum of nh4 and no2 in the absence of do and under non limiting concentrations of nh4 and no2 ramx max was measured in situ once or twice a week the maximum activities of aob and nob raob max and rnob max are defined respectively as the volumetric rates of nh4 oxidation and no3 production raob max and rnob max were measured via ex situ batch tests 1 l run under fully aerobic conditions 5 mgo2 l 1 and non limiting concentrations of nh4 and no2 the liquid fraction was sampled during mixing and a proportional number of random carriers were chosen manually mixing was provided with a magnetic stirrer 200 rpm and the temperature was maintained at 15 1 c after manually removing all carriers raob max and rnob max of the flocs were measured the ramx max value of the suspension was checked ex situ five times throughout the experimental period and was confirmed to be negligible nh4 and no2 were supplied as nh4cl and nano2 20 30 mgn l 1 and volumetric consumption rates were calculated by linear regression of laboratory measurements of 3 4 grab samples from the bulk liquid phase 2 5 activities of aob nob and amx during regular operation aerobic step the volumetric activities of the three main autotrophic guilds during regular operation raob cycle rnob cycle and ramx cycle expressed as mgnh4 n l 1 d 1 mgno3 n l 1 d 1 and mg nh4 no2 n l 1 d 1 respectively were estimated according to laureni et al 2016 in short during the aerated step of an sbr cycle the consumption of nh4 accumulation of no2 and production of no3 were followed by laboratory measurements of 3 4 grab samples from the bulk liquid phase the activities were estimated based on the stoichiometric and kinetic matrix presented in table 1 with parameters from table 2 heterotrophic denitrification during aeration was assumed to be negligible laureni et al 2016 2 6 nitrogen removal over the entire sbr cycle and during the aerobic step over the entire sbr cycle the volumetric n removal rate mgn l 1 d 1 was calculated by dividing the difference between the sum of the dissolved nitrogen species nh4 no2 and no3 in the influent and effluent by the hydraulic retention time hrt d the relative removals of nh4 and total nitrogen are defined as the difference between their influent and effluent concentrations divided by the influent concentrations the influent and effluent were sampled once per week fig s3 during aeration the aerobic volumetric n removal rate mgn l 1 d 1 was calculated as the difference between the nh4 consumption rate and the rates of no2 and no3 production the aerobic n removal efficiency was estimated by dividing the n removal rate during aeration by the nh4 depletion rate 2 7 growth rate of aob nob and amx the maximum growth rates of aob μaob max and nob μnob max were estimated during phase ii when substrate limitations were minor based on the measured exponential increase in their maximum activity in the flocs ri max fig 2b or in their activity during operation ri cycle fig 2c most of the activity increase occurred in suspension where diffusion limitation was assumed to be of minor importance the potential seeding of aob and nob from the biofilm was neglected the suspended solids mass balance xi with i aob nob is expressed as 3 dx i dt μ i max b i 1 srt x i μ i obs x i where μi max and μi obs are the maximum and observed growth rates respectively of the guild i d 1 bi is the decay rate of the guild i d 1 set to 0 05 μi max and srt is the solids retention time d the value of μi obs was obtained from the exponential interpolation of the measured increase in activities ri mgn l 1 d 1 4 r i t r i t δ t exp μ i obs δ t from eqs 3 and 4 and considering that growth occurs only during the aerobic time the maximum growth rate can be estimated as follows 5 μ i max μ i obs b i t total t aerobic 1 srt aerobic where taerobic ttotal is the average fraction of aerobic time over the total batch time and srtaerobic the average aerobic srt during the considered period the srt was not considered in the estimation of the maximum growth rate of amx μamx max as their growth occurred almost exclusively on the biofilm the uncertainty associated with μi max was quantified by means of monte carlo simulations as previously described laureni et al 2015 2 8 amplicon sequencing analyses of the bacterial community compositions in biofilm and flocs the amplicon sequencing method is presented in the supporting information section s1 2 9 analytical methods the concentration of nh4 was analysed using a flow injection analyser fiastar 5000 foss denmark the concentrations of no2 and no3 were analysed by ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland the cod was measured photometrically with test kits hach lange germany the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm filters macherey nagel germany prior to analysis the concentration of total and volatile suspended solids vss tss in the mixed liquors was determined according to standard methods apha 2005 the total solids ts on biofilm carriers were estimated as described previously laureni et al 2016 3 mathematical model of the hybrid system 3 1 model description a dynamic model of the hybrid mbbr operated in sbr mode was developed and implemented in matlab version r2015b mathworks inc the matlab scripts are available as open source code in the supporting information the aim of the model was to understand how the composition of the flocs and the nob concentration respond to changes in do fraction of flocs removed per sbr cycle fwas and maximum volumetric amx activity ramx max to this end perfect biomass segregation was assumed with aob and nob in the flocs and amx in the biofilm fig 1 five soluble compounds were considered ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 di nitrogen gas n2 and do the aob nob and amx processes were modelled according to the stoichiometric and kinetic matrix in table 1 unless explicitly stated parameter values were taken from the literature table 2 xaob and xnob were assumed to grow in the flocs and their abundance and activity to be influenced by growth and washout for the sake of simplicity the model excluded decay processes free ammonia and free nitrous acid inhibitions were considered negligible under mainstream concentrations and ph amx were considered to grow in a deep biofilm morgenroth 2008 the primary goal of the modelling was to understand the role of the biofilm as no2 sink the biofilm was consequently modelled as zero dimensional and spatial gradients were neglected in order to discuss the potential effects of diffusion additional simulations were run with 10 fold increased values for no2 and nh4 affinity constants of amx moreover as the activity of deep biofilms is transport limited rather than biomass limited the maximum amx process rate ρamx max μamx max xamx mgcod l 1 d 1 table 1 was assumed to be constant during each simulation this was implemented by considering the concentration of amx xamx and the process rate as constants the oxygen inhibition of amx was not explicitly modelled deep biofilms are in fact oxygen limited and the modelled amx activity is to be considered the activity resulting from the anoxic biofilm layers for consistency with the experimental part the simulation results are presented as a function of ramx max mg nh4 no2 n l 1 d 1 as obtained by the product of ρamx max and the sum of the stoichiometric coefficients for nh4 and no2 table 1 3 2 simulation strategy and scenario analysis the influent was assumed to contain 20 mgnh4 n l 1 and be devoid of no2 no3 and cod filling settling and decanting steps were assumed to be instantaneous only the aerated phase was simulated dynamically as in the operation of the experimental reactor settling was initiated each time the nh4 concentration equalled 2 mgn l 1 this resulted in variable cycle durations depending on biomass activity simulations were performed for a temperature of 15 c at which maximum growth rates were estimated in the reactor the do was assumed constant and the volumetric exchange of mww was 50 per cycle the initial concentration of nh4 at the start of each cycle was the result of mixing half of its value at the end of the previous cycle plus half of the influent concentration i e 11 mgn l 1 the no2 and no3 concentrations at the start of each simulated cycle were always equal to half of their values at the end of the previous cycle a fixed fraction of flocs fwas was removed at the end of each cycle fwas was defined as the mass removed from the reactor divided by mass of solids present in the reactor xremoved vremoved xreactor vreactor simulations were run until a pseudo steady state was reached i e constant effluent n and flocs concentration pseudo steady state were shown to be independent from the initial xaob and xnob the sensitivity of the model outputs was assessed with respect to the ratio between the o2 affinity constants of nob and aob ko2 nob ko2 aob and the ratio between the no2 affinity constants of nob and amx kno2 nob kno2 amx table s1 figure s9 a combination of different ρamx max 0 24 mgcod l 1 d 1 corresponding to ramx max 0 300 mg nh4 no2 n l 1 d 1 and fwas 0 4 1 7 were simulated for two do 0 15 and 1 5 mgo2 l 1 these modelled parameter values were explicitly chosen to fall in the range of the experimental values to assess the impact of the individual control parameters four specific scenarios are discussed table 3 3 3 interdependence between fwas hrt and srt for an sbr where the reaction phase of the cycle is always extended until the target effluent nh4 concentration is reached 2 mgn l 1 the hrt the fwas and ultimately the srt are interdependent at pseudo steady state the aob removed at the end of each cycle must equal the growth of aob during that cycle 6 f was x aob t v reactor τ 0 t μ aob τ x aob τ v reactor dτ where xaob t is the concentration of aob at the end of a cycle mgcod l 1 t is the length of the cycle d vreactor is the working volume of the reactor l μaob τ is the actual growth rate of aob at time τ during the cycle d 1 and xaob τ is the aob concentration at time τ mgcod l 1 under the simplifying assumption that over a cycle μaob const and xaob const eq 6 can be simplified to 7 f was μ aob t from eq 7 it can be seen that the hrt and the cycle time are directly linked for a given actual growth rate of aob increasing fwas increases t and thus the hrt as a result hrt and fwas cannot be controlled independently the value of fwas also impacts the pseudo steady state xaob and xnob and lower biomass concentrations result from higher fwas furthermore this has direct implications on the srt of the flocs defined as the average biomass present in the reactor divided by the biomass removed per cycle under the simplifying assumption that x const over a cycle it follows that 8 srt x v reactor f was x v reactor t t f was 1 μ aob from eq 8 after substituting eq 7 it can be seen that the srt is not an independent parameter either but is directly determined by the actual growth rate of the aob for the given environmental conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 long term operation of the hybrid mbbr and the impact of do on nob control 4 1 1 maximum volumetric activities ri max segregation between biofilm and flocs a 12 l hybrid mbbr was operated for mainstream pn a at 15 c on aerobically pre treated mww and the impact of the do on microbial competition and nob control was investigated the total and flocs associated maximum volumetric activities ri max of the three main guilds were measured as proxy for their abundance fig 2a and b over more than one year the reactor was stably operated as pn a i e prior to phase i in fig 2 laureni et al 2016 during phase ii as a result of the simultaneous increase in do from 0 17 to 1 2 mgo2 l 1 and the improved flocs retention raob max and rnob max increased exponentially fig 2b the observed increase was mainly associated with the flocs dotted line in fig 2b over the same period the total suspended solids increased from 0 2 to 1 gtss l 1 figure s2 the estimated maximum growth rate of aob μaob max and nob μnob max were 0 30 0 06 and 0 34 0 06 d 1 respectively for amx a μamx max of 0 014 0 004 d 1 was estimated the increase in raob max and rnob max stopped when the do was decreased to its initial value of 0 17 mgo2 l 1 day 115 phase iii while keeping all other operational conditions unchanged after an apparent delay of over six weeks rnob max started to decrease while the established raob max was maintained in the system fig 2b the loss in rnob max was primarily associated with the flocs during phase iv raob max and rnob max increased exponentially in particular when the do was increased to 1 6 mgo2 l 1 day 460 unfortunately the increase stopped on day 475 when a dramatic drop in all ri max was observed in correlation with a multiple day heavy rain event this also coincided with a 15 loss of tss in the system although this alone cannot explain the activity loss importantly all ri max naturally recovered in less than two months phase v fig 2 all operational conditions are presented in figure s1 4 1 2 volumetric activities during regular operation ri cycle the actual volumetric activities ri cycle of the three main guilds were measured during the aerobic step of an sbr cycle to assess the impact of the imposed operational condition on microbial competition actual activities are presented in fig 2c and the observed yields of nh4 converted to no2 and no3 are displayed in fig 2d during periods of high do phase ii and iv the volumetric activities during regular operation ri cycle were comparable to the maximum activities ri max indicating that substrate limitations were minor under these conditions fig 2a c the μaob max 0 28 0 05 d 1 and μnob max 0 30 0 06 d 1 estimated during phase ii were in good agreement with those obtained from the increase in ri max decreasing the do on day 115 phase iii resulted in an immediate decrease of raob cycle and rnob cycle as both guilds become do limited fig 2c after a delay of about two months rnob cycle started to decrease progressively in accordance with the behaviour of rnob max the decrease in rnob cycle coincided with the increase of ramx cycle indicating a progressive shift in the competition for no2 from day 285 onwards very little nob activity was detected as supported by the low no3 production the slight no2 accumulation indicated an excess of raob cycle over the available ramx cycle fig 2d the increase in do on day 375 phase iv led to a sharp increase in raob cycle and lead due to the excess aob maintained in the system to a pronounced accumulation of no2 to about 60 of the consumed nh4 fig 2d the rnob cycle also increased immediately due to the nob persisting in the biofilm and no3 started to accumulate the exponential increase of raob cycle and rnob cycle stopped on day 475 in conjunction with the heavy rain event fig 2c empty arrow 4 1 3 bacterial community composition of biofilm and flocs the relative read abundances of aob nob and amx in the biofilm and flocs are presented in fig 3 the dynamics of all individual otus detected within the three guilds are shown in figure s4 in good agreement with the observed ramx max amx were almost exclusively present in the biofilm with relative abundances of up to 15 of the total reads 0 1 in suspension interestingly four different otus were detected for amx in the biofilm and displayed different dynamics suggesting possible fine scale differentiation in the ca brocadia lineage fluorescence in situ hybridization fish micrographs of biofilm cryosections are shown in figure s7 significantly lower relative read abundances were observed for aob and nob throughout the entire operation fig 3b and c during phase iii the tss increased from 1 to over 2 5 gtss l 1 figure s2 the relative abundance of aob genus nitrosomonas progressively increased from approximately 0 5 to over 2 5 in the flocs whereas the relative abundance of nob genus nitrospira decreased progressively from 0 4 to below 0 1 thus the observed loss of nob activity fig 2 coincided with the actual washout of nob from the flocs the relative read abundances of both aob and nob guilds during phase iv increased markedly on the biofilm supporting the observed increases in raob max and rnob max fig 2 two different otus were identified for aob with distinct trends in biofilm and flocs the ratio of the relative read abundances of aob and nob is shown in fig 3d aob were selectively enriched over nob in the flocs during the period at low do phase iii the aob nob ratio increased from 5 to over 20 no major changes in the aob nob ratio were observed in the biofilm 4 1 4 nob control at low do wash out from the flocs and activity suppression in the biofilm aob and nob grew in the flocs and biofilm the enrichment of both guilds in the flocs less diffusion limited is in good agreement with previous experimental and modelling reports on pn a hubaux et al 2015 park et al 2014 veuillet et al 2014 vlaeminck et al 2010 volcke et al 2012 winkler et al 2011 also aob and nob displayed comparable maximum specific growth rates as expected at mainstream temperatures hellinga et al 1998 in principle these conditions would hinder the possibility to differentiate the actual growth rates of the two guilds and selectively wash out nob as efficiently achieved in sidestream suspended biomass systems hellinga et al 1998 joss et al 2011 nevertheless prolonged operation at low do 0 17 mgo2 l 1 did result in the selective wash out of nob from the flocs fig 2 this is explained by a distinctive characteristic of hybrid systems namely the competition for no2 between the nob in the flocs and the amx enriched in the biofilm acting as a no2 sink the proposed mechanisms for the selective nob washout are extensively discussed in the modelling section the accumulation and persistence of an nob fraction in biofilms has also been widely reported and makes the suppression of no2 oxidation challenging in solely biofilm pn a systems fux et al 2004 gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 park et al 2014 poot et al 2016 veuillet et al 2014 here the actual nitratation activity of the nob rnob cycle in the biofilm was consistently controlled by the do and was completely suppressed at 0 17 mgo2 l 1 phase iii and v presumably due to diffusion limitations to assess whether rnob cycle was suppressed only by do limitation or also by no2 limitation ri cycle were measured under non limiting no2 concentrations no increase in rnob cycle was observed confirming that do rather than no2 was the limiting substrate for nob in the biofilm fig 2c vertical black arrows in phase v as a result of the selective enrichment of aob in the flocs high no2 fluxes to the biofilm for amx can be guaranteed at sufficiently low do to suppress nob activity in the biofilm 4 1 5 effluent quality overall the wash out of nob from the flocs and the suppression of their activity in the biofilm at low do resulted in n removals over 88 4 and a residual concentration of total n below 3 mgn l 1 1 9 0 5 mgnh4 n l 1 0 3 0 2 mgno2 n l 1 and 0 5 0 3 mgno3 n l 1 this is the highest effluent quality reported so far for mainstream pn a systems de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 moreover the aerobic n removal rates achieved 79 16 mgn l 1 d 1 at an hrt of 11 2 h were comparable to those of conventional wwtp metcalf et al 2013 the dynamics of influent and effluent concentrations are presented in figure s3 4 2 mathematical modelling of the hybrid mbbr a simple dynamic model was developed to understand how the nob concentration in the flocs xnob respond to changes in do fraction of flocs removed per sbr cycle fwas and maximum volumetric amx activity in the biofilm ramx max to assess the impact of the individual control parameters four different scenarios were simulated table 3 the dynamics of xaob and xnob and effluent n concentrations are presented in fig 4 and one cycle at pseudo steady state is shown for each scenario in figure s5 the interdependences between the parameters and the impacts of substrate affinities are also discussed 4 2 1 scenario 1 baseline high aob and nob enrichment in the flocs a low initial concentration of 1 mgcod l 1 was set for xaob and xnob prolonged operation at 1 5 mgo2 l 1 resulted in the enrichment of both aob and nob in the flocs fig 4a similar to experimental observations during reactor operation phase ii fig 2 the pseudo steady state xaob and xnob obtained in scenario 1 were assumed as initial concentrations for the other scenarios 4 2 2 scenario 2 the do controls the selective washout of nob from the flocs the do has a direct impact on the growth rate of both aob and nob see process rates in table 1 aob and nob are also equally exposed to washout e g by removing a fraction of flocs at the end of each sbr cycle fwas however only the nob growth rate is impacted by the competition for no2 with the no2 sink represented by the amx in the biofilm this direct competition for no2 between nob and amx leads to a difference in the actual growth rates of aob and nob i e μnob μaob providing the basis for the selective nob washout i e μnob srt 1 μaob the impact of a do decrease to 0 15 mgo2 l 1 was assessed in scenario 2 to reflect the experimental strategy phase iii fig 2 under the imposed do limiting condition and at the fixed fwas only aob could be maintained in the system while nob were successfully washed out high n removals are achieved 84 fig 4b f at the same time due to the decreased aob activity the hrt increases from 1 6 to 5 9 h i e longer cycles are required to achieve the set effluent nh4 concentration in terms of effluent concentrations the reduction of the do limits the aerobic activity as was the case in the reactor fig 2c and results in the immediate reduction of no3 fig 4f the numerical results provide a mechanistic interpretation for the experimental observations the sole reduction of the do was sufficient to reduce the actual nob growth rate below the minimum required to prevent their washout moreover the simulations support the possibility to use do to achieve the selective washout of nob from the flocs 4 2 3 scenario 3 increasing the fraction of flocs removed per cycle is an effective strategy to achieve selective nob washout decreasing the do might not always be a viable option at full scale either because the operational do is already low or the size of the installed aerators and blowers is not suitable joss et al 2011 conversely the selective removal of the flocs from a hybrid mbbr or of fine particles from a granular sludge system may be a more feasible option e g via a separate settler veuillet et al 2014 hydrocyclone wett et al 2015 or screen han et al 2016 simulations were run to assess the effectiveness of increasing the fraction of flocs removed at the end of each sbr cycle as a strategy to achieve the selective washout of nob numerical results suggest that successful nob washout can indeed be achieved by increasing fwas while maintaining all other conditions unchanged under scenario 3 only the fwas was increased to 1 7 and as a result nob were selectively washed out at an srt of 6 8 d fig 4c in this case the actual nob growth rate function of do and no2 concentrations table 1 is no longer sufficient to compensate for the increased washout simultaneously the significantly lower aob concentrations maintained in the system result in higher hrt and thus reduced n loads that can be treated at the same effluent quality eq 7 nevertheless in comparison to lowering the do increasing fwas allows a faster nob washout from a process control perspective the proposed simulation examples highlight how in principle nob can be washed out by only controlling the removal of the flocs 4 2 4 scenario 4 variations of amx activity in the biofilm the no2 sink have a direct impact on nob concentration in the flocs the nob in the flocs compete for no2 with the amx enriched in the biofilm the no2 sink here represented by the maximum volumetric amx activity ramx max increasing ramx max i e the rate of no2 consumption by amx reduces the bulk no2 concentration and consequently the actual nob growth rate analogously to decreasing the do the possibility of achieving complete and selective nob washout from the flocs by increasing ramx max was shown numerically under scenario 4 the increase in ramx max resulted in a higher no2 consumption and thus a stronger competition with nob which are successfully washed out fig 4d at the same time simulations indicate that increasing ramx max results in slightly lower aob concentrations as amx reduce the nh4 available for aob growth with however minor implications in terms of hrt as a result a high n removal is achieved while still maintaining a low hrt the dynamics in effluent n concentrations are similar to scenario 2 an immediate decrease of the no3 concentration due to the reduced no2 available for nob is followed by a further progressive reduction as nob are washed out fig 4h at full scale the maximum amx activity can in principle be increased e g by bio augmentation from a sidestream pn a process wett et al 2015 on the other hand a partial or complete inhibition of the amx guild represents the opposite case where nob may grow in the flocs due to the reduced competition for no2 under such circumstances increasing fwas and or reducing the do may be suitable operational strategies to prevent nob proliferation as will be discussed in the next section 4 2 5 interdependent impacts of do fwas and ramx max on nob and the impact of substrates diffusion in the biofilm to better understand the interdependence between the different control parameters the pseudo steady state concentrations of xaob xnob and effluent no3 are shown in fig 5 as a function of different ramx max and fwas two do concentrations were simulated 0 15 and 1 5 mgo2 l 1 representative of the low and high do experimental periods the pseudo steady state of the four scenarios discussed in the previous sections are highlighted xnob and the effluent no3 concentration decrease with increasing ramx max i e the competing no2 sink for any given do and fwas there is a minimum ramx max required for full nob washout from the flocs fig 5b e xaob also decrease with increasing ramx max in fact by consuming nh4 amx reduce its availability for aob growth fig 5a d this effect disappears and xaob stabilizes as soon as the nob are fully washed out as a matter of fact when present in the system nob consume no2 and indirectly favour aob by decreasing nh4 depletion by amx as an example the case of partial amx inhibition would be equivalent to moving horizontally to the left in fig 5 an increased xnob is to be expected unless e g do is decreased or and fwas is increased additional simulations with a conservative ten times higher value for both nh4 and no2 affinity constants of amx were run to assess the effects of substrate diffusion through the biofilm on the modelled pseudo steady states only the case of fwas equal to 0 5 was considered as can be seen from fig 5 differences from the reference case i e with unmodified affinity constants are negligible it is therefore deemed justified to neglect diffusion effects for the purpose of this work overall when interpreting the numerical results it is important to consider the simplifying assumptions made in the modelling of the biofilm amx inhibition by oxygen was neglected and the ramx max was assumed to be the result of the active amx in the anoxic layers of a deep biofilm in addition no nob growth in the biofilm was considered in this respect it is worth noting that the nitrifying activity of nob was shown experimentally to be completely suppressed at low do additional simulations with more complex models including biomass stratification and inhibition processes are recommended here nevertheless the simplified model allowed to identify the fundamental role played by the amx enriched biofilm no2 sink in favouring the selective nob washout from the flocs 4 2 6 the possibility of successful nob washout from the flocs is not impaired by the values of the affinity constants in solely biofilm pn a systems the ratio of the oxygen affinity constants ko2 nob ko2 aob and the ratio of the no2 affinity constants kno2 nob kno2 amx are reported as the main parameters controlling microbial competition brockmann and morgenroth 2010 hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 picioreanu et al 2016 for example hao et al 2002 have reported that ko2 nob ko2 aob 0 2 and kno2 nob kno2 amx 3 is a required condition for successful nob suppression in a biofilm system modelled at 30 c in the present study the sensitivity of the simulation results and the validity of the previously drawn conclusions was tested with respect to the ratios ko2 nob ko2 aob and kno2 nob kno2 amx to ease the interpretation of the sensitivity analysis ko2 aob was maintained constant 0 6 mgo2 l 1 and the ko2 nob ko2 aob ratio was varied between 0 14 regmi et al 2014 and 2 00 pérez et al 2014 by changing ko2 nob table s1 simulations were run for the two reference do of 0 15 and 1 5 mgo2 l 1 and a fixed fwas of 0 5 the pseudo steady state xnob and effluent no2 concentrations are displayed as a function of ko2 nob ko2 aob in fig 6 an overview of xaob and xnob and the effluent concentrations of the dissolved n species is presented in fig s8 at a low do 0 15 mgo2 l 1 the value of ko2 nob ko2 aob determines the mechanisms controlling nob washout on the one hand for values of ko2 nob ko2 aob 1 low no2 concentrations are modelled i e rapidly consumed by nob and amx and the competition with amx for no2 is the dominant mechanism controlling nob washout increasing ramx max results in lower nob pseudo steady state concentrations fig 6a importantly nob are successfully washed out in the model even in the extreme case of ko2 nob ko2 aob 0 14 regmi et al 2014 which would make their control challenging in solely biofilm systems brockmann and morgenroth 2010 hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 on the other hand for higher values ko2 nob ko2 aob 1 do limitation starts to play an important role due to the reduced nob growth rate lower nob concentrations can be sustained in the system and no2 accumulates if the amx activity is not sufficiently high fig 6b interestingly for large ko2 nob ko2 nob ko2 aob 2 00 nob are washed out from the system even in the absence of amx and despite high no2 accumulation in this case the actual nob growth rate is not sufficient to maintain them in the system at the cycle length set by aob and the imposed fwas eq 7 importantly if ramx max is sufficiently high e g 65 mgn l 1 d 1 the nob washout does not depend on ko2 nob ko2 aob at a high do 1 5 mgo2 l 1 nob washout is less sensitive to the value of ko2 nob ko2 aob and the competition for no2 with amx is the dominant mechanism controlling nob washout fig 6c nevertheless in analogy to the low do case no2 accumulation occurs for high values of ko2 nob ko2 aob taken together these results provide a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the seemingly contradictory experimental observations during phase iv fig 2 when only limited nob enrichment was observed in the flocs despite high do and pronounced no2 accumulation in general higher ramx max are required for nob washout e g 237 mgn l 1 d 1 compared to the case at low do in terms of no2 affinity constants kno2 nob was decreased from a usually assumed value 100 times higher than kno2 amx hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 to a value of 0 1 kno2 amx figure s9 decreasing kno2 nob increases the competitive advantage of nob over amx and results in higher xnob at pseudo steady state for any given ramx max nevertheless within the broad range of values tested nob washout can always be achieved provided that a sufficiently high ramx max is present fig s9 in summary this work strongly support the increased operational flexibility offered by hybrid systems as compared to solely biofilm systems for the control of nob under mainstream conditions in fact irrespective of the values chosen for the affinity constants it is in principle always possible to control the selective pressure on nob via do fwas and or ramx max and achieve their complete washout 5 conclusions this study aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying microbial competition and the control of nob in hybrid pn a reactors to this end a hybrid mbbr was operated under mainstream conditions and a simple mathematical model of the system was developed experimentally amx were shown to enrich in the biofilm while aob and nob grew preferentially in the flocs amx are retained in the biofilm independent of floc removal and they act as a no2 sink conversely aob and nob are maintained in the flocs only if their actual growth rates is larger than the imposed washout i e if μ srt 1 the key mechanisms for selectively washing out nob from the system are maintaining a sufficiently low srt for the flocs and limiting no2 bulk phase concentrations by means of the amx no2 sink aob growth rates are not affected by no2 bulk phase concentrations allowing reactor operation with selective washout of nob while keeping aob experimental results and numerical simulations showed that for an imposed fraction of flocs removed per sbr cycle or given srt nob can be selectively washed out by decreasing the do setpoint e g from 1 2 to 0 17 mgo2 l 1 in this case while both aob and nob actual growth rates decrease due to the concurrent no2 limitation only nob growth rate is reduced below the washout threshold i e μnob srt 1 μaob in analogy for a given do setpoint simulations indicated that selective nob washout can be achieved also by increasing the fraction of flocs removed the actual nob growth rate remains unaffected but is no longer sufficient to compensate for the increased washout moreover differently from pure biofilm systems where nob suppression relies on a larger oxygen affinity of aob than nob modelling results suggest that it is in principle always possible to selectively wash out nob by controlling the do setpoint and or the flocs removal provided amx act as no2 sink in the biofilm ultimately this study demonstrates the high operational flexibility in terms of variables that can be easily controlled by operators offered by hybrid systems for the control of nob in mainstream pn a applications acknowledgements this study was funded by

18969,lithium is today an essential raw material for renewable energy technologies and electric mobility continental brines as present in the lithium triangle are the most abundant and the easiest to exploit lithium sources lithium is present in diluted concentrations together with different ions and it is imperative to fully remove both magnesium and calcium before lithium carbonate can be precipitated here we use membrane electrolysis as a novel method to generate hydroxyl groups in situ in a two chamber electrochemical cell with a side crystallizer omitting the need for chemical addition and not leading to substantial loss of lithium rich brine batch electrolysis experiments fully removed more than 99 99 of both mg2 and ca2 for three different native south american brines treated at current densities ranging from 27 to 350 a m 2 final concentrations were below icp detection limit 0 05 mg l 1 for a brine containing 3090 mg l 1 of mg2 and 685 mg l 1 of ca2 62 kwh m 3 are needed for the full removal of both cations when a current density of 223 a m 2 is employed most importantly the li concentration in the brine is not affected the removed cations are precipitated as mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 our process has the potential to simultaneously recover lithium magnesium and calcium compounds minimizing waste production graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable mining

very close to the threshold of supply risk flexer et al 2018 lithium is typically produced from lithium rich brines or hard rock ore lithium minerals total lithium resources in brines are much more abundant flexer et al 2018 kesler et al 2012 and lithium extraction from brines is the easiest and most cost effective method kesler et al 2012 most lithium resources in continental brines are found in a small region in south america often referred to as the lithium triangle flexer et al 2018 yaksic and tilton 2009 brines can be described as highly saline solutions averaging 170 330 g salts l 1

technology currently used for lithium recovery from brines briefly brine is pumped from the underground reservoirs into a series of large open air shallow evaporation ponds when lithium reaches an optimum concentration after solar wind evaporation li2co3 is precipitated by addition of soda ash the biggest problem associated with lithium extraction today is the presence of mg2 cations in the brine an et al 2012 flexer et al 2018 mg2 and li cations show very similar ionic radii and are both highly electropositive inducing similar chemical properties vikström et al 2013 mgco3 co precipitates with li2co3 when the mg2 concentration has not been fully depleted in previous steps vikström et al 2013 currently mg2 is removed by addition of lime cao or ca oh 2 this produces an increase in ph which entails the precipitation of mg oh 2 flexer et al 2018 garrett 2004 seo et al 2014 while this is a simple technology boryta 2000 high mg2 concentrations entail high processing costs and large quantities of lime need to be constantly transported to the often remote locations moreover the addition of lime removes mg2 while concomitantly increasing ca2 concentration a fraction of ca2 simultaneously precipitates with mg oh 2 as caso4 excess ca2 will have to be removed during later steps usually in ionic exchange columns during purification of primary lithium carbonate the mix precipitate mg oh 2 caso4 is difficult to separate and is considered a waste even for brines with very low mg2 concentration kesler et al 2012 vikström et al 2013 at least 2 tons of these residues are produced and discarded at the edge of the salar per ton of purified li2co3 raising environmental concerns finally upon addition of lime mg oh 2 is precipitated as a colloidal suspension entrapping large brine volumes therefore the exploitation of brines with high mg2 content is currently non viable because of the large volumes of lithium rich brine that are lost within the mg oh 2 caso4 precipitate an et al 2012 flexer et al 2018 garrett 2004 a new technology aiming for fast efficient and selective removal of mg2 from lithium rich brines is desirable both from an environmental and an economic perspective tran et al 2016 virolainen et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the eu has listed both magnesium and magnesite as critical raw materials with great economic importance løvik et al 2018 mg oh 2 is widely used in flame retardant composite materials as an acidic waste neutralizer it is added to cattle feed and as a fertilizer and is the departing raw material for the production of metallic magnesium in this context the production of lithium salts from brines is an opportunity for the concomitant production of magnesium salts electro membrane processes have been known for decades and have been applied to diverse separation processes in the chemical industry for example zhao et al liu et al 2014 2015 zhao et al 2013 have proposed an electrochemical reactor where anode and cathode separated by a membrane can selectively capture lithium ions from brines here we propose the use of membrane electrolysis as a clean method for the in situ production of oh anions in lithium rich brines avoiding further complication of the brine to precipitate not only magnesium but also calcium producing minimal waste our method relies on electromigration combined with crystallization in the two compartment electrochemical reactor depicted in fig 1 water is reduced at the cathode producing hydroxyl ions leading to the selective precipitation of mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 in a side crystallizer the anion exchange membrane aem separating the two compartments minimizes proton migration to the cathodic compartment enabling an alkaline ph whereas the bulk of the charge balancing is done by anions present in the brine the approach is potentially easy to adapt to brines of varying chemical compositions notably with important differences in mg2 and or ca2 concentrations most importantly after electrolysis treatment both mg2 and ca2 cations are below icp oes detection limit due to low solubility values at ph 13 s m g o h 2 5 6 10 10 m and s c a o h 2 5 10 4 m at 25 c the production of large amounts of ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 as by products contributes to the economic competitiveness of the technology the methodology is potentially applicable to both the current lime evaporitic technology and to new non evaporitic disruptive technologies that also require mg2 and ca2 free brine for the production of high purity lithium salts 2 materials and methods 2

with a ph meter hanna and by universal ph test paper strips xrd diffractograms were measured on a siemens d5000 powder diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 54056 å the spectra were recorded over a

argentina in de ionized water to a final 100 ml volume a complexometric titration indicated that this reagent was only 70 pure the precipitation reaction was carried out by adding ca oh 2 in suspension to the natural brine with continuous stirring until reaching ph 10 5 the precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 3200 rpm for 10 min and dried at 90 c for 50 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 dependence of ph with electrolysis time the membrane electrolysis cell was operated at constant current density of 223 a m 2 according to the compositions of the different compartments it is expected that at the anode water is oxidized to oxygen reaction 3 potentially intermediate reactive oxygen species and or chloride to chlorine gas reaction 4 concomitantly in the cathodic compartment water is reduced to h2 with the simultaneous production of oh reaction 5 3 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 4 2 c l c l 2 2 e 5 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h the applied current and the need to maintain electroneutrality in both compartments require a net transport of anions from the cathodic to anodic compartments via the aem migration of e g protons in the other direction cannot be fully avoided but our current efficiency calculations show that this is only minor see below because chloride anions are several orders of magnitude more concentrated than oh anions throughout the experiment i e 5 15 m versus 0 1 mm at ph 10 respectively charge balancing across the membrane was predominantly carried by chloride anions in these proof of concept experiments we purposely chose to keep a ph around

the production of oh the ph increases in the cathodic compartment as the electrolysis advances as observed in fig 2 a from the early stages of the electrolysis a white precipitate consisting of tiny particles resembling a floc started forming it was visually observed that the amount of precipitate augmented as the electrolysis advanced mg2 and ca2 can precipitate as mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 respectively reactions 6 and 7 based on the solubility products p k s p m g o h 2 11 25 and p k s p c a o h 2 5 3 at 25 c lide 2003 mg oh 2 should precipitate before ca oh 2 6 m g 2 a q 2 o h a q m g o h 2 s 7 c a 2 a q 2 o h a q c a o h 2 s the curve of fig 2 a resembles an acid base titration curve where the amount of circulated charge replaces the volume of the titrant added this means that circulated charge will control the ph of the brine as expected from faraday s law and an electrochemical reaction that produces oh as a product reaction 5 for a constant current value this can also be shown in a plot of ph vs elapsed electrolysis time see fig s1 in s i the plot presents four well defined regions ranging approximately from 1 ph 6 80 to 9 20 2 ph 9 20 to 10 3 ph 10 to 12 and 4 above ph 12 firstly as the electrolysis progresses the ph continuously increases with time by production of oh when ph 9 2 is reached the ph remains almost constant with electrolysis time because most of the produced oh are consumed by mg2 to precipitate mg oh 2 and hence the oh concentration in solution remains roughly constant when mg2 in solution is exhausted see fig 2b the ph increases sharply until roughly ph 12 at this point ca2 starts to consume the produced oh to generate ca oh 2 this can thus be used to separate the mg2 from the ca2 precipitation it was not possible to accurately determine the ph beyond 13 0 because of the experimental limitations of the ph electrode fig 2 b shows the variation of mg2 and ca2 concentrations with ph during the electrolysis until ph 9 the mg2 concentration in solution decreased slowly between ph 9 and 10 the mg2 concentration dropped significantly by ph 10 5 mg2 was fully removed from the brine i e below the detection limit of the icp oes 0 05 mg l 1 the ca2 concentration in solution decreased very slowly until ph 12 at which point it began to rapidly precipitate as ca oh 2 by ph 13 1 ca2 was fully removed from the brine these observations are in agreement with our interpretation of fig 2 a above the behaviour described in fig 2 a is indeed expected based on the solubility products lide 2003 mg2 should start to precipitate at ph 8 45 and its concentration should fall below 99 99 of the original content by ph 10 4 while ca2 begins to precipitate at ph 12 and its concentration should fall below 98 2 of the original content by ph 13 1 deviations from these numbers are most likely caused by salting out effect the activities in a brine should be quite different from concentrations these fractional precipitation occurring at different ph constitutes an advantage of our proposed methodology tracking the ph variation could thus be used in practice to assess the mg2 and ca2 concentrations that remain in the brine and create two distinct precipitated products our approach thus avoids lime addition which is effective but complex as a means to control ph in addition if brines are not naturally rich in so4 2 anions addition of lime removes mg2 but increases ca2 concentration requiring further processing most importantly in our proposed methodology there should be no loss of li since lioh is 5 and 11 orders of magnitude more soluble than ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 respectively lide 2003 fig 3 compares the native brine composition grey bars with the composition after electrolysing the brine for 31 400 c at which point the ph was 10 5 red bars and after 40 800 c until ph 13 1 blue bars the concentrations of na k and li after electrolysis show a slight increase probably due to water reduction reaction 5 and electroosmosis water molecules crossing the aem as hydration shell of the migrating anions zabolotskii et al 2010 b shows the same apparent concentration increase at ph 13 1 b concentration decrease at ph 10 5 is attributed to the negatively charged borate ions b4o7 2 being adsorbed on the positively charged mg oh 2 crystals the charge on mg oh 2 is neutralized after ph 12 see below and borate ions are released again to the solution the insert in fig 3 shows that at ph 10 5 mg2 has been fully depleted from the brine while ca2 is no longer detectable if the electrolysis is pursued until ph 13 1 the precise composition values determined by icp oes are shown in table s1 in s i our first target was to harvest the precipitate at ph 10 5 with the aim of separating mg oh 2 from ca oh 2 unfortunately even after vacuum filtration centrifugation and drying the precipitate weighed roughly ten times more than predicted from the total mg2 initially present in the native brine 60 2 vs 7 4 g for 1 l of treated brine analysis of the precipitate via icp oes after re dissolution in hcl indicated the presence of large amounts of na k li ca2 and b table s2 in s i the mass of the precipitate and the ionic composition strongly suggest that large brine quantities were trapped during the precipitation mg oh 2 has been reported to be a gelatinous precipitate which can inhibit classical industrial filtering and drying yuan et al 2015 and it has been found to serve as an efficient coagulant and flocculation aid huang et al 2012 semerjian and ayoub 2003 it has been reported to precipitate with crystal sizes in the order of the nm and different morphologies globular henrist et al 2003 microspheres xue et al 2009 lamellar chen et al 2008 and plates henrist et al 2003 secondly mg oh 2 has a high surface free energy with a large adsorptive surface area and a positive surface charge point of zero charge is approximately at ph 12 4 semerjian and ayoub 2003 this positive charge attracts negatively charged particles chlorides sulphates and borates thus inducing adsorption and agglomeration huang et al 2012 it is clear that to separately harvest mg oh 2 the crystallization approach will need to be optimized when the precipitate was harvested at ph 13 1 no intermediate precipitate collection the weight of the precipitate was much closer to our prediction 13 0 1 vs 8 7 g for 1 l of treated brine the xrd spectrum of the dry precipitate fig s2 in s i shows the characteristic peaks of both mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 the broad peaks suggest that the hydroxide crystals were very small the xrd spectra also showed the presence of nacl suggesting a poor washing of the solid this is to be expected considering the small size of the crystals icp oes analyses showed that 46 5 1 7 w w of this precipitate was composed of mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 no li was detected in this precipitate see detailed composition in table s3 in s i our data suggest that at ph 13 1 being closer to the point of zero charge than at ph 10 5 a lower amount of ions are adsorbed on the mg oh 2 precipitate our main objective here was to produce a mg2 and ca2 free brine for subsequent lithium recovery at this point our experimental results do not support the possibility to produce the two separate hydroxides in a one step electrolysis further tests need to focus on optimal operating conditions particularly for the crystallization solution ph is one of the most important variables if not the single most important one affecting adsorption characteristics huang et al 2012 one of the strategies currently under evaluation is to increase the forced convection in the catholyte so that the ph is better homogenized both in the side crystallizer and in the vicinity of the electrode approaching the point of zero charge for mg oh 2 while avoiding to reach a ph high enough for ca oh 2 appears key from a practical perspective it appears at the moment best to precipitate at ph 13 1 where the amount of valuable lithium rich brine trapped in the solid is 14 times lower than at ph 10 5 a subsequent option is post harvest treatment of the precipitate with stoichiometric quantities of h2so4 leading to redissolution of mg oh 2 while ca oh 2 will remain in the solid phase as caso4 lide 2003 drying of the liquid phase will produce a pure solid of mgso4 both sulphates have relatively high market values overall after electrolysis until ph 13 1 93 of the original brine volume was recovered 7 61 g of the original water was electrolyzed according to reaction 5 the remaining missing volume could be due to electroosmosis zabolotskii et al 2010 in addition to the small brine volume trapped in the precipitate 3 2 operational parameters current efficiency and energy consumption the electrolysis was stopped 5 min after the ph electrode indicated ph 13 0 at this level it is experimentally complex to precisely determine the ph which may impact the preciseness of the efficiency calculation with these considerations we calculated an efficiency value of η 95 5 it is interesting to note that if a non buffered aqueous solution was used as catholyte faraday s law predicts that at 2 23 a and 1 l of solution ph 9 should be reached in 0 5 s fig 2 a and fig s1 show that for brine i ph 9 is only reached after 100 min this delay indicates a buffering effect the early appearance of a precipitate or floc in addition to the slow but clear decrease in mg2 concentration fig 2 b suggests the partial precipitation of mg oh 2 in addition oh could also be used in the neutralization of h c o 3 absorption of atmospheric co2 and borates could also produce some buffering capacity see table 1 further experiments were performed at varying values of applied constant current for all current values tested the final mg2 and ca2 concentrations were below icp oes detection limit for each experiment depicted in fig 4 esource never showed a variation greater than 10 from the plotted value during the whole electrolysis process therefore for practical purposes the voltage is constant during brine electrolysis for all experiments performed with brine bi the total circulated charge was constant within experimental error and independent of the current density as expected for a given brine composition experiments at varying flow rates performed until ph 13 1 proofed that mg2 and ca2 concentrations always fall below icp oes detection limits at ph 10 5 mg2 concentration always fall below icp oes detection limits however ca2 concentrations did show variations these were attributed to ph gradients close to the electrode surface precipitating ca oh 2 at low flow rates reducing ca2 availability in solution for all other chemical species concentrations were the same within experimental error see table s4 in s i fig 4 shows a linear dependence between esource and the applied current density this linearity and the high voltage values well above the thermodynamic voltage for water splitting of 1 23 v imply that ohmic drops due to electrolytes and membrane resistances are the main reason for the voltage evolution with current the value of the e i slope provides an internal resistance of 1 75 ω for a constant current of 2 23 a and for a brine composition such as bi 224 mj 62 kwh m 3 are needed to completely deplete 1 m3 of brine from both mg2 and ca2 cations these values could considerably decrease by limiting the ohmic drop i e using a less resistive aem decreasing the interdistance between electrodes or applying a lower current density 3 3 reproducibility and repeatability repeatability was determined by measuring brine composition mg2 ca2 na k b and li concentrations after electrolysis in four replicate experiments performed with the same membrane electrolysis cell including same electrodes and membrane a percentage variation coefficient vc of 5 was determined for the different elements reproducibility was studied by running the electrolysis in different membrane electrolysis cell cell membrane and electrodes are different for the reproducibility a vc of 6 was obtained the two curves of ph vs circulated charge are almost superposed see fig s3 in s i repeatability and reproducibility data are shown in tables s5 and s6 in s i the values obtained for reproducibility and repeatability allow us to say that our method is robust for the real brine tested here 3 4 aplication of me for different brines as highlighted earlier the brine composition can vary considerably between salars to assess the impact of this variation we tested three different brines compositions shown in table 1 icp oes analysis indicated that for all three tested brines mg2 was fully removed when a ph of 10 5 was reached while ca2 was fully removed at ph 13 1 fig 5 shows the evolution of ph with the extent of electrolysis for the three brines the three curves show the same 4 well defined regions see section 3 1 with plateaus roughly in the same ph values however the total circulated charge and particularly the duration of the plateau regions clearly depends on the initial concentration of mg2 and ca2 in the different brines according to reactions 5 6 and 7 2 mol of electrons are needed to produce 2 mol of hydroxyl groups to precipitate 1 mol of either mg oh 2 or ca oh 2 according to table 1 it is necessary to circulate 24 507 21 323 and 69 469 c to fully precipitate mg2 ions from 1 l of brines i to iii respectively these values are in very good agreement with the duration of the first plateau in fig 5 3 5 comparison with the current lime technology as mining companies typically do not release precise figures for lime consumption per unit brine volume we simulated the mg2 removal by addition of lime when a lime suspension was added to brine bi 100 ml of a 20 ca oh 2 suspension were needed to reach ph 10 5 complexometric titration indicated that at that point 98 4 of the original mg2 ions had been removed final concentration 48 2 mg l 1 mg2 however the ca2 concentration had considerably increased from an initial value of 685 mg l 1 to a final value of 2725 70 mg l 1 this high ca2 value is in very good agreement with the expected concentration assuming ca2 coming from lime will precipitate as caso4 p k s p c a s o 4 3 64 at 25 c and that ca2 ions beyond the available so4 2 concentration table 1 will remain in solution assuming a cost of 150 us ton for lime mg2 removal would amount for 3 us per m3 for bi brine tested here with proportional price increases according to mg2 content an important point to consider is the likelihood of lithium mining facilities to become geographically concentrated in the lithium triangle in the near future this will introduce logistic issues as concentrated demand most likely will not be satisfied with nearby quarries and freight from more distant regions will affect the final price of lime and the ecological footprint last but not least considerable amounts of waste are generated requiring disposal and while today there are no costs associated with the waste management it is not unlikely that landfilling will imply costs in the near future the cost of the electrolysis will be tightly bound to the local cost of electricity it is interesting to note that the lithium triangle is subjected to a particularly strong solar irradiation piacentini et al 2003 electricity produced from photovoltaics is steadily becoming cheaper including a recent energy supply auctioned at 0 021 us kwh in this region antofagasta chile at this electricity price the energy cost for the electrochemical process would be 1 3 us per m3 for bi brine tested here the electrochemical reactor still requires optimization and together with lower constant current values applied see fig 4 this might bring the energy consumption further down from 62 kwh m 3 brine further reactor optimization will allow us to assess the purity of the additional products produced h2 potentially cl2 mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 although a minor cost compared with energy consumption membrane durability should be considered two different pieces of membrane used for over 200 and 500 h respectively did not reveal any macroscopic damage because of either scaling or high alkalinity most importantly the voltage across the electrodes did not change for a given applied current density membrane damaged would have very likely entailed membrane resistance changes at this proof of concept stage it is quite early to evaluate the overall economic impact of our proposed technology which not only implies the full deprivation of mg2 and ca2 cations saving cost in further purification stages detail calculations should also consider the market values of the additional products the zero waste production and the elimination of the requirement for the constant freighting of chemicals with associated weather related disruptions in operations flexer et al 2018 we must stress that all values are only valid for the brines analysed in this work an increase in mg2 concentration in the original brine would imply proportional increases both in the lime and the electricity costs finally in a prospective up scaling of this technology a careful analysis will be imposed to assess the convenience of producing cl2 at the anode taking into consideration both safety and economic aspects it is also important to highlight that new non evaporitic lithium recovery technologies often require the depletion of divalent cations from the native brine before lithium salts can be recovered flexer et al 2018 garrett 2004 and hence our proposed methodology could also be applied to those disruptive technologies as well proposals have also been put forward for lithium recovery from more diluted sources such as geothermal brines or wastewater from the oil industry choubey et al 2016 garrett 2004 our methodology is also potentially applicable to all of those regardless of the differences in lithium magnesium and calcium concentration in this context depletion of divalent cations without addition of further chemicals followed by lithium recovery should also be seen as a step forward towards the desalination of all these saline and hypersaline water sources 4 conclusions lithium is a minor component in brines and therefore its isolation from all other chemical species present in solution is important both the evaporitic technology and prospective new recovery methodologies can deal with minor quantities of certain ions present in solution at time of the final lithium recovery step most notably na and k since their chemistry is quite different from that of li conversely it is of paramount importance that both mg2 and ca2 cations are fully removed from brines to recover battery grade lithium carbonate the current technology is chemical intensive requiring the addition of lime and produces large amounts of solid waste that are currently landfilled in the fragile ecosystems here we have presented results showing that membrane electrolysis combined with crystallization produces a divalent cation free brine which is ready for further treatment the key findings of this work are both mg2 and ca2 concentrations were below icp oes and complexometric titration detection limits after membrane electrolysis treatment similar performances were observed for three different natural brines mg2 and ca2 precipitate as hydroxides brine ph is controlled by the progress of the electrolysis a careful ph control is useful for a follow up of the amount of cations remaining in the brine mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 precipitated together if the operating conditions are further optimized which is our work in progress the two hydroxides could potentially be precipitated separately together with h2 and cl2 all products add to the competitiveness of the technology compensating the operational costs no valuable li is lost upon brine electrolysis

18969,lithium is today an essential raw material for renewable energy technologies and electric mobility continental brines as present in the lithium triangle are the most abundant and the easiest to exploit lithium sources lithium is present in diluted concentrations together with different ions and it is imperative to fully remove both magnesium and calcium before lithium carbonate can be precipitated here we use membrane electrolysis as a novel method to generate hydroxyl groups in situ in a two chamber electrochemical cell with a side crystallizer omitting the need for chemical addition and not leading to substantial loss of lithium rich brine batch electrolysis experiments fully removed more than 99 99 of both mg2 and ca2 for three different native south american brines treated at current densities ranging from 27 to 350 a m 2 final concentrations were below icp detection limit 0 05 mg l 1 for a brine containing 3090 mg l 1 of mg2 and 685 mg l 1 of ca2 62 kwh m 3 are needed for the full removal of both cations when a current density of 223 a m 2 is employed most importantly the li concentration in the brine is not affected the removed cations are precipitated as mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 our process has the potential to simultaneously recover lithium magnesium and calcium compounds minimizing waste production graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable mining

very close to the threshold of supply risk flexer et al 2018 lithium is typically produced from lithium rich brines or hard rock ore lithium minerals total lithium resources in brines are much more abundant flexer et al 2018 kesler et al 2012 and lithium extraction from brines is the easiest and most cost effective method kesler et al 2012 most lithium resources in continental brines are found

salars in very dry regions flexer et al 2018 each salar has a different chemical composition choubey et al 2016 flexer et al 2018 houston et al 2011 kesler et al 2012 the evaporitic method is the technology currently used for lithium recovery from brines briefly brine is pumped from the underground reservoirs into a series of large open air shallow evaporation ponds when lithium reaches an optimum concentration after solar wind evaporation li2co3 is precipitated by addition of soda ash the biggest problem associated with lithium extraction today is the presence of mg2 cations in the brine an et al 2012 flexer et al 2018 mg2 and li cations show very similar ionic radii and are both highly electropositive inducing similar chemical properties vikström et al 2013 mgco3 co precipitates with li2co3 when the mg2 concentration has not been fully depleted in previous steps vikström et al 2013 currently mg2 is removed by addition of lime cao or ca oh 2 this produces an increase in ph which entails the precipitation of mg oh 2 flexer et al 2018 garrett 2004 seo et al 2014 while this is a simple technology boryta 2000 high mg2 concentrations entail high processing costs and large quantities of lime need to be constantly transported to the often remote locations moreover the addition of lime removes mg2 while concomitantly increasing ca2 concentration a fraction of ca2 simultaneously precipitates with mg oh 2 as caso4 excess ca2 will have to be removed during later steps usually in ionic exchange columns during purification of primary lithium carbonate the mix precipitate mg oh 2 caso4 is difficult to separate and is considered a waste even for brines with very low mg2 concentration kesler et al 2012 vikström et al 2013 at least 2 tons of these residues are produced and discarded at the edge of the salar per ton of purified li2co3 raising environmental concerns finally upon addition of lime mg oh 2 is precipitated as a colloidal suspension entrapping large brine volumes therefore the exploitation of brines with high mg2 content is currently non viable because of the large volumes of lithium rich brine that are lost within the mg oh 2 caso4 precipitate an et al 2012 flexer et al 2018 garrett 2004 a new technology aiming for fast efficient and selective removal of mg2 from lithium rich brines is desirable both from an environmental and an economic perspective tran et al 2016 virolainen et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the eu has listed both magnesium and magnesite as critical raw materials with great economic importance løvik et al 2018 mg oh 2 is widely used in flame retardant composite materials as an acidic waste neutralizer it is added to cattle feed and as a fertilizer and is the departing raw material for the production of metallic magnesium in this context the production of lithium salts from brines is an opportunity for the concomitant production of magnesium salts electro membrane processes have been known for decades and have been applied to diverse separation processes in the chemical industry for example zhao et al liu et al 2014 2015 zhao et al 2013 have proposed an electrochemical reactor where anode and cathode separated by a membrane can selectively capture lithium ions from brines here we propose the use of membrane electrolysis as a clean method for the in situ production of oh anions in lithium rich brines avoiding further complication of the brine to precipitate not only magnesium but also calcium producing minimal waste our method relies on electromigration combined with crystallization in the two compartment electrochemical reactor depicted in fig 1 water is reduced at the cathode producing hydroxyl ions leading to the selective precipitation of mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 in a side crystallizer the anion exchange membrane aem separating the two compartments minimizes proton migration to the cathodic compartment enabling an alkaline ph whereas the bulk of the charge balancing is done by anions present in the brine the approach is potentially easy to adapt to brines of varying chemical compositions notably with important differences in mg2 and or ca2 concentrations most importantly after electrolysis treatment both mg2 and ca2 cations are below icp oes detection limit due to low solubility values at ph 13 s m g o h 2 5 6 10 10 m and s c a o h 2 5 10 4 m at 25 c the production of large amounts of ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 as by products contributes to the economic competitiveness of the technology the methodology is potentially applicable to both the current lime evaporitic technology and to new non evaporitic disruptive technologies that also require mg2 and ca2 free brine for the production of high purity lithium salts 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical cells the electrochemical cells were designed and made in house based on a previously described design desloover et al 2012 two acrylic frames were used as anode and cathode compartments internal dimensions 5 20 2 cm and separated by an aem ami 7001cr membrane international inc usa the frames were bolted together between two rectangular acrylic plates the total volume for each compartment was 200 ml the anode used was a titanium ti mesh electrode coated with an iridium based mixed metal oxide iro2 tio2 65 35 with a centrally attached perpendicular current collector dimensions 4 8 19 8 cm 1 mm thickness magneto special anodes the netherlands the cathode was a stainless steel wire mesh with a stainless steel current collector the distance between electrodes was 3 mm between the surface of the electrodes and the aem two plastic meshes are placed to avoid direct contact between the electrodes and the membrane experiments were run in constant current mode using a dc cc regulated power supply v a instrument china the current densities are reported with respect to the projected surface area of the membrane in contact with the solutions 100 cm2 the cell voltage was monitored directly from the digital screen in the power supply all electrochemical experiments were run at least in triplicate fig 5 depicts representative curves with replicates yielding very similar ph results relative error below 3 in all other figures and numerical results the average of at least three replicates is always reported experiments were run in batch mode at room temperature 22 3 c the anodic compartment was connected to a 2 l recirculating schott bottle while the cathodic compartment was connected to a 1 l side decanter built in house both anolyte and catholyte total volumes were 1 l these volumes were constantly recirculated through the cell compartments using a peristaltic pump unless otherwise specified flow rate 6 l h 1 pc28 apema argentina recirculation also

mgcl2 6h2o biopack p a to natural brine bi to simulate a natural brine of higher mg2 content brine compositions are shown in table 1 2 3 analysis cl and so4 2 concentrations were determined using a dionex as9 hc column in a dionex dx 100 chromatographer for brines bi and biii and by titration for bii cations and boron compositions reported in table 1 s1 s2 s3 in fig 3 and sections 3 3 and 3 4 were determined by icp oes analysis spectra modula flame all other mg2 and ca2 reported concentration values were determined by complexometric titrations with edta anedra p a eriochrome black t anedra p a and murexide anedra p a were used as complexometric indicators to determine the endpoint all analysis were run in triplicate with standard deviations never falling beyond 5 the ph was registered with a ph meter hanna and by universal ph test paper strips xrd diffractograms were measured on a siemens d5000 powder diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 54056 å the spectra were recorded over a 2θ range from 15 to 90 with a step of 0 02 and a count time of 1 s point 2 4 control lime analysis a lime suspension was prepared by mixing 20 g of ca oh 2 hardware store quality los tilianes argentina in de ionized water to a final 100 ml volume a complexometric titration indicated that this reagent was only 70 pure the precipitation reaction was carried out by adding ca oh 2 in suspension to the natural brine with continuous stirring until reaching ph 10 5 the precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 3200 rpm for 10 min and dried at 90 c for 50 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 dependence of ph with electrolysis time the membrane electrolysis cell was operated at constant current density of 223 a m 2 according to the compositions of the different compartments it is expected that at the anode water is oxidized to oxygen reaction 3 potentially intermediate reactive oxygen species and or chloride to chlorine gas reaction 4 concomitantly in the cathodic compartment water is reduced to h2 with the simultaneous production of oh reaction 5 3 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 4 2 c l c l 2 2 e 5 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h the applied current and the need to maintain electroneutrality in both compartments require a net transport of anions from the cathodic to anodic compartments via the aem migration of e g protons in the other direction cannot be fully avoided but our current efficiency calculations show that this is only minor see below because chloride anions are several orders of magnitude more concentrated than oh anions throughout the experiment i e 5 15 m versus 0 1 mm at ph 10 respectively charge balancing across the membrane was predominantly carried by chloride anions in these proof of concept experiments we purposely chose to keep a ph around 10 in the anodic compartment to avoid chlorine gas formation at ph above 7 cl2 disproportionates into cl and clo e c l o c l 2 1 61 v 0 059 p h e c l 2 c l 1 36 and ph constant lide 2003 because of the production of oh the ph increases in the cathodic compartment as the electrolysis advances as observed in fig 2 a from the early stages of the electrolysis a white precipitate consisting of tiny particles resembling a floc started forming it was visually observed that the amount of precipitate augmented as the electrolysis advanced mg2 and ca2 can precipitate as mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 respectively reactions 6 and 7 based on the solubility products p k s p m g o h 2 11 25 and p k s p c a o h 2 5 3 at 25 c lide 2003 mg oh 2 should precipitate before ca oh 2 6 m g 2 a q 2 o h a q m g o h 2 s 7 c a 2 a q 2 o h a q c a o h 2 s the curve of fig 2 a resembles an acid base titration curve where the amount of circulated charge replaces the volume of the titrant added this means that circulated charge will control the ph of the brine as expected from faraday s law and an electrochemical reaction that produces oh as a product reaction 5 for a constant current value this can also be shown in a plot of ph vs elapsed electrolysis time see fig s1 in s i the plot presents four well defined regions ranging approximately from 1 ph 6 80 to 9 20 2 ph 9 20 to 10 3 ph 10 to 12 and 4 above ph 12 firstly as the electrolysis progresses the ph continuously increases with time by production of oh when ph 9 2 is reached the ph remains almost constant with electrolysis time because most of the produced oh are consumed by mg2 to precipitate mg oh 2 and hence the oh concentration in solution remains roughly constant when mg2 in solution is exhausted see fig 2b the ph increases sharply until roughly ph 12 at this point ca2 starts to consume the produced oh to generate ca oh 2 this can thus be used to separate the mg2 from the ca2 precipitation it was not possible to accurately determine the ph beyond 13 0 because of the experimental limitations of the ph electrode fig 2 b shows the variation of mg2 and ca2 concentrations with ph during the electrolysis until ph 9 the mg2 concentration in solution decreased slowly between ph 9 and 10 the mg2 concentration dropped significantly by ph 10 5 mg2 was fully removed from the brine i e below the detection limit of the icp oes 0 05 mg l 1 the ca2 concentration in solution decreased very slowly until ph 12 at which point it began to rapidly precipitate as ca oh 2 by ph 13 1 ca2 was fully removed from the brine these observations are in agreement with our interpretation of fig 2 a above the behaviour described in fig 2 a is indeed expected based on the solubility products lide 2003 mg2 should start to precipitate at ph 8 45 and its concentration should fall below 99 99 of the original content by ph 10 4 while ca2 begins to precipitate at ph 12 and its concentration should fall below 98 2 of the original content by ph 13 1 deviations from these numbers are most likely caused by salting out effect the activities in a brine should be quite different from concentrations these fractional precipitation occurring at different ph constitutes an advantage of our proposed methodology tracking the ph variation could thus be used in practice to assess the mg2 and ca2 concentrations that remain in the brine and create two distinct precipitated products our approach thus avoids lime addition which is effective but complex as a means to control ph in addition if brines are not naturally rich in so4 2 anions addition of lime removes mg2 but increases ca2 concentration requiring further processing most importantly in our proposed methodology there should be no loss of li since lioh is 5 and 11 orders of magnitude more soluble than ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 respectively lide 2003 fig 3 compares the native brine composition grey bars with the composition after electrolysing the brine for 31 400 c at which point the ph was 10 5 red bars and after 40 800 c until ph 13 1 blue bars the concentrations of na k and li after electrolysis show a slight increase probably due to water reduction reaction 5 and electroosmosis water molecules crossing the aem as hydration shell of the migrating anions zabolotskii et al 2010 b shows the same apparent concentration increase at ph 13 1 b concentration decrease at ph 10 5 is attributed to the negatively charged borate ions b4o7 2 being adsorbed on the positively charged mg oh 2 crystals the charge on mg oh 2 is neutralized after ph 12 see below and borate ions are released again to the solution the insert in fig 3 shows that at ph 10 5 mg2 has been fully depleted from the brine while ca2 is no longer detectable if the electrolysis is pursued until ph 13 1 the precise composition values determined by icp oes are shown in table s1 in s i our first target was to harvest the precipitate at ph 10 5 with the aim of separating mg oh 2 from ca oh 2 unfortunately even after vacuum filtration centrifugation and drying the precipitate weighed roughly ten times more than predicted from the total mg2 initially present in the native brine 60 2 vs 7 4 g for 1 l of treated brine analysis of the precipitate via icp oes after re dissolution in hcl indicated the presence of large amounts of na k li ca2 and b table s2 in s i the mass of the precipitate and the ionic composition strongly suggest that large brine quantities were trapped during the precipitation mg oh 2 has been reported to be a gelatinous precipitate which can inhibit classical industrial filtering and drying yuan et al 2015 and it has been found to serve as an efficient coagulant and flocculation aid huang et al 2012 semerjian and ayoub 2003 it has been reported to precipitate with crystal sizes in the order of the nm and different morphologies globular henrist et al 2003 microspheres xue et al 2009 lamellar chen et al 2008 and plates henrist et al 2003 secondly mg oh 2 has a high surface free energy with a large adsorptive surface area and a positive surface charge point of zero charge is approximately at ph 12 4 semerjian and ayoub 2003 this positive charge attracts negatively charged particles chlorides sulphates and borates thus inducing adsorption and agglomeration huang et al 2012 it is clear that to separately harvest mg oh 2 the crystallization approach will need to be optimized when the precipitate was harvested at ph 13 1 no intermediate precipitate collection the weight of the precipitate was much closer to our prediction 13 0 1 vs 8 7 g for 1 l of treated brine the xrd spectrum of the dry precipitate fig s2 in s i shows the characteristic peaks of both mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 the broad peaks suggest that the hydroxide crystals were very small the xrd spectra also showed the presence of nacl suggesting a poor washing of the solid this is to be expected considering the small size of the crystals icp oes analyses showed that 46 5 1 7 w w of this precipitate was composed of mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 no li was detected in this precipitate see detailed composition in table s3 in s i our data suggest that at ph 13 1 being closer to the point of zero charge than at ph 10 5 a lower amount of ions are adsorbed on the mg oh 2 precipitate our main objective here was to produce a mg2 and ca2 free brine for subsequent lithium recovery at this point our experimental results do not support the possibility to produce the two separate hydroxides in a one step electrolysis further tests need to focus on optimal operating conditions particularly for the crystallization solution ph is one of the most important variables if not the single most important one affecting adsorption characteristics huang et al 2012 one of the strategies currently under evaluation is to increase the forced convection in the catholyte so that the ph is better homogenized both in the side crystallizer and in the vicinity of the electrode approaching the point of zero charge for mg oh 2 while avoiding to reach a ph high enough for ca oh 2 appears key from a practical perspective it appears at the moment best to precipitate at ph 13 1 where the amount of valuable lithium rich brine trapped in the solid is 14 times lower than at ph 10 5 a subsequent option is post harvest treatment of the precipitate with stoichiometric quantities of h2so4 leading to redissolution of mg oh 2 while ca oh 2 will remain in the solid phase as caso4 lide 2003 drying of the liquid phase will produce a pure solid of mgso4 both sulphates have relatively high market values overall after electrolysis until ph 13 1 93 of the original brine volume was recovered 7 61 g of the original water was electrolyzed according to reaction 5 the remaining missing volume could be due to electroosmosis zabolotskii et al 2010 in addition to the small brine volume trapped in the precipitate 3 2 operational parameters current efficiency and energy consumption the electrolysis was stopped 5 min after the ph electrode indicated ph 13 0 at this level it is experimentally complex to precisely determine the ph which may impact the preciseness of the efficiency calculation with these considerations we calculated an efficiency value of η 95 5 it is interesting to note that if a non buffered aqueous solution was used as catholyte faraday s law predicts that at 2 23 a and 1 l of solution ph 9 should be reached in 0 5 s fig 2 a and fig s1 show that for brine i ph 9 is only reached after 100 min this delay indicates a buffering effect the early appearance of a precipitate or floc in addition to the slow but clear decrease in mg2 concentration fig 2 b suggests the partial precipitation of mg oh 2 in addition oh could also be used in the neutralization of h c o 3 absorption of atmospheric co2 and borates could also produce some buffering capacity see table 1 further experiments were performed at varying values of applied constant current for all current values tested the final mg2 and ca2 concentrations were below icp oes detection limit for each experiment depicted in fig 4 esource never showed a variation greater than 10 from the plotted value during the whole electrolysis process therefore for practical purposes the voltage is constant during brine electrolysis for all experiments performed with brine bi the total circulated charge was constant within experimental error and independent of the current density as expected for a given brine composition experiments at varying flow rates performed until ph 13 1 proofed that mg2 and ca2 concentrations always fall below icp oes detection limits at ph 10 5 mg2 concentration always fall below icp oes detection limits however ca2 concentrations did show variations these were attributed to ph gradients close to the electrode surface precipitating ca oh 2 at low flow rates reducing ca2 availability in solution for all other chemical species concentrations were the same within experimental error see table s4 in s i fig 4 shows a linear dependence between esource and the applied current density this linearity and the high voltage values well above the thermodynamic voltage for water splitting of 1 23 v imply that ohmic drops due to electrolytes and membrane resistances are the main reason for the voltage evolution with current the value of the e i slope provides an internal resistance of 1 75 ω for a constant current of 2 23 a and for a brine composition such as bi 224 mj 62 kwh m 3 are needed to completely deplete 1 m3 of brine from both mg2 and ca2 cations these values could considerably decrease by limiting the ohmic drop i e using a less resistive aem decreasing the interdistance between electrodes or applying a lower current density 3 3 reproducibility and repeatability repeatability was determined by measuring brine composition mg2 ca2 na k b and li concentrations after electrolysis in four replicate experiments performed with the same membrane electrolysis cell including same electrodes and membrane a percentage variation coefficient vc of 5 was determined for the different elements reproducibility was studied by running the electrolysis in different membrane electrolysis cell cell membrane and electrodes are different for the reproducibility a vc of 6 was obtained the two curves of ph vs circulated charge are almost superposed see fig s3 in s i repeatability and reproducibility data are shown in tables s5 and s6 in s i the values obtained for reproducibility and repeatability allow us to say that our method is robust for the real brine tested here 3 4 aplication of me for different brines as highlighted earlier the brine composition can vary considerably between salars to assess the impact of this variation we tested three different brines compositions shown in table 1 icp oes analysis indicated that for all three tested brines mg2 was fully removed when a ph of 10 5 was reached while ca2 was fully removed at ph 13 1 fig 5 shows the evolution of ph with the extent of electrolysis for the three brines the three curves show the same 4 well defined regions see section 3 1 with plateaus roughly in the same ph values however the total circulated charge and particularly the duration of the plateau regions clearly depends on the initial concentration of mg2 and ca2 in the different brines according to reactions 5 6 and 7 2 mol of electrons are needed to produce 2 mol of hydroxyl groups to precipitate 1 mol of either mg oh 2 or ca oh 2 according to table 1 it is necessary to circulate 24 507 21 323 and 69 469 c to fully precipitate mg2 ions from 1 l of brines i to iii respectively these values are in very good agreement with the duration of the first plateau in fig 5 3 5 comparison with the current lime technology as mining companies typically do not release precise figures for lime consumption per unit brine volume we simulated the mg2 removal by addition of lime when a lime suspension was added to brine bi 100 ml of a 20 ca oh 2 suspension were needed to reach ph 10 5 complexometric titration indicated that at that point 98 4 of the original mg2 ions had been removed final concentration 48 2 mg l 1 mg2 however the ca2 concentration had considerably increased from an initial value of 685 mg l 1 to a final value of 2725 70 mg l 1 this high ca2 value is in very good agreement with the expected concentration assuming ca2 coming from lime will precipitate as caso4 p k s p c a s o 4 3 64 at 25 c and that ca2 ions beyond the available so4 2 concentration table 1 will remain in solution assuming a cost of 150 us ton for lime mg2 removal would amount for 3 us per m3 for bi brine tested here with proportional price increases according to mg2 content an important point to consider is the likelihood of lithium mining facilities to become geographically concentrated in the lithium triangle in the near future this will introduce logistic issues as concentrated demand most likely will not be satisfied with nearby quarries and freight from more distant regions will affect the final price of lime and the ecological footprint last but not least considerable amounts of waste are generated requiring disposal and while today there are no costs associated with the waste management it is not unlikely that landfilling will imply costs in the near future the cost of the electrolysis will be tightly bound to the local cost of electricity it is interesting to note that the lithium triangle is subjected to a particularly strong solar irradiation piacentini et al 2003 electricity produced from photovoltaics is steadily becoming cheaper including a recent energy supply auctioned at 0 021 us kwh in this region antofagasta chile at this electricity price the energy cost for the electrochemical process would be 1 3 us per m3 for bi brine tested here the electrochemical reactor still requires optimization and together with lower constant current values applied see fig 4 this might bring the energy consumption further down from 62 kwh m 3 brine further reactor optimization will allow us to assess the purity of the additional products produced h2 potentially cl2 mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 although a minor cost compared with energy consumption membrane durability should be considered two different pieces of membrane used for over 200 and 500 h respectively did not reveal any macroscopic damage because of either scaling or high alkalinity most importantly the voltage across the electrodes did not change for a given applied current density membrane damaged would have very likely entailed membrane resistance changes at this proof of concept stage it is quite early to evaluate the overall economic impact of our proposed technology which not only implies the full deprivation of mg2 and ca2 cations saving cost in further purification stages detail calculations should also consider the market values of the additional products the zero waste production and the elimination of the requirement for the constant freighting of chemicals with associated weather related disruptions in operations flexer et al 2018 we must stress that all values are only valid for the brines analysed in this work an increase in mg2 concentration in the original brine would imply proportional increases both in the lime and the electricity costs finally in a prospective up scaling of this technology a careful analysis will be imposed to assess the convenience of producing cl2 at the anode taking into consideration both safety and economic aspects it is also important to highlight that new non evaporitic lithium recovery technologies often require the depletion of divalent cations from the native brine before lithium salts can be recovered flexer et al 2018 garrett 2004 and hence our proposed methodology could also be applied to those disruptive technologies as well proposals have also been put forward for lithium recovery from more diluted sources such as geothermal brines or wastewater from the oil industry choubey et al 2016 garrett 2004 our methodology is also potentially applicable to all of those regardless of the differences in lithium magnesium and calcium concentration in this context depletion of divalent cations without addition of further chemicals followed by lithium recovery should also be seen as a step forward towards the desalination of all these saline and hypersaline water sources 4 conclusions lithium is a minor component in brines and therefore its isolation from all other chemical species present in solution is important both the evaporitic technology and prospective new recovery methodologies can deal with minor quantities of certain ions present in solution at time of the final lithium recovery step most notably na and k since their chemistry is quite different from that of li conversely it is of paramount importance that both mg2 and ca2 cations are fully removed from brines to recover battery grade lithium carbonate the current technology is chemical intensive requiring the addition of lime and produces large amounts of solid waste that are currently landfilled in the fragile ecosystems here we have presented results showing that membrane electrolysis combined with crystallization produces a divalent cation free brine which is ready for further treatment the key findings of this work are both mg2 and ca2 concentrations were below icp oes and complexometric titration detection limits after membrane electrolysis treatment similar performances were observed for three different natural brines mg2 and ca2 precipitate as hydroxides brine ph is controlled by the progress of the electrolysis a careful ph control is useful for a follow up of the amount of cations remaining in the brine mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 precipitated together if the operating conditions are further optimized which is our work in progress the two hydroxides could potentially be precipitated separately together with h2 and cl2 all products add to the competitiveness of the technology compensating the operational costs no valuable li is lost upon brine electrolysis
