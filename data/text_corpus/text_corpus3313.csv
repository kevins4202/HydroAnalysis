16565,a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bioelectrochemical system bes was designed and developed to achieve the self degradation of 2 chlorophenol 2 cp with the cooperation of cathode and anode the electrons supplied for the cathode 2 cp dechlorination come from its own dechlorinated product in the anode phenol separate degradation experiments of cathode 2 cp and anode phenol were firstly conducted the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound 3 66 1 56 and the phenolic compound degradation ability of bes were investigated with the formation of the bioanode able to degrade phenol the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was further developed where 2 cp could achieve sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation when applied voltage was 0 6 v and cathode influent ph was 7 1 56 mm 2 cp reached 80 15 cathode dechlorination efficiency and 58 91 total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation efficiency the bioanodes played a decisive role in bes different operating conditions would affect the overall performance of bes by changing the electrochemical activity and microbial community structure of the bioanodes this study demonstrated the feasibility of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to degrade 2 cp wastewater and provided perspectives for the cooperation of cathode and anode aiming to explore more potential of bes in wastewater treatment field graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 2 chlorophenol 2 cp wastewater cascade operating mode self degradation dechlorinaton ring cleavage bioelectrochemical system bes 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds cocs are refractory organic compounds that are commonly used in many fields and widely exist in our environment li et al 2021 liang et al 2013 scheutz et al 2011 because cocs are toxic harmful and difficult to degrade most of them have been listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency igbinosa et al 2013 among cocs chlorophenols cps constitute an important category due to their strong odor emission high toxicity and persistence in the environment miran et al 2017 therefore the treatment of cps wastewater has become a major environmental concern and more and more current researches focused on achieving the efficient degradation of cps since the existence of chlorine group increases the toxicity and persistence of cps dechlorination is the most critical step in cps degradation process kong et al 2014b several technologies achieved the dechlorination of cps but limitations still exist as for anaerobic biotechnology because of the high toxicity of cps and the deficiency of sustainable electron donors e g h2 and short chain organics the anaerobic dechlorination rate was low lin et al 2019 electrochemical technology could provide sufficient electron donors for the dechlorination reaction but the energy consumption and cost were relatively high wen et al 2013 bioelectrochemical system bes has great potential in wastewater treatment field for supplying electrons lin et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 previous researches have shown that several types of cps e g 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 4 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp and pentachlorophenol pcp could be efficiently and selectively reduced into phenol in bes cathode lin et al 2019 strycharz et al 2010 wang et al 2012b wen et al 2013 the mechanism of bes cathode dechlorination is that the carbon source in the anode chamber was firstly converted into electrons by the electroactive bacteria in the bioanode then the electrons would flow to the cathode through the external circuit and be served as electron donors to complete the dechlorination of cps in the cathode chamber compared with conventional anaerobic biotechnology bes has lower carbon consumption and higher dechlorination rate jiang et al 2016 kong et al 2014a compared with conventional electrochemical technology bes has lower energy consumption cui et al 2016 however as an electron donor system bes cathode could not efficiently achieve the further degradation of the dechlorinated product phenol resulting in the incomplete degradation of cps many strategies have been proposed to solve this problem for instance bes cathode was combined with denitrification bioreactor to achieve the further ring cleavage of 2 cp arellano gonzalez et al 2016 micro aeration was also applied in bes cathode coupled with facultative anaerobic degradative bacteria to promote the complete degradation of 2 4 6 tcp khan et al 2019 however the combined application of reactors made the whole system complicated and the proper micro aeration condition was difficult to control in bes cathode therefore the objective of this study is to achieve both dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation of 2 cp in bes since previous studies have shown that phenol the dechlorinated product of 2 cp could be used as carbon source in the bioanode to perform transformation and degradation friman et al 2013 hassan et al 2018 hedbavna et al 2016 kong et al 2014b the combination of cathode and anode activities seems like a promising way to degrade 2 cp accordingly a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was developed and investigated to achieve the self degradation of 2 cp which means that the electrons responsible for the cathode 2 cp dechlorination come from its own dechlorinated product in the anode phenol this operating mode can not only achieve the further degradation of the intermediate phenol but also convert the waste phenol into useful carbon source in the bioanode thus reducing the exogenous carbon consumption of the 2 cp degradation process in this study the ability of the double chamber bes to separately degrade cathode 2 cp and anode phenol was firstly investigated to gain operating experience the optimal concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound and the optimum concentration of phenolic compounds were measured based on the separate degradation experiments the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was further developed and applied to sequentially degrade 2 cp wastewater the critical operating parameters including applied voltage and cathode influent ph were optimized to improve the 2 cp degradation efficiency in this novel operating mode this study also analyzed the electrochemical activity and microbial community structure of the bioanodes and clarified the decisive role of the bioanodes on the electrochemical and degradation performance of bes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes setup the double chamber bes was constructed using polymethyl methacrylate and each chamber had a working volume of 75 cm3 5 cm length 3 cm width 5 cm height the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a proton exchange membrane n117 dupont usa graphite felts 3 cm length 3 cm height 3 mm thickness were used as anode and cathode and the cathode was coated with pt catalyst 1 mg pt cm 2 the graphite felts were pretreated by heating at 450 c for 30 mins before use wang et al 2009 saturated ag agcl reference electrode was installed in the anode chamber for the detection of anode potential the whole bes was carefully sealed to maintain an anaerobic environment and prevent leakage 2 2 bes acclimation and start up stage the bes was started up with a bioanode and an abiotic cathode the anolyte consisted of 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl 0 13 g l 1 kcl 50 mmol l 1 mm pbs 5 ml l 1 vitamins 12 5 ml l 1 trace elements and 1 g l 1 acetate the anodic biofilm was acclimated with anaerobic sludge from a wastewater treatment plant in tianjin china the catholyte was composed of 50 mm sterilized phosphate buffer saline pbs to keep anaerobic conditions both anolyte and catholyte were sparged with n2 for 15 min before every feeding the applied voltage of bes in the start up period was 0 6 v supplied with a dc power supply atten technology co ltd shenzhen china both anolyte and catholyte were discharged and refilled with a fresh one when the system current was as low as 0 1 ma each time the solution was renewed was recorded as one cycle when the maximum system current remained similar for three consecutive cycles the bes start up stage was considered completed 2 3 operating conditions in bes degradation stage after the bes start up stage 2 cp and phenol were introduced in the reactors to start the bes degradation stage composed of two main progressive phases phase i is the separate degradation phase i e cathode 2 cp dechlorination and anode phenol ring cleavage fig 1 a 2 cp and phenol were separately added into the cathode and anode chamber the separate degradation experiments were composed of two parts to respectively investigate the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound and the pollutants degradation ability of the bes table 1 in phase i the bioanodes able to degrade phenol were acclimated and formed in preparation for the following phase to introduce cathode effluent into the anode chamber the operating experience and results accumulated in phase i were also utilized to help develop the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes in phase ii phase ii is the sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage phase i e 2 cp degradation in the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes fig 1b 2 cp wastewater served as the cathode influent and the dechlorinated cathode effluent served as the anode influent in phase ii 2 cp achieved sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation the critical operating parameters applied voltage and cathode influent ph of this innovative operating mode were investigated and optimized to improve the degradation efficiency of 2 cp table 2 triplicate reactors were performed in parallel for all experiments and all reactors were operated at room temperature 2 4 analysis and calculation the electrode potentials and system current were important

respectively in all degradation experiments the cycle of solution renewal was 36 h and samples were taken from both the anode and cathode chambers every 6 h to detect the concentration of 2 cp phenol and chloride cl samples taken from the anode chamber were filtered by 0 22 μm pore diameter membrane filters to remove bacteria the concentration of 2 cp and phenol were detected by a high performance

chromatography ics 1100 thermo scientific usa cyclic voltammetry cv of the abiotic anode and bioanodes at the end of each phase start up phase separate degradation phase sequential degradation phase were measured using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua shanghai china with a three electrode system anode as working electrode cathode as counter electrode and saturated ag agcl as reference electrode the scan range was from 0 6 v to 1 0 v and the scan rate was 10 mv s 1 the anolyte applied for the scan of each bioanode was the same as the anolyte used for the bioanode in each operating phase the anolyte applied for the abiotic anode was the same as the anolyte used in the sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation phase containing acetate phenol and 2 cp each time changing the bioanode or the electrolyte the scan was firstly run for approximately 30 mins and then when the system was stable the scanning data would be recorded 2 5 microbial community analysis bacterial samples from the initial unacclimated anaerobic sludge and the bioanodes in different operating stages bes start up and degradation stage and different operating parameters different applied voltage and influent ph were analyzed to investigate the variations in their microbial community structures the method for taking the anodic biofilm was as follows using sterilized tweezers to place the bioanode in a beaker containing sterilized ultrapure water the beaker was then sonicated for 15 mins to transfer the anodic biofilm into the ultrapure water then the water containing biofilm was centrifuged to obtain the biofilm sample dna of these bacterial samples was extracted using a water dna isolation kit according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna purity and concentration were determined using nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa the primer set of 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used for the amplification of the v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was performed on the illumina mesiq platform at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd reads with a similarity of more than 97 were clustered into one operational taxonomic unit otu 3 results and discussion 3 1 bes acclimation and start up acetate was used as the substrate to acclimate bes during the acclimation period the system current continuously increased and the electrode potential gradually stabilized fig s1 in 250 h the maximum output current reached around 2 93 ma and remained same in three consecutive cycles showing the success of bes start up the anodic biofilm was finally formed successfully fig s2 the anode and cathode potentials were also sustained at that time at about 450 mv and 1050 mv respectively 3 2 separate degradation of cathode 2 cp and anode phenol after the successful start up of bes the anode substrate was changed from single acetate to co substrates acetate and phenol investigating the ability of the bioanode to degrade phenol at the same time 2 cp was introduced into the cathode chamber evaluating the feasibility of the two chamber bes to achieve separate degradation of anode phenol and cathode 2 cp simultaneously 3 2 1 optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound after a period about 7 cycles of adaptation for phenolic compounds introduction the bess gradually developed the ability to degrade phenolic compounds and could finally operate stably then the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound was investigated the concentration of anode phenol and cathode 2 cp was kept as 1 56 mm and the molar concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound was changed 2 44 1 56 3 66 1 56 4 88 1 56 and 6 10 1 56 part i in table 1 the system current and the electrode potentials were recorded with the increment of the anode acetate concentration functional bacteria had more readily degradable substrate the system current thus increased the maximum current was 1 42 2 10 2 26 and 2 51 ma under the concentration ratio of 2 44 1 56 3 66 1 56 4 88 1 56 and 6 10 1 56 respectively showing an improvement in the electrochemical performance fig 2 a their electrode potentials were relatively stable and similar the anode potentials were sustained between 50 to 300 mv and the cathode potentials were maintained between 650 to 900 mv fig 2b all bess under different concentration ratio could operate successfully and stably as for the cathode 2 cp dechlorination part the molar amount of 2 cp decrement was the same as the molar amount of phenol and cl increment in the cathode chamber showing that 2 cp could be selectively converted into phenol and cl with no other by products fig s3 similar to previous researches the selectivity was one big advantage of the cathode dechlorination fernando leon fernandez et al 2021 strycharz et al 2010 wen et al 2013 with the increment of the concentration ratio of acetate to phenolic compound the cathode 2 cp dechlorination efficiency and rate increased from 64 74 and 0 0281 mm h 1 in 2 44 1 56 ratio to 92 95 and 0 0403 mm h 1 in 6 10 1 56 ratio fig 2c due to the increment of the system current the cathode 2 cp could receive more electrons to complete the reduction process and thus the dechlorination performance was improved lin et al 2019 as for the anode phenol degradation part with the increment of the concentration ratio of acetate to phenolic compound the phenol degradation efficiency and rate increased first and then decreased fig 2d when the concentration ratio was 3 66 1 56 bes had the best phenol degradation performance with an efficiency of 67 05 and a rate of 0 0291 mm h 1 either too low or too high levels of acetate concentration in the anode had a negative impact on the phenol degradation performance when the anode acetate concentration was too low the activity of the bioanode decreased due to the lack of easily degradable substrate thus the anode phenol degradation efficiency and rate decreased when the anode acetate concentration was too high the bioanode preferably utilized the sufficient acetate instead of the hardly degradable substrate phenol also resulting in the decrement of the anode phenol degradation the molar concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound affected both the electrochemical and degradation performance of the bes fig 2 according to the results the optimum molar concentration ratio was 3 66 1 56 which could achieve better degradation performance for both the anode phenol and the cathode 2 cp 3 2 2 phenolic compounds degradation ability of bes to investigate the phenolic compounds degradation ability of bes the molar concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound was maintained as 3 66 1 56 while the concentration of the phenolic compounds 2 cp and phenol was gradually increased 1 56 2 34 and 3 12 mm part ii in table 1 when the concentration of phenolic compounds increased from 1 56 to 2 34 mm the maximum current decreased from 2 10 ma to 1 84 ma while the system could still maintain the electrochemical activity fig 3 a and b however when the pollutant concentration reached up to 3 12 mm due to the high toxicity of the phenolic compounds the bes finally crashed the system current dropped to less than 0 1 ma and the anode potential increased to near 600 mv fig 3a and b the anodic biofilm finally lost its electrochemical activity the cathode 2 cp dechlorination performance was shown in fig 3c and fig s4 when the 2 cp concentration was 1 56 and 2 34 mm the dechlorination rates were 0 0348 and 0 0300 mm h 1 respectively the dechlorination rates were directly related with the system current values higher current had higher dechlorination rate although the difference of their dechlorination rate was small their dechlorination efficiency had a bigger difference 80 20 under 1 56 mm pollutant and 46 15 under 2 34 mm pollutant because their initial 2 cp concentration was different fig 3c when the 2 cp concentration was 3 12 mm the biological activity of the anodic biofilm was damaged without the assistance of functional bacteria the cathode dechlorination efficiency and rate 2 30 and 0 0020 mm h 1 were extremely low the anode phenol degradation performance was also negatively affected by the increment of the phenol concentration fig 3d the phenol degradation rates under the phenol concentration of 1 56 mm and 2 34 mm were close which were 0 0291 and 0 0275 mm h 1 respectively this is because the anode acetate concentration was synchronously raised with the phenol concentration and the easily degradable substrate stimulated the growth of the functional anodic biofilm inducing the functional enzymes and mitigating the toxicity of the higher concentration phenol hedbavna et al 2016 luo et al 2009 yang et al 2021 due to the difference of the initial phenol concentration the anode phenol degradation efficiency was 67 05 under 1 56 mm and was 42 31 under 2 34 mm when the phenol concentration reached 3 12 mm the anode phenol degradation efficiency and rate decreased to 7 86 and 0 0068 mm h 1 excessive concentration of phenol induced extreme levels of toxicity thus greatly reducing the activity of the functional bacteria as shown in the results bes could not withstand phenolic compound concentration as high as 3 12 mm the system lost its ability to efficiently degrade phenol and 2 cp in such a high concentration while under the phenolic compound concentration of 1 56 and 2 34 mm both bess could achieve phenol and 2 cp degradation and their electrochemical performance and pollutant degradation rates were close however since the degradation efficiencies of phenol and 2 cp were higher under the concentration of 1 56 mm this pollutant concentration would be used in the following experiments 3 3 sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage of 2 cp the above separate degradation experiments showed that 2 cp and phenol could achieve simultaneous degradation in the cathode and anode in a double chamber bes therefore a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was further developed where 2 cp could achieve sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation since acetate was required in the anode to maintain the activity of functional bacteria and the operation of bes the cathode dechlorinated effluent was added with acetate before being transferred to the anode chamber this addition process is analogous to the carbon source addition process in the common denitrification process in wastewater treatment hagman et al 2008 besides acetate nutrient medium nh4cl kcl vitamins and trace elements necessary for bacterial growth were also added in the anolyte to help maintain the bacterial activity of the bioanode 3 3 1 critical parameter applied voltage applied voltage is a critical parameter that affects the electrochemical and pollutant degradation performances in bes daghio et al 2018 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2011 zou et al 2020 in this study different voltages 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 v were applied in the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to investigate their effect and optimize the applied voltage parameter part i in table 2 as for the electrochemical part the increment of the applied voltage could increase the system current but the increase in current had an upper limit the increase in system current was about 0 63 ma when enhancing applied voltage from 0 4 to 0 6 v while further enhancing applied voltage from 0 6 to 0 8 v had little improvement on the system current fig 4 a this is mainly due to the fact that the electron transfer efficiency between bacteria and electrodes is limited in conventional bioanodes jiang et al 2014 yong et al 2012 yu et al 2020 hindering the continuous increase in system current moreover since the bioanode potential was relatively stable in bes between 50 to 300 mv the cathode potential changed along with the variation of the applied voltage fig 4b previous research showed that 2 cp dechlorination could occur at a potential of 400 mv arellano gonzalez et al 2015 as can be seen in fig 4b the cathode potentials of all bess were lower than 400 mv all meeting the potential requirement of 2 cp dechlorination the following dechlorination results obtained in this experiment also confirmed that 2 cp dechlorination could occur under all the applied voltages of 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 v as for the phenolic compounds degradation part the results proved the feasibility of the research idea that 2 cp could achieve sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation in a sequential cathode anode cascade operating mode bes fig 4c phenol the dechlorinated product of cathode 2 cp achieved further ring cleavage in the bioanode the concentration of 2 cp in the anode chamber was also slightly reduced showing that 2 cp could also achieve slight degradation in the bioanode while the degradation rate was very slow fig 4c the cv analysis of the bioanode section 3 4 1 showed that the bioanode finally developed the ability to directly oxidize phenol without developing the ability to directly oxidize 2 cp and the microbial community analysis section 3 4 2 showed the existence of dechlorinative bacteria in the bioanode these analysis results showed that the bioanode was not able to directly oxidize 2 cp due to its high toxicity in the bioanode 2 cp had to first conduct dechlorination through the dechlorinative bacteria and then achieve further degradation however dechlorination process was difficult to happen in the anode due to the lack of electron donors this explained why the bioanode had good phenol degradation performance but poor 2 cp degradation performance also highlighting the importance of the pretreatment of 2 cp in the cathode for toxicity reduction in bes pollutant degradation performance was mainly impacted by the electrochemical performance with the increment of the applied voltage the system current increased supplying more electrons for 2 cp dechlorination in the cathode leading to a higher 2 cp dechlorination efficiency and rate table 3 the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation efficiency and rate also increased table 3 higher dechlorination performance of 2 cp decreased the toxicity of the cathode effluent reduced the toxicity suffered by the bioanode allowing the bioanode to have higher activity and to generate current and degrade phenolic compounds more efficiently applied voltage increasing from 0 4 to 0 6 v the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation performance in the system clearly improved efficiency and rate increased from 45 58 and 0 0197 mm h 1 to 58 91 and 0 0256 mm h 1 while increasing from 0 6 to 0 8 v the improvement of the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation performance was not so significant efficiency and rate only incresed to 60 26 and 0 0261 mm h 1 table 3 since the anode potentials were relatively stable and the cathode potentials all met the potential required for 2 cp reduction system current became the most key factor determining the phenolic compounds degradation performance in this study therefore the difference in bes degradation performance was in accordance with that in the system current value the results indicated that 0 4 v applied voltage was too low to meet the voltage requirement of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes while 0 6 and 0 8 v were appropriate applied voltages to achieve optimum phenolic compounds degradation the close electrochemical and degradation performance of 0 6 and 0 8 v showed that the optimization ability of the applied voltage had an upper limit the system overall performance would not keep increasing along with the increment of the applied voltage moreover several previous researches showed that higher applied voltage may cause a negative effect on bes performance daghio et al 2018 feng et al 2016 even making the bioanode potential rise and provoking the instability of the system mu et al 2009 therefore the control of the applied voltage is significant to make the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes have a good performance since the electrochemical and pollutant degradation performances of bes under the applied voltage of 0 6 and 0 8 v were similar to reduce the power consumption 0 6 v was selected as the applied voltage in the following experiments 3 3 2 critical parameter cathode influent ph cathode influent ph is another critical parameter in bes a previous research showed that lower cathode ph ph 3 could improve both the cathode dechlorination efficiency and the electricity generation in bes by supplying abundant protons and overcoming the proton limitation wen et al 2013 however in the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes in this study the cathode influent ph would affect the anode influent ph and would further influence the activity of the bioanode and the overall performance of bes therefore the electrochemical and 2 cp degradation performances under different cathode influent ph ph 7 5 3 were analyzed to investigate whether lower cathode influent ph could have a positive influence in this study part ii in table 2 the cathode effluent ph i e the anode influent was also measured the cathode effluent ph was raised when the influent ph was 7 raised from 7 0 to 7 3 while the ph did not have considerable changes when the influent ph was 3 or 5 indicating that the proton limitation might be overcome at lower ph levels wen et al 2013 however as can be seen in fig 5 a and b the system electrochemical performance was decreased under lower cathode influent ph because electroactive bacteria had a low tolerance for acidic environments du et al 2017 sleutels et al 2010 when cathode influent ph decreased to 3 the system even crashed and lost its electrochemical activity results indicated that although lower cathode influent ph could overcome the proton limitation in the cathode the function and activity of the bioanode were the key factors to determine the bes electrochemical performance since the appropriate ph condition of the anodic functional bacteria is in neutral environment lower ph would reduce the anodic bacterial activity and decrease the bes electrochemical activity with the decrement of the cathode influent ph the cathode 2 cp dechlorination performance worsened due to the reduction of the current system the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation efficiency and rate were also decreased from 58 91 and 0 0256 mm h 1 to 8 38 and 0 0036 mm h 1 fig 5c table 4 as a result of two main reasons 1 lower ph environment decreased the activity of the functional bacteria in the bioanode 2 the decrement of the cathode 2 cp dechlorination efficiency resulted in higher toxicity of the cathode effluent i e anode influent further decreasing the activity of the functional bacteria in the bioanode overall the sequential 2 cp dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation process in sequential cathode anode cascade bes is an electro driven and bio catalytic process in the cathode 2 cp performed reduction process where the ccl bond was attacked by electrons from the cathode electron donor system resulting in the reduction of the chlorine group in benzene ring to cl in the catholyte in the anode phenol conducted oxidation process where phenol released electrons and was oxidized into co2 under the action of the bioanode electron acceptor system in the bioanode degradation process phenol would firstly achieve carboxylation and be converted into 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba then 4 hba would perform ring cleavage to generate small module acids e g acetate finally the small module acids would be further oxidized into co2 to achieve mineralization hedbavna et al 2016 yang et al 2020 during the whole process bioanodes played a decisive role to determine both the performances of electricity generation and phenolic compounds degradation in bes therefore the characteristics of the bioanodes in different condition were further analyzed 3 4 characteristic analysis of the bioanode 3 4 1 cv analysis the bioanodes at the end of the bes start up the separate degradation phase phase i and the sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage phase phase ii were analyzed via cv to investigate their electrochemical characteristics the abiotic anode was also analyzed via cv as the control group compared with abiotic anode clear oxidation peaks appeared in all the bioanodes proving the development of electrochemical activity of these bioanodes fig 6 in cv process besides organic substrates the typical redox proteins in geobacter c type cytochromes may also be oxidized and produce oxidation peaks however since previous researches showed that c type cytochromes would be fully oxidized by approximately 0 2 v vs ag agcl and the currents generated by them were approximately between 10 and 30 µa cm 2 lebedev et al 2014 liu et al 2011 peng and zhang 2017 the oxidation peaks appeared after 0 2 v and had more than 110 µa cm 2 current shown in fig 6 were not likely to come from the cytochromes the oxidation peaks should come from the oxidation of the organic substrates acetate phenol or 2 cp one oxidation peak at approximately 0 109 v vs ag agcl was shown in the cv of the bes start up phase fig 6b since acetate was the only carbon source that existed and performed oxidation during bes start up this oxidation peak was contributed by the acetate oxidation in the cv of the separate degradation phase phase i with anolyte containing acetate and phenol two oxidation peaks were shown fig 6c due to the fact that phenol had higher oxidation potential than acetate the oxidation peaks at 0 037 v vs ag agcl and 0 609 v vs ag agcl should represent the oxidation of acetate and phenol respectively the oxidation peak of acetate was slightly shifted from 0 109 to 0 037 v which may be due to the different anolyte composition and operating condition the oxidation peak of phenol was similar with a previous research which also showed an oxidation peak of phenol at nearly 0 600 v vs ag agcl in bioanode chen et al 2017 with the addition of phenol and decrease of acetate concentration in the anolyte the current generated by the bioanode was lower fig 6c indicating that with the increment of the anolyte toxicity the electroactivity of the bioanode reduced in accordance with the above electrochemical results the cv of the sequential degradation phase phase ii with anolyte containing acetate phenol and 2 cp was similar with the cv of the separate degradation phase phase i which showed two oxidation peaks of acetate and phenol without showing a new oxidation peak of 2 cp fig 6d the results indicated that the bioanode did not develop an obvious ability to oxidize the much more toxic 2 cp the whole cv analysis was consistent with the phenolic compounds degradation results of the bioanodes further revealing the electrochemical degradation activity of the bioanodes in different operating condition 3 4 2 microbial community analysis microbial community structure was analyzed at the genus level to discuss the functional and decisive role of the bioanode fig 7 bacterial samples from the initial unacclimated anaerobic sludge s1 the bioanode at the end of the start up stage s2 and the bioanode at the end of the 2 cp degradation stage s3 were analyzed to investigate the microbial community change in different operating stages fig 7a compared with s1 after a period of acclimation and start up several functional genera were enriched in s2 mainly composed of geobacter 28 78 advenella 18 08 acinetobacter 14 28 and sphaerochaeta 8 85 geobacter genus was a well known electroactive bacterium that could transfer electrons to the anode to generate electrical current guo et al 2013 acinetobacter genus was a typical biofilm forming bacterium that took charge of the formation of anodic biofilm gao et al 2014 sphaerochaeta and advenella were previously reported as fermentative and degradative bacteria ying et al 2017 both could participate in the degradation of the organic substrates the enrichment of these functional bacteria was achieved during the bes start up with the introduction of phenolic compounds 2 cp and phenol the microbial community structure experienced some changes s3 in fig 7a the abundance of acinetobacter decreased to 2 83 indicating that the function of biofilm forming species reduced after the formation of biofilm the abundances of dechlorosoma 16 92 and dysgonomonas 5 42 increased in s3 dechlorosoma was reported to be able to achieve dechlorination of several chlorinated compounds mezgebe et al 2017 sturchio et al 2003 and may also participate in the dechlorination of 2 cp in this study however the results of the section 3 3 showed a poor dechlorination performance of 2 cp in the bioanode indicating that dechlorosoma species in the bioanode may be utilized more to improve the 2 cp resistance of the bioanode than to dechlorinate 2 cp moreover dysgonomonas species were previously reported as phenol degradative bacteria huang et al 2016 which could be involved in the phenol degradation process in the bioanode the abundance of geobacter 27 92 and sphaerochaeta 9 81 in s3 was similar to s2 several geobacter species were found to be able to utilize phenol as carbon source jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 therefore the geobacter species in s3 could be responsible for both phenol degradation and electricity generation fermentative genus sphaerochaeta could also assist in the degradation of the organic intermediate metabolites cloacibacillus 6 41 was also enriched in s3 which was reported to be able to degrade organics and generate electricity zhang et al 2021 zhao and zhang 2021 the variation in microbial community structures led to different bacterial activity and function of the bioanodes from s1 to s2 the electrical stimulation and acetate addition facilitated the enrichment of electroactive bacteria geobacter as well as acetate degradative and fermentative bacteria sphaerochaeta and advenella making the bioanode electroactive and achieving the start up of bes from s2 to s3 the phenolic compounds introduction further changed the microbial community structure promoting the enrichment of phenol degradative bacteria dysgonomonas and cloacibacillus thus providing the electroactive bioanode with the ability to degrade phenolic compounds at the end of the degradation stage bacterial samples from the bioanodes under different operating parameters s3 applied voltage 0 6 v cathode influent ph 7 s3 04v applied voltage 0 4 v cathode influent ph 7 s3 ph3 applied voltage 0 6 v cathode influent ph 3 were taken to analyze the effect of critical parameters fig 7b compared with optimal condition s3 the abundance of the functional bacteria decreased in s3 04 v under a low applied voltage of 0 4 v geobacter 7 71 dechlorosoma 8 16 dysgonomonas 0 11 sphaerochaeta 2 33 and cloacibacillus 0 02 leading to the lower electrochemical and degradation performance of bes several other degradative and fermentative genera were enriched in s3 04 v including unclassified f comamonadaceae 5 39 lentimicrobium 8 37 and stenotrophomonas 5 14 which may assist in phenolic compound degradation under low applied voltage when the cathode influent ph was 3 the microbial community of the bioanode changed considerably s3 ph3 the abundance of the functional genera decreased geobacter 0 09 dechlorosoma 0 74 dysgonomonas 0 82 sphaerochaeta 0 29 and cloacibacillus 0 19 leading to a significant performance reduction of the bes under such condition several phenol resistant and acid resistant genera enriched including comamonas 26 90 and unclassified f clostridiaceae 12 34 results showed that different operating parameters would affect the bes performance via the change of the microbial community structure of the bioanode both lower applied voltage and influent ph would lead to the decrease of the abundance of the functional genera geobacter dechlorosoma dysgonomonas sphaerochaeta and cloacibacillus resulting in both lower performances of electricity generation and phenolic compounds degradation in bes compared with the optimal parameters the cv and microbial community analyses further manifested and confirmed the decisive role of the bioanode on the overall performance of bes functional bacteria and anode cooperated to complete phenolic compounds oxidation and electricity generation degradative and fermentative bacteria dysgonomonas cloacibacillus and sphaerochaeta were responsible for converting phenolic compounds into small module organic intermediates then electroactive bacteria geobacter played a role in further converting the small module organic intermediates into co2 as well as achieving the electron transfer from the organic substrates to the anode yang et al 2020 through the external circuit and applied voltage electrons flowed from the anode to the cathode and reacted with 2 cp in the cathode to perform 2 cp dechlorination in this operating mode bes contaminant 2 cp was introduced from the cathode and moved to the anode while on the contrary electrons the degradation driving force were produced from the anode and flowed to the cathode 4 perspectives although this study demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to degrade 2 cp further development of this system must appropriately address several key challenges the first challenge is the requirement of the addition of co substrate acetate in this study acetate had to be added every time before transferring the cathode effluent into the anode in case the bes had lower electrochemical and degradation performance due to the high toxicity of the phenolic compounds the development of the bioanode may be able to solve this problem in recent years many advanced bioanodes were designed to improve the pollutant degradation efficiency and electricity generation in bes such as bioanodes coated with photocatalytic materials or modified with high redox potential materials chen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 due to the synergetic effect of biocatalysis and material catalysis these bioanodes could complete the phenol degradation and electricity generation under the condition of single substrate phenol in the bioanode and overcome the requirement of acetate addition the second challenge is the transfer of the cathode effluent to the anode in this study the bes operated in a batch flow mode after each cycle the cathode effluent need be discharged added with acetate and then fed into the anode chamber artificially this technique made the process complex and restricted the operation of the reactor in a continuous flow mode the overcome of the first challenge may provide opportunity for continuous flow operating mode since the addition of acetate during the process would not be required the cathode effluent could be directly pumped in the anode chamber future experiments should try to operate the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes in a continuous mode to degrade 2 cp and the operating parameters e g flow rate and hrt need to be further investigated and optimized by solving these two challenges 2 cp wastewater could achieve self degradation continuously without the requirement of exogenous carbon sources at present most researches on the degradation of cocs by bio electrochemical technology focused on the improvement and utilization of the only anode or cathode li et al 2020 mao et al 2019 wang et al 2012a however the degradation of many cocs is a process that requires both electron donors and acceptors therefore the combination and cooperation of anode and cathode may be a more promising strategy to achieve the efficient degradation of cocs in the future 5 conclusion this study designed and developed a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes through the combination and cooperation of the cathode and anode 2 cp could achieve self degradation the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenol and the phenolic compound degradation ability of the bes were investigated and several critical operating parameters were optimized in this operating mode bioanodes played the most decisive role the electrochemical activity and the microbial community structure of the bioanodes directly affected the electrochemical and degradation performances of the bes this study demonstrated the feasibility of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to efficiently degrade 2 cp and this operating mode could also be tried in future researches to degrade other cocs to explore more possibility and potential of bes declaration of competing interest the authors

16565,a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bioelectrochemical system bes was designed and developed to achieve the self degradation of 2 chlorophenol 2 cp with the cooperation of cathode and anode the electrons supplied for the cathode 2 cp dechlorination come from its own dechlorinated product in the anode phenol separate degradation experiments of cathode 2 cp and anode phenol were firstly conducted the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound 3 66 1 56 and the phenolic compound degradation ability of bes were investigated with the formation of the bioanode able to degrade phenol the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was further developed where 2 cp could achieve sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation when applied voltage was 0 6 v and cathode influent ph was 7 1 56 mm 2 cp reached 80 15 cathode dechlorination efficiency and 58 91 total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation efficiency the bioanodes played a decisive role in bes different operating conditions would affect the overall performance of bes by changing the electrochemical activity and microbial community structure of the bioanodes this study demonstrated the feasibility of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to degrade 2 cp wastewater and provided perspectives for the cooperation of cathode and anode aiming to explore more potential of bes in wastewater treatment field graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 2 chlorophenol 2 cp wastewater cascade operating mode self degradation dechlorinaton ring cleavage bioelectrochemical system bes 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds cocs are refractory organic compounds that are commonly used in many fields and widely exist in our environment li et al 2021 liang et al 2013 scheutz et al 2011 because cocs are toxic harmful and difficult to degrade most of them have been listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency igbinosa et al 2013 among cocs chlorophenols cps constitute an important category due to their strong odor emission high toxicity and persistence in the environment miran et al 2017 therefore the treatment of cps wastewater has become a major environmental concern and more and more current researches focused on achieving the efficient degradation of cps since the existence of chlorine group increases the toxicity and persistence of cps dechlorination is the most critical step in cps degradation process kong et al 2014b several technologies achieved the dechlorination of cps but limitations still exist as for anaerobic biotechnology because of the high toxicity of cps and the deficiency of sustainable electron donors e g h2 and short chain organics the anaerobic dechlorination rate was low lin et al 2019 electrochemical technology could provide sufficient electron donors for the dechlorination reaction but the energy consumption and cost were relatively high wen et al 2013 bioelectrochemical system bes has great potential in wastewater treatment field for supplying electrons lin et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 previous researches have shown that several types of cps e g 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 4 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp and pentachlorophenol pcp could be efficiently and selectively reduced into phenol in bes cathode lin et al 2019 strycharz et al 2010 wang et al 2012b wen et al 2013 the mechanism of bes cathode dechlorination is that the carbon source in the anode chamber was firstly converted into electrons by the electroactive bacteria in the bioanode then the electrons would flow to the cathode through the external circuit and be served as electron donors to complete the dechlorination of cps in the cathode chamber compared with conventional anaerobic biotechnology bes has lower carbon consumption and higher dechlorination rate jiang et al 2016 kong et al 2014a compared with conventional electrochemical technology bes has lower energy consumption cui et al 2016 however as an electron donor system bes cathode could not efficiently achieve the further degradation of the dechlorinated product phenol resulting in the incomplete degradation of cps many strategies have been proposed to solve this problem for instance bes cathode was combined with denitrification bioreactor to achieve the further ring cleavage of 2 cp arellano gonzalez et al 2016 micro aeration was also applied in bes cathode coupled with facultative anaerobic degradative bacteria to promote the complete degradation of 2 4 6 tcp khan et al 2019 however the combined application of reactors made the whole system complicated and the proper micro aeration condition was difficult to control in bes cathode therefore the objective of this study is to achieve both dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation of 2 cp in bes since previous studies have shown that phenol the dechlorinated product of 2 cp could be used as carbon source in the bioanode to perform transformation and degradation friman et al 2013 hassan et al 2018 hedbavna et al 2016 kong et al 2014b the combination of cathode and anode activities seems like a promising way to degrade 2 cp accordingly a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was developed and investigated to achieve the self degradation of 2 cp which means that the electrons responsible for the cathode 2 cp dechlorination come from its own dechlorinated product in the anode phenol this operating mode can not only achieve the further degradation of the intermediate phenol but also convert the waste phenol into useful carbon source in the bioanode thus reducing the exogenous carbon consumption of the 2 cp degradation process in this study the ability of the double chamber bes to separately degrade cathode 2 cp and anode phenol was firstly investigated to gain operating experience the optimal concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound and the optimum concentration of phenolic compounds were measured based on the separate degradation experiments the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was further developed and applied to sequentially degrade 2 cp wastewater the critical operating parameters including applied voltage and cathode influent ph were optimized to improve the 2 cp degradation efficiency in this novel operating mode this study also analyzed the electrochemical activity and microbial community structure of the bioanodes and clarified the decisive role of the bioanodes on the electrochemical and degradation performance of bes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes setup the double chamber bes was constructed using polymethyl methacrylate and each chamber had a working volume of 75 cm3 5 cm length 3 cm width 5 cm height the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a proton exchange membrane n117 dupont usa graphite felts 3 cm length 3 cm height 3 mm thickness were used as anode and cathode and the cathode was coated with pt catalyst 1 mg pt cm 2 the graphite felts were pretreated by heating at 450 c for 30 mins before use wang et al 2009 saturated ag agcl reference electrode was installed in the anode chamber for the detection of anode potential the whole bes was carefully sealed to maintain an anaerobic environment and prevent leakage 2 2 bes acclimation and start up stage the bes was started up with a bioanode and an abiotic cathode the anolyte consisted of 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl 0 13 g l 1 kcl 50 mmol l 1 mm pbs 5 ml l 1 vitamins 12 5 ml l 1 trace elements and 1 g l 1 acetate the anodic biofilm was acclimated with anaerobic sludge from a wastewater treatment plant in tianjin china the catholyte was composed of 50 mm sterilized phosphate buffer saline pbs to keep anaerobic conditions both anolyte and catholyte were sparged with n2 for 15 min before every feeding the applied voltage of bes in the start up period was 0 6 v supplied with a dc power supply atten technology co ltd shenzhen china both anolyte and catholyte were discharged and refilled with a fresh one when the system current was as low as 0 1 ma each time the solution was renewed was recorded as one cycle when the maximum system current remained similar for three consecutive cycles the bes start up stage was considered completed 2 3 operating conditions in bes degradation stage after the bes start up stage 2 cp and phenol were introduced in the reactors to start the bes degradation stage composed of two main progressive phases phase i is the separate degradation phase i e cathode 2 cp dechlorination and anode phenol ring cleavage fig 1 a 2 cp and phenol were separately added into the cathode and anode chamber the separate degradation experiments were composed of two parts to respectively investigate the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound and the pollutants degradation ability of the bes table 1 in phase i the bioanodes able to degrade phenol were acclimated and formed in preparation for the following phase to introduce cathode effluent into the anode chamber the operating experience and results accumulated in phase i were also utilized to help develop the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes in phase ii phase ii is the sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage phase i e 2 cp degradation in the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes fig 1b 2 cp wastewater served as the cathode influent and the dechlorinated cathode effluent served as the anode influent in phase ii 2 cp achieved sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation the critical operating parameters applied voltage and cathode influent ph of this innovative operating mode were investigated and optimized to improve the degradation efficiency of 2 cp table 2 triplicate reactors were performed in parallel for all experiments and all reactors were operated at room temperature 2 4 analysis and calculation the electrode potentials and system current were important

and chloride cl samples taken from the anode chamber were filtered by 0 22 μm pore diameter membrane filters to remove bacteria the concentration of 2 cp and phenol were detected by a high performance

were measured using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua shanghai china with a three electrode system anode as working electrode cathode as counter electrode and saturated ag agcl as reference electrode the scan range was from 0 6 v to 1 0 v and the scan rate was 10 mv s 1 the anolyte applied for the scan of each bioanode was the same as the anolyte used for the bioanode in each operating phase the anolyte applied for the abiotic anode was the same as the anolyte used in the sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation phase containing acetate phenol and 2 cp each time changing the bioanode or the electrolyte the scan was firstly run for approximately 30 mins and then when the system was stable the scanning data would be recorded 2 5 microbial community analysis bacterial samples from the initial unacclimated anaerobic sludge and the bioanodes in different operating stages bes start up and degradation stage and different operating parameters different applied voltage and influent ph were analyzed to investigate the variations in their microbial community structures the method for taking the anodic biofilm was as follows using sterilized tweezers to place the bioanode in a beaker containing sterilized ultrapure water the beaker was then sonicated for 15 mins to transfer the anodic biofilm into the ultrapure water then the water containing biofilm was centrifuged to obtain the biofilm sample dna of these bacterial samples was extracted using a water dna isolation kit according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna purity and concentration were determined using nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa the primer set of 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used

similarity of more than 97 were clustered into one operational taxonomic unit otu 3 results and discussion 3 1 bes acclimation and start up acetate was used as the substrate to acclimate bes during the acclimation period the system current continuously increased and the electrode potential gradually stabilized fig s1 in 250 h the maximum output current reached around 2 93 ma and remained same in three consecutive cycles showing the success of bes start up the anodic biofilm was finally formed successfully fig s2 the anode and cathode potentials were also sustained at that time at about 450 mv and 1050 mv respectively 3 2 separate degradation of cathode 2 cp and anode phenol after the successful start up of bes the anode substrate was changed from single acetate to co substrates acetate and phenol investigating the ability of the bioanode to degrade phenol at the same time 2 cp was introduced into the cathode chamber evaluating the feasibility of the two chamber bes to achieve separate degradation of anode phenol and cathode 2 cp simultaneously 3 2 1 optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound after a period about 7 cycles of adaptation for phenolic compounds introduction the bess gradually developed the ability to degrade phenolic compounds and could finally operate stably then the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound was investigated the concentration of anode phenol and cathode 2 cp was kept as 1 56 mm and the molar concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound was changed 2 44 1 56 3 66 1 56 4 88 1 56 and 6 10 1 56 part i in table 1 the system current and the electrode potentials were recorded with the increment of the anode acetate concentration functional bacteria had more readily degradable substrate the system current thus increased the maximum current was 1 42 2 10 2 26 and 2 51 ma under the concentration ratio of 2 44 1 56 3 66 1 56 4 88 1 56 and 6 10 1 56 respectively showing an improvement in the electrochemical performance fig 2 a their electrode potentials were relatively stable and similar the anode potentials were sustained between 50 to 300 mv and the cathode potentials were maintained between 650 to 900 mv fig 2b all bess under different concentration ratio could operate successfully and stably as for the cathode 2 cp dechlorination part the molar amount of 2 cp decrement was the same as the molar amount of phenol and cl increment in the cathode chamber showing that 2 cp could be selectively converted into phenol and cl with no other by products fig s3 similar to previous researches the selectivity was one big advantage of the cathode dechlorination fernando leon fernandez et al 2021 strycharz et al 2010 wen et al 2013 with the increment of the concentration ratio of acetate to phenolic compound the cathode 2 cp dechlorination efficiency and rate increased from 64 74 and 0 0281 mm h 1 in 2 44 1 56 ratio to 92 95 and 0 0403 mm h 1 in 6 10 1 56 ratio fig 2c due to the increment of the system current the cathode 2 cp could receive more electrons to complete the reduction process and thus the dechlorination performance was improved lin et al 2019 as for the anode phenol degradation part with the increment of the concentration ratio of acetate to phenolic compound the phenol degradation efficiency and rate increased first and then decreased fig 2d when the concentration ratio was 3 66 1 56 bes had the best phenol degradation performance with an efficiency of 67 05 and a rate of 0 0291 mm h 1 either too low or too high levels of acetate concentration in the anode had a negative impact on the phenol degradation performance when the anode acetate concentration was too low the activity of the bioanode decreased due to the lack of easily degradable substrate thus the anode phenol degradation efficiency and rate decreased when the anode acetate concentration was too high the bioanode preferably utilized the sufficient acetate instead of the hardly degradable substrate phenol also resulting in the decrement of the anode phenol degradation the molar concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound affected both the electrochemical and degradation performance of the bes fig 2 according to the results the optimum molar concentration ratio was 3 66 1 56 which could achieve better degradation performance for both the anode phenol and the cathode 2 cp 3 2 2 phenolic compounds degradation ability of bes to investigate the phenolic compounds degradation ability of bes the molar concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenolic compound was maintained as 3 66 1 56 while the concentration of the phenolic compounds 2 cp and phenol was gradually increased 1 56 2 34 and 3 12 mm part ii in table 1 when the concentration of phenolic compounds increased from 1 56 to 2 34 mm the maximum current decreased from 2 10 ma to 1 84 ma while the system could still maintain the electrochemical activity fig 3 a and b however when the pollutant concentration reached up to 3 12 mm due to the high toxicity of the phenolic compounds the bes finally crashed the system current dropped to less than 0 1 ma and the anode potential increased to near 600 mv fig 3a and b the anodic biofilm finally lost its electrochemical activity the cathode 2 cp dechlorination performance was shown in fig 3c and fig s4 when the 2 cp concentration was 1 56 and 2 34 mm the dechlorination rates were 0 0348 and 0 0300 mm h 1 respectively the dechlorination rates were directly related with the system current values higher current had higher dechlorination rate although the difference of their dechlorination rate was small their dechlorination efficiency had a bigger difference 80 20 under 1 56 mm pollutant and 46 15 under 2 34 mm pollutant because their initial 2 cp concentration was different fig 3c when the 2 cp concentration was 3 12 mm the biological activity of the anodic biofilm was damaged without the assistance of functional bacteria the cathode dechlorination efficiency and rate 2 30 and 0 0020 mm h 1 were extremely low the anode phenol degradation performance was also negatively affected by the increment of the phenol concentration fig 3d the phenol degradation rates under the phenol concentration of 1 56 mm and 2 34 mm were close which were 0 0291 and 0 0275 mm h 1 respectively this is because the anode acetate concentration was synchronously raised with the phenol concentration and the easily degradable substrate stimulated the growth of the functional anodic biofilm inducing the functional enzymes and mitigating the toxicity of the higher concentration phenol hedbavna et al 2016 luo et al 2009 yang et al 2021 due to the difference of the initial phenol concentration the anode phenol degradation efficiency was 67 05 under 1 56 mm and was 42 31 under 2 34 mm when the phenol concentration reached 3 12 mm the anode phenol degradation efficiency and rate decreased to 7 86 and 0 0068 mm h 1 excessive concentration of phenol induced extreme levels of toxicity thus greatly reducing the activity of the functional bacteria as shown in the results bes could not withstand phenolic compound concentration as high as 3 12 mm the system lost its ability to efficiently degrade phenol and 2 cp in such a high concentration while under the phenolic compound concentration of 1 56 and 2 34 mm both bess could achieve phenol and 2 cp degradation and their electrochemical performance and pollutant degradation rates were close however since the degradation efficiencies of phenol and 2 cp were higher under the concentration of 1 56 mm this pollutant concentration would be used in the following experiments 3 3 sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage of 2 cp the above separate degradation experiments showed that 2 cp and phenol could achieve simultaneous degradation in the cathode and anode in a double chamber bes therefore a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes was further developed where 2 cp could achieve sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation since acetate was required in the anode to maintain the activity of functional bacteria and the operation of bes the cathode dechlorinated effluent was added with acetate before being transferred to the anode chamber this addition process is analogous to the carbon source addition process in the common denitrification process in wastewater treatment hagman et al 2008 besides acetate nutrient medium nh4cl kcl vitamins and trace elements necessary for bacterial growth were also added in the anolyte to help maintain the bacterial activity of the bioanode 3 3 1 critical parameter applied voltage applied voltage is a critical parameter that affects the electrochemical and pollutant degradation performances in bes daghio et al 2018 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2011 zou et al 2020 in this study different voltages 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 v were applied in the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to investigate their effect and optimize the applied voltage parameter part i in table 2 as for the electrochemical part the increment of the applied voltage could increase the system current but the increase in current had an upper limit the increase in system current was about 0 63 ma when enhancing applied voltage from 0 4 to 0 6 v while further enhancing applied voltage from 0 6 to 0 8 v had little improvement on the system current fig 4 a this is mainly due to the fact that the electron transfer efficiency between bacteria and electrodes is limited in conventional bioanodes jiang et al 2014 yong et al 2012 yu et al 2020 hindering the continuous increase in system current moreover since the bioanode potential was relatively stable in bes between 50 to 300 mv the cathode potential changed along with the variation of the applied voltage fig 4b previous research showed that 2 cp dechlorination could occur at a potential of 400 mv arellano gonzalez et al 2015 as can be seen in fig 4b the cathode potentials of all bess were lower than 400 mv all meeting the potential requirement of 2 cp dechlorination the following dechlorination results obtained in this experiment also confirmed that 2 cp dechlorination could occur under all the applied voltages of 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 v as for the phenolic compounds degradation part the results proved the feasibility of the research idea that 2 cp could achieve sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation in a sequential cathode anode cascade operating mode bes fig 4c phenol the dechlorinated product of cathode 2 cp achieved further ring cleavage in the bioanode the concentration of 2 cp in the anode chamber was also slightly reduced showing that 2 cp could also achieve slight degradation in the bioanode while the degradation rate was very slow fig 4c the cv analysis of the bioanode section 3 4 1 showed that the bioanode finally developed the ability to directly oxidize phenol without developing the ability to directly oxidize 2 cp and the microbial community analysis section 3 4 2 showed the existence of dechlorinative bacteria in the bioanode these analysis results showed that the bioanode was not able to directly oxidize 2 cp due to its high toxicity in the bioanode 2 cp had to first conduct dechlorination through the dechlorinative bacteria and then achieve further degradation however dechlorination process was difficult to happen in the anode due to the lack of electron donors this explained why the bioanode had good phenol degradation performance but poor 2 cp degradation performance also highlighting the importance of the pretreatment of 2 cp in the cathode for toxicity reduction in bes pollutant degradation performance was mainly impacted by the electrochemical performance with the increment of the applied voltage the system current increased supplying more electrons for 2 cp dechlorination in the cathode leading to a higher 2 cp dechlorination efficiency and rate table 3 the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation efficiency and rate also increased table 3 higher dechlorination performance of 2 cp decreased the toxicity of the cathode effluent reduced the toxicity suffered by the bioanode allowing the bioanode to have higher activity and to generate current and degrade phenolic compounds more efficiently applied voltage increasing from 0 4 to 0 6 v the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation performance in the system clearly improved efficiency and rate increased from 45 58 and 0 0197 mm h 1 to 58 91 and 0 0256 mm h 1 while increasing from 0 6 to 0 8 v the improvement of the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation performance was not so significant efficiency and rate only incresed to 60 26 and 0 0261 mm h 1 table 3 since the anode potentials were relatively stable and the cathode potentials all met the potential required for 2 cp reduction system current became the most key factor determining the phenolic compounds degradation performance in this study therefore the difference in bes degradation performance was in accordance with that in the system current value the results indicated that 0 4 v applied voltage was too low to meet the voltage requirement of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes while 0 6 and 0 8 v were appropriate applied voltages to achieve optimum phenolic compounds degradation the close electrochemical and degradation performance of 0 6 and 0 8 v showed that the optimization ability of the applied voltage had an upper limit the system overall performance would not keep increasing along with the increment of the applied voltage moreover several previous researches showed that higher applied voltage may cause a negative effect on bes performance daghio et al 2018 feng et al 2016 even making the bioanode potential rise and provoking the instability of the system mu et al 2009 therefore the control of the applied voltage is significant to make the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes have a good performance since the electrochemical and pollutant degradation performances of bes under the applied voltage of 0 6 and 0 8 v were similar to reduce the power consumption 0 6 v was selected as the applied voltage in the following experiments 3 3 2 critical parameter cathode influent ph cathode influent ph is another critical parameter in bes a previous research showed that lower cathode ph ph 3 could improve both the cathode dechlorination efficiency and the electricity generation in bes by supplying abundant protons and overcoming the proton limitation wen et al 2013 however in the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes in this study the cathode influent ph would affect the anode influent ph and would further influence the activity of the bioanode and the overall performance of bes therefore the electrochemical and 2 cp degradation performances under different cathode influent ph ph 7 5 3 were analyzed to investigate whether lower cathode influent ph could have a positive influence in this study part ii in table 2 the cathode effluent ph i e the anode influent was also measured the cathode effluent ph was raised when the influent ph was 7 raised from 7 0 to 7 3 while the ph did not have considerable changes when the influent ph was 3 or 5 indicating that the proton limitation might be overcome at lower ph levels wen et al 2013 however as can be seen in fig 5 a and b the system electrochemical performance was decreased under lower cathode influent ph because electroactive bacteria had a low tolerance for acidic environments du et al 2017 sleutels et al 2010 when cathode influent ph decreased to 3 the system even crashed and lost its electrochemical activity results indicated that although lower cathode influent ph could overcome the proton limitation in the cathode the function and activity of the bioanode were the key factors to determine the bes electrochemical performance since the appropriate ph condition of the anodic functional bacteria is in neutral environment lower ph would reduce the anodic bacterial activity and decrease the bes electrochemical activity with the decrement of the cathode influent ph the cathode 2 cp dechlorination performance worsened due to the reduction of the current system the total cathode anode phenolic compounds degradation efficiency and rate were also decreased from 58 91 and 0 0256 mm h 1 to 8 38 and 0 0036 mm h 1 fig 5c table 4 as a result of two main reasons 1 lower ph environment decreased the activity of the functional bacteria in the bioanode 2 the decrement of the cathode 2 cp dechlorination efficiency resulted in higher toxicity of the cathode effluent i e anode influent further decreasing the activity of the functional bacteria in the bioanode overall the sequential 2 cp dechlorination and ring cleavage degradation process in sequential cathode anode cascade bes is an electro driven and bio catalytic process in the cathode 2 cp performed reduction process where the ccl bond was attacked by electrons from the cathode electron donor system resulting in the reduction of the chlorine group in benzene ring to cl in the catholyte in the anode phenol conducted oxidation process where phenol released electrons and was oxidized into co2 under the action of the bioanode electron acceptor system in the bioanode degradation process phenol would firstly achieve carboxylation and be converted into 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba then 4 hba would perform ring cleavage to generate small module acids e g acetate finally the small module acids would be further oxidized into co2 to achieve mineralization hedbavna et al 2016 yang et al 2020 during the whole process bioanodes played a decisive role to determine both the performances of electricity generation and phenolic compounds degradation in bes therefore the characteristics of the bioanodes in different condition were further analyzed 3 4 characteristic analysis of the bioanode 3 4 1 cv analysis the bioanodes at the end of the bes start up the separate degradation phase phase i and the sequential dechlorination and ring cleavage phase phase ii were analyzed via cv to investigate their electrochemical characteristics the abiotic anode was also analyzed via cv as the control group compared with abiotic anode clear oxidation peaks appeared in all the bioanodes proving the development of electrochemical activity of these bioanodes fig 6 in cv process besides organic substrates the typical redox proteins in geobacter c type cytochromes may also be oxidized and produce oxidation peaks however since previous researches showed that c type cytochromes would be fully oxidized by approximately 0 2 v vs ag agcl and the currents generated by them were approximately between 10 and 30 µa cm 2 lebedev et al 2014 liu et al 2011 peng and zhang 2017 the oxidation peaks appeared after 0 2 v and had more than 110 µa cm 2 current shown in fig 6 were not likely to come from the cytochromes the oxidation peaks should come from the oxidation of the organic substrates acetate phenol or 2 cp one oxidation peak at approximately 0 109 v vs ag agcl was shown in the cv of the bes start up phase fig 6b since acetate was the only carbon source that existed and performed oxidation during bes start up this oxidation peak was contributed by the acetate oxidation in the cv of the separate degradation phase phase i with anolyte containing acetate and phenol two oxidation peaks were shown fig 6c due to the fact that phenol had higher oxidation potential than acetate the oxidation peaks at 0 037 v vs ag agcl and 0 609 v vs ag agcl should represent the oxidation of acetate and phenol respectively the oxidation peak of acetate was slightly shifted from 0 109 to 0 037 v which may be due to the different anolyte composition and operating condition the oxidation peak of phenol was similar with a previous research which also showed an oxidation peak of phenol at nearly 0 600 v vs ag agcl in bioanode chen et al 2017 with the addition of phenol and decrease of acetate concentration in the anolyte the current generated by the bioanode was lower fig 6c indicating that with the increment of the anolyte toxicity the electroactivity of the bioanode reduced in accordance with the above electrochemical results the cv of the sequential degradation phase phase ii with anolyte containing acetate phenol and 2 cp was similar with the cv of the separate degradation phase phase i which showed two oxidation peaks of acetate and phenol without showing a new oxidation peak of 2 cp fig 6d the results indicated that the bioanode did not develop an obvious ability to oxidize the much more toxic 2 cp the whole cv analysis was consistent with the phenolic compounds degradation results of the bioanodes further revealing the electrochemical degradation activity of the bioanodes in different operating condition 3 4 2 microbial community analysis microbial community structure was analyzed at the genus level to discuss the functional and decisive role of the bioanode fig 7 bacterial samples from the initial unacclimated anaerobic sludge s1 the bioanode at the end of the start up stage s2 and the bioanode at the end of the 2 cp degradation stage s3 were analyzed to investigate the microbial community change in different operating stages fig 7a compared with s1 after a period of acclimation and start up several functional genera were enriched in s2 mainly composed of geobacter 28 78 advenella 18 08 acinetobacter 14 28 and sphaerochaeta 8 85 geobacter genus was a well known electroactive bacterium that could transfer electrons to the anode to generate electrical current guo et al 2013 acinetobacter genus was a typical biofilm forming bacterium that took charge of the formation of anodic biofilm gao et al 2014 sphaerochaeta and advenella were previously reported as fermentative and degradative bacteria ying et al 2017 both could participate in the degradation of the organic substrates the enrichment of these functional bacteria was achieved during the bes start up with the introduction of phenolic compounds 2 cp and phenol the microbial community structure experienced some changes s3 in fig 7a the abundance of acinetobacter decreased to 2 83 indicating that the function of biofilm forming species reduced after the formation of biofilm the abundances of dechlorosoma 16 92 and dysgonomonas 5 42 increased in s3 dechlorosoma was reported to be able to achieve dechlorination of several chlorinated compounds mezgebe et al 2017 sturchio et al 2003 and may also participate in the dechlorination of 2 cp in this study however the results of the section 3 3 showed a poor dechlorination performance of 2 cp in the bioanode indicating that dechlorosoma species in the bioanode may be utilized more to improve the 2 cp resistance of the bioanode than to dechlorinate 2 cp moreover dysgonomonas species were previously reported as phenol degradative bacteria huang et al 2016 which could be involved in the phenol degradation process in the bioanode the abundance of geobacter 27 92 and sphaerochaeta 9 81 in s3 was similar to s2 several geobacter species were found to be able to utilize phenol as carbon source jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 therefore the geobacter species in s3 could be responsible for both phenol degradation and electricity generation fermentative genus sphaerochaeta could also assist in the degradation of the organic intermediate metabolites cloacibacillus 6 41 was also enriched in s3 which was reported to be able to degrade organics and generate electricity zhang et al 2021 zhao and zhang 2021 the variation in microbial community structures led to different bacterial activity and function of the bioanodes from s1 to s2 the electrical stimulation and acetate addition facilitated the enrichment of electroactive bacteria geobacter as well as acetate degradative and fermentative bacteria sphaerochaeta and advenella making the bioanode electroactive and achieving the start up of bes from s2 to s3 the phenolic compounds introduction further changed the microbial community structure promoting the enrichment of phenol degradative bacteria dysgonomonas and cloacibacillus thus providing the electroactive bioanode with the ability to degrade phenolic compounds at the end of the degradation stage bacterial samples from the bioanodes under different operating parameters s3 applied voltage 0 6 v cathode influent ph 7 s3 04v applied voltage 0 4 v cathode influent ph 7 s3 ph3 applied voltage 0 6 v cathode influent ph 3 were taken to analyze the effect of critical parameters fig 7b compared with optimal condition s3 the abundance of the functional bacteria decreased in s3 04 v under a low applied voltage of 0 4 v geobacter 7 71 dechlorosoma 8 16 dysgonomonas 0 11 sphaerochaeta 2 33 and cloacibacillus 0 02 leading to the lower electrochemical and degradation performance of bes several other degradative and fermentative genera were enriched in s3 04 v including unclassified f comamonadaceae 5 39 lentimicrobium 8 37 and stenotrophomonas 5 14 which may assist in phenolic compound degradation under low applied voltage when the cathode influent ph was 3 the microbial community of the bioanode changed considerably s3 ph3 the abundance of the functional genera decreased geobacter 0 09 dechlorosoma 0 74 dysgonomonas 0 82 sphaerochaeta 0 29 and cloacibacillus 0 19 leading to a significant performance reduction of the bes under such condition several phenol resistant and acid resistant genera enriched including comamonas 26 90 and unclassified f clostridiaceae 12 34 results showed that different operating parameters would affect the bes performance via the change of the microbial community structure of the bioanode both lower applied voltage and influent ph would lead to the decrease of the abundance of the functional genera geobacter dechlorosoma dysgonomonas sphaerochaeta and cloacibacillus resulting in both lower performances of electricity generation and phenolic compounds degradation in bes compared with the optimal parameters the cv and microbial community analyses further manifested and confirmed the decisive role of the bioanode on the overall performance of bes functional bacteria and anode cooperated to complete phenolic compounds oxidation and electricity generation degradative and fermentative bacteria dysgonomonas cloacibacillus and sphaerochaeta were responsible for converting phenolic compounds into small module organic intermediates then electroactive bacteria geobacter played a role in further converting the small module organic intermediates into co2 as well as achieving the electron transfer from the organic substrates to the anode yang et al 2020 through the external circuit and applied voltage electrons flowed from the anode to the cathode and reacted with 2 cp in the cathode to perform 2 cp dechlorination in this operating mode bes contaminant 2 cp was introduced from the cathode and moved to the anode while on the contrary electrons the degradation driving force were produced from the anode and flowed to the cathode 4 perspectives although this study demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to degrade 2 cp further development of this system must appropriately address several key challenges the first challenge is the requirement of the addition of co substrate acetate in this study acetate had to be added every time before transferring the cathode effluent into the anode in case the bes had lower electrochemical and degradation performance due to the high toxicity of the phenolic compounds the development of the bioanode may be able to solve this problem in recent years many advanced bioanodes were designed to improve the pollutant degradation efficiency and electricity generation in bes such as bioanodes coated with photocatalytic materials or modified with high redox potential materials chen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 due to the synergetic effect of biocatalysis and material catalysis these bioanodes could complete the phenol degradation and electricity generation under the condition of single substrate phenol in the bioanode and overcome the requirement of acetate addition the second challenge is the transfer of the cathode effluent to the anode in this study the bes operated in a batch flow mode after each cycle the cathode effluent need be discharged added with acetate and then fed into the anode chamber artificially this technique made the process complex and restricted the operation of the reactor in a continuous flow mode the overcome of the first challenge may provide opportunity for continuous flow operating mode since the addition of acetate during the process would not be required the cathode effluent could be directly pumped in the anode chamber future experiments should try to operate the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes in a continuous mode to degrade 2 cp and the operating parameters e g flow rate and hrt need to be further investigated and optimized by solving these two challenges 2 cp wastewater could achieve self degradation continuously without the requirement of exogenous carbon sources at present most researches on the degradation of cocs by bio electrochemical technology focused on the improvement and utilization of the only anode or cathode li et al 2020 mao et al 2019 wang et al 2012a however the degradation of many cocs is a process that requires both electron donors and acceptors therefore the combination and cooperation of anode and cathode may be a more promising strategy to achieve the efficient degradation of cocs in the future 5 conclusion this study designed and developed a sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes through the combination and cooperation of the cathode and anode 2 cp could achieve self degradation the optimum concentration ratio of anode acetate to phenol and the phenolic compound degradation ability of the bes were investigated and several critical operating parameters were optimized in this operating mode bioanodes played the most decisive role the electrochemical activity and the microbial community structure of the bioanodes directly affected the electrochemical and degradation performances of the bes this study demonstrated the feasibility of the sequential cathode anode cascade mode bes to efficiently degrade 2 cp and this operating mode could also be tried in future researches to degrade other cocs to explore more possibility and potential of bes declaration of competing interest the authors

16566,release of algal organic matter aom from algae poses great threats to drinking water safety as organic nitrogen in aom is relatively higher compared to natural organic matter nom the organic chloramine formation during chlorination cause overestimation of effective chlorine which may lead to a biological risk this study compared the organic chloramine formation from aom and nom and confirmed that aom tend to form more organic chloramines during chlorination furthermore it was found that hydrophilic fraction and high molecular weight 100 kda fraction of aom generated major organic chloramines due to a high content of protein based on the results of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms spearman s rank correlation was used to analyze the relationship between molecular composition of aom and organic chloramine formation notably molecules with high correlation to organic chloramine formation located in a triangle region of van krevelen diagram which is a typical area of peptides therefore it indicates that the precursors of organic chloramine in aom are mainly proteins peptides and appropriate treatment processes e g biological treatment or membrane filtration should be addressed to effectively remove the precursors before chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal organic matter organic chloramines chlorination ft icr ms spearman s rank correlation 1 introduction eutrophication caused by algae in lakes and reservoirs is a critical problem and poses great threats to drinking water treatment utilities pilotti et al 2021 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2018 water quality can be seriously deteriorated by algae which increases turbidity taste and odor and algal toxins in the water column he et al 2021 commonly pre oxidation processes including chlorination ozonation and potassium permanganate are widely used for algae removal ma et al 2018 ma et al 2019 however algal organic matter aom generated by specific cyanobacteria species e g microcystis aeruginosa will be released into water with the lysis of cyanobacteria cells zhou et al 2015 it is difficult to remove aom by coagulation or pre oxidation enhanced coagulation jia et al 2018 and aom has been proved to be important precursors of disinfection by products dbps during chlorination fang et al 2010 li et al 2012 organic chloramines can be formed by chlorine substituting hydrogen on the amino groups during chlorination zhang et al 2016 which are precursors of nitrogenous dbps n dbps e g trichloronitromethane and dichloroacetonitrile wu et al 2020 besides organic chloramines were reported to have little or no disinfection ability but can be detected as a part of the total chlorine when the conventional n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method is applied lee and westerhoff 2009 zhang et al 2015 fang et al 2010 reported that aom contains large amount of organic n matters such as amino acids proteins and aliphatic amines therefore organic chloramines could be massively formed in algae laden water and the disinfection ability would be overestimated when dpd method is used to measure total chlorine because of the complicated composition of aom it is difficult to investigate the formation mechanism of organic chloramine from aom 1 the molecular weights mws of aom ranges from hundreds to millions dalton hua et al 2019 minsoo et al 2019 2 aom is composed of a large amount of proteins polysaccharides and lipids which have complex structures ma et al 2012 3 components in aom showed different hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties li et al 2014 in our previous study we used to characterize aom with fluorescence hydrophobicity proteins carbonhydrates and molecular weight mw distribution and found that fractions with different mws and different hydrophilicity have different dbp formation potentials during chlorination or chloramination zhou et al 2015 similarly aom with different mws and hydrophilicity fractions may have different organic chloramine formation potentials however the correlations of organic chloramine formation with different aom fractions have not been studied characteristics of aom were commonly studied using the above mentioned conventional methods but the information about molecular composition of aom is limited currently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been widely used to investigate the complex organic mixtures like natural organic matter nom sleighter and hatcher 2007 zhang et al 2020a in this study ft icr ms was first used to characterize the molecular composition of aom and the relationship between molecular composition and organic chloramine formation would be further studied based on ft icr ms data overall the objectives of this study were 1 to compare the organic chloramine formation from aom and nom in chlorination 2 to evaluate the contributions of aom fractions with different mws and different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity on organic chloramine formation 3 to identify the characteristics of organic chloramine precursors in aom using ft icr ms and investigate the relationship

international humic substances society usa unless otherwise stated all other purchased chemicals and reagents were analytical grade and detailed information were listed in supporting information text s1 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 algae cultivation and aom extraction microcystis aeruginosa fachb 912 was purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences bg11 media was used to culture the algae the medium temperature was kept at 25 c m aeruginosa cells were illuminated by a 12 h continuous light daily and the intensity was about 30 40 μmol photons m2 s m aeruginosa cells in late exponential growth phase were used in this study and the aom was extracted from the same batch of algae the algae cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min and then centrifugal sediments were collected and resuspended in ultrapure water milli q usa then freezing and thawing method was used for three times to break the cells and release the intracellular substances by centrifuging and filtration the filtrates were obtained as aom 2 2 2 mw fractionation of aom a series of polyethersulfone ultrafiltration uf membranes were used to fractionate aom into different mw

zhang et al 2016 the characteristics of all samples were analyzed by ft icr ms and detailed information and limitations are described in text s2 description of the weighted average value of double bond equivalence dbew are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of organic chloramine formation from aom and nom organic chloramines formed from aom during 24 h chlorination with different chlorine dosage are shown in fig 1 a c of note the formation of nh2cl is negligible in chlorination of aom due to the low concentration of ammonia nitrogen li et al 2012 the organic chloramines formed quickly because of the high reaction rate constants 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 between free chlorine and organic nitrogen yoon and jensen 1993 as shown in fig 1a the concentration of organic chloramines reached up to 0 52 mg cl2 l 1 with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage in the first 0 5 h and then decreased gradually to 0 10 mg cl2 l 1 till 24 h while a continuous decline on the concentrations of free chlorine was observed furthermore the profiles of organic chloramine proportion in total chlorine increased significantly at the initial 0 5 h and then showed upward trends in 24 h specifically the proportion of organic chloramines in total chlorine after 24 h chlorination were 100 0 70 0 and 60 0 when the chlorine dosages were 1 25 2 50 5 00 mg cl2 l 1 respectively fig 1a c therefore more attention should be paid on the high risk of disinfection efficiency overestimation during algae containing water chlorination due to the high proportion of organic chloramines in total chlorine 60 0 as a comparison nom a widely available organic precursor was chosen for organic chloramine formation fig 1d f as shown in fig 1d the organic chloramine formation at 0 5 h with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage was 0 13 mg cl2 l 1 which was only 25 of that in aom chlorination and the proportion in total chlorine of organic chloramine in nom chlorination are also significantly lower than that in aom chlorination the results were consistent with the study of zhang et al 2016 that aom was the major precursors of organic chloramine compared to nom and the reasons can be ascribed to that aom contains high organic n content which provides sufficient amino groups for organic chloramine formation morris 1967 snyder and margerum 1982 yoon and jensen 1993 3 2 organic chloramine formation from different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and molecular weight factions the organic chloramine formation from different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity fractions after 0 5 h chlorination are presented in fig 2 a the generated organic chloramines with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage were 0 52 0 35 0 30 and 0 73 mg cl2 l 1 from aom hp tp and hl fractions respectively compared to aom the organic chloramine formation potential of hl fractions was higher while that of the hp and tp fractions was lower on the contrary fig 2a and figure s1 the phenomenon can be explained as follows our previous study reported that the main components of aom of microsystis aeruginosa was proteins and polysaccharides and proteins in hl hp tp fractions accounted for 58 2 41 8 and 24 1 of total mass respectively zhou et al 2014 additionally the proportions of polysaccharides in hl hp and tp fractions were 29 7 47 2 and 53 5 respectively table s1 it is obvious that hl fractions had more proteins and fewer polysaccharides than the hp and tp fractions as proteins containing organic amines tend to react with chlorine easily to form organic chloramine while polysaccharides were composed of c h and o components which cannot form organic chloramines in chlorination this observation suggests that proteins in aom may play an important role in organic chloramine formation the organic chloramine formation from different mw fractions after 0 5 h chlorination are shown in fig 2b the generated organic chloramines with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage were 0 52 0 38 0 47 0 40 and 0 76 mg cl2 l 1 from aom mw 1 kda 1 30 kda 30 100 kd and 100 kda fractions respectively compared to aom only high mw mw 100 kda fractions had higher organic chloramine formation potential fig 2b and figure s1 as shown in table s1 high mw fraction also had the highest protein content 44 7 and a relatively low polysaccharides content 16 8 consistent with the result that fractions of aom containing high protein content are favorable to form organic chloramines of note different trends of organic chloramine formation were observed as chlorine dosages changed table 1 organic chloramines generated from aom hp hl and 100 kda fractions kept increasing as chlorine dosage increased from 1 25 to 5 00 mg l 1 however other aom fractions exhibited decreasing or increasing then decreasing trends with the increasing chlorine dosage to explain the phenomenon the proteins polysaccharides ratio pp ratio was used to characterize the content of organic chloramine precursors low pp ratios were observed in tp mw 1 kda 1 30 kda and 30 100 kda fractions table s1 where the organic chloramine precursors were insufficient and can be quickly consumed during chlorination and then the formed organic chloramines can be further decomposed as the chlorine dosage increased the result was consistent with zhang et al 2016 which reported that with chlorine dosage increased from 5 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 organic chloramines formation at 30 min decreased on the other hand high pp ratio were observed in aom hp hl and 100 kda fractions where the organic chloramine precursors were abundant and thus the organic chloramines formation kept increasing with the increase of chlorine dosage 3 3 relationships between dbew and organic chloramine formation potential based on the above mentioned results hl and mw 100 kda fractions of aom were confirmed to be the major organic chloramine precursors fig 3 a and figure s2 present the iso abundance plots of dbe versus carbon numbers obtained from ft icr ms and the dbe 2 10 with 10 25 carbon numbers were the most abundant in aom and seven individual fractions it was notable that the weighted average value of double bond equivalence dbew has a linear correlation r2 0 5935 with the formation of organic chloramines fig 3b indicating a potential positive relationship between unsaturation of precursors and organic chloramine formation the reason could be ascribed to that it was easier for chlorine to oxidize unsaturated substances ge et al 2018 wan et al 2021 to further screen the molecular compositions of organic chloramine precursors correlation analysis with van krevelen diagram was used in the following section 3 4 linking molecular compositions of aom with organic chloramine formation potential molecules in complex mixtures can be characterized by ft icr ms wang et al 2017 which allow us to link aom properties with its molecular compositions by correlation analysis spearman s correlation coefficient rs is used to identify and test the strength of a relationship between two sets of data which is more applicable in this study because the distribution of molecules is not normal herzsprung et al 2012 kellerman et al 2015 also only the molecules composed of chon and chons were included in van krevelen diagram since these substances may be responsible for the formation of organic chloramines especially to avoid weak significance of the results from the small sample size only molecules present in all the 8 samples n 850 were used in calculation in this study the response intensity of the chosen molecules and the concentrations of organic chloramine were linked by spearman s correlation analysis fig 4 the significance test was performed using the method reported by herzsprung et al 2012 three kinds of molecules were considered to be not related in our work 1 molecules with a negative rank correlation coefficient rs were defined as not related because their presence has no favorable effect on the formation of organic chloramines 2 molecules with significance greater than 0 1 was regarded to be unrelated to organic chloramine formation 3 molecules with spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs less than 0 4 vasilaki et al 2018 show a very low correlation between molecules and organic chloramine formation in previous studies for environmental samples e g nom regions of van krevelen diagram were divided to define specific compound category according to the method of zhang et al 2020b it was observed that very few points fall within the region of proteins as shown in figure s3 thus leading to the low organic chloramine formation of nom fig 1 recently as the above mentioned classification showed low accuracy for biological samples e g aom a new method was developed by rivas ubach et al 2018 it can be distinguished that the shape of the peptide area is close to a triangle the coordinates of the three vertices of which are approximately 0 15 0 80 0 20 2 00 and 0 80 1 75 figure s4 similarly as shown in fig 4 when the molecules were presented by the color coded circles with respect to spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs it was observed that a large proportion of molecules 77 2 correlated to organic chloramine formation rs 0 4 fall within the triangle region of peptides of note these peptides in the triangle region are consist of many groups like r co nh2 and r co nh r which are responsible for organic chloramine formation in chlorination zhang et al 2016 overall the results further verified that proteins peptides in aom were the major precursors of organic chloramines during chlorination 3 5 implications for drinking water treatment the results of this study suggest that organic chloramine formation in chlorination of algae containing water may cause overestimation of disinfection efficiency and pose a high biological risk to drinking water furthermore organic chloramines with group ncl2 could be decomposed into nitriles r r cn through decarboxylation and chloride loss and further formed trichloroacetonitrile and dichloroacetonitrile during chlorination na and olson 2006 yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 in drinking water treatment aom are more important precursors for organic chloramines compared to nom humic acid and fulvic acid zhang et al 2016 as hl fraction and high mw fraction of aom contain significant amounts of proteins which were the main precursors of organic chloramines advanced treatment processes e g biological treatment or membrane filtration would be potential options to minimize the organic chloramine formation potential of algae containing water 4 conclusions the organic chloramine formation during chlorination was investigated in this study the ft icr ms and spearman s rank correlation analysis were used to characterize the precursors of organic chloramine the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the formation of organic chloramines from aom was far more than that from nom and caused the overestimation of effective chlorine 2 hydrophilic fraction and mw 100 kda fraction of aom contribute to a significant amount of organic chloramine precursors during chlorination 3 positive relationship between unsaturation of precursors from aom and organic chloramine formation was developed and the major precursors of organic chloramine were identified to be proteins peptides by spearman s rank correlation declaration of competing

confirmed that aom tend to form more organic chloramines during chlorination furthermore it was found that hydrophilic fraction and high molecular weight 100 kda fraction of aom generated major organic chloramines due to a high content of protein based on the results of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms spearman s rank correlation was used to analyze the relationship between molecular composition of aom and organic chloramine formation notably molecules with high correlation to organic chloramine formation located in a triangle region of van krevelen diagram which is a typical area of peptides therefore it indicates that the precursors of organic chloramine in aom are mainly proteins peptides and appropriate treatment processes e g biological treatment or membrane filtration should be addressed to effectively remove the precursors before chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal organic matter organic chloramines chlorination ft icr ms spearman s rank correlation 1 introduction eutrophication caused by algae in lakes and reservoirs is a critical problem and poses great threats to drinking water treatment utilities pilotti et al 2021 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2018 water quality can be seriously deteriorated by algae which increases turbidity taste and odor and algal toxins in the water column he et al 2021 commonly pre oxidation processes including chlorination ozonation and potassium permanganate are widely used for algae removal ma et al 2018 ma et al 2019 however algal organic matter aom generated by specific cyanobacteria species e g microcystis aeruginosa will be released into water with the lysis of cyanobacteria cells zhou et al 2015 it is difficult to remove aom by coagulation or pre oxidation enhanced coagulation jia et al 2018 and aom has been proved to be important precursors of disinfection by products dbps during chlorination fang et al 2010 li et al 2012 organic chloramines can be formed by chlorine substituting hydrogen on the amino groups during chlorination zhang et al 2016 which are precursors of nitrogenous dbps n dbps e g trichloronitromethane and dichloroacetonitrile wu et al 2020 besides organic chloramines were reported to have little or no disinfection ability but can be detected as a part of the total chlorine when the conventional n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method is applied lee and westerhoff 2009 zhang et al 2015 fang et al 2010 reported that aom contains large amount of organic n matters such as amino acids proteins and aliphatic amines therefore organic chloramines could be massively formed in algae laden water and the disinfection ability would be overestimated when dpd method is used to measure total chlorine because of the complicated composition of aom it is difficult to investigate the formation mechanism of organic chloramine from aom 1 the molecular weights mws of aom ranges from hundreds to millions dalton hua et al 2019 minsoo et al 2019 2 aom is composed of a large amount of proteins polysaccharides and lipids which have complex structures ma et al 2012 3 components in aom showed different hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties li et al 2014 in our previous study we used to characterize aom with fluorescence hydrophobicity proteins carbonhydrates and molecular weight mw distribution and found that fractions with different mws and different hydrophilicity have different dbp formation potentials during chlorination or chloramination zhou et al 2015 similarly aom with different mws and hydrophilicity fractions may have different organic chloramine formation potentials however the correlations of organic chloramine formation with different aom fractions have not been studied characteristics of aom were commonly studied using the above mentioned conventional methods but the information about molecular composition of aom is limited currently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been widely used to investigate the complex organic mixtures like natural organic matter nom sleighter and hatcher 2007 zhang et al 2020a in this study ft icr ms was first used to characterize the molecular composition of aom and the relationship between molecular composition and organic chloramine formation would be further studied based on ft icr ms data overall the objectives of this study were 1 to compare the organic chloramine formation from aom and nom in chlorination 2 to evaluate the contributions of aom fractions with different mws and different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity on organic chloramine formation 3 to identify the characteristics of organic chloramine precursors in aom using ft icr ms and investigate the relationship between aom molecular composition and organic chloramine formation by spearman s rank correlation 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals and reagents suwannee river nom cat 2r101n was supplied by international humic substances society usa unless otherwise stated all other purchased chemicals and reagents were analytical grade and detailed information were listed in supporting information text s1 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 algae cultivation and aom extraction microcystis aeruginosa fachb 912 was purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences bg11 media was used to culture the algae the medium temperature was kept at 25 c m aeruginosa cells were illuminated by a 12 h continuous light daily and the intensity was about 30 40 μmol photons m2 s m aeruginosa cells in late exponential growth phase were used in this study and the aom was extracted from the same batch of algae the algae cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min and then centrifugal sediments were collected and resuspended in ultrapure water milli q usa then freezing and thawing method was used for three times to break the cells and release the intracellular substances by centrifuging and filtration the filtrates were obtained as aom 2 2 2 mw fractionation of aom a series of polyethersulfone ultrafiltration uf membranes were used to fractionate aom into different mw fractions 1 kda 1 30 kda 30 100 kda and 100 kda a 50 ml ultrafiltration cell amicon 8400 millipore corp usa was used with a constant nitrogen gas pressure of 0 1 mpa in this experiment to fractionate aom 2 2 3 hydrophilic hydrophobic fractionation of aom xad 8 xad 4 amberlite usa columns were applied for the fractionation of aom into hydrophilic hl transphilic tp and hydrophobic hp fractions according to the method reported by knulst et al 1998 the recovery rate of the fractionation was 85 91 the presented data had been normalized to 100 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic matter doc was detected by a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan total chlorine free chlorine and monochloramine were measured using dpd total chlorine reagent method dpd free chlorine reagent method and monochlorf reagent method respectively hach co usa lee et al 2007 the organic chlorine concentration was calculated by total chlorine minus free chlorine and monochloramine zhang et al 2016 the characteristics of all samples were analyzed by ft icr ms and detailed information and limitations are described in text s2 description of the weighted average value of double bond equivalence dbew are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of organic chloramine formation from aom and nom organic chloramines formed from aom during 24 h chlorination with different chlorine dosage are shown in fig 1 a c of note the formation of nh2cl is negligible in chlorination of aom due to the low concentration of ammonia nitrogen li et al 2012 the organic chloramines formed quickly because of the high reaction rate constants 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 between free chlorine and organic nitrogen yoon and jensen 1993 as shown in fig 1a the concentration of organic chloramines reached up to 0 52 mg cl2 l 1 with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage in the first 0 5 h and then decreased gradually to 0 10 mg cl2 l 1 till 24 h while a continuous decline on the concentrations of free chlorine was observed furthermore the profiles of organic chloramine proportion in total chlorine increased significantly at the initial 0 5 h and then showed upward trends in 24 h specifically the proportion of organic chloramines in total chlorine after 24 h chlorination were 100 0 70 0 and 60 0 when the chlorine dosages were 1 25 2 50 5 00 mg cl2 l 1 respectively fig 1a c therefore more attention should be paid on the high risk of disinfection efficiency overestimation during algae containing water chlorination due to the high proportion of organic chloramines in total chlorine 60 0 as a comparison nom a widely available organic precursor was chosen for organic chloramine formation fig 1d f as shown in fig 1d the organic chloramine formation at 0 5 h with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage was 0 13 mg cl2 l 1 which was only 25 of that in aom chlorination and the proportion in total chlorine of organic chloramine in nom chlorination are also significantly lower than that in aom chlorination the results were consistent with the study of zhang et al 2016 that aom was the major precursors of organic chloramine compared to nom and the reasons can be ascribed to that aom contains high organic n content which provides sufficient amino groups for organic chloramine formation morris 1967 snyder and margerum 1982 yoon and jensen 1993 3 2 organic chloramine formation from different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and molecular weight factions the organic chloramine formation from different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity fractions after 0 5 h chlorination are presented in fig 2 a the generated organic chloramines with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage were 0 52 0 35 0 30 and 0 73 mg cl2 l 1 from aom hp tp and hl fractions respectively compared to aom the organic chloramine formation potential of hl fractions was higher while that of the hp and tp fractions was lower on the contrary fig 2a and figure s1 the phenomenon can be explained as follows our previous study reported that the main components of aom of microsystis aeruginosa was proteins and polysaccharides and proteins in hl hp tp fractions accounted for 58 2 41 8 and 24 1 of total mass respectively zhou et al 2014 additionally the proportions of polysaccharides in hl hp and tp fractions were 29 7 47 2 and 53 5 respectively table s1 it is obvious that hl fractions had more proteins and fewer polysaccharides than the hp and tp fractions as proteins containing organic amines tend to react with chlorine easily to form organic chloramine while polysaccharides were composed of c h and o components which cannot form organic chloramines in chlorination this observation suggests that proteins in aom may play an important role in organic chloramine formation the organic chloramine formation from different mw fractions after 0 5 h chlorination are shown in fig 2b the generated organic chloramines with 1 25 mg l 1 chlorine dosage were 0 52 0 38 0 47 0 40 and 0 76 mg cl2 l 1 from aom mw 1 kda 1 30 kda 30 100 kd and 100 kda fractions respectively compared to aom only high mw mw 100 kda fractions had higher organic chloramine formation potential fig 2b and figure s1 as shown in table s1 high mw fraction also had the highest protein content 44 7 and a relatively low polysaccharides content 16 8 consistent with the result that fractions of aom containing high protein content are favorable to form organic chloramines of note different trends of organic chloramine formation were observed as chlorine dosages changed table 1 organic chloramines generated from aom hp hl and 100 kda fractions kept increasing as chlorine dosage increased from 1 25 to 5 00 mg l 1 however other aom fractions exhibited decreasing or increasing then decreasing trends with the increasing chlorine dosage to explain the phenomenon the proteins polysaccharides ratio pp ratio was used to characterize the content of organic chloramine precursors low pp ratios were observed in tp mw 1 kda 1 30 kda and 30 100 kda fractions table s1 where the organic chloramine precursors were insufficient and can be quickly consumed during chlorination and then the formed organic chloramines can be further decomposed as the chlorine dosage increased the result was consistent with zhang et al 2016 which reported that with chlorine dosage increased from 5 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 organic chloramines formation at 30 min decreased on the other hand high pp ratio were observed in aom hp hl and 100 kda fractions where the organic chloramine precursors were abundant and thus the organic chloramines formation kept increasing with the increase of chlorine dosage 3 3 relationships between dbew and organic chloramine formation potential based on the above mentioned results hl and mw 100 kda fractions of aom were confirmed to be the major organic chloramine precursors fig 3 a and figure s2 present the iso abundance plots of dbe versus carbon numbers obtained from ft icr ms and the dbe 2 10 with 10 25 carbon numbers were the most abundant in aom and seven individual fractions it was notable that the weighted average value of double bond equivalence dbew has a linear correlation r2 0 5935 with the formation of organic chloramines fig 3b indicating a potential positive relationship between unsaturation of precursors and organic chloramine formation the reason could be ascribed to that it was easier for chlorine to oxidize unsaturated substances ge et al 2018 wan et al 2021 to further screen the molecular compositions of organic chloramine precursors correlation analysis with van krevelen diagram was used in the following section 3 4 linking molecular compositions of aom with organic chloramine formation potential molecules in complex mixtures can be characterized by ft icr ms wang et al 2017 which allow us to link aom properties with its molecular compositions by correlation analysis spearman s correlation coefficient rs is used to identify and test the strength of a relationship between two sets of data which is more applicable in this study because the distribution of molecules is not normal herzsprung et al 2012 kellerman et al 2015 also only the molecules composed of chon and chons were included in van krevelen diagram since these substances may be responsible for the formation of organic chloramines especially to avoid weak significance of the results from the small sample size only molecules present in all the 8 samples n 850 were used in calculation in this study the response intensity of the chosen molecules and the concentrations of organic chloramine were linked by spearman s correlation analysis fig 4 the significance test was performed using the method reported by herzsprung et al 2012 three kinds of molecules were considered to be not related in our work 1 molecules with a negative rank correlation coefficient rs were defined as not related because their presence has no favorable effect on the formation of organic chloramines 2 molecules with significance greater than 0 1 was regarded to be unrelated to organic chloramine formation 3 molecules with spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs less than 0 4 vasilaki et al 2018 show a very low correlation between molecules and organic chloramine formation in previous studies for environmental samples e g nom regions of van krevelen diagram were divided to define specific compound category according to the method of zhang et al 2020b it was observed that very few points fall within the region of proteins as shown in figure s3 thus leading to the low organic chloramine formation of nom fig 1 recently as the above mentioned classification showed low accuracy for biological samples e g aom a new method was developed by rivas ubach et al 2018 it can be distinguished that the shape of the peptide area is close to a triangle the coordinates of the three vertices of which are approximately 0 15 0 80 0 20 2 00 and 0 80 1 75 figure s4 similarly as shown in fig 4 when the molecules were presented by the color coded circles with respect to spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs it was observed that a large proportion of molecules 77 2 correlated to organic chloramine formation rs 0 4 fall within the triangle region of peptides of note these peptides in the triangle region are consist of many groups like r co nh2 and r co nh r which are responsible for organic chloramine formation in chlorination zhang et al 2016 overall the results further verified that proteins peptides in aom were the major precursors of organic chloramines during chlorination 3 5 implications for drinking water treatment the results of this study suggest that organic chloramine formation in chlorination of algae containing water may cause overestimation of disinfection efficiency and pose a high biological risk to drinking water furthermore organic chloramines with group ncl2 could be decomposed into nitriles r r cn through decarboxylation and chloride loss and further formed trichloroacetonitrile and dichloroacetonitrile during chlorination na and olson 2006 yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 in drinking water treatment aom are more important precursors for organic chloramines compared to nom humic acid and fulvic acid zhang et al 2016 as hl fraction and high mw fraction of aom contain significant amounts of proteins which were the main precursors of organic chloramines advanced treatment processes e g biological treatment or membrane filtration would be potential options to minimize the organic chloramine formation potential of algae containing water 4 conclusions the organic chloramine formation during chlorination was investigated in this study the ft icr ms and spearman s rank correlation analysis were used to characterize the precursors of organic chloramine the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the formation of organic chloramines from aom was far more than that from nom and caused the overestimation of effective chlorine 2 hydrophilic fraction and mw 100 kda fraction of aom contribute to a significant amount of organic chloramine precursors during chlorination 3 positive relationship between unsaturation of precursors from aom and organic chloramine formation was developed and the major precursors of organic chloramine were identified to be proteins peptides by spearman s rank correlation declaration of competing

proteins and polysaccharides in the biomass will undergo hydrolysis and maillard reaction producing biorefractory organic substances such as recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen rdon and melanoidins in this study a series of spectroscopy methods were used to quantitatively analyze the maillard reaction of glucose and lysine and the interaction mechanisms of the maillard reaction products mrps and lysozyme were investigated results showed that the typical aromatic heterocyclic structures in mrps such as pyrazine and furan were found to quench molecular fluorescence of lysozyme resulting in an unfolding of standard protein structure and increase in lysozyme hydrophobicity significant loss of enzyme activity was detected during this process thermodynamic parameters obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry itc confirmed that the interaction between mrps and lysozyme occurred both exothermically and spontaneously density functional theory dft calculations suggested

anaerobic digestion ad efficiency in the engineering field li et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 such processes are known to effectively improve the bioavailability of organic matter recently more attention has been paid to the effect of organic matter conversion in sludge during thp on the ad process as thp is widely used as a pretreatment for the ad process chen et al 2019 yin et al 2019 usman et al 2019 2020 hao et al 2020 thp can intensify hydrolysis of the macro biopolymers in was and increase the methane production of ad but the possible negative effects of thp also should be considered such as formation of biorefractory by products zhang et al 2020 particular concerns include the recalcitrant nitrogen containing organic compounds with dark color produced in the was thp process and their poor biodegradability zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 these recalcitrant compounds when placed in sludge treated by thermal hydrolysis were resistant to conversion by ad microorganisms usman et al 2020 an additional number of studies further reported the identification of products from biopolymer conversion after sludge thp processing and all studies noted the emergence of molecules of heterocyclic amines furans aldehydes and ketones chen et al 2019 hao et al 2020 usman et al 2020 furthermore all those molecules were identified as typical organic structures from maillard reaction zhang et al 2020 besides it has already been reported that the addition of melanoidins produced by food waste fw hydrothermal treatment inhibited the acidification process during anaerobic digestion of fw yin et al 2019 as recalcitrant organic compounds maillard reaction products mrps are known for poor microbial degradability and adverse biological effects beyond a certain concentration including genotoxicity cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity chandra et al 2008 wang et al 2011 which allows them to persist in the environment ivarson and benzing purdie 1987 this means that the recalcitrant chemicals in mrps will not only affect the efficiency of ad but the undegraded mrps in ad sludge dewatering filtrate also enter the subsequent wastewater biological treatment and uv disinfection unit dwyer et al 2008a 2009 as these recalcitrant mrps were found to strongly quench uv light and inhibit the side stream nitrogen removal process such as anammox and nitrification gu et

6 bar 30 min despite the increasing number of research publications reporting the adverse effects of the mrps the study of the maillard reaction in the field of wastewater treatment is still in its early stage enzymatic reactions play an essential role in environmental biological processes such as ad bano et al 2017 but how those recalcitrant heterocyclic compounds in mrps interact with proteins and inhibit enzyme driven biodegradation reactions is still unclear hellwig et al 2016 in general molecules with a rich functional group structure can interact with proteins through non covalent interactions resulting in changes in the secondary structure of proteins xu et al 2020 structural changes in proteins may in turn lead to a reduction in their enzymatic activities chen et al 2016 martinez gonzalez et al 2017 report shows that humic acid as another example binds to enzymes and inhibits enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis reactions huang et al 2021 interaction mechanisms like electrostatic force covalent bond and sweep flocculation were suggested li et al 2019a 2019b as a newly identified issue an in depth understanding of the mechanisms of mrps enzyme interaction is essential to ensure a sustainable application of thp in wastewater sludge treatment in this study we investigated the effects of mrps on the enzymatic function of proteins the interaction mechanism of lysozyme and template mrps prepared with glucose and lysine were investigated by multi spectroscopic methodologies including the fluorescence quenching analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometry and circular dichromatic cd spectrum the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction including enthalpy δh entropy δs and gibbs free energy δg were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry itc dft was used to further verify the rationality of the molecular reaction mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 mrps preparation reagents used in the experiment are shown in text s1 in supporting information si a 1 1 mixture of glucose 10 g l and lysine 10 g l as the most basic precursor of maillard reaction was heated to prepare template mrps in a stainless steel hydrothermal reactor cämmerer and kroh 1995 considering that the maillard reaction does not require high temperatures a mild thermal hydrolysis temperature 100 c was selected to avoid side reactions such as caramelization and deamination at the same time a long heating time 2 h ensures the adequate processing of the maillard reaction uv vis spectra and molecular weight distribution of mrps were evaluated see in text s2 mrps samples 0 min and 120 min for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed using a thermo fisher kalpha spectrometer with an al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev the n 1 s o 1 s and c1s core levels were deconvoluted into subcomponents by xpspeak 4 1 the organic species of template mrps were further analyzed through a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms and the detailed information can be seen in text s2 in si 2 2 procedure for mrps lysozyme interaction specifically a wide range of concentrations of mrps 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 120 mg l were titrated into dissolved lysozyme solution 50 mg l followed by a 160 rpm stirring for 20 min at 25 c the changes in enzyme activity zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter were determined immediately after the batch experiment enzyme activity was assessed by measuring the degradation rate of peptidoglycan on the micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall ml sigma aldrich by lysozyme over a fixed period of time as the lysozyme can attack the peptidoglycans in the cell walls causing a decrease in the suspension absorbance at wavelength 450 nm the detailed information can be seen in text s3 zeta potential was measured on a zetasizer 3000 malvern instruments uk hydrodynamic diameter was determined in triplicate by using a malvern zetasizer nano zs instruments worcestershire united kingdom operating with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and a detection angle of 90 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined

discussion 3 1 the characterization of glucose lysine mrps the maillard reaction has been demonstrated its performance as a non negligible side effect in sludge thermal hydrolysis process since the typical thp conditions e g 165 c for 30 min overlap with that of the maillard reaction in our previous study a three stage pathway of the maillard reaction under sludge hydrothermal condition were proposed wang et al 2021 in general the intense hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides at high temperature exposes abundant free amino and aldehyde groups to initiate the hydroxyl condensation of the maillard reaction resulting in the formation of schiff base and amadori products enolization reaction is followed to form furan intermediate accompanied by side reaction generating heterocyclic such as pyrazine furan intermediates are further polymerized to form macromolecular colored substances with the prolongation of heating time since mrps is a complex mixture it is not feasible to separate mrps from the heterogeneous sludge colloid system after thermal hydrolysis lysine and glucose were used in this study to prepare template mrps as lysine is the most abundant amino acid in sludge and has high maillard reaction activity organic species including furan pyrazines pyrrole pyridine ketones and phenols in the template mrps were detected by gc ms table s1 which were identified as characteristic products of the maillard reaction other studies also identified the soluble products following the sludge thp and confirmed the formation of heterocyclic structure products such as pyrrole pyrazine and furan chen et al 2019 meanwhile these newly formed heteroatom containing heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazine and furan also pose new queries regarding the biodegradability of organic matters after thermal hydrolysis process is performed xps was applied to further confirm the chemical structure transformation of n element in mrps fig s1 the n1s spectrum of lysine centralized at 400 4 ev which corresponded to protein n while the mrps were divided into three peaks suggesting that the amino group of lysine changed into pyrazinic n 398 3 ev pyridinic n 399 5 ev and cn c 401 5 ev uv vis spectra and fluorescence spectra were proved effective in quantitatively assessing the extent of maillard reactions the uv vis absorption spectra of mrps show a significant uv quenching characteristic which intensifies with the prolongation of heating time fig s2 consistent with the previous studies chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the enhanced uv absorption peak intensity was attributed to the generation of an increasing number of conjugated structures in the maillard reaction in mrp products for example π electrons in the aromatic structure of pyrazine and furan can be excited by ultraviolet light to jump to π antibonding orbitals accordingly a red shift from 202 nm to 216 nm was also observed because the newly formed conjugated structures reduced the energy required for electron to transition in ultraviolet light the 3d eem profiles show that two distinct fluorescence peaks λex em 365 440 nm and λex em 230 450 nm intensified with thp time fig s3 indicating the formation of melanoidins which are brown pigment substances morales and salvio 2001 dwyer et al 2009 figure s4 further confirmed that the liquid color changed from white to brown with heating time the development of fluorescence was associated with the polymerization and polycondensation reaction in the final stage of the maillard reaction morales and salvio 2001 the molecular weight distribution data also identified the macromolecular substances generated by polymerization and polycondensation fig s5 the peak at 50 da may be attributed to the small molecule ketone produced by the strecker degradation in the maillard reaction fig s5 also notable there is toasted aroma gradually produced during this process data not shown uv quenching ability aroma and color are three distinct characteristics of the maillard reaction a non enzymatic browning reaction cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 3 2 influence of mrps on the enzyme activity of lysozyme as shown in fig 1 a the enzyme activity of lysozyme gradually decreased by 31 from 503 u mg to 345 u m with an increase to 2 for the mass ratio of mrps to lysozyme this suggests that the mrps inhibit the catalytic activity of lysozyme with the addition of mrps the surface charge of lysozyme rapidly decreased fig 1b indicating that the mrps have affinity to lysozyme through electrostatic interaction where the mrps is highly electronegative while the lysozyme is positively charged bekedam et al 2007 the specific interactions of mrps and enzyme were explored in the following sections 3 3 interaction of mrps lysozyme 3 3 1 fluorescence quenching of mrps lysozyme fluorescence quenching is direct evidence to provide some characterization about molecular interactions if fluorophores in organic matter are involved in reactions two distinct fluorescence peaks at ex em 275 340 nm peak a and ex em 225 340 nm peak b were detected in the 3d eem profile of lysozyme which was attributed to the presence of tryptophan trp and tyrosine tyr in lysozyme fig 2 a after the addition of mrps the fluorescence intensity of peak a and peak b decreased from 1225 and 1030 a u to 859 and 743 a u respectively showing a significant fluorescence quenching effect fig 2b a variety of mechanisms exist which lead to fluorescence quenching such as excited state reaction molecular rearrangement energy transfer ground state complex formation and collision quenching liang et al 2016 all of these mechanisms may affect the enzyme function of proteins quenching titration was applied to quantitatively investigate fluorescence quenching types of the mrps lysozyme system including diffusion controlled dynamic quenching and chemical static quenching generally these two quenching types were distinguished by the quenching rate constant kq diffusion controlled dynamic quenching kq 2 0 1010 l mol s is associated with the interactive collision of molecules while chemical static quenching kq 2 0 1010 l mol s attributes to the coordination between quencher and biomacromolecule xu et al 2020 the stern volmer plots of f0 f shows a good linear correlation between f0 f and mass concentration g l fig 2c it is already known that the average lifetime of a tryptophan related chromophore is 5 10 9 s shou et al 2018 since mrps are complex mixtures the exact molality cannot be determined we calculated the theoretical molecular weight of mrps according to the critical kq 2 0 1010 l mol s the maximum theoretical molecular weight was 43 2 da and 32 9 da based on fluorescence quenching of peak a and b respectively table s2 and s3 far less than the actual molecular weight of the mrps fig s5 this implied that a static quenching occurred in the interaction and mrps lysozyme coordination was formed the ksv for tyrosine and tryptophan were 4 08 l g and 3 83 l g based on stern volmer plots furthermore fig 2 d shows a pair of strong linear correlations between log f0 f f and log q the number of bonding site index n were 0 27 and 0 25 for trp and tyr which were both far from 1 0 indicating the coordination between mrps and lysozyme is a multi site combination pyrazine derivatives in mrps have been found to strongly quench protein fluorescence through π π stacking with aromatic functional groups in protein shen et al 2019 it has been reported that aromatic compounds like pyrazine could interact with proteins and lead to a static quenching according to the thermodynamic parameter of the pyrazine bsa system ma et al 2019 uv vis spectra of the mrps lysozyme system also showed a red shift from 196 nm to 202 nm with the increase in dosage of the mrps fig s7 suggesting that the stacking of conjugated structures in mrps and lysozyme may reduce the energy required for electron excitation in the conjugated system in addition previous literature also reported that pyrazien may bind with hydrophobic groups of protein implying that the hydrophobic effect cannot be ignored shen et al 2019 the hydrodynamic diameter decreased and reached a minimum at 625 nm when the mrps concentration was 120 mg l fig s8 the smaller particle size could explain the enhancement of the molecular binding in the presence of both mrps and lysozyme 3 3 2 secondary structure changes of protein a cd spectrum can be used to detect the changes in secondary structures of protein the α helical proteins had two negative peaks at 208 nm n π transition and 222 nm π π transition while β sheet showed one negative peak at 218 nm banerjee and sheet 2017 as shown in the cd spectra fig 3 a the α helix of proteins gradually decreased with the addition of maillard products indicating the mrps lysozyme interaction altered the conformation of protein molecules previous study also reported that secondary structure components of protein changed after binding with macromolecule such as humic substances tan et al 2009 the π π stacking and hydrogen bond of mrps and lysozyme results in structural changes in the protein leading to increased hydrophobicity of lysozyme in addition the hydrophobic interactions between organic matter molecules could further contribute to changes in protein structure takekiyo et al 2009 to better understand the protein structure changes in the mrps lysozyme complex the protein amide i band from 1700 to 1600 cm 1 were characterized by infrared self deconvolution with second derivative resolution and curve fitting xu et al 2020 fig 3b showed the fitted curve of amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 in lysozyme and mrps lysozyme complex while amide i band in the lysozyme and its complex contained aggregated strands 1625 1610 cm 1 β sheets 1640 1630 cm 1 α helices 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turn helices 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheets 1695 1680 cm 1 table s5 the proportion of α helices decreased which aligns with the results from cd spectra a decrease in α helix content of proteins represents a loose molecular structure and therefore inner hydrophobic groups were more easily exposed to express the hydrophobic property jiang et al 2015 this result suggests a significant increase of lysozyme hydrophobicity it is also worth noting that changes in protein structure could significantly affect normal biological function of a protein as an enzyme vertegel et al 2004 the hydrophobicity evaluated by the bpb method showed that more bpb was bound to the lysozyme after the addition of the mrps fig s10 indicating the exposure of more hydrophobic sites in lysozyme these hydrophobic sites occupied by bpb suggested that the hydrophobic interaction between lysozyme and mrps did not develop 3 3 3 thermodynamic behavior of lysozyme mrps interaction using itc itc was used to study the interaction between proteins and small molecular components which provides important diagnostic insights concerning the molecular forces involved in the binding process pierce et al 1999 an iterative nonlinear least square regression method for a multi site model was used to calculate thermodynamic parameters of the mrps lysozyme interaction such thermodynamic parameters include binding enthalpies δh entropies δs and gibbs free energy δg the δh of mrps lysozyme is negative indicating that the binding reaction is exothermic fig s11 the values of δs and δg were also calculated table 1 which could potentially provide worthwhile insights into the type and magnitude of the molecular forces involved in the binding process the results show that there were three sites in the mrps lysozyme interaction the positive δs occurs because the water molecules that are arranged in an orderly type around the protein acquire a more random configuration this is a result of the second structure changes and the enhancement of molecular hydrophobicity of proteins the negative δg value suggested that the interaction process was spontaneous the itc analysis illustrated that the mrps bound to high affinity sites on the lysozyme and successfully formed unremarkably stable mrps lysozyme complexes 3 3 4 theoretical calculation of lysozyme mrps interaction dft calculations identified the molecular mechanisms of reaction between typical aromatic heterocyclic structures in mrps such as 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and 2 5 dimethyl pyrazine and amino acids with aromatic rings in lysozyme such as tryptophan and tyrosine based on the 3d eem results we used tryptophan and tyrosine to model enzymes the conformations of pyrazine trp pyrazine tyr furan trp and furan tyr were optimized an independent gradient model igm analysis was used to describe the intermolecular non covalent interactions shown in fig 4 the color between the molecules varying from green to blue indicated an increased interaction of molecular forces because of its high electronegativity the n atoms on the pyrazine ring have a strong induction effect of electron withdrawing i effect in addition the conjugative effect of electron withdrawing c effect of the n atoms on the pyrazine conjugate ring also increases the electron cloud density on n atoms this makes them prone to form stable hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms of the amino acids that are attached to n fig 4a and b the electron cloud density of the hydrogen atom attached to n in amino acids is relatively low due to the i effect of n which produces a high ability to form hydrogen bonds with pyrazine n at the same time the aromatic pyrazine ring could interact with the benzene ring in amino acids through parallel dislocated aromatic stacking fig 4a and t shaped vertical stacking fig 4b both stacking effects undoubtedly further enhanced the interaction between the two rings the pyrazine ring could also be stacked with tyrosine through a separate parallel dislocated aromatic stacking fig 4c similarly carbonyl o atoms in furfural were also prone to form hydrogen bonds because of its c and i effects and the hydrogen bond could coexist with parallel dislocated aromatic stacking fig 4d t shaped vertical or parallel dislocated aromatic stacking alone can also maintain the interaction of furfural with tryptophan and tyrosine fig 4e and f therefore it can be concluded that hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking can be developed in rich form between the mrps and lysozyme 3 3 5 interaction mechanisms of mrps and proteins due to the aromaticity of typical heterocyclic rings such as pyrazine and furan in mrps and the high electron cloud density of heterocyclic atoms n o the mrps could bind to proteins through aromatic stacking and h bond at some suitable spatial locations the aromatic stack and the h bond between the molecules could coexist resulting in higher binding strength the combination of mrps and aromatic functional groups in protein resulted in the fluorescence quenching of protein at the same time the combination with the mrps may lead to changes in the polarity of protein residues unfortunately this may also lead to the destruction of hydrogen bonds within the protein molecules and the gradual expansion of secondary structures α helix and β sheet the unfolded proteins showed additional hydrophobic sites however mrps did not bind to proteins through hydrophobicity possibly due to the greater binding strength of the h bond and aromatic stacking rather than a hydrophobic interaction with the accumulation of secondary structure changes the proteins could not function properly as enzymes 3 4 environmental implications the highly recalcitrant mrps produced during sludge thermal hydrolysis play an inhibitory role in the biodegradability of sludge organic fraction besides the non biodegradability of these recalcitrant substances enables them to remain stable through the biochemical processes they undergo from ad immediately following sludge thermal hydrolysis to side stream nitrogen removal process of digested sludge supernatant and finally uv disinfection and eventually also allows them to be discharged into the environment where they can persist for a long period ivarson and benzing purdie 1987 these recalcitrant chemicals in mrps might show biotoxicity since they can interact with proteins through non covalent binding and induce proteins to lose their enzymatic structure li et al 2019a 2019b xu et al 2020 it is imperative that the life paths of the mrps are specifically identified and that their impact on the biochemical processes involved is further clarified the mitigation techniques for mrps in sludge thermal hydrolysis process need to be specifically considered in order to improve subsequent biochemical efficiency and therefore prevents mrps from entering into the environment 4 conclusion the presence of mrps inhibited the activity of extracellular lysozyme significant fluorescence quenching indicated the interaction between mrps and lysozyme thermodynamic characteristics showed that the mrps lysozyme reaction is a spontaneous exothermic process further spectroscopic analysis showed that the decrease of enzyme activity was related to the changes in secondary structure of the enzyme protein dft simulations suggested that aromatic structures with polar n atoms allow mrps to interact strongly with proteins through aromatic stacking and h bond simultaneously resulting in structural changes of proteins considering the interaction of mrps and extracellular enzymes further efforts concerning the effect of mrps on

16567,thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp is often used to improve the anaerobic digestion performance of waste activated sludge was in wastewater treatment plants wwtps during the thp process the proteins and polysaccharides in the biomass will undergo hydrolysis and maillard reaction producing biorefractory organic substances such as recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen rdon and melanoidins in this study a series of spectroscopy methods were used to quantitatively analyze the maillard reaction of glucose and lysine and the interaction mechanisms of the maillard reaction products mrps and lysozyme were investigated results showed that the typical aromatic heterocyclic structures in mrps such as pyrazine and furan were found to quench molecular fluorescence of lysozyme resulting in an unfolding of standard protein structure and increase in lysozyme hydrophobicity significant loss of enzyme activity was detected during this process thermodynamic parameters obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry itc confirmed that the interaction between mrps and lysozyme occurred both exothermically and spontaneously density functional theory dft calculations suggested that the molecular interactions of mrps and protein included parallel dislocation aromatic stacking t shaped vertical aromatic stacking h bond and h bond coupled to aromatic stacking graphical

the increasing amount of was from wwtps pose a true environmental challenge as urbanization expands for the future peccia and westerhoff 2015 ebner et al 2015 vassilev and vassileva 2016 de schouwer et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 considering the rich organic components and nutrient in was the reuse of was as a renewable resource is the ultimate way to proceed in accordance with the concept of sustainable urban development zhao et al 2014 azevedo et al 2019 cho and kim 2019 ngan et al 2019 situmorang et al 2020 the hydrothermal technology has drawn wide attention in recent years because it can effectively enhance the potential value of was as a resource zhao et al 2014 torri et al 2017 hamzah et al 2019 for the past few years thp has primarily been used as a pretreatment to improve anaerobic digestion ad efficiency in the engineering field li et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 such processes are known to effectively improve the bioavailability of organic matter recently more attention has been paid to the effect of organic matter conversion in sludge during thp on the ad process as thp is widely used as a pretreatment for the ad process chen et al 2019 yin et al 2019 usman et al 2019 2020 hao et al 2020 thp can intensify hydrolysis of the macro biopolymers in was and increase the methane production of ad but the possible negative effects of thp also should be considered such as formation of biorefractory by products zhang et al 2020 particular concerns include the recalcitrant nitrogen containing organic compounds with dark color produced in the was thp process and their poor biodegradability zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 these recalcitrant compounds when placed in sludge treated by thermal hydrolysis were resistant to conversion by ad microorganisms usman et al 2020 an additional number of studies further reported the identification of products from biopolymer conversion after sludge thp processing and all studies noted the emergence of molecules of heterocyclic amines furans aldehydes and ketones chen et al 2019 hao et al 2020 usman et al 2020 furthermore all those molecules were identified as typical organic structures from maillard reaction zhang et al 2020 besides it has already been reported that the addition of melanoidins produced by food waste fw hydrothermal treatment inhibited the acidification process during anaerobic digestion of fw yin et al 2019 as recalcitrant organic compounds maillard reaction products mrps are known for poor microbial degradability and adverse biological effects beyond a certain concentration including genotoxicity cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity chandra et al 2008 wang et al 2011 which allows them to persist in the environment ivarson and benzing purdie 1987 this means that the recalcitrant chemicals in mrps will not only affect the efficiency of ad but the undegraded mrps in ad sludge dewatering filtrate also enter the subsequent wastewater biological treatment and uv disinfection unit dwyer et al 2008a 2009 as these recalcitrant mrps were found to strongly quench uv light and inhibit the side stream nitrogen removal process such as anammox and nitrification gu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 for example dwyer et al 2008b has reported an 18 decrease of uv transmission from 59 1 3 to 41 0 8 and a 50 increase of average effluent organic nitrogen content from 1 8 0 17 mg l 1 to 2 8 0 14 mg l 1 based on the historical data from the 16th june 2006 through to the 28th december 2007 of oxley creek wwtp australia after commissioning the sludge thp process 140 165 c 2 6 6 bar 30 min despite the increasing number of research publications reporting the adverse effects of the mrps the study of the maillard reaction in the field of wastewater treatment is still in its early stage enzymatic reactions play an essential role in environmental biological processes such as ad bano et al 2017 but how those recalcitrant heterocyclic compounds in mrps interact with proteins and inhibit enzyme driven biodegradation reactions is still unclear hellwig et al 2016 in general molecules with a rich functional group structure can interact with proteins through non covalent interactions resulting in changes in the secondary structure of proteins xu et al 2020 structural changes in proteins may in turn lead to a reduction in their enzymatic activities chen et al 2016 martinez gonzalez et al 2017 report shows that humic acid as another example binds to enzymes and inhibits enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis reactions huang et al 2021 interaction mechanisms like electrostatic force covalent bond and sweep flocculation were suggested li et al 2019a 2019b as a newly identified issue an in depth understanding of the mechanisms of mrps enzyme interaction is essential to ensure a sustainable application of thp in wastewater sludge treatment in this study we investigated the effects of mrps on the enzymatic function of proteins the interaction mechanism of lysozyme and template mrps prepared with glucose and lysine were investigated by multi spectroscopic methodologies including the fluorescence quenching analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometry and circular dichromatic cd spectrum the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction including enthalpy δh entropy δs and gibbs free energy δg were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry itc dft was used to further verify the rationality of the molecular reaction mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 mrps preparation reagents used in the experiment are shown in text s1 in supporting information si a 1 1 mixture of glucose 10 g l and lysine 10 g l as the most basic precursor of maillard reaction was heated to prepare template mrps in a stainless steel hydrothermal reactor cämmerer and kroh 1995 considering that the maillard reaction does not require high temperatures a mild thermal hydrolysis temperature 100 c was selected to avoid side reactions such as caramelization and deamination at the same time a long heating time 2 h ensures the adequate processing of the maillard reaction uv vis spectra and molecular weight distribution of mrps were evaluated see in text s2 mrps samples 0 min and 120 min for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed using a thermo fisher kalpha spectrometer with an al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev the n 1 s o 1 s and c1s core levels were deconvoluted into subcomponents by xpspeak 4 1 the organic species of template mrps were further analyzed through a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms and the detailed information can be seen in text s2 in si 2 2 procedure for mrps lysozyme interaction specifically a wide range of concentrations of mrps 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 120 mg l were titrated into dissolved lysozyme solution 50 mg l followed by a 160 rpm stirring for 20 min at 25 c the changes in enzyme activity zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter were determined immediately after the batch experiment enzyme activity was assessed by measuring the degradation rate of peptidoglycan on the micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall ml sigma aldrich by lysozyme over a fixed period of time as the lysozyme can attack the peptidoglycans in the cell walls causing a decrease in the suspension absorbance at wavelength 450 nm the detailed information can be seen in text s3 zeta potential was measured on a zetasizer 3000 malvern instruments uk hydrodynamic diameter was determined in triplicate by using a malvern zetasizer nano zs instruments worcestershire united kingdom operating with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and a detection angle of 90 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined with microtitrimetry were used to quantitatively explore the mrps lysozyme interaction see in text s4 next the obtained results were fitted with the stern volmer model to determine the quenching type changes in the hydrophobicity of lysozyme mrps and their complex were evaluated by their binding ability with hydrophobic chromophore bromophenol blue bpb chelh et al 2006 the cd and ftir spectra were applied to obtain the information about the changes in protein secondary structures see in text s2 the thermodynamic properties of the mrps lysozyme interaction were obtained by an itc experiment see in text s5 2 3 quantum chemical calculations dft was employed for the intermolecular interaction stimulation using the gaussian 16 software and the detail procedure is given as text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of glucose lysine mrps the maillard reaction has been demonstrated its performance as a non negligible side effect in sludge thermal hydrolysis process since the typical thp conditions e g 165 c for 30 min overlap with that of the maillard reaction in our previous study a three stage pathway of the maillard reaction under sludge hydrothermal condition were proposed wang et al 2021 in general the intense hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides at high temperature exposes abundant free amino and aldehyde groups to initiate the hydroxyl condensation of the maillard reaction resulting in the formation of schiff base and amadori products enolization reaction is followed to form furan intermediate accompanied by side reaction generating heterocyclic such as pyrazine furan intermediates are further polymerized to form macromolecular colored substances with the prolongation of heating time since mrps is a complex mixture it is not feasible to separate mrps from the heterogeneous sludge colloid system after thermal hydrolysis lysine and glucose were used in this study to prepare template mrps as lysine is the most abundant amino acid in sludge and has high maillard reaction activity organic species including furan pyrazines pyrrole pyridine ketones and phenols in the template mrps were detected by gc ms table s1 which were identified as characteristic products of the maillard reaction other studies also identified the soluble products following the sludge thp and confirmed the formation of heterocyclic structure products such as pyrrole pyrazine and furan chen et al 2019 meanwhile these newly formed heteroatom containing heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazine and furan also pose new queries regarding the biodegradability of organic matters after thermal hydrolysis process is performed xps was applied to further confirm the chemical structure transformation of n element in mrps fig s1 the n1s spectrum of lysine centralized at 400 4 ev which corresponded to protein n while the mrps were divided into three peaks suggesting that the amino group of lysine changed into pyrazinic n 398 3 ev pyridinic n 399 5 ev and cn c 401 5 ev uv vis spectra and fluorescence spectra were proved effective in quantitatively assessing the extent of maillard reactions the uv vis absorption spectra of mrps show a significant uv quenching characteristic which intensifies with the prolongation of heating time fig s2 consistent with the previous studies chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the enhanced uv absorption peak intensity was attributed to the generation of an increasing number of conjugated structures in the maillard reaction in mrp products for example π electrons in the aromatic structure of pyrazine and furan can be excited by ultraviolet light to jump to π antibonding orbitals accordingly a red shift from 202 nm to 216 nm was also observed because the newly formed conjugated structures reduced the energy required for electron to transition in ultraviolet light the 3d eem profiles show that two distinct fluorescence peaks λex em 365 440 nm and λex em 230 450 nm intensified with thp time fig s3 indicating the formation of melanoidins which are brown pigment substances morales and salvio 2001 dwyer et al 2009 figure s4 further confirmed that the liquid color changed from white to brown with heating time the development of fluorescence was associated with the polymerization and polycondensation reaction in the final stage of the maillard reaction morales and salvio 2001 the molecular weight distribution data also identified the macromolecular substances generated by polymerization and polycondensation fig s5 the peak at 50 da may be attributed to the small molecule ketone produced by the strecker degradation in the maillard reaction fig s5 also notable there is toasted aroma gradually produced during this process data not shown uv quenching ability aroma and color are three distinct characteristics of the maillard reaction a non enzymatic browning reaction cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 3 2 influence of mrps on the enzyme activity of lysozyme as shown in fig 1 a the enzyme activity of lysozyme gradually decreased by 31 from 503 u mg to 345 u m with an increase to 2 for the mass ratio of mrps to lysozyme this suggests that the mrps inhibit the catalytic activity of lysozyme with the addition of mrps the surface charge of lysozyme rapidly decreased fig 1b indicating that the mrps have affinity to lysozyme through electrostatic interaction where the mrps is highly electronegative while the lysozyme is positively charged bekedam et al 2007 the specific interactions of mrps and enzyme were explored in the following sections 3 3 interaction of mrps lysozyme 3 3 1 fluorescence quenching of mrps lysozyme fluorescence quenching is direct evidence to provide some characterization about molecular interactions if fluorophores in organic matter are involved in reactions two distinct fluorescence peaks at ex em 275 340 nm peak a and ex em 225 340 nm peak b were detected in the 3d eem profile of lysozyme which was attributed to the presence of tryptophan trp and tyrosine tyr in lysozyme fig 2 a after the addition of mrps the fluorescence intensity of peak a and peak b decreased from 1225 and 1030 a u to 859 and 743 a u respectively showing a significant fluorescence quenching effect fig 2b a variety of mechanisms exist which lead to fluorescence quenching such as excited state reaction molecular rearrangement energy transfer ground state complex formation and collision quenching liang et al 2016 all of these mechanisms may affect the enzyme function of proteins quenching titration was applied to quantitatively investigate fluorescence quenching types of the mrps lysozyme system including diffusion controlled dynamic quenching and chemical static quenching generally these two quenching types were distinguished by the quenching rate constant kq diffusion controlled dynamic quenching kq 2 0 1010 l mol s is associated with the interactive collision of molecules while chemical static quenching kq 2 0 1010 l mol s attributes to the coordination between quencher and biomacromolecule xu et al 2020 the stern volmer plots of f0 f shows a good linear correlation between f0 f and mass concentration g l fig 2c it is already known that the average lifetime of a tryptophan related chromophore is 5 10 9 s shou et al 2018 since mrps are complex mixtures the exact molality cannot be determined we calculated the theoretical molecular weight of mrps according to the critical kq 2 0 1010 l mol s the maximum theoretical molecular weight was 43 2 da and 32 9 da based on fluorescence quenching of peak a and b respectively table s2 and s3 far less than the actual molecular weight of the mrps fig s5 this implied that a static quenching occurred in the interaction and mrps lysozyme coordination was formed the ksv for tyrosine and tryptophan were 4 08 l g and 3 83 l g based on stern volmer plots furthermore fig 2 d shows a pair of strong linear correlations between log f0 f f and log q the number of bonding site index n were 0 27 and 0 25 for trp and tyr which were both far from 1 0 indicating the coordination between mrps and lysozyme is a multi site combination pyrazine derivatives in mrps have been found to strongly quench protein fluorescence through π π stacking with aromatic functional groups in protein shen et al 2019 it has been reported that aromatic compounds like pyrazine could interact with proteins and

system in addition previous literature also reported that pyrazien may bind with hydrophobic groups of protein implying that the hydrophobic effect cannot be ignored shen et al 2019 the hydrodynamic diameter decreased and reached a minimum at 625 nm when the mrps concentration was 120 mg l fig s8 the smaller particle size could explain the enhancement of the molecular binding in the presence of both mrps and lysozyme 3 3 2 secondary structure changes of protein a cd spectrum can be used to detect the changes in secondary structures of protein the α helical proteins had two negative peaks at 208 nm n π transition and 222 nm π π transition while β sheet showed one negative peak at 218 nm banerjee and sheet 2017 as shown in the cd spectra fig 3 a the α helix of proteins gradually decreased

ivarson and benzing purdie 1987 these recalcitrant chemicals in mrps might show biotoxicity since they can interact with proteins through non covalent binding and induce proteins to lose their enzymatic structure li et al 2019a 2019b xu et al 2020 it is imperative that the life paths of the mrps are specifically identified and that their impact on the biochemical processes involved is further clarified the mitigation techniques for mrps in sludge thermal hydrolysis process need to be specifically considered in order to improve subsequent biochemical efficiency and therefore prevents mrps from entering into the environment 4 conclusion the presence of mrps inhibited the activity of extracellular lysozyme significant fluorescence quenching indicated the interaction between mrps and lysozyme thermodynamic characteristics showed that the mrps lysozyme reaction is a spontaneous exothermic process further spectroscopic analysis showed that the decrease of enzyme activity was related to the changes in secondary structure of the enzyme protein dft simulations suggested that aromatic structures with polar n atoms allow mrps to interact strongly with proteins through aromatic stacking and h bond simultaneously resulting in structural changes of proteins considering the interaction of mrps and extracellular enzymes further efforts concerning the effect of mrps on

16568,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a key n2 producing process in the global nitrogen cycle major progress in understanding the core mechanism of anammox bacteria has been made but our knowledge of the survival strategies of anammox bacteria in complex ecosystems such as full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps remains limited here by combining metagenomics with in situ metatranscriptomics complex anammox driven nitrogen cycles in an anoxic tank and a granular activated carbon gac biofilm module of a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate were constructed four distinct anammox metagenome assembled genomes mags representing a new genus named ca loosdrechtii a new species in ca kuenenia a new species in ca brocadia and a new strain in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis were simultaneously retrieved from the gac biofilm metabolic reconstruction revealed that all anammox organisms highly expressed the core metabolic enzymes and showed a high metabolic versatility pathways for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra coupled to volatile fatty acids vfas oxidation likely assist anammox bacteria to survive unfavorable conditions and facilitate switches between lifestyles in oxygen fluctuating environments the new ca kuenenia species dominated the anammox community of the gac biofilm specifically may be enhanced by the uniquely encoded flexible ammonium and iron acquisition strategies the new ca brocadia species likely has an extensive niche distribution that is simultaneously established in the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm the two distinct niches the highly diverse and impressive metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria revealed in this study advance our understanding of the survival and application of anammox bacteria in the full scale wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox metabolic versatility biofilm oxygen vfas dnra 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria mediate a key step in the biological nitrogen cycle and have been applied worldwide for energy efficient inorganic nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater anammox provides a short cut in the nitrogen cycle and offers sustainable solutions to the problems associated with the nitrification denitrification process in terms of lower aeration costs lower biomass production lower greenhouse gas emissions is a powerful technology to address energy autarky and reduce carbon footprints in wastewater treatment kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the discovery of this unique metabolism and subsequent translation to full scale applications represents one of the most rapid biotechnological advances in nitrogen removal from wastewater ali et al 2020 guo et al 2016 li et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2020b 2020c zhao et al 2019 the anammox process is mediated by a monophyletic group of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria within the planctomycetes strous et al 1999 to date distinct candidate genera of anammox bacteria including ca scalindua ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca anammoxoglobus and ca jettenia were consecutively identified kartal et al 2007b kuypers et al 2003 quan et al 2008 schmid et al 2000 strous et al 1999 2006 all of which were firstly identified from wastewater treatment plants wwtps or lab scale bioreactors only except for the marine ca scalindua but the enrichment and application of ca scalindua in a membrane bioreactor for treating moderate saline wastewater has been well studied ali et al 2020 in the anammox process nitrite reacts with ammonium yielding energy for chemolithoautotrophic growth and releasing dinitrogen gas nh4 no2 n2 2h2o which mainly takes place in the anammoxosome de almeida et al 2015 a specialized intracellular prokaryotic organelle the anammoxosome contains the vast majority of cellular iron in the form of cofactors within fe s proteins and multi heme cytochromes kartal and keltjens 2016 iron is essential for heme proteins known from numerous biochemical reactions electron shuttle gas sensing and gas transport in anammox bacteria ferousi et al 2017 kartal and keltjens 2016 each anammox cell was estimated to manage a pool of about 107 iron atoms which is much higher than the 105 to 106 iron atoms in an escherichia coli cell ferousi et al 2017 the high content of heme bound iron results in the bright red color of anammox enrichment cultures that iron availability has been identified as important for the success of anammox bacteria bi et al 2014 liu and ni 2015 research on anammox bacteria to date has not resulted in any classical pure cultures that based on the enrichment of anammox bacteria in laboratory bioreactors metagenomic sequencing together with biochemical analyses have been used to unravel the core metabolisms that hydrazine n2h4 and nitric oxide no were identified as volatile intermediates hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 the chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle of anammox bacteria was challenged that anammox bacteria are suggested much more versatile than initially assumed outside their core energy metabolism anammox bacteria was suggested using volatile fatty acids vfas as alternative electron donors to ammonium such as formate acetate and propionate for energy conservation with nitrite or nitrate as electron acceptors güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007b 2008 tao et al 2019 communities and metabolic diversities of anammox bacteria in diverse ecosystems such as oxygen minimum zone of the ocean lüke et al 2016 laboratory reactors with different configurations ali et al 2020 bhattacharjee et al 2017 hu et al 2012 speth et al 2012 van de vossenberg et al 2013 and granule and activated sludge of full scale wwtps speth et al 2016 yang et al 2020c have been extensively investigated using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics buoyant granular activated carbon gac could selectively adsorb hydrophobic protein and favor anammox bacteria attachment is an effective carrier for rapid anammox bacteria enrichment and application for wastewater treatment gu et al 2020 however efforts have seldom focused on applying whole community metagenomics to study anammox bacteria in full scale gac biofilm systems to this end metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses were performed on a gac biofilm model and an anoxic tank with observed red anammox granules in a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate complex nitrogen cycling networks in these two reactors carried out by the cooperation of different active microbial groups were constructed interestingly four high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags representing four distinct anammox organisms belonging to three anammox genera were retrieved from the gac biofilm the gene content of reconstructed genomes combined with metatranscriptomic data revealed a high metabolic versatility of the anammox bacterial community additionally a ca brocadia strain was simultaneously established in the gac biofilm and the anoxic tank its selective adaption strategies under different ecological niches were investigated the four distinct anammox organisms added here substantially extend the diversity of anammox bacteria and their impressive metabolic versatility advances our understanding of the application of anammox bacteria in the full scale engineered system 2 materials and methods 2 1 operational strategies of the wwtp the zentraldeponie emscherbruch zde wwtp next to the emscher river in herten germany was designed to treat landfill leachate the plant was primarily operated as a conventional activated sludge system two anoxic tanks and two aeration tanks 165 m3 of each tank with a conventional nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal processes to reduce the operation costs and increase nitrogen removal efficiency the plant was renovated from 2001 by adding four parallel ultrafiltration uf membranes pore diameter is 0 8 μm with a total surface area of 300 350 m2 and biofilm modules with 9 granular activated carbon gac reactors fig 1 the plant was renovated to remove ammonium through a two stage process in which part of ammonium was oxidized to nitrite by the activated sludge system the first stage and the remaining ammonium and oxidized nitrite were then transferred to nitrogen gas by anammox in the gac reactors under anaerobic condition the second stage to achieve cost effective nitrogen removal by anammox fresh anammox granules from other full scale plants and laboratory reactors were inoculated into the gac reactors together with activated carbon at the volume ratio of 1 100 to 1 10 the optimal specific surface area of applied gac was between 600 m2 g and 1800 m2 g the gac reactors were immediately filled with oxygen free wastewater to create an anaerobic condition after the inoculation of anammox granules to provide anammox bacteria sufficient substrates the nh4 n no2 n rate of the effluent of the first stage was kept at around 1 1 1 through controlling the air supply in the aeration tanks consequently anammox bacteria were successfully established and enriched in the gac reactors in which red anammox granules with diameters between 0 8 and 24 mm could be observed azari et al 2017 the main inflow rate of the plant was approximately 20 30 m3 h with a 1 6 3 0 h hydraulic retention time hrt the solid retention time srt of the activated sludge system was kept at around 5 5 6 days while srt for the gac biofilm modules was significantly long 50 days the air supply in the first aeration tank was 100 700 m3 h to maintain the do in wastewater at the range of 0 1 0 4 mg l the air supply in the second aeration tank was stopped from january 2017 a portion of wastewater was pumped back from the aeration tanks to the first anoxic tank at a maximum rate of 300 m3 h fig 1 retentate sludge produced by uf membranes was pumped back to the first anoxic tank at a rate of 200 380 m3 h fig 1 and the stream of permeate from uf was fed as influent for gac biofilm modules the operating temperature of the plant was always higher than 28 c fig 1 2 2 sampling nucleic acid extraction sequencing and data analysis samples in this study were collected from the zde wwtp in april 2018 activated sludge from the second anoxic tank where anammox bacteria had been previously observed and biofilm from one of the gac reactors were collected samples for dna isolation were stored at 20 c and samples for rna isolation were preserved on site in lifeguard soil preservation solution qiagen germany dna and rna extraction sequencing de novo metagenomic assembly and binning were previously described yang et al 2020c the completeness and level of contamination of all acquired mags were estimated using checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 gtdb tk v1 3 0 chaumeil et al 2019 was used to classify mags based on the genome database taxonomy gtdb r202 parks et al 2020 open reading frames orfs from metagenomic assemblies scaffolds and mags were predicted by prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 trimmed metagenomic reads were mapped to the metagenomic assemblies using bowtie2 v2 2 9 ben and steven 2012 to calculate the genome abundance as tpm ribosomal rna rrna reads were identified and removed from metatranscriptomic datasets using sortmerna version 2 1 kopylova et al 2012 against the silva 132 database and the default databases non rrna metatranscriptomic reads were mapped to predicted orfs using bwa v0 7 17 li and durbin 2009 to calculate the genome wide gene transcription as tpm to compare the genome wide gene transcription of ca brocadia sp yc2 in both activated sludge and biofilm gene transcription indicated by tpm was normalized by genome abundance 2 3 overall nitrogen cycle construction and anammox bacterial mag annotation orfs from metagenomic assemblies were searched by blastp against the previously constructed custom databases of nitrogen cycle related genes yang et al 2020c with e value 10 10 blast hits with amino acid identities 60 and minimum alignment lengths 50 were considered as the nitrogen cycle related genes the overall nitrogen cycles in the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm were constructed based on the functional gene transcription of each pathway qualities of the obtained anammox mags were further improved through a reassembly using a previously described protocol yang et al 2020a the genomic content of anammox mags was analyzed by the microscope platform http www genoscope cns fr agc microscope they were further annotated by ghostkoala which is kegg s internal annotation tool for k number assignment of kegg genes using ssearch computation kanehisa et al 2016 beside the predicted orfs from anammox mags were also annotated by eggnog mapper huerta cepas et al 2017 and rapid annotation using subsystem technology rast overbeek et al 2014 potentially secreted proteins with the signal peptides were identified by signalp 4 1 signal blast and psortb frank and sippl 2008 thomas nordahl et al 2011 yu et al 2010 2 4 comparative genomic analyses average amino acid identities aais were calculated between the newly obtained anammox mags in this study and the known anammox genomes using comparem with the default setting https github com dparks1134 comparem unique genes of the new ca kuenenia species compared to the other three anammox mags recovered from the gac biofilm in this study and the other known ca kuenenia genomes were identified by reciprocal best blast altschul et al 1990 blast hits with an e value of 10 5 amino acid identities 50 and a minimum alignment length 50 were considered as the unique genes 2 5 phylogenetic analyses checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 was used to produce an alignment of 43 concatenated markers from all the obtained mags from both systems for phylogenetic analysis the alignment of 43 concatenated markers nearly full length 16s rrna gene and hzsa of the newly obtained anammox mags and the known anammox genomes completeness 50 contamination 10 were used for phylogenetic analysis ferric reductase fre recovered from anammox genomes and sequences of ferric reductase domain superfamily including fre and nadph oxidases nox summarized previously zhang et al 2013 were used for phylogenetic analysis all above single gene sequences were aligned by mafft yamada et al 2016 and gaps in the multiple sequence alignment were removed by trimal v1 2 with the setting gt 0 1 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 maximum likelihood trees were built using iq tree

visualized using itol letunic and bork 2019 2 6 data availability raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences have been submitted to ncbi under bioproject prjna526440 the four anammox mags obtained in this study are available in ncbi genbank under the accession number soer00000000 soeu00000000 soes00000000 and soes00000000 3 results and discussion 3 1 complex anammox driven nitrogen cycles the nitrogen removal performance of the activated sludge system two anoxic tanks followed by two aeration tanks and the gac biofilm modules were followed over more than a one year period before the time of sampling figs 1 s1 and s2 the main influent of the landfill leachate of the plant was rich in ammonium 758 mg l fig 1 up to 91 8 of ammonium removal efficiency was achieved by the activated sludge system and 5 4 of ammonium was oxidized to nitrite nitrate and discharged into the effluent fig 1 around 24 2 of the remaining ammonium 62 mg l 99 3 of the produced nitrite 27 mg l and 95 7 of the produced nitrate 14 mg l were subsequently removed by the gac biofilm modules equipped with anammox granules fig 1 the enrichment of anammox bacteria could be observed in the second anoxic tank and gac biofilm modules as red anammox granules shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of representative dna and rna samples from the second anoxic tank and a gac biofilm was carried out to obtain a genome scale view of the microbial communities and the anammox driven nitrogen cycles of these two distinct reactors after trimming and rrna removal metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of activated sludge sample from the anoxic tank produced 258 95 million dna and 58 68 million rrna free cdna reads respectively 251 60 million dna and 66 43 million rrna free cdna reads were obtained from the gac biofilm de novo assembly and binning of the metagenomic dna reads produced 155 and 198 mags from the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm respectively the processes carried out by microorganisms in both reactors related to the nitrogen cycle were constructed based on the in situ transcription of nitrogen cycle related genes fig 1b c high transcriptional activities of amo and hao genes suggest that aerobic ammonia oxidizing activity was much high in the anoxic condition fig 1b this process was mainly catalyzed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob specifically a nitrosomonas strain bin1 47 which was the top fourth most abundant organism in the anoxic tank and had a high genome wide transcriptional activity figs 2 a and s3a residual do from the influent wastewater and the returned post aerobic stage wastewater fig 1a likely allows nitrosomonas with a high affinity for oxygen to oxidize ammonia aerobic ammonia oxidation activity carried out by nitrosomonas bin1 170 was also detected in the anaerobic gac biofilm but the transcriptional levels of amo and hao were much lower than in the anoxic tank figs 1c and s3b aoa and comammox were not detected in either the anoxic tank or the gac biofilm it is likely that the high substrate affinity of comammox kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2020 and high organic carbon sensitivity of aoa gwak et al 2020 restricted their survival in this ammonium and cod rich system fig 1a the nxrabc genes of nob were not detected in the assemblies of either reactor and none of the obtained mags was closely related to known nob suggesting that the growth of nob was seriously inhibited by the high ammonium and the anoxic anaerobic conditions because of the high free ammonia sensitivity ushiki et al 2017 and low oxygen affinity guisasola et al 2005 laureni et al 2016 of nob anammox process was established in both reactors that central genes hzs hdh hox and nxr were highly transcribed fig 1b c and were found in four mags in the gac biofilm fig 2b and one mag in the anoxic tank fig 2a see below the transcriptional activities of central anammox metabolic genes in the gac biofilm were much stronger than in the anoxic tank fig 1b c likely reflecting a higher anammox activity in the gac biofilm the high transcriptional levels of denitrifying genes narg nirk s nor and nosz fig 1b indicated that the oxidized nox was rapidly reduced by denitrifiers in both reactors the high denitrifying activities were enabled by the high organics input fig 1a which served as the energy source for heterotrophic denitrifiers the high gene transcripts of nap nirb and nrfa in both reactors suggest that part of the oxidized nox was reduced to ammonium through the dnra process fig 1b c dnra bacteria are generally found in anoxic electron donor rich zones with a low nitrate availability van den berg et al 2015 the growth of dnra organisms could be stimulated by the anoxic conditions and high organics inputs in these two reactors fig 1a benefit from the high affinity for nitrate the dnra process has an advantage over denitrification under nitrate limiting conditions kraft et al 2014 anammox process was the main biological source of nitrate but only about 11 of total nitrogen is converted to nitrate that the available nitrate in both reactors was in low levels fig 1a which likely confers a selective advantage to the growth of dnra organisms in the competition with denitrifiers unlike anammox and nitrification denitrification and dnra were carried out by a diverse population around 50 80 mags and 15 24 mags of mags obtained from the anoxic tank contained at least one denitrification and dnra gene respectively fig 2a the coreresponding percentages in the gac biofilm were 42 84 mags and 12 25 mags fig 2b overall partial nitrification and denitrification were the dominant processes for effective nitrogen removal in the anoxic tank in which aerobic ammonia oxidization carried out by nitrosomonas likely served a key function in nitrogen removal by providing nitrite to denitrifiers and anammox bacteria fig 1a b in contrast anammox and denitrification dominated nitrogen removal in the gac biofilm which could efficiently convert the residual ammonium and the produced nox to n2 fig 1c 3 2 recovery of distinct anammox genomes four high quality completeness 94 contamination 5 anammox mags yc1 yc2 yc6 and yc7 were obtained from the gac biofilm table 1 fig 2b which accounted for 11 9 and 7 3 of all the metagenomic and non rrna metatranscriptomic reads mapped to all obtained mags respectively a ca brocadia mag bin1 171 was obtained from the anoxic tank fig 2a which had a 99 9 average nucleotide identity ani with mag yc2 and homologous genes predicted from these two mags share 100 identity illustrating they represent the same ca brocadia strain phylogenetic analyses of 43 concatenated markers fig 3 a 16s rrna genes fig 3c and hzsa fig s4 confirmed the placement of yc1 yc2 yc6 and yc7 into three different genera in the anammox cluster ani and 16s rrna gene based similarities further identified their lineages at the species level fig 3b d yc1 was identified as a new anammox genus and named ca loosdrechtii emscherensis in our recent study unpublished result yc7 was most similar ani 99 to ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes fig 3b which is larger than the proposed species cutoff ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 it thus was named ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis yc7 yc2 is related to ca brocadia but the highest ani 88 57 fig 3b and 16s rrna gene identity 97 74 fig 3d with other known ca brocadia strains are lower than the proposed species cutoffs ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 16s rrna gene identity 98 7 stackebrandt 2006 yarza et al 2014 it thus was named ca brocadia sp yc2 mag yc6 was assigned to ca kuenenia but it formed a separate clade with the other known ca kuenenia organisms in the phylogenetic trees figs 3a c and s4 furthermore the highest ani and 16s rrna gene identity between yc6 and the other known ca kuenenia genomes were 81 45 and 96 11 respectively fig 3b d which are lower than the proposed species cutoffs ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 16s rrna gene identity 98 7 stackebrandt 2006 yarza et al 2014 here we propose the name hertensis for this novel ca kuenenia species alluding to its discovery in herten wwtp thus was named ca kuenenia hertensis yc6 to our best knowledge all the known ca kuenenia organisms to date affiliate to ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis the identity of ca kuenenia hertensis in the current study substantially extend the phylogenetic diversity of the ca kuenenia genus 3 3 the much active central anammox metabolism hydrazine is the highly unusual and extremely reactive intermediate of the anammox process and hydrazine synthesis and oxidation are central for energy conservation in anammox bacteria kartal and keltjens 2016 consistent with the previous finding that anammox bacteria have to express the sluggish hzs at high levels to achieve appreciable metabolic activity kartal et al 2013 hzs were all highly expressed by the four anammox bacteria in the gac biofilm fig 4 it has been postulated that hzs receives electrons from a tetraheme c type cytochrome as a part of the electron transfer module etm ferousi et al 2019 which was conserved in these four anammox mags table s1 hydrazine oxidation is carried out by hdh a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao like protein akram et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2016 the hdh homologs were found in yc1 yc2 and yc7 with high in situ expression levels but not in the recovered part of yc6 fig 4 hydrazine oxidation could be catalyzed by kustc 1061 another hao like protein in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2011 kustc 1061 which also carried out hydroxylamine oxidation to no kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2014 is a dedicated hydroxylamine oxidizing protein hox that recycles the leaked out hydroxylamine from hzs back to no fig 4 and prevents the inhibition of hydroxylamine to hdh dietl et al 2015 maalcke et al 2014 the hox homolog could be found in yc1 yc6 and yc7 but not in the recovered part of yc2 fig 4 hox coding genes were highly transcribed by these three strains fig 4 verifying a central role of hox in anammox metabolism electrons required for nitrite reduction to no are most likely derived from nitrite oxidation catalyzed by nxr rather than the previously recognized hydrazine oxidation hu et al 2019 in agreement with the core physiological function of nitrite oxidation in the anammox process nxr coding genes were all highly transcribed by these four anammox organisms fig 4 hzs hdh and nxr are conserved throughout the known anammox organisms whereas nitrite reduction to no is catalyzed by distinct no generating nitrite reductases nir that are also found in other organisms kartal and keltjens 2016 known ca kuenenia and ca scalindua species encode cytochrome cd 1 nir nirs whereas ca jettenia species encode a copper containing nir nirk hira et al 2012 hu et al 2012 nir is absent in most of the ca brocadia genomes but a nirs was found in a ca brocadia genome which was obtained from a full scale wwtp yang et al 2020c nir genes were identified in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis yc7 and ca loosdrechtii emscherensis yc1 but not in the recovered parts of ca brocadia sp yc2 and ca kuenenia hertensis yc6 fig 4 similar to the low transcription of nirs in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 nir genes were very weakly transcribed by yc1 and yc7 fig 4 the hao like protein kustc0458 was proposed relate to nitrite reduction to no in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 consistently all four anammox mags encoded kustc0458 homologs table s1 which likely fulfill the function of nitrite reduction to no in anammox metabolism fig 4 3 4 vfas oxidation coupled with dnra process growth of anammox bacteria on acetate propionate and both acetate and propionate was shown for ca brocadia kartal et al 2008 ca anammoxoglobus kartal et al 2007b and ca jettenia tao et al 2019 enrichments respectively acetyl coa synthetases acs which catalyze the ligation of acetate with coa for acetyl coa production has been implicated in acetate oxidation by anammox bacteria russ et al 2012 a recent study suggested that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis is not capable of using acetate as a carbon or energy source despite the presence of acs lawson et al 2020 the propionate activation capability of an acs like protein kustc1128 found in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was verified through heterologous expression suggesting that propionate could be catalyzed by acs through propionate coa production russ et al 2012 in line with previous studies that reported at least three different acs encoded by each anammox genome kartal et al 2007b 2008 three to five acss were encoded and highly expressed by the four anammox organisms fig 4 table s1 the produced propionate coa by acs could be further transferred to acetyl coa through an α carboxylation reaction combined with the tca cycle plugge et al 1993 a complete α carboxylation pathway was encoded and expressed by all anammox organisms except for ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis yc7 fig 4 comparably the α carboxylation pathway mcc mce and mcm is also absent in all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes fig 5 b overall the ammonium and acetate propionate co oxidation capability likely helps anammox bacteria survive unfavorable conditions and facilitate switches between lifestyles in the eutrophic wastewater treatment system the oxidation of vfas could couple dnra processes by supplying anammox bacteria with ammonium ahmad et al 2021 ali et al 2020 güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007a lam et al 2009 wang et al 2021 winkler et al 2012 in anammox bacteria the first step of dnra nitrate reduction to nitrite was proposed to be catalyzed by nxr operating in the reverse kartal et al 2007a while a soluble ferredoxin dependent nitrate reductase narb associated with nitrate reduction was uniquely encoded by yc1 fig 4 pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfah which catalyzes the six electron reduction of nitrite into ammonium was observed in yc1 and yc2 whereas it was absent in the two ca kuenenia mags yc6 and yc7 fig 4 and all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes instead a putative calcium dependent multihaem nitrite reductase was proposed responsible for the nitrite reduction in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2007a cod nh4 n ratio plays an important role in governing the competition between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs in wastewater during the enrichment of amammox bacteria in the laboratory reactors the cod nh4 n ratio is usually lower than 2 0 because it was proposed that a high cod nh4 n ratio could allow a higher fraction of heterotrophic bacteria and reduce the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria cao et al 2017 although the cod nh4 n ratio in the influent of the gac biofilm modules is up to 15 0 fig 1 high diverse anammox bacteria successfully enriched in the gac biofilm with very high activities similarly a high influent cod nh4 n ratio 9 2 was reported in a full scale mainstream pn a process in austria in which a high proportion of anammox bacteria was enriched wett et al 2015 these findings suggest that the niche of anammox bacteria in practical applications in engineered systems can be much broader than generally assumed it is generally believed that anammox bacteria are protected by heterotrophs in the presence of high organics but the organotrophy alternative lifestyle allows them to deal with organics on their own and makes them more versatile in high organics environment than often expected 3 5 flexible ammonium and iron acquisition strategies type i glutamine synthetase gsi and fmn dependent glutamate synthase glts fmn associated with ammonium assimilation were encoded by the four anammox organisms except for the absence of gsi in the recovered part of yc7 and gene transcripts of both enzymes were all detected fig 4 yc6 contained an additional ammonium assimilation pathway a type iii glutamine synthetase gsiii and a nadph dependent glutamate synthase glts nadph were adjacently encoded figs 4 and 5 the gsiii coding gene was also found in all the known ca kuenenia genomes but the adjacent glts nadph is unique for yc6 which represents a new species in ca kuenenia fig 5b it has been reported that the expression of gsi and gsiii in the same organism is subjected to transcriptional regulation in response to changes in nitrogen availability that the gsiii is highly expressed only under ammonium deficiency amaya et al 2005 reyes et al 1997 the simultaneously encoded and highly expressed gsi and gsiii systems likely confer a selective advantage to yc6 over others for growth in fluctuating conditions fig 4 three feob homologs associated with fe ii transportation ferousi et al 2017 were simultaneously encoded and expressed by yc6 whereas only one feob was found in the other three anammox organisms fig 5a multiple feob likely confer a selective advantage to yc6 over others for iron competition but another two subunits of the feoabc system feoa and feoc associated with iron uptake enhancement were absent in these four mags which was also occurred in other anammox genomes ferousi et al 2017 the feoabc system was previously regarded as the only system for iron uptake by anammox bacteria ferousi et al 2017 whereas a tonb exbb exbd tee complex associated with fe iii uptake was found in these anammox organisms only except for the recovered part of the ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis mag yc7 fig 5a and it was consistently absent in the other known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes fig 5b anammox bacteria have been observed to couple formate oxidation to fe iii reduction outside the cell strous et al 2006 van de vossenberg et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 which likely act as a potential fe ii acquisition pathway through reducing fe iii another enzyme with great interest is a ferric reductase fre fig 4 the homolog of nadph oxidase associated with fe iii reduction shatwell et al 1996 which was uniquely encoded by yc6 among these four anammox organisms fig 5a and all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis strains fig 5b fer likely provides yc6 an additional source of fe ii through reducing the collected fe iii by the tee system zhang et al 2013 during periods of limited soluble fe ii availability nanosized diameter 16 25 nm iron rich particles were observed inside the anammoxosome of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis van niftrik et al 2008 which were speculated to be iron storage sites possibly formed by bacterioferritins bfrs ferousi et al 2017 in the model bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa bfr compartmentalizes iron at concentrations far above the solubility of fe iii and protects the reducing cell environment from unwanted fe iii fe ii redox cycling rivera 2017 it carries out the fe ii oxidation at ferroxidase centers using o2 and internalizes fe iii in the interior cavity for iron storage it also can reduce fe iii through the interaction with a ferredoxin to achieve iron mobilization rivera 2017 fig 4 nitrate dependent iron oxidation has shown that in anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2013 strous et al 2006 that nitrate is the most likely electron acceptor for fe ii oxidation carried out by bfr rather than o2 in the oxygen free anammoxosome bfr could be found in yc6 yc1 and all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis species figs 4 5a and b the in situ transcripts of bfrs were detected in both yc6 and yc1 fig 4 indicating a central role of bfr in iron storage and metabolism anammox bacteria rely heavily on iron containing proteins for energy conservation especially for the large amounts of heme c containing enzymes like hdh and hzs in the anammoxosome akram et al 2019 it was found that iron became the growth limiting nutrients when the nitrite concentration was increased beyond 20 mm during the enrichment of ca scalindua van de vossenberg et al 2008 anammox activity was significantly promoted by adding an appropriate amount of fe ii in the enrichment which increased the heme c levels within anammox cells and also improved hdh activity bi et al 2014 liu and ni 2015 the increase in the available iron concentration can accelerate the metabolism of anammox bacteria so that the flexible iron acquisition strategies likely confers a selective advantage to yc6 over others for iron competition in iron availability fluctuating conditions because of the crucial function of iron in the metabolism of anammox bacteria appropriate iron concentration has been regarded as a significant factor for the fast start up of the anammox process it was reported that the anammox activity and bacterial growth were enhanced by 0 09 and 0 12 mm fe ii while the anammox activity could be seriously inhibited by higher fe ii concentrations 0 75 mm ding et al 2020 a similar result was obtained from strain ca brocadia sinica that lower fe ii concentrations 0 06 0 08 mm could significantly increase the growth rate and the activity was suppressed by higher fe ii concentrations 0 08 mm shu et al 2016 therefore iron concentration should be a crucial monitoring and controlling parameter in practical anammox application for treating various sources of wastewater under different treatment strategies 3 6 extensive niche distribution of a ca brocadia species the ca brocadia sp yc2 was successfully established in both the anoxic tank and gac biofilm module the two distinct niches of the plant the anoxic tank is equipped as a conventional activated sludge system without aeration but the influent wastewater and the recycled wastewater from the aeration tank might bring trace amounts of oxygen to support the growth of some aerobic organisms with high oxygen affinity the gac biofilm module was an anaerobic system where gacs serve as biofilm carriers for the enrichment of anammox bacteria differently the concentration of bioavailable organics and ammonium in the influent of the anoxic tank was much higher than in the gac biofilm module while the cod nh4 n ratio was much higher in the influent of the gac biofilm module fig 1 the gac biofilm module had a much longer srt 50 days compared to the anoxic tanks 6 days that the slow growing anammox bacteria are more easily to be washed out from the anoxic tank of all the predicted genes in yc2 67 and 89 were detected in the metatranscriptomic datasets in the anoxic tank and gac biofilm samples respectively table s2 central genes related to the anammox process hzs hdh and nxr substrate transportation amt and fnt and ammonium assimilation gsi and glts fmn were all highly transcribed by yc2 in both reactors fig 6 hox related to hydroxylamine oxidation and nir related to nitrite reduction were absent in the recovered parts of yc2 in both reactors enzymes related to vfas acetate and propionate oxidation and reactive oxygen species detoxification like superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat had higher expression levels in the anoxic tank fig 6 which likely indicates a stronger aerobic oxidation activity in the anoxic condition feob related to fe ii collection was highly expressed by yc2 in both reactors while the expression activity of tee for fe iii acquisition was only detected in the gac reactor fig 6 the collected fe iii may serve as a crucial electron acceptor for anaerobic metabolism in the anaerobic biofilm the different genome wide gene transcriptional patterns of yc2 in the two distinct reactors might confer it selective adaption strategies under different ecological niches 4 conclusions and implications the metagenomic reconstruction of microbial mags derived from an anoxic tank and a gac biofilm module of a full scale wwtp combined with a metatranscriptomic analysis has revealed the complex nitrogen cycling networks in these two reactors carried out by the cooperation of different active microbial groups one and four anammox mags representing four distinct anammox organisms were derived from the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm respectively gene content of reconstructed mags combined with metatranscriptomic data revealed a substantial metabolic versatility and survival strategies of anammox organisms although the cod nh4 n ratio 15 0 of the influent of the gac biofilm modules was much higher than the expected optimal value 2 0 of laboratory reactor operation four distinct anammox organisms were successfully enriched and they seem to be very active concerning the central anammox metabolism for nitrogen removal anammox organisms can oxidize vfas coupled to the dnra process this organotrophy alternative lifestyle allows them to be more versatile under high organics environment and expands their ecological niche in the engineered systems than generally assumed in particular the flexible ammonium and iron acquisition strategies likely confer a selective advantage to ca kuenenia hertensis yc6 the second known ca kuenenia species to date over others under substrate fluctuating conditions is a remarkable addition to previous knowledge on anammox bacterial diversity and metabolism in particular iron concentration in wastewater should be regarded as a key parameter for the success of anammox because of the crucial function of iron in anammox metabolism the recoveries of four distinct anammox organisms with substantial metabolic versatility from the full scale system especially the identification of a new anammox genus and a new ca kuenenia species significantly extend the phylogenetic and functional diversity of anammox organisms future research efforts should focus on the enrichment and physiological characterization of representatives of these novel anammox organisms for example to provide special insights on optimal nitrogen removal from sewage in

16568,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a key n2 producing process in the global nitrogen cycle major progress in understanding the core mechanism of anammox bacteria has been made but our knowledge of the survival strategies of anammox bacteria in complex ecosystems such as full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps remains limited here by combining metagenomics with in situ metatranscriptomics complex anammox driven nitrogen cycles in an anoxic tank and a granular activated carbon gac biofilm module of a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate were constructed four distinct anammox metagenome assembled genomes mags representing a new genus named ca loosdrechtii a new species in ca kuenenia a new species in ca brocadia and a new strain in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis were simultaneously retrieved from the gac biofilm metabolic reconstruction revealed that all anammox organisms highly expressed the core metabolic enzymes and showed a high metabolic versatility pathways for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra coupled to volatile fatty acids vfas oxidation likely assist anammox bacteria to survive unfavorable conditions and facilitate switches between lifestyles in oxygen fluctuating environments the new ca kuenenia species dominated the anammox community of the gac biofilm specifically may be enhanced by the uniquely encoded flexible ammonium and iron acquisition strategies the new ca brocadia species likely has an extensive niche distribution that is simultaneously established in the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm the two distinct niches the highly diverse and impressive metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria revealed in this study advance our understanding of the survival and application of anammox bacteria in the full scale wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox metabolic versatility biofilm oxygen vfas dnra 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria mediate a key step in the biological nitrogen cycle and have been applied worldwide for energy efficient inorganic nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater anammox provides a short cut in the nitrogen cycle and offers sustainable solutions to the problems associated with the nitrification denitrification process in terms of lower aeration costs lower biomass production lower greenhouse gas emissions is a powerful technology to address energy autarky and reduce carbon footprints in wastewater treatment kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the discovery of this unique metabolism and subsequent translation to full scale applications represents one of the most rapid biotechnological advances in nitrogen removal from wastewater ali et al 2020 guo et al 2016 li et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2020b 2020c zhao et al 2019 the anammox process is mediated by a monophyletic group of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria within the planctomycetes strous et al 1999 to date distinct candidate genera of anammox bacteria including ca scalindua ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca anammoxoglobus and ca jettenia were consecutively identified kartal et al 2007b kuypers et al 2003 quan et al 2008 schmid et al 2000 strous et al 1999 2006 all of which were firstly identified from wastewater treatment plants wwtps or lab scale bioreactors only except for the marine ca scalindua but the enrichment and application of ca scalindua in a membrane bioreactor for treating moderate saline wastewater has been well studied ali et al 2020 in the anammox process nitrite reacts with ammonium yielding energy for chemolithoautotrophic growth and releasing dinitrogen gas nh4 no2 n2 2h2o which mainly takes place in the anammoxosome de almeida et al 2015 a specialized intracellular prokaryotic organelle the anammoxosome contains the vast majority of cellular iron in the form of cofactors within fe s proteins and multi heme cytochromes kartal and keltjens 2016 iron is essential for heme proteins known from numerous biochemical reactions electron shuttle gas sensing and gas transport in anammox bacteria ferousi et al 2017 kartal and keltjens 2016 each anammox cell was estimated to manage a pool of about 107 iron atoms which is much higher than the 105 to 106 iron atoms in an escherichia coli cell ferousi et al 2017 the high content of heme bound iron results in the bright red color of anammox enrichment cultures that iron availability has been identified as important for the success of anammox bacteria bi et al 2014 liu and ni 2015 research on anammox bacteria to date has not resulted in any classical pure cultures that based on the enrichment of anammox bacteria in laboratory bioreactors metagenomic sequencing together with biochemical analyses have been used to unravel the core metabolisms that hydrazine n2h4 and nitric oxide no were identified as volatile intermediates hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 the chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle of anammox bacteria was challenged that anammox bacteria are suggested much more versatile than initially assumed outside their core energy metabolism anammox bacteria was suggested using volatile fatty acids vfas as alternative electron donors to ammonium such as formate acetate and propionate for energy conservation with nitrite or nitrate as electron acceptors güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007b 2008 tao et al 2019 communities and metabolic diversities of anammox bacteria in diverse ecosystems such as oxygen minimum zone of the ocean lüke et al 2016 laboratory reactors with different configurations ali et al 2020 bhattacharjee et al 2017 hu et al 2012 speth et al 2012 van de vossenberg et al 2013 and granule and activated sludge of full scale

and favor anammox bacteria attachment is an effective carrier for rapid anammox bacteria enrichment and application for wastewater treatment gu et al 2020 however efforts have seldom focused on applying whole community metagenomics to study anammox bacteria in full scale gac biofilm systems to this end metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses were performed on a gac biofilm model and an anoxic tank with observed red anammox granules in a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate complex nitrogen cycling networks in these two reactors carried out by the cooperation of different active microbial groups were constructed interestingly four high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags representing four distinct anammox organisms belonging to three anammox genera were retrieved from the gac biofilm the gene content of reconstructed genomes combined with metatranscriptomic data revealed a high metabolic versatility of the anammox bacterial community additionally a ca brocadia strain was simultaneously established in the gac biofilm and the anoxic tank its selective adaption strategies under different ecological niches were investigated the four distinct anammox organisms added here substantially extend the diversity of anammox bacteria and their impressive metabolic versatility advances our understanding of the application of anammox bacteria in the full scale engineered system 2 materials and methods 2 1 operational strategies of the wwtp the zentraldeponie emscherbruch zde wwtp next to the emscher river in herten germany was designed to treat landfill leachate the plant was primarily operated as a conventional activated sludge system two anoxic tanks and two aeration tanks 165 m3 of each tank with a conventional nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal processes to reduce the operation costs and increase nitrogen removal efficiency the plant was renovated from 2001 by adding four parallel ultrafiltration uf membranes pore diameter is 0 8 μm with a total surface area of 300 350 m2 and biofilm modules with 9 granular activated carbon gac reactors fig 1 the plant was renovated to remove ammonium through a two stage process in which part of ammonium was oxidized to nitrite by the activated sludge system the first stage and the remaining ammonium and oxidized nitrite were then transferred to nitrogen gas by anammox in the gac reactors under anaerobic condition the second stage to achieve cost effective nitrogen removal by anammox fresh anammox granules from other full scale plants and laboratory reactors were inoculated into the gac reactors together with activated carbon at the volume ratio of 1 100 to 1 10 the optimal specific surface area of applied gac was between 600 m2 g and 1800 m2 g the gac reactors were immediately filled with oxygen free wastewater to create an anaerobic condition after the inoculation of anammox granules to provide anammox bacteria sufficient substrates the nh4 n no2 n rate of the effluent of the first stage was kept at around 1 1 1 through controlling the air supply in the aeration tanks consequently anammox bacteria were successfully established and enriched in the gac reactors in which red anammox granules with diameters between 0 8 and 24 mm could be observed azari et al 2017 the main inflow rate of the plant was approximately 20 30 m3 h with a 1 6 3 0 h hydraulic retention time hrt the solid retention time srt of the activated sludge system was kept at around 5 5 6 days while srt for the gac biofilm modules was significantly long 50 days the air supply in the first aeration tank was 100 700 m3 h to maintain the do in wastewater at the range of 0 1 0 4 mg l the air supply in the second aeration tank was stopped from january 2017 a portion of wastewater was pumped back from the aeration tanks to the first anoxic tank at a maximum rate of 300 m3 h fig 1 retentate sludge produced by uf membranes was pumped back to the first anoxic tank at a rate of 200 380 m3 h fig 1 and the stream of permeate from uf was fed as influent for gac biofilm modules the operating temperature of the plant was always higher than 28 c fig 1 2 2 sampling nucleic acid extraction sequencing and data analysis samples in this study were collected from the zde wwtp in april 2018 activated sludge from the second anoxic tank where anammox bacteria had been previously observed and biofilm from one of the gac reactors were collected samples for dna isolation were stored at 20 c and samples for rna isolation were preserved on site in lifeguard soil preservation solution qiagen germany dna and rna extraction sequencing de novo metagenomic assembly and binning were previously described yang et al 2020c the completeness and level of contamination of all acquired mags were estimated using checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 gtdb tk v1 3 0 chaumeil et al 2019 was used to classify mags based on the genome database taxonomy gtdb r202 parks et al 2020 open reading frames orfs from metagenomic assemblies scaffolds and mags were predicted by prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 trimmed metagenomic reads were mapped to the metagenomic assemblies using bowtie2 v2 2 9 ben and steven 2012 to calculate the genome abundance as tpm ribosomal rna rrna reads were identified and removed from metatranscriptomic datasets using sortmerna version 2 1 kopylova

gene transcription as tpm to compare the genome wide gene transcription of ca brocadia sp yc2 in both activated sludge and biofilm gene transcription indicated by tpm was normalized by genome abundance 2 3 overall nitrogen cycle construction and anammox bacterial mag annotation orfs from metagenomic assemblies were searched by blastp against the previously constructed custom databases of nitrogen cycle related genes yang et al 2020c with e value 10 10 blast hits with amino acid identities 60 and minimum alignment lengths 50 were considered as the nitrogen cycle related genes the overall nitrogen cycles in the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm were constructed based on the functional gene transcription of each pathway qualities of the obtained anammox mags were further improved through a reassembly using a previously described protocol yang et al 2020a the genomic content of anammox mags was analyzed by the microscope platform http www genoscope cns fr agc microscope they were further annotated by ghostkoala which is kegg s internal annotation tool for k number assignment of kegg genes using ssearch computation kanehisa et al 2016 beside the predicted orfs from anammox mags were also annotated by eggnog mapper huerta cepas et al 2017 and rapid annotation using subsystem technology rast overbeek et al 2014 potentially secreted proteins with the signal peptides were identified by signalp 4 1 signal blast and psortb frank and sippl 2008 thomas nordahl et al 2011 yu et al 2010 2 4 comparative genomic analyses average amino acid identities aais were calculated

visualized using itol letunic and bork 2019 2 6 data availability raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences have been submitted to ncbi under bioproject prjna526440 the four anammox mags obtained in this study are available in ncbi genbank under the accession number soer00000000 soeu00000000 soes00000000 and soes00000000 3 results and discussion 3 1 complex anammox driven nitrogen cycles the nitrogen removal performance of the activated sludge system two anoxic tanks followed by two aeration tanks and the gac biofilm modules were followed over more than a one year period before the time of sampling figs 1 s1 and s2 the main influent of the landfill leachate of the plant was rich in ammonium 758 mg l fig 1 up to 91 8 of ammonium removal efficiency was achieved by the activated sludge system and 5 4 of ammonium was oxidized to nitrite nitrate and discharged into the effluent fig 1 around 24 2 of the remaining ammonium 62 mg l 99 3 of the produced nitrite 27 mg l and 95 7 of the produced nitrate 14 mg l were subsequently removed by the gac biofilm modules equipped with anammox granules fig 1 the enrichment of anammox bacteria could be observed in the second anoxic tank and gac biofilm modules as red anammox granules shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of representative dna and rna samples from the second anoxic tank and a gac biofilm was carried out to obtain a genome scale view of the microbial communities and the anammox driven nitrogen cycles of these two distinct reactors after trimming and rrna removal metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of activated sludge sample from the anoxic tank produced 258 95 million dna and 58 68 million rrna free cdna reads respectively 251 60 million dna and 66 43 million rrna free cdna reads were obtained from the gac biofilm de novo assembly and binning of the metagenomic dna reads produced 155 and 198 mags from the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm respectively the processes carried out by microorganisms in both reactors related to the nitrogen cycle were constructed based on the in situ transcription of nitrogen cycle related genes fig 1b c high transcriptional activities of amo and hao genes suggest that aerobic ammonia oxidizing activity was much high in the anoxic condition fig 1b this process was mainly catalyzed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob specifically a nitrosomonas strain bin1 47 which was the top fourth most abundant organism in the anoxic tank and had a high genome wide transcriptional activity figs 2 a and s3a residual do from the influent wastewater and the returned post aerobic stage wastewater fig 1a likely allows nitrosomonas with a high affinity for oxygen to oxidize ammonia aerobic ammonia oxidation activity carried out by nitrosomonas bin1 170 was also detected in the anaerobic gac biofilm but the transcriptional levels of amo and hao were much lower than in the anoxic tank figs 1c and s3b aoa and comammox were not detected in either the anoxic tank or the gac biofilm it is likely that the high substrate affinity of comammox kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2020 and high organic carbon sensitivity of aoa gwak et al 2020 restricted their survival in this ammonium and cod rich system fig 1a the nxrabc genes of nob were not detected in the assemblies of either reactor and none of the obtained mags was closely related to known nob suggesting that the growth of nob was seriously inhibited by the high ammonium and the anoxic anaerobic conditions because of the high free ammonia sensitivity ushiki et al 2017 and low oxygen affinity guisasola et al 2005 laureni et al 2016 of nob anammox process was established in both reactors that central genes hzs hdh hox and nxr were highly transcribed fig 1b c and were found in four mags in the gac biofilm fig 2b and one mag in the anoxic tank fig 2a see below the transcriptional activities of central anammox metabolic genes in the gac biofilm were much stronger than in the anoxic tank fig 1b c likely reflecting a higher anammox activity in the gac biofilm the high transcriptional levels of denitrifying genes narg nirk s nor and nosz fig 1b indicated that the oxidized nox was rapidly reduced by denitrifiers in both reactors the high denitrifying activities were enabled by the high organics input fig 1a which served as the energy source for heterotrophic denitrifiers the high gene transcripts of nap nirb and nrfa in both reactors suggest that part of the oxidized nox was reduced to ammonium through the dnra process fig 1b c dnra bacteria are generally found in anoxic electron donor rich zones with a low nitrate availability van den berg et al 2015 the growth of dnra organisms could be stimulated by the anoxic conditions and high organics inputs in these two reactors fig 1a benefit from the high affinity for nitrate the dnra process has an advantage over denitrification under nitrate limiting conditions kraft et al 2014 anammox process was the main biological source of nitrate but only about 11 of total nitrogen is converted to nitrate that the available nitrate in both reactors was in low levels fig 1a which likely confers a selective advantage to the growth of dnra organisms in the competition with denitrifiers unlike anammox and nitrification denitrification and dnra were carried out by a diverse population around 50 80 mags and 15 24 mags of mags obtained from the anoxic tank contained at least one denitrification and dnra gene respectively fig 2a the coreresponding percentages in the gac biofilm were 42 84 mags and 12 25 mags fig 2b overall partial nitrification and denitrification were the dominant processes for effective nitrogen removal in the anoxic tank in which aerobic ammonia oxidization carried out by nitrosomonas likely served a key function in nitrogen removal by providing nitrite to denitrifiers and anammox bacteria fig 1a b in contrast anammox and denitrification dominated nitrogen removal in the gac biofilm which could efficiently convert the residual ammonium and the produced nox to n2 fig 1c 3 2 recovery of distinct anammox genomes four high quality completeness 94 contamination 5 anammox mags yc1 yc2 yc6 and yc7 were obtained from the gac biofilm table 1 fig 2b which accounted for 11 9 and 7 3 of all the metagenomic and non rrna metatranscriptomic reads mapped to all obtained mags respectively a ca brocadia mag bin1 171 was obtained from the anoxic tank fig 2a which had a 99 9 average nucleotide identity ani with mag yc2 and homologous genes predicted from these two mags share 100 identity illustrating they represent the same ca brocadia strain phylogenetic analyses of 43 concatenated markers fig 3 a 16s rrna genes fig 3c and hzsa fig s4 confirmed the placement of yc1 yc2 yc6 and yc7 into three different genera in the anammox cluster ani and 16s rrna gene based similarities further identified their lineages at the species level fig 3b d yc1 was identified as a new anammox genus and named ca loosdrechtii emscherensis in our recent study unpublished result yc7 was most similar ani 99 to ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes fig 3b which is larger than the proposed species cutoff ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 it thus was named ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis yc7 yc2 is related to ca brocadia but the highest ani 88 57 fig 3b and 16s rrna gene identity 97 74 fig 3d with other known ca brocadia strains are lower than the proposed species cutoffs ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 16s rrna gene identity 98 7 stackebrandt 2006 yarza et al 2014 it thus was named ca brocadia sp yc2 mag yc6 was assigned to ca kuenenia but it formed a separate clade with the other known ca kuenenia organisms in the phylogenetic trees figs 3a c and s4 furthermore the highest ani and 16s rrna gene identity between yc6 and the other known ca kuenenia genomes were 81 45 and 96 11 respectively fig 3b d which are lower than the proposed species cutoffs ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 16s rrna gene identity 98 7 stackebrandt 2006 yarza et al 2014 here we propose the name hertensis for this novel ca kuenenia species alluding to its discovery in herten wwtp thus was named ca kuenenia hertensis yc6 to our best knowledge all the known ca kuenenia organisms to date affiliate to ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis the identity of ca kuenenia hertensis in the current study substantially extend the phylogenetic diversity of the ca kuenenia genus 3 3 the much active central anammox metabolism hydrazine is the highly unusual and extremely reactive intermediate of the anammox process and hydrazine synthesis and oxidation are central for energy conservation in anammox bacteria kartal and keltjens 2016 consistent with the previous finding that anammox bacteria have to express the sluggish hzs at high levels to achieve appreciable metabolic activity kartal et al 2013 hzs were all highly expressed by the four anammox bacteria in the gac biofilm fig 4 it has been postulated that hzs receives electrons from a tetraheme c type cytochrome as a part of the electron transfer module etm ferousi et al 2019 which was conserved in these four anammox mags table s1 hydrazine oxidation is carried out by hdh a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao like protein akram et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2016 the hdh homologs were found in yc1 yc2 and yc7 with high in situ expression levels but not in the recovered part of yc6 fig 4 hydrazine oxidation could be catalyzed by kustc 1061 another hao like protein in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2011 kustc 1061 which also carried out hydroxylamine oxidation to no kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2014 is a dedicated hydroxylamine oxidizing protein hox that recycles the leaked out hydroxylamine from hzs back to no fig 4 and prevents the inhibition of hydroxylamine to hdh dietl et al 2015 maalcke et al 2014 the hox homolog could be found in yc1 yc6 and yc7 but not in the recovered part of yc2 fig 4 hox coding genes were highly transcribed by these three strains fig 4 verifying a central role of hox in anammox metabolism electrons required for nitrite reduction to no are most likely derived from nitrite oxidation catalyzed by nxr rather than the previously recognized hydrazine oxidation hu et al 2019 in agreement with the core physiological function of nitrite oxidation in the anammox process nxr coding genes were all highly transcribed by these four anammox organisms fig 4 hzs hdh and nxr are conserved throughout the known anammox organisms whereas nitrite reduction to no is catalyzed by distinct no generating nitrite reductases nir that are also found in other organisms kartal and keltjens 2016 known ca kuenenia and ca scalindua species encode cytochrome cd 1 nir nirs whereas ca jettenia species encode a copper containing nir nirk hira et al 2012 hu et al 2012 nir is absent in most of the ca brocadia genomes but a nirs was found in a ca brocadia genome which was obtained from a full scale wwtp yang et al 2020c nir genes were identified in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis yc7 and ca loosdrechtii emscherensis yc1 but not in the recovered parts of ca brocadia sp yc2 and ca kuenenia hertensis yc6 fig 4 similar to the low transcription of nirs in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 nir genes were very weakly transcribed by yc1 and yc7 fig 4 the hao like protein kustc0458 was proposed relate to nitrite reduction to no in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 consistently all four anammox mags encoded kustc0458 homologs table s1 which likely fulfill the function of nitrite reduction to no in anammox metabolism fig 4 3 4 vfas oxidation coupled with dnra process growth of anammox bacteria on acetate propionate and both acetate and propionate was shown for ca brocadia kartal et al 2008 ca anammoxoglobus kartal et al 2007b and ca jettenia tao et al 2019 enrichments respectively acetyl coa synthetases acs which catalyze the ligation of acetate with coa for acetyl coa production has been implicated in acetate oxidation by anammox bacteria russ et al 2012 a recent study suggested that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis is not capable of using acetate as a carbon or energy source despite the presence of acs lawson et al 2020 the propionate activation capability of an acs like protein kustc1128 found in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was verified through heterologous expression suggesting that propionate could be catalyzed by acs through propionate coa production russ et al 2012 in line with previous studies that reported at least three different acs encoded by each anammox genome kartal et al 2007b 2008 three to five acss were encoded and highly expressed by the four anammox organisms fig 4 table s1 the produced propionate coa by acs could be further transferred to acetyl coa through an α carboxylation reaction combined with the tca cycle plugge et al 1993 a complete α carboxylation pathway was encoded and expressed by all anammox organisms except for ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis yc7 fig 4 comparably the α carboxylation pathway mcc mce and mcm is also absent in all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes fig 5 b overall the ammonium and acetate propionate co oxidation capability likely helps anammox bacteria survive unfavorable conditions and facilitate switches between lifestyles in the eutrophic wastewater treatment system the oxidation of vfas could couple dnra processes by supplying anammox bacteria with ammonium ahmad et al 2021 ali et al 2020 güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007a lam et al 2009 wang et al 2021 winkler et al 2012 in anammox bacteria the first step of dnra nitrate reduction to nitrite was proposed to be catalyzed by nxr operating in the reverse kartal et al 2007a while a soluble ferredoxin dependent nitrate reductase narb associated with nitrate reduction was uniquely encoded by yc1 fig 4 pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfah which catalyzes the six electron reduction of nitrite into ammonium was observed in yc1 and yc2 whereas it was absent in the two ca kuenenia mags yc6 and yc7 fig 4 and all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes instead a putative calcium dependent multihaem nitrite reductase was proposed responsible for the nitrite reduction in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2007a cod nh4 n ratio plays an important role in governing the competition between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs in wastewater during the enrichment of amammox bacteria in the laboratory reactors the cod nh4 n ratio is usually lower than 2 0 because it was proposed that a high cod nh4 n ratio could allow a higher fraction of heterotrophic bacteria and reduce the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria cao et al 2017 although the cod nh4 n ratio in the influent of the gac biofilm modules is up to 15 0 fig 1 high diverse anammox bacteria successfully enriched in the gac biofilm with very high activities similarly a high influent cod nh4 n ratio 9 2 was reported in a full scale mainstream pn a process in austria in which a high proportion of anammox bacteria was enriched wett et al 2015 these findings suggest that the niche of anammox bacteria in practical applications in engineered systems can be much broader than generally assumed it is generally believed that anammox bacteria are protected by heterotrophs in the presence of high organics but the organotrophy alternative lifestyle allows them to deal with organics on their own and makes them more versatile in high organics environment than often expected 3 5 flexible ammonium and iron acquisition strategies type i glutamine synthetase gsi and fmn dependent glutamate synthase glts fmn associated with ammonium assimilation were encoded by the four anammox organisms except for the absence of gsi in the recovered part of yc7 and gene transcripts of both enzymes were all detected fig 4 yc6 contained an additional ammonium assimilation pathway a type iii glutamine synthetase gsiii and a nadph dependent glutamate synthase glts nadph were adjacently encoded figs 4 and 5 the gsiii coding gene was also found in all the known ca kuenenia genomes but the adjacent glts nadph is unique for yc6 which represents a new species in ca kuenenia fig 5b it has been reported that the expression of gsi and gsiii in the same organism is subjected to transcriptional regulation in response to changes in nitrogen availability that the gsiii is highly expressed only under ammonium deficiency amaya et al 2005 reyes et al 1997 the simultaneously encoded and highly expressed gsi and gsiii systems likely confer a selective advantage to yc6 over others for growth in fluctuating conditions fig 4 three feob homologs associated with fe ii transportation ferousi et al 2017 were simultaneously encoded and expressed by yc6 whereas only one feob was found in the other three anammox organisms fig 5a multiple feob likely confer a selective advantage to yc6 over others for iron competition but another two subunits of the feoabc system feoa and feoc associated with iron uptake enhancement were absent in these four mags which was also occurred in other anammox genomes ferousi et al 2017 the feoabc system was previously regarded as the only system for iron uptake by anammox bacteria ferousi et al 2017 whereas a tonb exbb exbd tee complex associated with fe iii uptake was found in these anammox organisms only except for the recovered part of the ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis mag yc7 fig 5a and it was consistently absent in the other known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genomes fig 5b anammox bacteria have been observed to couple formate oxidation to fe iii reduction outside the cell strous et al 2006 van de vossenberg et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 which likely act as a potential fe ii acquisition pathway through reducing fe iii another enzyme with great interest is a ferric reductase fre fig 4 the homolog of nadph oxidase associated with fe iii reduction shatwell et al 1996 which was uniquely encoded by yc6 among these four anammox organisms fig 5a and all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis strains fig 5b fer likely provides yc6 an additional source of fe ii through reducing the collected fe iii by the tee system zhang et al 2013 during periods of limited soluble fe ii availability nanosized diameter 16 25 nm iron rich particles were observed inside the anammoxosome of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis van niftrik et al 2008 which were speculated to be iron storage sites possibly formed by bacterioferritins bfrs ferousi et al 2017 in the model bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa bfr compartmentalizes iron at concentrations far above the solubility of fe iii and protects the reducing cell environment from unwanted fe iii fe ii redox cycling rivera 2017 it carries out the fe ii oxidation at ferroxidase centers using o2 and internalizes fe iii in the interior cavity for iron storage it also can reduce fe iii through the interaction with a ferredoxin to achieve iron mobilization rivera 2017 fig 4 nitrate dependent iron oxidation has shown that in anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2013 strous et al 2006 that nitrate is the most likely electron acceptor for fe ii oxidation carried out by bfr rather than o2 in the oxygen free anammoxosome bfr could be found in yc6 yc1 and all the known ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis species figs 4 5a and b the in situ transcripts of bfrs were detected in both yc6 and yc1 fig 4 indicating a central role of bfr in iron storage and metabolism anammox bacteria rely heavily on iron containing proteins for energy conservation especially for the large amounts of heme c containing enzymes like hdh and hzs in the anammoxosome akram et al 2019 it was found that iron became the growth limiting nutrients when the nitrite concentration was increased beyond 20 mm during the enrichment of ca scalindua van de vossenberg et al 2008 anammox activity was significantly promoted by adding an appropriate amount of fe ii in the enrichment which increased the heme c levels within anammox cells and also improved hdh activity bi et al 2014 liu and ni 2015 the increase in the available iron concentration can accelerate the metabolism of anammox bacteria so that the flexible iron acquisition strategies likely confers a selective advantage to yc6 over others for iron competition in iron availability fluctuating conditions because of the crucial function of iron in the metabolism of anammox bacteria appropriate iron concentration has been regarded as a significant factor for the fast start up of the anammox process it was reported that the anammox activity and bacterial growth were enhanced by 0 09 and 0 12 mm fe ii while the anammox activity could be seriously inhibited by higher fe ii concentrations 0 75 mm ding et al 2020 a similar result was obtained from strain ca brocadia sinica that lower fe ii concentrations 0 06 0 08 mm could significantly increase the growth rate and the activity was suppressed by higher fe ii concentrations 0 08 mm shu et al 2016 therefore iron concentration should be a crucial monitoring and controlling parameter in practical anammox application for treating various sources of wastewater under different treatment strategies 3 6 extensive niche distribution of a ca brocadia species the ca brocadia sp yc2 was successfully established in both the anoxic tank and gac biofilm module the two distinct niches of the plant the anoxic tank is equipped as a conventional activated sludge system without aeration but the influent wastewater and the recycled wastewater from the aeration tank might bring trace amounts of oxygen to support the growth of some aerobic organisms with high oxygen affinity the gac biofilm module was an anaerobic system where gacs serve as biofilm carriers for the enrichment of anammox bacteria differently the concentration of bioavailable organics and ammonium in the influent of the anoxic tank was much higher than in the gac biofilm module while the cod nh4 n ratio was much higher in the influent of the gac biofilm module fig 1 the gac biofilm module had a much longer srt 50 days compared to the anoxic tanks 6 days that the slow growing anammox bacteria are more easily to be washed out from the anoxic tank of all the predicted genes in yc2 67 and 89 were detected in the metatranscriptomic datasets in the anoxic tank and gac biofilm samples respectively table s2 central genes related to the anammox process hzs hdh and nxr substrate transportation amt and fnt and ammonium assimilation gsi and glts fmn were all highly transcribed by yc2 in both reactors fig 6 hox related to hydroxylamine oxidation and nir related to nitrite reduction were absent in the recovered parts of yc2 in both reactors enzymes related to vfas acetate and propionate oxidation and reactive oxygen species detoxification like superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat had higher expression levels in the anoxic tank fig 6 which likely indicates a stronger aerobic oxidation activity in the anoxic condition feob related to fe ii collection was highly expressed by yc2 in both reactors while the expression activity of tee for fe iii acquisition was only detected in the gac reactor fig 6 the collected fe iii may serve as a crucial electron acceptor for anaerobic metabolism in the anaerobic biofilm the different genome wide gene transcriptional patterns of yc2 in the two distinct reactors might confer it selective adaption strategies under different ecological niches 4 conclusions and implications the metagenomic reconstruction of microbial mags derived from an anoxic tank and a gac biofilm module of a full scale wwtp combined with a metatranscriptomic analysis has revealed the complex nitrogen cycling networks in these two reactors carried out by the cooperation of different active microbial groups one and four anammox mags representing four distinct anammox organisms were derived from the anoxic tank and the gac biofilm respectively gene content of reconstructed mags combined with metatranscriptomic data revealed a substantial metabolic versatility and survival strategies of anammox organisms although the cod nh4 n ratio 15 0 of the influent of the gac biofilm modules was much higher than the expected optimal value 2 0 of laboratory reactor operation four distinct anammox organisms were successfully enriched and they seem to be very active concerning the central anammox metabolism for nitrogen removal anammox organisms can oxidize vfas coupled to the dnra process this organotrophy alternative lifestyle allows them to be more versatile under high organics environment and expands their ecological niche in the engineered systems than generally assumed in particular the flexible ammonium and iron acquisition strategies likely confer a selective advantage to ca kuenenia hertensis yc6 the second known ca kuenenia species to date over others under substrate fluctuating conditions is a remarkable addition to previous knowledge on anammox bacterial diversity and metabolism in particular iron concentration in wastewater should be regarded as a key parameter for the success of anammox because of the crucial function of iron in anammox metabolism the recoveries of four distinct anammox organisms with substantial metabolic versatility from the full scale system especially the identification of a new anammox genus and a new ca kuenenia species significantly extend the phylogenetic and functional diversity of anammox organisms future research efforts should focus on the enrichment and physiological characterization of representatives of these novel anammox organisms for example to provide special insights on optimal nitrogen removal from sewage in

16569,combined organic and inorganic fouling is a primary barrier constraining the performance of reverse osmosis ro membrane in this work we conducted a systematic study focusing on the synergetic fouling effects of silica and humic acid ha in ro process and found the critical silica concentration where the fouling pattern changed qualitatively when the silica concentration was lower than 6 mm at a typical ha concentration of 50 mg l 1 no severe fouling was observed while silica reaching this critical point could cause severe synergetic fouling with ha concentrated silica above the critical point acted as the prior foulant with marginal fouling effect caused by ha a variety of solutions and surface based characterizations were performed to elucidate the synergistic fouling responsibility for silica and ha our study suggests that the carboxylic groups from ha formed hydrogen bonds with silica hydrate inducing silica adsorption onto ha aggregates at low silica particle concentrations the ha network was bridged together to form large foulants due to the silica silica interaction above the silica critical concentration these mechanisms were further confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations this study provides an in depth insight into the combined organic inorganic fouling and can serve as a guideline to optimize feed conditions in order to mitigate fouling of ro in wastewater reusing industry graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse osmosis silica humic acid combined fouling interaction mechanism 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is one of the most important membrane separation technologies in wastewater reclamation and water desalination al mayyahi 2018 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2020a membrane fouling by inorganic and organic matters in feed water is complicated due to the interactions among multiple species and their synergetic contributions xie et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a these synergetic fouling could reduce flux increase operational pressure and energy consumption accelerate cleaning frequency and ultimately shorten the lifespans of membranes higgin et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 lee and elimelech 2007 wang et al 2019 therefore it is critical to understand what is behind fouling phenomena to propose targeted mitigation strategies accordingly in ro process as one of the predominant substances of natural organic matters nom humic acid ha exists widely in natural and engineering water systems including seawater industrial wastewater and hazardous landfill leachate sir et al 2012 wang et al 2019 due to its relatively small molecular weight ha could not be completely removed by ro pretreatments like ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf han et al 2015 lee et al 2000 liu et al 2021 moreover ha could cause the most irreversible membrane fouling compared to polysaccharides and proteins tin et al 2017 thus ha played an important role in ro fouling of seawater desalination and wastewater treatment monruedee et al 2012 moreover the synergistic interaction between ha and some inorganic ions could increase fouling severity and making the fouling more difficult to remove hence it is important to reveal the combined fouling patterns and mechanisms of ha and inorganic compounds among the common inorganic substances that co exist with ha in ro feed the most studied was ca2 and mg2 the complexes formed between ca2 or mg2 and ha could cause aggregation in membrane fouling process in most practical conditions and was not qualitatively sensitive with ions concentrations tang et al 2007 wang et al 2015b yao et al 2012 zhao et al 2019b however as one of the most obstinate inorganic foulants in ro process silica also contributes significantly to scaling in ro lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 silica not only has a stronger enrichment effect on ro membranes compared to ca2 and mg2 wang et al 2019 but also induce irreversible scaling layers which are resistant to chemical cleaning lu et al 2020 xia et al 2015 hence the mixture of silica and ha in ro feed could cause more complex combined fouling several studies have already discussed about the synergistic fouling of ha and colloidal silica for instance studies found an aggravating fouling of mixing colloidal silica and ha in nf process contreras et al 2009 li and elimelech 2006 in another study a ph related synergetic effect was found in ro tests with combined solution of ha and colloidal silica lin 2017 however the chemical characteristics of soluble silica is much more complex than colloidal silica soluble silica could form oligomers and polymers through si o si bonds and it could also aggregate together to form large flocs by hydrogen bonds through hydroxylic groups belton et al 2012 tong et al 2017 hence soluble silica could behave differently compared to colloidal silica in synergistic fouling guo et al 2012 to our best knowledge there has been no systematical study on the combined fouling patterns and mechanisms of soluble silica and ha in ro process for the first time this study aimed to fill the knowledge gap of the synergetic effects of ha and silica on fouling in ro process a series of bench scale filtration experiments were performed using ha and sodium metasilicate as model organic and inorganic foulants respectively the fouling potential was evaluated under different feed concentrations the solution chemistry and membrane foulant components were systemically characterized via a variety of analytical approaches in order to explore the fouling mechanisms at the molecular level the finding was further strengthened through molecular dynamics md simulations a critical silica concentration was found above which dramatic fouling was inevitable and the mechanism behind the fouling pattern was thoroughly investigated this study enhances our understanding of the interaction between silica and ha and its role in ro fouling the outcome of this research has the potential to be applied to predict fouling and determine the strategies to manipulate feed composition in order to retard fouling development 2 method and materials 2 1 materials and chemicals sodium metasilicate nonahydrate na2sio3 9h2o 95 purity ha fulvic acid as the main component above 90 purity were used as model foulants shanghai macklin biochemical co china other chemicals for feed preparation including nacl hcl and naoh were in analytical grade and used without further treatment ultrapure water with resistivity of 18 2 mω was used for all filtration experiments milli q milliporesigma usa ha stock solution 1 g l 1 was prepared with ph adjusted to around 9 by 1 m naoh solution for better dissolution and was filtrated through a 0 7 μm membrane to remove insoluble fractions based on a previous study wang et al 2015b the polyamide thin film composite ro membranes used in the study were cut from a spiral wound module lfc3 hydranautics usa with a water flux of 45 l m 2 h 1 and a salt rejection of 99 7 when testing by 1500 mg l 1 nacl solution at 25 and 1 55 mpa wang et al 2019 the membranes were rinsed by a 25 v v isopropyl alcohol once and ultrapure water for 3 times to remove residual impurities and activate the membrane surface the pretreated membranes were stored in ultrapure water at 4 for later use tong et al 2017 2 2 ro membrane fouling tests we evaluated the fouling properties using solutions with silica concentration of 0 mm 2 mm 4 mm 6 mm 8 mm and 10 mm which were named as blank and si2 to si10 respectively when investigating combined fouling behaviors 50 mg l 1 of ha was added in the feed named as ha and ha si2 to ha si10 respectively we chose 50 mg l 1 as a typical ha concentration based on our pre experiment fig s1 and previous studies cruz silva et al 2019 yang et al 2010 all feed solutions were adjusted to ph of 7 0 0 1 using 1 m naoh and hcl solutions and conductivity of 5600 μs cm 1 equivalent to a 50 mm nacl solution following previous studies before the experiments wang et al 2020b xia et al 2015 the abbreviation and basic characteristics of all tested feed names is provided in table s1 a lab scale crossflow filtration setup scheme s1 was used for fouling tests with an effective membrane area of 20 6 cm2 before each fouling experiment the system was flushed by deionized water for three times then ultrapure water once the membranes were then pre compacted for 12 h with ultrapure water under 1 8 mpa since the pipeline in the setup was composed of two parallel membrane modules two sets of data were collected for each run to minimize random error each filtration cycle was performed under 1 6 mpa for 600 min with a crossflow velocity of 9 4 cm s 1 the permeate flow rate was continuously recorded by a micro flow meter for each module the initial flux of membrane was typically around 50 2 l m 2 h 1 under our test condition after fouling tests the fouled membranes were air dried for 30 min and stored at 4 2 3 feed property characterizations the particle size distribution and zeta potential of the feed solutions were measured on zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the microscale aggregates were directly visualized by

dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds oxford x max uk were performed along with the tem the fluorescence solution chemistry and acidic functional groups of the feed were characterized by excitation emission matrix eem spectrum f 7000 hitachi japan solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr jnm ecz600r jeol japan and acid base titration respectively eem was performed following the steps of a previous study after proper dilution to keep the eem test data under the instrument maximum limit with the scan at excitation of 200 500 nm and emission of 250 600 nm xiao et al 2018 yu et al 2020 the data was processed by matlab 2015b for baseline correction and normalization we also calculated fluorescence quotient fq for each sample xiao et al 2018 for solid state nmr the samples were adjusted to ph of 7 and then freeze dried for 3 days before performing 13c using dipolar dephasing magic angle spinning dd mas method 29si and 1h nmr guan et al 2019 the acid base titration was conducted using a solution composed of 4 mm silica and 1 g l 1 ha for higher resolution this is because the signal from a low concentration ha solution i e 50 mg l 1 used for filtration relatively low molar carboxyl content could be impeded by silica during the titration hong and elimelech 1997 lee and elimelech 2006 wang et al 2015a considering that this test drew only qualitative conclusions it is still relevant to our study and could serve as a backup for other experiments the acid base titration curves were calculated and analyzed by matlab 2015b to get the pk a concentration and distribution of the solutions wang and waite 2009 2 4 membrane property characterizations the fouled membranes were cut into square pieces of 0 5 cm2 for instrumental analysis the surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem merlin compact zeiss germany and atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker germany the functional groups elemental maps and the chemical compositions of the foulant layers were probed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 6700ftir thermo electron china x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi quantera ii ulvac phi japan and electrospray ionization ion trap time of flight mass spectrometry esi tof ms lcms it tof shimadzu japan respectively the ftir data was processed in omnic 7 3 and the 2d cos mapping was visualized by 2dshige software shigeaki morita japan see in si for details about 2d cos ftir analysis noda and ozaki 2004 yan et al 2016 we processed a subtraction and normalization to silica fouled membrane ftir data for

membranes we cut them into 2 cm2 pieces and soaked each piece in 1 ml ultrapure water with 30 min sonication to fully extract soluble fractions the solution was subject to esi tof ms analysis to identify foulant chemical compositions all feed samples were subject to a 15 min ultrasonic pretreatment prior to characterization and the tests were performed at least triplites 2 5 md simulations of the interaction between ha and silica the md simulations were implemented to investigate the interaction between ha and silica molecules the latter were expected to exist in the form of silicate dimer according to the esi tof ms and acid base titration data scheme s2a the stevenson s ha structure were chosen as a model ha molecule in the simulation scheme s2b stevenson 1982 the initial structures of the components were optimized using b3lyp 6 31g and gaussian 16 the simulations were performed using gromacs version 2020 5 software with gromos 54a7 force field at 295 k 1 bar in aqueous phase using v rescale thermostat and a parrinello rahman barostat respectively the time step was set to 2 fs a calculation was taken every 0 5 ps 2 simulations were performed with one ha molecule interacted with 2 case 1 and 20 case 2 silica molecules respectively each simulation lasted for 100 ns to reach an equilibrium the hydrogen bonds were defined as the conditions where the angle of h donor acceptor was 30 and the distance of donor and acceptor was 0 35 nm during the data analysis the binding energy of each interaction was calculated when the bindings were stable in cases 1 and 2 1 and 6 silica molecules were observed to bind with ha respectively the types of hydrogen bonds between ha and silica were studied 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of silica critical concentration several cross flow experiments proved that the flux decline was silica concentration dependent the fouling was not severe and independent of ha addition when silica was 2 mm fig 1 a the feed with only 2 mm silica si2 gave a final flux decline by 4 while the mixed feed of ha and 2 mm silica ha si2 reduced the final flux by 5 with more silica added the combined fouling effect became noticeable fig 1b as the silica concentration increased to 6 mm the mixed feed ha si6 led to a significant flux decline by 46 showing a synergistic effect conversely neither 6 mm silica si6 nor ha solutions alone fouled the membranes so rapidly above this threshold i e silica concentration was 10 mm both silica and mixed feed solutions si10 and ha si10 respectively had similar fouling properties implying that ha played a minor role in the combined fouling process fig 1c we later investigated the fouling under different silica concentrations and 6 mm proved to be the critical concentration when silica participated fouling fig 1d detailed flux curves under other concentrations are shown in fig s2 in the silica fouling tests alone the fouling slightly enhanced as the feed concentration increased from 0 to 6 mm the final normalized flux dropped from 100 to 87 the fluxes decreased to 56 and 37 for 8 mm and 10 mm silica feed at the end of the 600 min filtration experiments respectively when silica and ha coexisted in the feed the fluxes started to deteriorate significantly when the silica concentrations increased to 6 mm due to the strong synergistic effect however after the silica concentration exceeded 8 mm silica became the major foulant no obvious synergistic interaction was observed the above fouling tests showed a critical silica concentration above which the combined fouling by silica and ha were intensified indicating a potential interaction between these two species and the formation of foulant network to support this hypothesis more physicochemical properties of the feed solutions and membrane foulant were investigated as will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 variations of feed solution aggregates with silica concentration 3 2 1 size distribution and microscopic properties of aggregates the solution with only ha showed a featured particle size distribution around 300 nm fig 2 a in the mixed silica and ha feed when the silica concentration was lower than 6 mm the peak shape and position remained basically the same as the ha feed with no additional peaks that represented silica aggregates when silica concentration increased to 6 mm a second smaller peak appeared between 10 and 50 nm the original peak shifted to around 150 nm and has similar shape and patterns to those of low concentration silica solutions the peak shifting above the critical si concentration might be attribute to the ha aggregate structure breaking down due to the steric effect of fully occupied si on ha binding sites the shrinking particle size could lead to severer flux decline which corresponds with our former fouling experiments gwenaelle et al 2017 park et al 2008 the two different size distributions indicated that the ha structure remained unchanged regardless of the existence of silica silica did not aggregate by itself in a low concentration solution but may get adsorbed by the porous structure of ha and dispersed on the ha surface instead when the silica concentration was raised to the critical point i e 6 mm due to the saturation of the ha adsorption sites the free silica self aggregated with bridging effect and hydrogen bonds which contributed to the second peak belton et al 2012 simonsen et al 2009 tem and eds results supported the interaction between ha and silica fig 2b f in the ha feed the aggregates mainly existed in the form of flocculent agglomerates fig 2b while the particles in silica only solution fig 2c were small aggregated granules in the mixed solution of ha and 6 mm silica fig 2d small granular silica was found to be trapped into the porous structures of ha network when the silica concentration increased to 10 mm we observed silica trapped ha aggregates where the si signals were well matched with the carbon and oxygen signals from the ha backbone in eds map fig 2e left and 2c in addition individual silica aggregates were also found figs 2e right and s3 therefore silica was proved to be trapped in the ha network when its concentration was relatively high the eem results of all the samples showed a peak at em of 400 600 nm and ex of 200 500 fig s4 which was indicative of humic and fluvic substances in the mixed ha and silica solution chen et al 2003 a further fq analysis showed a peak at em of 200 230 nm and ex of 300 350 nm in ha si6 sample fig 3 b the red circle this peak was not observed in low silica concentration samples 2 mm in fig 3a and 4 mm in fig s5a but became salient as silica increased 8 mm in fig s5b and 10 mm in fig 3c this fq peak was overlapped with an identified area with high fouling potential regions highlighted by gray dash in fig 3a c at em of 200 280 nm and ex of 280 330 nm xiao et al 2018 thus we could infer the interaction discipline by combining this morphology and fluorescence result with the former filtration tests when the silica concentration exceeded the threshold of 6 mm silica filled the empty pockets of ha and a more complicated network with large fouling potential formed 3 2 2 chemical characteristics of aggregates the mentioned interaction between silica and ha was further identified by solid state nmr and acid base titration the chemical shifts of 13c in the solid state nmr spectrum of ha were influenced by its chemical environment fig 4 a the main peaks in the ha spectrum were at 27 ppm 125 ppm and 178 ppm which corresponded to aliphatic c aromatic c and carboxyl c respectively almendros et al 2016 mathers and xu 2003 notably the carboxyl peak at 178 ppm detected in the ha sample was not found in the mixed ha silica sample this illustrated that the existence of silica was able to interact with the carboxyl groups in ha and change the chemical environment similarly in the hydrogen nmr spectrum the peak featuring carboxylic hydrogen at 13 ppm vanished when silica was added into the ha solution fig 4b the disappearance of the carboxylic signals indicated a shielding effect by the surrounding silica the 29si spectrum conversely showed marginal difference between pure silica feed and mixed solution with ha the peaks of both spectrums lied around 101 ppm and 110 ppm which corresponded to q3 and q4 types of silica respectively fig 4c see structures of silica species in scheme s3 dogan et al 2009 gunawidjaja et al 2010 hung et al 2021 this implied that the interaction with ha did not change the silicate chemical environment notably according to the research of mi and elimelech the silica particle in forward osmosis formed hydrogen bonds with carboxylic groups on the polyamide membrane surface which was consistent to our findings mi and elimelech 2013 we conducted an acid base titration to confirm the interaction between acidic groups mainly carboxyl and silica fig 4d the total acidic concentration of a 4 mm silica solution was 2 5 mm the solution showed a partial dimerization of silica the pk a was located mainly around 9 8 which was in accordance with the pk a of silica in the form of small oligomers and monomer belton et al 2012 in ha solution the pk a was found around 4 7 and 5 9 representing mainly carboxylic groups a small portion of pk a of 8 and 8 5 were phenol groups lee and elimelech 2006 in the mixed solution both acidic groups at pk a 9 8 representing silica and groups around 4 7 5 7 representing ha carboxyl were detected with lowered intensity these indicated the coupling and masking effect between silica and the carboxylic groups in ha which was in accordance with the nmr test results the solution zeta potential test also corroborated this conclusion as ha samples mixed with silica were less negatively charged at ph 7 which was due to the occupation of negatively charged coo groups by silica fig s6 taheri et al 2013 in summary in the mixed silica and ha solution silica tended to interact with the carboxylic groups of the ha backbone which resulted in the chemical environment changes in these regions as identified by solid state nmr and acid base titration the interaction was probably hydrogen bonds according to the experimental results and previous works mi and elimelech 2013 at low silica concentration because of extra carboxylic binding sites no significant structural changes in ha was observed when the silica concentration exceeded 6 mm the binding sites for the carboxylic groups were saturated and there were free silica aggregates at this point these fully silica loaded ha may cause enhanced fouling due to the interaction between silica 3 3 variations of foulant layers with silica concentration 3 3 1 morphology of foulant layers silica and ha resulted in two completely different surfaces after fouling as identified by afm and sem figs 5 and 6 s7 and s8 and table s2 the presence of ha in feed smoothened the fouled surface remarkably compared with the silica fouled membrane as shown in fig 5a and b where the root mean square roughness r q was 85 9 nm for si6 vs 46 3 nm for ha si6 on the other hand the increasing concentration of silica increased the surface roughness irrespective of ha and the largest rq leap occurred just above the critical silica concentration i e silica concentration between 6 mm and 10 mm with or without ha presence fig 5c which indicate a notable change in foulant layer structure the sem images further confirmed the difference between silica and ha figs 6 and s8 when silica was dominant the roughness as well as the morphology was close to fouling with silica only at low silica concentrations the foulant layer was more flattened by ha additionally the sem figures also provided more details during the silica fouling low silica concentrations led to local fouling leaving a portion of bare original ro membrane in the gaps of the fouling structure with the concentration increasing the fouling layer became rougher and covered the whole membrane surface which could be the cause of the nosedive of membrane flux when ha existed the foulant layers covered the entire membrane surface regardless of the silica concentrations 3 3 2 chemical compositions of foulant layers the fouling layers were characterized by ftir xps and esi tof ms for further understanding of the fouling mechanism the ftir data showed q3 silica was dominated in the foulant layer compared to q2 and q4 species fig s9a and table s3 carboxyl related peaks in ha fouled membranes were found at 1200 1600 cm 1 fig 7 a for details see table s3 and fig s9a guan et al 2019 qin et al 2017 simonsen et al 2009 yoon et al 2004 zhao et al 2011 based on the foregoing hypothesis of the potential interaction between ha carboxylic groups and silica we conducted a 2d cos ftir analysis for deeper understanding of this process at variant silica concentrations fig 7b and c the basically positive value in the synchronous map fig 7b and the declined trend in absorbance with increasing silica concentrations in 1 d spectrum fig 7a indicated a general and synchronous shielding effect to the ha structure by silica the peaks related with carboxyl groups in the asynchronous map the lower left region of fig 7b and table 1 had basically the same sign with those in the synchronous map which means that the lower wavenumber peaks basically changed after the higher wavenumber peaks i e follow the sequence of νas coo 1584 cm 1 νs coo 1413 cm 1 ν oh cooh 1295 cm 1 ν cooh 1240 cm 1 guan et al 2019 noda and ozaki 2004 this demonstrated that the interaction between silica and ha possibly hydrogen bonds first took place on deprotonated carboxylic groups rather than protonated groups due to the negative charging and higher electron cloud density the xps c1s spectrums of fouled membranes showed that the carbon composition in the foulant mainly existed in the form of ch co c o and carboxylic groups figs 8 a c and s10a these peaks were related with ha and centered around 284 8 ev 286 5 ev 287 2 ev 288 4 ev respectively chu et al 2016 monteil rivera et al 2000 you et al 2016 the deconvoluted areas of these peaks in different samples are compared in fig 8d overall the intensity of these components declined as silica concentration increased among all the functional groups the carboxylic groups underwent the sharpest drop with more silica added which is another indication confirming the interaction between silica and carboxyl shown in fig 8a c in orange arrows it is worth noticing that the most evident decrease in the carboxylic signal took place when the silica concentration crossed 6 mm which corresponded with the critical concentration of silica in the fouling test as well as the afm tests mentioned before the xps spectrum of silica foulant with and without ha fig s10b showed similar peaks after deconvolution this shows the silica structure remained unchanged as indicated by the previous nmr tests the two 10 mm silica samples with and without ha had a major peak around 103 8 ev representing si o si bonds higher than others with a peak around 103 4 ev representing sio2 nh2o crist 2000 simonsen et al 2009 this implied a stronger silica self crosslinking and dehydration effect with a high silica concentration esi tof ms was used to resolve structure of silica species of the silica ha interaction fig s11 identified that the prominent particles in the negative spectrum were nah4si2o7 2h2o with a m z of 231 1 and the main signal in positive spectrum were na3si2o5 with a m z of 205 1 this result indicated that the monomer silica was converted to dimer through polymerization which could also be evidenced by the foregoing titration result fig 4d and scheme s2a in summary silica in the foulant layer existed in the form of q3 silica in solid phase the dominant stable species was found to be silicate dimer when ro membranes were fouled with ha and silica simultaneously silica interacted with the carboxylic groups of ha as the feed silica concentration increased it first bridged with deprotonated then protonated carboxylic groups with hydrogen bonds 3 4 md simulations of ha and silica interaction the md simulation revealed that the interaction between ha and silica was through hydrogen bonds fig 9 in both cases 1 fig 9a with 1 ha molecule interact with 2 si molecules and 2 fig 9b and c with 1 ha molecule interact with 20 molecules silica molecules were able to interact with ha the extra self aggregated silica in case 2 fig 9c and the formed clusters further interacted with ha which confirmed our hypothesis of the bridging effect of silica fig 9b silica bound multiple sites on the ha backbone including hydroxyl oh ether o carboxyl cooh amide conr2 and carbonyl co groups the carboxyl group proved to be the dominant functional group to bind silica in both cases as shown in fig 9d in case 1 each carboxyl group averagely formed 0 0062 hydrogen bond during the entire 100 ns simulation while in case 2 this number increased to 0 087 due to the enriched silica density the binding energy showed the si ha and si si interactions were thermodynamically favorable the averaged binding energies between si and ha was 21 88 kj mol 1 and 33 27 kj mol 1 in cases 1 and 2 respectively the averaged binding energy between two si aggregates containing 2 molecules was 12 46 kj mol 1 detail in table s4 this result showed that the interaction between ha and si were more favorable at higher si concentrations 4 conclusions in this study the systematical fouling patterns between ha and silica were analyzed and the critical point of silica concentration was found the underlying interaction mechanisms between ha and silica were revealed by multiscale solution and surface based characterization approaches the following conclusions were drawn 1 the critical concentration of silica was 6 mm at a 50 mg l 1 of ha concentration the fouling was not severe with silica concentration below this threshold but serious synergetic fouling was found when silica concentration reached this point a further increased silica concentration made no further severe synergistic fouling 2 ha existed as porous flocs in feed solution and silica below the critical point could adsorb upon the aggregates when exceeding the critical point the adsorption sites on ha saturated and individual silica particles turned to exist in the feed 3 in the foulant layer the dimeric silica gradually bridged with carboxyl group on ha due to the electrostatic effect it first form hydrogen bonds with deprotonated carboxyl groups and then with the protonated ones most of the carboxyl groups were wrapped up when reaching the critical silica concentration and silica silica bridging occurs making a more severe synergistic fouling 4 this study sheds light on the mitigation strategy of the combined fouling of ha and silica keeping silica concentration under the critical point in feed solution and removing carboxyl groups such as through ph controlling or carboxyl groups pre occupying could both be effective

16569,combined organic and inorganic fouling is a primary barrier constraining the performance of reverse osmosis ro membrane in this work we conducted a systematic study focusing on the synergetic fouling effects of silica and humic acid ha in ro process and found the critical silica concentration where the fouling pattern changed qualitatively when the silica concentration was lower than 6 mm at a typical ha concentration of 50 mg l 1 no severe fouling was observed while silica reaching this critical point could cause severe synergetic fouling with ha concentrated silica above the critical point acted as the prior foulant with marginal fouling effect caused by ha a variety of solutions and surface based characterizations were performed to elucidate the synergistic fouling responsibility for silica and ha our study suggests that the carboxylic groups from ha formed hydrogen bonds with silica hydrate inducing silica adsorption onto ha aggregates at low silica particle concentrations the ha network was bridged together to form large foulants due to the silica silica interaction above the silica critical concentration these mechanisms were further confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations this study provides an in depth insight into the combined organic inorganic fouling and can serve as a guideline to optimize feed conditions in order to mitigate fouling of ro in wastewater reusing industry graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse osmosis silica humic acid combined fouling interaction mechanism 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is one of the most important membrane separation technologies in wastewater reclamation and water desalination al mayyahi 2018 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2020a membrane fouling by inorganic and organic matters in feed water is complicated due to the interactions among multiple species and their synergetic contributions xie et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a these synergetic fouling could reduce flux increase operational pressure and energy consumption accelerate cleaning frequency and ultimately shorten the lifespans of membranes higgin et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 lee and elimelech 2007 wang et al 2019 therefore it is critical to understand what is behind fouling phenomena to propose targeted mitigation strategies accordingly in ro process as one of the predominant substances of natural organic matters nom humic acid ha exists widely in natural and engineering water systems including seawater industrial wastewater and hazardous landfill leachate sir et al 2012 wang et al 2019 due to its relatively small molecular weight ha could not be completely removed by ro pretreatments like ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf han et al 2015 lee et al 2000 liu et al 2021 moreover ha could cause the most irreversible membrane fouling compared to polysaccharides and proteins tin et al 2017 thus ha played an important role in ro fouling of seawater desalination and wastewater treatment monruedee et al 2012 moreover the synergistic interaction between ha and some inorganic ions could increase fouling severity and making the fouling more difficult to remove hence it is important to reveal the combined fouling patterns and mechanisms of ha and inorganic compounds among the common inorganic substances that co exist with ha in ro feed the most studied was ca2 and mg2 the complexes formed between ca2 or mg2 and ha could cause aggregation in membrane fouling process in most practical conditions and was not qualitatively sensitive with ions concentrations tang et al 2007 wang et al 2015b yao et al 2012 zhao et al 2019b however as one of the most obstinate inorganic foulants in ro process silica also contributes significantly to scaling in ro lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 silica not only has a stronger enrichment effect on ro membranes compared to ca2 and mg2 wang et al 2019 but also induce irreversible scaling layers which are resistant to chemical cleaning lu et al 2020 xia et al 2015 hence the mixture of silica and ha in ro feed could cause more complex combined fouling several studies have already discussed about the synergistic fouling of ha and colloidal silica for instance studies found an aggravating fouling of mixing colloidal silica and ha in nf process contreras et al 2009 li and elimelech 2006 in another study a ph related synergetic effect was found in ro tests with combined solution of ha and colloidal silica lin 2017 however the chemical characteristics of soluble silica is much more complex than colloidal silica soluble silica could form oligomers and polymers through si o si bonds and it could also aggregate together to form large flocs by hydrogen bonds through hydroxylic groups belton et al 2012 tong et al 2017 hence soluble silica could behave differently compared to colloidal silica in synergistic fouling guo et al 2012 to our best knowledge there has been no systematical study on the combined fouling patterns and mechanisms of soluble silica and ha in ro process for the first time this study aimed to fill the knowledge gap of the synergetic effects of ha and silica on fouling in ro process a series of bench scale filtration experiments were performed using ha and sodium metasilicate as model organic and inorganic foulants respectively the fouling potential was evaluated under different feed concentrations the solution chemistry and membrane foulant components were systemically characterized via a variety of analytical approaches in order to explore the fouling mechanisms at the molecular level the finding was further strengthened through molecular dynamics md simulations a critical silica concentration was found above which dramatic fouling was inevitable and the mechanism behind the fouling pattern was thoroughly investigated this study enhances our understanding of the interaction between silica and ha and its role in ro fouling the outcome of this research has the potential to be applied to predict fouling and determine the strategies to manipulate feed composition in order to retard fouling development 2 method and materials 2 1 materials and chemicals sodium metasilicate nonahydrate na2sio3 9h2o 95 purity ha fulvic acid as the main component above 90 purity were used as model foulants shanghai macklin biochemical co china other chemicals for feed preparation including nacl hcl and naoh were in analytical grade and used without further treatment ultrapure water with resistivity of 18 2 mω was used for all filtration experiments milli q milliporesigma usa ha stock solution 1 g l 1 was prepared with ph adjusted to around 9 by 1 m naoh solution for better dissolution and was filtrated through a 0 7 μm membrane to remove insoluble fractions based on a previous study wang et al 2015b the polyamide thin film composite ro membranes used in the study were cut from a spiral wound module lfc3 hydranautics usa with a water flux of 45 l m 2 h 1 and a salt rejection of 99 7 when testing by 1500 mg l 1 nacl solution at 25 and 1 55 mpa wang et al 2019 the membranes were rinsed by a 25 v v isopropyl alcohol once and ultrapure water for 3 times to remove residual impurities and activate the membrane surface the pretreated membranes were stored in ultrapure water at 4 for later use tong et al 2017 2 2 ro membrane fouling tests we evaluated the fouling properties using solutions with silica concentration of 0 mm 2 mm 4 mm 6 mm 8 mm and 10 mm which were named as blank and si2 to si10 respectively when investigating combined fouling behaviors 50 mg l 1 of ha was added in the feed named as ha and ha si2 to ha si10 respectively we chose 50 mg l 1 as a typical ha concentration based on our pre experiment fig s1 and previous studies cruz silva et al 2019 yang et al 2010 all feed solutions were adjusted to ph of 7 0 0 1 using 1 m naoh and hcl solutions and conductivity of 5600 μs cm 1 equivalent to a 50 mm nacl solution following previous studies before the experiments wang et al 2020b xia et al 2015 the abbreviation and basic characteristics of all tested feed names is provided in table s1 a lab scale crossflow filtration setup scheme s1 was used for fouling tests with an effective membrane area of 20 6 cm2 before each fouling experiment the system was flushed by deionized water for three times then ultrapure water once the membranes were then pre compacted for 12 h with ultrapure water under 1 8 mpa since the pipeline in the setup was composed of two parallel membrane modules two sets of data were collected for each run to minimize random error each filtration cycle was performed under 1 6 mpa for 600 min with a crossflow velocity of 9 4 cm s 1 the permeate flow rate was continuously recorded by a micro flow meter for each module the initial flux of membrane was typically around 50 2 l m 2 h 1 under our test condition after fouling tests the fouled membranes were air dried for 30 min and stored at 4 2 3 feed property

previous study after proper dilution to keep the eem test data under the instrument maximum limit with the scan at excitation of 200 500 nm and emission of 250 600 nm xiao et al 2018 yu et al 2020 the data was processed by matlab 2015b for baseline correction and normalization we also calculated fluorescence quotient fq for each sample xiao et al 2018 for solid state nmr the samples were adjusted to ph of 7 and then freeze dried for 3 days before performing 13c using dipolar dephasing magic angle spinning dd mas method 29si and 1h nmr guan et al 2019 the acid base titration was conducted using a solution composed of 4 mm silica and 1 g l 1 ha for higher resolution this is because the signal from a low concentration ha solution i e 50 mg l 1 used for filtration relatively low molar carboxyl content could be impeded by silica during the titration hong and elimelech 1997 lee and elimelech 2006 wang et al 2015a considering that this test drew only qualitative conclusions it is still relevant to our study and could serve as a backup for other experiments the acid base titration curves were calculated and analyzed by matlab 2015b to get the pk a concentration and distribution of the solutions wang and waite 2009 2 4 membrane property characterizations the fouled membranes were cut into square pieces of 0 5 cm2 for instrumental analysis the surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem merlin compact zeiss germany and atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker germany the functional groups elemental maps and the chemical compositions of the foulant layers were probed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 6700ftir thermo electron china x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi quantera ii ulvac phi japan and electrospray ionization ion trap time of flight mass spectrometry esi tof ms lcms it tof shimadzu japan respectively the ftir data was processed in omnic 7 3 and the 2d cos mapping was visualized by 2dshige software shigeaki morita japan see in si for details about 2d cos ftir analysis noda and ozaki 2004 yan et al 2016 we processed a subtraction and normalization to silica fouled membrane ftir data for a clean baseline see supplementary information the xps data was analyzed by avantage software in which a deconvolution was carried out after calibrating c 1s binding energy to 284 8 ev for the fouled membranes we cut them into 2 cm2 pieces and soaked each piece in 1 ml ultrapure water with 30 min sonication to fully extract soluble fractions the solution was subject to esi tof ms analysis to identify foulant chemical compositions all feed samples were subject to a 15 min ultrasonic pretreatment prior to characterization and the tests were performed at least triplites 2 5 md simulations of the interaction between ha and silica the md simulations were implemented to investigate the interaction between ha and silica molecules the latter were expected to exist in the form of silicate dimer according to the esi tof ms and acid base titration data scheme s2a the stevenson s ha structure were chosen as a model ha molecule in the simulation scheme s2b stevenson 1982 the initial structures of the components were optimized using b3lyp 6 31g and gaussian 16 the simulations were performed using gromacs version 2020 5 software with gromos 54a7 force field at 295 k 1 bar in aqueous phase using v rescale thermostat and a parrinello rahman barostat respectively the time step was set to 2 fs a calculation was taken every 0 5 ps 2 simulations were performed with one ha molecule interacted with 2 case 1 and 20 case 2 silica molecules respectively each simulation lasted for 100 ns to reach an equilibrium the hydrogen bonds were defined as the conditions where the angle of h donor acceptor was 30 and the distance of donor and acceptor was 0 35 nm during the data analysis the binding energy of each interaction was calculated when the bindings were stable in cases 1 and 2 1 and 6 silica molecules were observed to bind with ha respectively the types of hydrogen bonds between ha and silica were studied 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of silica critical concentration several cross flow experiments proved that the flux decline was silica concentration dependent the fouling was not severe and independent of ha addition when silica was 2 mm fig 1 a the feed with only 2 mm silica si2 gave a final flux decline by 4 while the mixed feed of ha and 2 mm silica ha si2 reduced the final flux by 5 with more silica added the combined fouling effect became noticeable fig 1b as the silica concentration increased to 6 mm the mixed feed ha si6 led to a significant flux decline by 46 showing a synergistic effect conversely neither 6 mm silica si6 nor ha solutions alone fouled the membranes so rapidly above this threshold i e silica concentration was 10 mm both silica and mixed feed solutions si10 and ha si10 respectively had similar fouling properties implying that ha played a minor role in the combined fouling process fig 1c we later investigated the fouling under different silica concentrations and 6 mm proved to be the critical concentration when silica participated fouling fig 1d detailed flux curves under other concentrations are shown in fig s2 in the silica fouling tests alone the fouling slightly enhanced as the feed concentration increased from 0 to 6 mm the final normalized flux dropped from 100 to 87 the fluxes decreased to 56 and 37 for 8 mm and 10 mm silica feed at the end of the 600 min filtration experiments respectively when silica and ha coexisted in the feed the fluxes started to deteriorate significantly when the silica concentrations increased to 6 mm due to the strong synergistic effect however after the silica concentration exceeded 8 mm silica became the major foulant no obvious synergistic interaction was observed the above fouling tests showed a critical silica concentration above which the combined fouling by silica and ha were intensified indicating a potential interaction between these two species and the formation of foulant network to support this hypothesis more physicochemical properties of the feed solutions and membrane foulant were investigated as will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 variations of feed solution aggregates with silica concentration 3 2 1 size distribution and microscopic properties of aggregates the solution with only ha showed a featured particle size distribution around 300 nm fig 2 a in the mixed silica and ha feed when the silica concentration was lower than 6 mm the peak shape and position remained basically the same as the ha feed with no additional peaks that represented silica aggregates when silica concentration increased to 6 mm a second smaller peak appeared between 10 and 50 nm the original peak shifted to around 150 nm and has similar shape and patterns to those of low concentration silica solutions the peak shifting above the critical si concentration might be attribute to the ha aggregate structure breaking down due to the steric effect of fully occupied si on ha binding sites the shrinking particle size could lead to severer flux decline which corresponds with our former fouling experiments gwenaelle et al 2017 park et al 2008 the two different size distributions indicated that the ha structure remained unchanged regardless of the existence of silica silica did not aggregate by itself in a low concentration solution but may get adsorbed by the porous structure of ha and dispersed on the ha surface instead when the silica concentration was raised to the critical point i e 6 mm due to the saturation of the ha adsorption sites the free silica self aggregated with bridging effect and hydrogen bonds which contributed to the second peak belton et al 2012 simonsen et al 2009 tem and eds results supported the interaction between ha and silica fig 2b f in the ha feed the aggregates mainly existed in the form of flocculent agglomerates fig 2b while the particles in silica only solution fig 2c were small aggregated granules in the mixed solution of ha and 6 mm silica fig 2d small granular silica was found to be trapped into the porous structures of ha network when the silica concentration increased to 10 mm we observed silica trapped ha aggregates where the si signals were well matched with the carbon and oxygen signals from the ha backbone in eds map fig 2e left and 2c in addition individual silica aggregates were also found figs 2e right and s3 therefore silica was proved to be trapped in the ha network when its concentration was relatively high the eem results of all the samples showed a peak at em of 400 600 nm and ex of 200 500 fig s4 which was indicative of humic and fluvic substances in the mixed ha and silica solution chen et al 2003 a further fq analysis showed a peak at em of 200 230 nm and ex of 300 350 nm in ha si6 sample fig 3 b the red circle this peak was not observed in low silica concentration samples 2 mm in fig 3a and 4 mm in fig s5a but became salient as silica increased 8 mm in fig s5b and 10 mm in fig 3c this fq peak was overlapped with an identified area with high fouling potential regions highlighted by gray dash in fig 3a c at em of 200 280 nm and ex of 280 330 nm xiao et al 2018 thus we could infer the interaction discipline by combining this morphology and fluorescence result with the former filtration tests when the silica concentration exceeded the threshold of 6 mm silica filled the empty pockets of ha and a more complicated network with large fouling potential formed 3 2 2 chemical characteristics of aggregates the mentioned interaction between silica and ha was further identified by solid state nmr and acid base titration the chemical shifts of 13c in the solid state nmr spectrum of ha were influenced by its chemical environment fig 4 a the main peaks in the ha spectrum were at 27 ppm 125 ppm and 178 ppm which corresponded to aliphatic c aromatic c and carboxyl c respectively almendros et al 2016 mathers and xu 2003 notably the carboxyl peak at 178 ppm detected in the ha sample was not found in the mixed ha silica sample this illustrated that the existence of silica was able to interact with the carboxyl groups in ha and change the chemical environment similarly in the hydrogen nmr spectrum the peak featuring carboxylic hydrogen at 13 ppm vanished when silica was added into the ha solution fig 4b the disappearance of the carboxylic signals indicated a shielding effect by the surrounding silica the 29si spectrum conversely showed marginal difference between pure silica feed and mixed solution with ha the peaks of both spectrums lied around 101 ppm and 110 ppm which corresponded to q3 and q4 types of silica respectively fig 4c see structures of silica species in scheme s3 dogan et al 2009 gunawidjaja et al 2010 hung et al 2021 this implied that the interaction with ha did not change the silicate chemical environment notably according to the research of mi and elimelech the silica particle in forward osmosis formed hydrogen bonds with carboxylic groups on the polyamide membrane surface which was consistent to our findings mi and elimelech 2013 we conducted an acid base titration to confirm the interaction between acidic groups mainly carboxyl and silica fig 4d the total acidic concentration of a 4 mm silica solution was 2 5 mm the solution showed a partial dimerization of silica the pk a was located mainly around 9 8 which was in accordance with the pk a of silica in the form of small oligomers and monomer belton et al 2012 in ha solution the pk a was found around 4 7 and 5 9 representing mainly carboxylic groups a small portion of pk a of 8 and 8 5 were phenol groups lee and elimelech 2006 in the mixed solution both acidic groups at pk a 9 8 representing silica and groups around 4 7 5 7 representing ha carboxyl were detected with lowered intensity these indicated the coupling and masking effect between silica and the carboxylic groups in ha which was in accordance with the nmr test results the solution zeta potential test also corroborated this conclusion as ha samples mixed with silica were less negatively charged at ph 7 which was due to the occupation of negatively charged coo groups by silica fig s6 taheri et al 2013 in summary in the mixed silica and ha solution silica tended to interact with the carboxylic groups of the ha backbone which resulted in the chemical environment changes in these regions as identified by solid state nmr and acid base titration the interaction was probably hydrogen bonds according to the experimental results and previous works mi and elimelech 2013 at low silica concentration because of extra carboxylic binding sites no significant structural changes in ha was observed when the silica concentration exceeded 6 mm the binding sites for the carboxylic groups were saturated and there were free silica aggregates at this point these fully silica loaded ha may cause enhanced fouling due to the interaction between silica 3 3 variations of foulant layers with silica concentration 3 3 1 morphology of foulant layers silica and ha resulted in two completely different surfaces after fouling as identified by afm and sem figs 5 and 6 s7 and s8 and table s2 the presence of ha in feed smoothened the fouled surface remarkably compared with the silica fouled membrane as shown in fig 5a and b where the root mean square roughness r q was 85 9 nm for si6 vs 46 3 nm for ha si6 on the other hand the increasing concentration of silica increased the surface roughness irrespective of ha and the largest rq leap occurred just above the critical silica concentration i e silica concentration between 6 mm and 10 mm with or without ha presence fig 5c which indicate a notable change in foulant layer structure the sem images further confirmed the difference between silica and ha figs 6 and s8 when silica was dominant the roughness as well as the morphology was close to fouling with silica only at low silica concentrations the foulant layer was more flattened by ha additionally the sem figures also provided more details during the silica fouling low silica concentrations led to local fouling leaving a portion of bare original ro membrane in the gaps of the fouling structure with the concentration increasing the fouling layer became rougher and covered the whole membrane surface which could be the cause of the nosedive of membrane flux when ha existed the foulant layers covered the entire membrane surface regardless of the silica concentrations 3 3 2 chemical compositions of foulant layers the fouling layers were characterized by ftir xps and esi tof ms for further understanding of the fouling mechanism the ftir data showed q3 silica was dominated in the foulant layer compared to q2 and q4 species fig s9a and table s3 carboxyl related peaks in ha fouled membranes were found at 1200 1600 cm 1 fig 7 a for details see table s3 and fig s9a guan et al 2019 qin et al 2017 simonsen et al 2009 yoon et al 2004 zhao et al 2011 based on the foregoing hypothesis of the potential interaction between ha carboxylic groups and silica we conducted a 2d cos ftir analysis for deeper understanding of this process at variant silica concentrations fig 7b and c the basically positive value in the synchronous map fig 7b and the declined trend in absorbance with increasing silica concentrations in 1 d spectrum fig 7a indicated a general and synchronous shielding effect to the ha structure by silica the peaks related with carboxyl groups in the asynchronous map the lower left region of fig 7b and table 1 had basically the same sign with those in the synchronous map which means that the lower wavenumber peaks basically changed after the higher wavenumber peaks i e follow the sequence of νas coo 1584 cm 1 νs coo 1413 cm 1 ν oh cooh 1295 cm 1 ν cooh 1240 cm 1 guan et al 2019 noda and ozaki 2004 this demonstrated that the interaction between silica and ha possibly hydrogen bonds first took place on deprotonated carboxylic groups rather than protonated groups due to the negative charging and higher electron cloud density the xps c1s spectrums of fouled membranes showed that the carbon composition in the foulant mainly existed in the form of ch co c o and carboxylic groups figs 8 a c and s10a these peaks were related with ha and centered around 284 8 ev 286 5 ev 287 2 ev 288 4 ev respectively chu et al 2016 monteil rivera et al 2000 you et al 2016 the deconvoluted areas of these peaks in different samples are compared in fig 8d overall the intensity of these components declined as silica concentration increased among all the functional groups the carboxylic groups underwent the sharpest drop with more silica added which is another indication confirming the interaction between silica and carboxyl shown in fig 8a c in orange arrows it is worth noticing that the most evident decrease in the carboxylic signal took place when the silica concentration crossed 6 mm which corresponded with the critical concentration of silica in the fouling test as well as the afm tests mentioned before the xps spectrum of silica foulant with and without ha fig s10b showed similar peaks after deconvolution this shows the silica structure remained unchanged as indicated by the previous nmr tests the two 10 mm silica samples with and without ha had a major peak around 103 8 ev representing si o si bonds higher than others with a peak around 103 4 ev representing sio2 nh2o crist 2000 simonsen et al 2009 this implied a stronger silica self crosslinking and dehydration effect with a high silica concentration esi tof ms was used to resolve structure of silica species of the silica ha interaction fig s11 identified that the prominent particles in the negative spectrum were nah4si2o7 2h2o with a m z of 231 1 and the main signal in positive spectrum were na3si2o5 with a m z of 205 1 this result indicated that the monomer silica was converted to dimer through polymerization which could also be evidenced by the foregoing titration result fig 4d and scheme s2a in summary silica in the foulant layer existed in the form of q3 silica in solid phase the dominant stable species was found to be silicate dimer when ro membranes were fouled with ha and silica simultaneously silica interacted with the carboxylic groups of ha as the feed silica concentration increased it first bridged with deprotonated then protonated carboxylic groups with hydrogen bonds 3 4 md simulations of ha and silica interaction the md simulation revealed that the interaction between ha and silica was through hydrogen bonds fig 9 in both cases 1 fig 9a with 1 ha molecule interact with 2 si molecules and 2 fig 9b and c with 1 ha molecule interact with 20 molecules silica molecules were able to interact with ha the extra self aggregated silica in case 2 fig 9c and the formed clusters further interacted with ha which confirmed our hypothesis of the bridging effect of silica fig 9b silica bound multiple sites on the ha backbone including hydroxyl oh ether o carboxyl cooh amide conr2 and carbonyl co groups the carboxyl group proved to be the dominant functional group to bind silica in both cases as shown in fig 9d in case 1 each carboxyl group averagely formed 0 0062 hydrogen bond during the entire 100 ns simulation while in case 2 this number increased to 0 087 due to the enriched silica density the binding energy showed the si ha and si si interactions were thermodynamically favorable the averaged binding energies between si and ha was 21 88 kj mol 1 and 33 27 kj mol 1 in cases 1 and 2 respectively the averaged binding energy between two si aggregates containing 2 molecules was 12 46 kj mol 1 detail in table s4 this result showed that the interaction between ha and si were more favorable at higher si concentrations 4 conclusions in this study the systematical fouling patterns between ha and silica were analyzed and the critical point of silica concentration was found the underlying interaction mechanisms between ha and silica were revealed by multiscale solution and surface based characterization approaches the following conclusions were drawn 1 the critical concentration of silica was 6 mm at a 50 mg l 1 of ha concentration the fouling was not severe with silica concentration below this threshold but serious synergetic fouling was found when silica concentration reached this point a further increased silica concentration made no further severe synergistic fouling 2 ha existed as porous flocs in feed solution and silica below the critical point could adsorb upon the aggregates when exceeding the critical point the adsorption sites on ha saturated and individual silica particles turned to exist in the feed 3 in the foulant layer the dimeric silica gradually bridged with carboxyl group on ha due to the electrostatic effect it first form hydrogen bonds with deprotonated carboxyl groups and then with the protonated ones most of the carboxyl groups were wrapped up when reaching the critical silica concentration and silica silica bridging occurs making a more severe synergistic fouling 4 this study sheds light on the mitigation strategy of the combined fouling of ha and silica keeping silica concentration under the critical point in feed solution and removing carboxyl groups such as through ph controlling or carboxyl groups pre occupying could both be effective
