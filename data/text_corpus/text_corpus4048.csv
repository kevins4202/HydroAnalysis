20240,the bubbly flows have always been a key research object in the field of multiphase simulations however when the bubbly flows become violent to cause the large deformations of bubbles complex interfaces may be generated and bring great challenges to the traditional mesh based methods to overcome this challenge one of the most commonly used mesh free particle methods moving particles semi implicit mps method is adopted in this paper for the numerical simulations of bubbly flows with complex interfaces firstly a multiphase mps method is developed by combining the single phase improved mps imps method proposed in our previous study with different multiphase models including the improved density smoothing scheme interparticle viscosity model continuous acceleration model surface tension model incompressible compressible model and multiphase collision model then the deformations of 2d 3d square droplets are simulated to validate the surface tension model and the multiphase mps method is verified through the benchmark cases of 2d 3d single bubble rising with large density and viscosity ratios up to 1000 and 100 respectively finally a series of bubbly flows with increasing complexity are performed including the bubble rising and breaking at a high reynolds number the co axial coalescence of two bubbles with different radiuses and the violent interactions between a set of bubbles the mps results keep fair agreements with other numerical and experimental results through which the advantages of the present multiphase mps method in bubbly flows with complex interfaces can be well demonstrated keywords mps numerical simulation multiphase flows bubbly flows complex interface 1 introduction the bubbly flows are not only a kind of complex flow phenomenon commonly found in nature but also play important roles in various industrial processes such as the oil production massoud et al 2020 chen et al 2020 underwater explosion klaseboer et al 2005 yu et al 2021 ship wake zhang and liu 2020 murai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 etc a better understanding of the dynamic characteristics of bubbly flows would be great help to the optimization of industrial processes and design of more efficient and economical equipment during the past decades bubbly flows have been widely investigated using advanced experimental facilities and measuring techniques for example trevorrow et al 1994 employed the acoustic experimental techniques for the bubble wake measurements behind three surface ships and it is found that the wake bubbles last as strong acoustic scatterers for approximately 7 5 min with a maximum width of 60 m the bubbles in a cbm wellbore annulus are detected by wu et al 2018 using a bubble probe designed based on the apparent difference in conductivity between two media according to the results of bubble detection the two phase flow patterns can be well monitored and the mean density of the two phase flow is obtained abbaszadeh et al 2021 proposed a new bubbly flow measurement procedure based on the optical scattering behavior of a laser beam passing through a bubbly flow which can be successfully applied to capture the bubbly wake of ship models in the towing tank tests abbaszadeh et al 2020 given the complexity and high cost of experimental research a variety of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the volume of fluid vof level set ls and front tracking ft are introduced into the numerical simulations of bubbly flows and proven capable to obtain additional information and insight annaland et al 2005 croce et al 2010 pan and chen 2014 ma et al 2020 tian et al 2021 however an important common feature of the above cfd methods is that they all belong to mesh based methods in which the discretization of fluid domain is implemented in a eulerian mesh system to trace the phase interfaces in the mesh system complex interface capturing or front tracking algorithms need to be executed at each time step which brings two main deficiencies firstly the implementation of these algorithms is in fact to reconstruct the interfaces thus additional computational errors are inevitably produced during this process secondly when the bubbly flows are violent to cause the large deformations of bubbles complex interfaces may be generated and bring great challenges to the accuracy of these algorithms in recent decades the mesh free methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 and moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 koshizuka et al 1998 have been proposed as the next generation of cfd methods different from the mesh based methods the discretization of fluid domain in mesh free methods is carried out by the use of a set of interacting particles the motions of particles follow the governing equations in lagrangian description and there is no constant topology relationship existing between particles from the distribution of particles the interfaces can be directly obtained without special algorithms therefore the mesh free methods are particularly feasible in dealing with multiphase problems with complex interfaces in the field of bubbly flows an early research is conducted by colagrossi and landrini 2003 in which the rising and breaking of a single bubble are simulated by sph method and the captured interface shows a good agreement with the results of level set with an improved multi fluid sph formulation grenier et al 2013 performed the simulations of various bubbly flows including the evolution of an isolated bubble the merging of two bubbles and the oil water separation process in all cases good agreements are achieved between sph results and reference solutions moreover the influence of bond number on the evolutions of bubbly flows is well analyzed considering that most of existing researches focused on 2d simulations zhang et al 2015 and duan et al 2017 investigated the dynamic behaviors of 3d bubbly flows with the multiphase sph and mps methods respectively in mps method a semi implicit algorithm is adopted and the pressure field is calculated by solving the poisson pressure equation ppe thus the incompressibility of fluids can be guaranteed and the simulation is more stable than sph method which adopts an explicit algorithm based on the equation of state eos since it was originally proposed by koshizuka and oka 1996 the mps method has been widely used in violent free surface flows khayyer and gotoh 2008 zhang et al 2014 tang et al 2016 zhang and wan 2018 however due to its short history the development of multiphase methods in mps is immature and the applications of mps method in bubbly flows are far less extensive than that of the mesh based method or sph method moreover the calculation efficiency of mps method is greatly limited by the huge computational cost on neighbor particle searching and ppe solving thus it is difficult to deal with the more complicated calculation process and the sharp increase of particle number when extended to multiphase flows in this paper a multiphase mps method would be firstly developed by introducing a set of multiphase models into the single phase improved mps imps method proposed in our previous studies zhang and wan 2012 2017 specially the improved density smoothing scheme and interparticle viscosity model shakibaeinia and jin 2012 are adopted to solve the instability and inaccuracy caused by abrupt drop of density and viscosity across the phase interface then the continuous acceleration model duan et al 2017 is applied to keep the continuity of acceleration field which is important for multiphase problems with high density ratios in order to reproduce the bubble deformation surface tension effects are considered by the use of continuum surface force csf model brackbill et al 1992 moreover an incompressible compressible model khayyer and gotoh 2016 is employed to solve the liquid and bubble phases as incompressible and compressible respectively the multiphase collision model shakibaeinia and jin 2012 is adopted to deal with possible particle collisions and keep the uniform particle distribution finally the gpu graphics processing unit acceleration technique chen and wan 2019 developed in our previous study for single phase simulations is extended and applied thus the present multiphase mps method is capable to simulate large scale 3d bubbly flows with more than two million particles with the proposed multiphase mps method a series of bubbly flows with increasing complexity are simulated with a wide range from 2d to 3d and from single bubble to multiple bubbles firstly in consideration of its importance in bubbly flows the surface tension model is validated through the simulations of deformations of 2d 3d square droplets then the multiphase mps method is applied to sumulate 2d 3d single bubble rising with large density and viscosity ratios up to 1000 and 100 respectively and the numerical results are compared with the benchmark results hysing et al 2008 alexander et al 2014 given that the reynolds number in the benchmark study is relatively low re 35 the bubble rising and breaking at a high reynolds number re 35843 is further studied afterwards the bubbly flows with two or multiple bubbles are respectively simulated in which the interfaces become more complex due to the violent interactions between bubbles the expected advantage of multiphase mps method in capturing complex interfaces is demonstrated by comparison with other numerical and experimental results moreover the relationship between the interface evolution and the bond number is investigated and the mechanism of dynamic behaviors of bubbly flows is analyzed in detail 2 multiphase mps method 2 1 governing equations in mps method the motion of particles is governed by the continuity and momentum equations in lagrangian form koshizuka and oka 1996 written as 1 d ρ d t ρ u 2 ρ d u d t p f v f b f s where ρ u and p are the density velocity and pressure respectively p f v f b and f s denote the pressure gradient viscous force body force and surface tension force which are the four main forces in the bubbly flows studied in this paper in the present multiphase mps method the multiphase system is considered as a single fluid system thus the governing equations for different phases are uniform and can be solved simultaneously to deal with the abrupt drop of density and viscosity across the phase interface the multi density and multi viscosity models are employed in the multi density model an improved density smoothing scheme is proposed on the basis of the scheme of shakibaeinia and jin 2012 which realizes the smooth transition of density field by performing the spatial weighted averaging of density for particles near the phase interface as shown in fig 1 with the improved scheme the smoothed density field can be obtained by 3 ρ i ρ i w s e l f j i ρ j w r i j r e w s e l f j i w r i j r e where i includes the target particle i and all its neighboring particles w self is a weight function to amplify the effect of the target particle itself on the smoothed density through which the sharpness of density variation across the phase interface can be better preserved in the multi viscosity model the interparticle viscosity with a harmonic mean form shakibaeinia and jin 2012 is employed to substitute the real particle viscosity so that the viscous force between particles of different phases can be accurately calculated with the interparticle viscosity the viscous force term in eq 2 can be calculated according to the following formation 4 f v μ 2 u 2 d n 0 λ j i 2 μ i μ j μ i μ j u j u i w r i j r e 2 2 particle interaction models particle interaction models in mps method are utilized to discretize the differential operators in governing equations consisted of gradient model divergence model and laplacian models koshizuka and oka 1996 which are respectively defined as 5 φ i d n 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i w r i j r e 6 φ i d n 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i w r i j r e 7 2 φ i 2 d n 0 λ j i φ j φ i w r i j r e where φ is an arbitrary scalar function ф is an arbitrary vector d is the number of space dimensions n 0 is the particle number density at initial arrangement λ is a parameter defined as 8 λ j i w r i j r e r j r i 2 j i w r i j r e which is applied to keep the variance increase equal to that of the analytical solution the kernel function w r ij r e used here is the nonsingular one suggested by zhang and wan 2012 9 w r i j r e r e 0 85 r i j 0 15 r e 1 0 r r e 0 r e r where r and r e represent the particle distance and the largest radius of the particle interaction respectively when the particle distance is larger than a certain threshold the kernel function becomes zero value and no interaction exists the improved kernel function obtains a finite value when the particle distance is equal to zero thus the singularity problem of the original kernel function koshizuka and oka 1996 can be avoided 2 3 semi implicit algorithm in mps method a semi implicit algorithm is utilized to keep the incompressibility of fluid in which each time step is subdivided into two separate steps in the first step also called prediction step the temporal velocity field is explicitly calculated according to viscosity gravity and surface tension forces in the second step also called correction step the poisson pressure equation ppe is solved to obtain the pressure field with which the velocity and location of particles are finally updated to the next time step in this paper we employ the improved ppe with a mixed source term which is firstly proposed by tanaka and masunaga 2010 and rewritten by lee et al 2011a 10 2 p n 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t u i γ ρ δ t 2 n i n 0 n 0 where γ is a blending parameter less than 1 the source term on the right hand of eq 10 represents a combination of the divergence free incompressible condition and the particle number density incompressible condition respectively which proves to be effective to suppress the pressure oscillations in original mps method to consider the compressibility of bubble phase an incompressible compressible model is included in the present multiphase mps method by introducing a compressible term into the source term of ppe similar with the studies of khayyer and gotoh 2016 and duan el al 2017 the compressible term derived from equation of state eos is adopted with which the formation of ppe turns into 11 2 p k 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t u i γ ρ δ t 2 n k i n 0 n 0 1 δ t 2 c s 2 p i n 1 where c s is the speed of sound moreover the compressible term could be moved to the left hand side of ppe in the solution process thus the diagonal elements of the ppe matrix become larger and the stability of pressure calculation can be improved tanaka and masunaga 2010 2 4 continuous acceleration model for the bubbly flow with high density ratio a huge discrepancy of acceleration may exist on two sides of the phase interface according to the original pressure gradient model of eq 5 the pressure gradient forces between a pair of interacting particles have the same value when the two particles belong to different phases the acceleration of the lighter particle would be much larger than that of the heavier particle due to the high density ratio generating a discontinuous acceleration field which may cause blow up instability in the present multiphase mps method the continuous acceleration model duan et al 2017 is employed to improve the stability in simulations of bubbly flows with high density ratios the main ideal of this model is to introduce the concept of interparticle density into both the pressure gradient model and the ppe solving firstly an improved pressure gradient model with the interparticle density should be adopted written as 12 2 ρ i ρ j p i d n 0 j i 2 p j p i ρ i ρ j r j r i r j r i 2 w r i j r e d n 0 j i p i p i min ρ i r j r i r j r i 2 w r i j r e where p i min represents the minimal pressure among the same phase neighboring particles of particle i the first term on the right hand of eq 12 is a modified form of the original pressure gradient model in which the use of interparticle density guarantees an identical acceleration for the lighter and heavier particles as shown in fig 2 when the density ratio is equal to 1 1000 the acceleration ratio calculated by original model is also 1 1000 while the improved model can obtain the same particle acceleration on two sides of interface and keep the continuity of acceleration field the second term on the right hand of eq 12 can be regarded as a particle stabilizing term pst which exerts an artificial force on target particles with a direction from the dense particle region to the dilute region thus the uniform distribution of particles can be better maintained moreover in the transition region the pressure field suffers from great changes due to the rapid variation of density field therefore a large pressure gradient may be generated and causes the violent movement of particles especially for the lighter particles in order to keep the smoothness of pressure field the ppe with inter particle density is adopted in the present multiphase mps method with which the left hand side of ppe can be discretized as 13 2 ρ i ρ j 2 p n 1 i 2 d n 0 λ j i 2 ρ i ρ j p j n 1 p i n 1 w r i j r e 2 5 surface tension model surface tension force has important influence on the deformation of bubble in the present multiphase mps method the surface tension model follows the continuum surface force csf model proposed by brackbill et al 1992 which is also one of the most widely used surface tension models in mesh based or mesh free methods in csf model the surface tension force is converted into a kind of body force distributed in the transition region as shown in fig 3 the value of surface tension force can be calculated with the following equation 14 f s σ κ c where σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the interface curvature c is the gradient of color function in this paper the density weighted color function zhang et al 2015 is employed to keep the continuity of surface tension force which is defined as 15 c ij 0 if particle i and j belong to the same phase 2 ρ i ρ i ρ j if particle i and j belong to different phase as to the calculation of interface curvature κ the analytical method proposed in the contoured continuum surface force ccsf model duan et al 2015 is applied the main ideal of this method is to approximate phase interfaces by the contours of smoothed color function fig 4 in the first step the smoothed color function f at an arbitrary location x y can be obtained by performing a spatial weighted averaging of the above color function 16 f x y j c j g r i j r s j g r i j r s g r i j r s 9 π r s 2 exp 9 r i j 2 r s 2 with the smoothed color function known the local contour passing through particle i can be obtained through a taylor series expansion 17 f x i x x i f y i y y i 1 2 f x x i x x i 2 f x y i x x i y y i 1 2 f yy i y y i 2 0 where the subscripts x and y represent the partial derivatives with respect to x and y respectively finally the interface curvature at particle i can be analytically calculated as 18 κ i y 1 y i 3 2 2 f x i f y i f x y i f x i 2 f y y i f y i 2 f x x i f x i 2 f y i 2 3 2 moreover the above derivation is also be applicable for 3d model the only difference is that the derivatives of smoothed color function with respect to variable z should be considered therefore the mean curvature in 3d model can be calculated as 19 κ i f x x i f y i 2 f z i 2 f y y i f x i 2 f z i 2 f z z i f x i 2 f y i 2 2 f x i f y i f x y i f x i f z i f x z i f y i f z i f y z i f x i 2 f y i 2 f z i 2 3 2 2 6 multiphase collision model when particle distance becomes too small the uniform distribution of particles is no longer satisfied and unphysical penetrations between different phases are likely to occur in the present method the multiphase collision model shakibaeinia and jin 2012 is employed to exert an additional repulsive force when particle distance is below a certain threshold this model considers the collision of particles as the collision of two spheres with different masses initially different particles are uniformly distributed with an constant distance l 0 if the distance between any two particles becomes smaller than α times of l 0 during the simulation the particle collision is assumed to happen and the velocities of particles are corrected based on the following equations 20 u i u i 1 ρ i 1 ε ρ i ρ j ρ i ρ j u i j n 21 u j u j 1 ρ j 1 ε ρ i ρ j ρ i ρ j u i j n where u i is the velocity vector of particles after collision u i j n is the normal relative velocity of particles i and j and ε is the collision ratio 2 7 boundary conditions the wall boundary conditions in mps include the free slip and no slip wall conditions to impose the boundary conditions the concept of mirror particle lee et al 2011b is introduced to replace the wall and dummy particles in the calculation of viscous force the positions of mirror particles are symmetrical to corresponding fluid particles about the wall and the velocities of mirror particles are calculated with the follow equations 1 free slip condition 22 u mirror t u i t u mirror n 2 u w u i n 2 no slip condition 23 u mirror t 2 u w u i t u mirror n 2 u w u i n where n and t are the normal and tangential vectors to the wall respectively the subscripts mirror w and i represent the mirror wall and corresponding fluid particles respectively 2 8 gpu acceleration technique due to its multi core architecture gpu graphics processing unit is quite suitable for large scale parallel computing and has been widely applied in high performance computing crespo et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 chow et al 2018 for mps method the gpu acceleration technique has been successfully applied in the simulations of single phase flows hori et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 xie et al 2020 however up to now there have been few studies on the applications of gpu in the multiphase mps simulations in this paper the gpu acceleration technique developed based on the imps method chen and wan 2019a 2019b 2019b is further extended into the present multiphase mps method fig 5 shows the flowchart of multiphase mps method with gpu acceleration technique as it can be seen both cpu and gpu are utilized but with different tasks the cpu works as a host part to deal with logical works environment configuration instructions for setting parallelism and communicating data between cpu and gpu the gpu works as a device part which is responsible for all the parallel computing benefiting from simultaneous solution of different phase in this paper the calculation processes of single phase and multiphase mps method are basically consistent except for the insertion of above multi phase models thus the speedup of gpu in multiphase simulation can be considered as the same as that in single phase simulation 3 numerical simulations 3 1 deformations of 2d 3d square droplets the surface tension model is critical to simulate bubbly flows with deformed interfaces to validate the surface tension model in the present multiphase mps method deformations of 2d 3d square droplets are simulated in this section the initial conditions for 2d 3d cases are shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b respectively in 2d case an initial square droplet with a length of 0 4 m on each side is arranged in the middle of the calculation domain with a size of 1 m 1 m the densities of droplet and surrounding fluids are both 1 kg m3 and the dynamic viscosities are both 0 2 m2 s the surface tension coefficient is σ 1 n m and the gravitational force is ignored all boundary conditions are set as no slip wall the initial condition in 3d case is similar with the 2d case but the droplet and calculation domain are expanded into 3d in both cases the fluid pressures along the horizontal ordinate are measured and recorded the deformations of 2d square droplet simulated by multiphase mps method are presented in fig 7 as it can be seen due to the relatively larger interface curvature four corners of the square droplet are firstly drove by surface tension force at t 0 07 s and the four edges move away from the center of droplet then the droplet continues to deform and gradually turns into an almost perfect circle at t 1 s according to the laplace law the pressure inside the droplet is expected to be higher than that of the surrounding fluid after the fluid field becomes stable for 2d droplet the pressure drop can be estimated as 24 δ p p a p b σ r σ π l where r is the final radius of the droplet according to eq 24 the theoretical value of pressure drop in this case is equal to 4 431 pa in fig 8 the pressure distribution and pressure drop predicted by multiphase mps method are presented and compared with the theoretical results from the pressure distribution in fig 8 a obvious pressure drop can be observed between the droplet and surrounding fluid and in fig 8 b a good agreement is achieved between the calculated pressure profiles with the theoretical value from laplace law the simulation results of 3d square droplet s deformation are shown in fig 9 from the droplet deformations presented in fig 9 a c similar trend with the 2d case can be observed at t 0 12 s the eight corners of the 3d droplet are firstly drove by surface tension force and six faces move away from the center of droplet at t 1 s the droplet becomes an almost perfect sphere droplet fig 9 d compares the calculated pressure profiles with the theoretical value noted that in 3d case the formulation used to calculate the pressure drop becomes 25 δ p p a p b 2 σ r 2 σ 4 π 3 3 l therefore the theoretical value of pressure drop in 3d case is equal to 8 056 pa again the calculated pressure profiles show a good agreement with the theoretical value validating the accuracy of surface tension model in the present multiphase mps method 3 2 benchmark tests of 2d 3d single bubble rising the single bubble rising is the simplest but also the most common bubbly flow in nature in this section the simulations of 2d 3d single bubble rising are carried out and the performance of multiphase mps method is investigated the initial configurations are set to be identical with the 2d benchmark study by hysing et al 2008 and the 3d benchmark study by adelsberger et al 2014 as shown in fig 10 in 2d case a circular bubble with the diameter d 0 5 m is initially centered at 0 5 0 5 in a 1 2 rectangular container the no slip boundary condition is imposed on the top and bottom walls while the free slip boundary condition is imposed on the vertical sidewalls in 3d case a sphere bubble with the diameter d 0 5 m is initially centered at 0 5 0 5 0 5 in the 1 1 2 cuboid container and all boundaries are set as no slip wall the gravity acceleration is g 0 98 m s2 and points downwards the physical properties of fluids keep the same as the case 2 of the benchmark study in which the density ratio 1000 1 and viscosity ratio 100 1 are relatively higher and the phase interface is more complex in both 2d and 3d cases the two main non dimensional numbers in bubble dynamics including the reynolds number re and bond number bo also known as eotvos number eo are equal to 35 and 125 respectively for bubbly flows the reynolds number representing the ratio of inertial to viscous effects and the bond number which gives the ratio of gravitational forces to surface tension effects are defined as 26 re ρ 1 g d 3 μ 1 b o ρ 1 g d 2 σ from the above definition it can be seen that with the increase of reynolds number the inertial force becomes more dominant than the viscous force which means that the movement of bubble would be more violent with the increase of bond number the inertial force become more dominant than the surface tension force thus more severe deformation would occur during the bubble rising considering that the advantage of multiphase mps method is more significant in the violent flows with complex interfaces the bubble rising at high reynolds number will be further studied in section 3 3 and the bubbly flow with increasing bond number will be studied in section 3 4 and section 3 5 time evolution of bubble shape in 2d rising problem is presented in fig 11 due to the large bond number surface tension effects are weak in this case and the bubble experiences strong deformations during the rising process especially in the later stage where the breakup of bubble is observed and two tiny bubbles are separated from the skirt part of the main bubble the interface captured by multiphase mps method is compared with benchmark results and a good agreement can be observed fig 12 plots the quantitative results calculated by different methods including the center of mass and rise velocity of bubble compared with sph sun et al 2015 and mmps ca duan et al 2017 methods the multiphase mps method gives more consistent results with benchmark results besides the severe oscillations of rise velocity observed in other mesh free methods are not found in the multiphase mps results validating the stability of present method fig 13 shows the time evolution of bubble shape in 3d rising problem similarly the 3d bubble experiences a large deformation due to the relatively high bond number and weak surface tension effects however the breakup of bubble observed in previous 2d case does not occur in present 3d simulation which shows a good agreement with the 3d benchmark results adelsberger et al 2014 in the early stage of its buoyant motion the 3d bubble deforms fast and turns into a dimpled cap at t 1 s afterwards the diameter of bubble in the vertical direction gradually decreases while the diameter in the horizontal direction increases finally the shape of bubble is located in the dimpled ellipsoidal cap regime at t 3 5 s being same as the benchmark results in fig 14 the shapes of 3d bubble simulated by multiphase mps method at several typical time instants are compared with the benchmark results which is obtained by three different solvers including drops nast3d and openfoam adelsberger et al 2014 in general the result of multiphase mps method show a better agreement with the results of drops and openfoam the main difference is observed on the bottom edge of bubble where the interface curvature is large the center of mass and rise velocity are presented and compared in fig 15 the center of mass calculated by multiphase mps method agrees well with benchmark result and more accurate rise velocity can be predicted compared with mmps ca and mmps hd methods duan et al 2017 in summary the multiphase mps method proposed in this paper can be well validated through the above simulations of 2d and 3d single bubble rising there are some slight differences between mps results and benchmark results such as the profile of bubble edge and the evolution of tiny bubbles formed after bubble breaking however considering that these local deformations bring great challenges to numerical methods and even the three mesh based methods used in benchmark study obtained different results the results in present work are regarded as acceptable 3 3 bubble rising and breaking with high reynolds number it should be noted that in the simulations of section 3 2 the viscosities of fluids are large and the gravity is small resulting in low reynolds number in order to further examine the capacity of multiphase mps method in more violent bubbly flows with high reynolds number the rising and breaking of a single bubble in the low viscosity liquid which corresponds to the experimental study of walters and davidson 1962 are simulated and analyzed in this section the initial configuration is presented in fig 16 where the bubble with a radius r 0 0254 m is located in the middle of the container with a width of 10r and a height of 12r the distance from the center of bubble to the container bottom is 4 r the fluids inside and outside of the bubble are water and air respectively the density and viscosity of water phase are 1000 kg m3 and 0 001 pa s while the density and viscosity of the air bubble are 1 kg m3 and 1 77 10 5 pa s therefore the density and viscosity ratios in this case reach up to 1000 and 56 5 the surface tension coefficient is 0 0728 n m and the gravity acceleration is g 9 8 m s2 according to the parameters and fluid properties the reynolds number in this case is up to 35843 the mps snapshots of bubble shapes at some typical time instants are presented in fig 17 and compared with experimental snapshots provided in the study of walters and davidson 1962 due to the extremely high reynolds number the deformation of bubble observed in present case are more violent than the above benchmark tests in its rising process the bubble firstly deforms into a horseshoe shape due to the upwelling water motion below the bubble t 0 1375 s subsequently the cavity gradually grows and the bubble was continuously elongated at t 0 2375 s the breakup of bubble occurs and two small bubbles are separated from the main bubble besides some satellite droplets are formed during the bubble breaking process after that the bottom edge of bubble shrink upward rapidly due to the large interface curvature and the bubble turns into a cap shape finally from the comparison between numerical and experimental results a good agreement can be observed proving that the complex interfaces in bubbly flows can still be accurately captured by multiphase mps method even if the reynolds number is high fig 18 shows the quantitative results obtained by multiphase mps method in the high reynolds number problem and the comparison with sph sun et al 2015 and experimental results walters and davidson 1962 the quantitative results include the position of the top of bubble and the thickness at the axis of symmetry of bubble which represent the characteristics of bubble motion and deformation respectively from the comparisons it can be seen that both multiphase mps method and sph method are able to accurately predict the bubble characteristics and the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data 3 4 co axial coalescence of two bubbles with different radiuses when the bubbly flow contains more than one bubble the interaction between different bubbles may lead to larger bubble deformation and more complex evolution of interfaces in this section the co axial coalescence of two bubbles with different radiuses are simulated by multiphase mps method and the bubble interaction is investigated the initial configuration is displayed in fig 19 which is also used in the studies of grenier et al 2013 and duan et al 2017 two close bubbles are located on the same vertical line inside a 1 0 m 1 5 m rectangular container filled with pure water the radiuses of lower and upper bubbles are r 0 1 m and 1 5r 0 15 m respectively the densities of liquid and bubble phases are 1000 kg m3 and 100 kg m3 thus the density ratio is equal to 10 in this case the viscosities of liquid and bubble phases are 0 156 kg m s and 0 078 kg m s respectively three cases with different surface tension coefficients are considered including 49 n m 4 9 n m and 1 96 n m corresponding to the bond number of 8 80 and 200 respectively fig 20 shows the buoyant motion and coalescence process of two bubbles at bo 80 and the comparison with other numerical results in the open literature as it can be observed the characteristics of bubbly flow and complex interfaces captured by multiphase mps method achieve a good agreement with the results of level set and sph grenier et al 2013 initially the smaller bubble in the lower location moves with a significantly faster velocity than that of the larger bubble in the upper region the deformation of the smaller bubbles is more violent and the breakup of bubble is observed at the moment of t g r 1 2 2 53 with two separated tiny bubbles formed after the smaller bubble catches up with the larger one it is gradually sucked into the cavity below the larger bubble the liquid film between two bubbles becomes thinner and thinner leading to the coalescence of bubbles finally in fig 21 time history of velocities of bubbles during the rising and coalescence process is plotted in general the trend of rise velocity keeps consistent with the observations in fig 20 at the beginning the rise velocities of both two bubbles increase rapidly especially the smaller bubble the rise velocity of the leading bubble reaches its peak soon and starts to decrease while the smaller bubble keeps being accelerated until it catches up with the larger one at t g r 1 2 2 3 afterwards the velocity of the smaller bubble drops quickly due to the blocking effect of the larger one at the same time some upward momentum is transferred from the smaller bubble to the larger bubble inducing another increase of the large bubble s rise velocity finally the coalescence of bubbles occurs and average velocity of the merged bubble tends to be steady to explore the mechanism of bubble interaction in present case the velocity field and streamlines around these two bubbles are displayed in fig 22 it can be observed that two strong vortex structures are formed on two sides of the larger bubble and stably exists during the bubble rising process due to its small size and short distance to the larger bubble the smaller bubble is completely exposed to influence of the vortex structure from the distribution of streamlines it can be found that the smaller bubble is located in the region where the wake flows are moving upward thus the buoyant motion of the smaller bubble is greatly speeded up the surface tension effects on the bubble coalescence are further investigated by performing the simulations with different bond numbers as shown in fig 23 in the case of bo 8 the larger surface tension force could inhibit the deformations of bubbles and the lower bubble is less influenced by the wake flows therefore the bubble coalescence is not observed during the simulation as the bond number increases to 80 and 200 the surface tension effects are greatly reduced and the bubbles suffer from much larger deformations in these two cases the deformation and coalescence of two bubbles are very similar due to the negligible surface tension effect but it can still be observed that at t g r 1 2 2 53 and 3 16 the complex interfaces caused by bubble coalescence is more complex at bo 200 3 5 violent interactions between a set of bubbles in practical industrial process the bubbly flows are more complicated and difficult to be simulated because the bubbles usually appear in groups rather than in the form of single or a pair in this section the multiphase mps method is applied to model the rising of a set of bubbles as well as the chasing breaking coalescence and other violent interactions the initial configuration and bubbles distribution are displayed in fig 24 which is similar with the model used in the sph research of grenier et al 2013 a set of 36 bubbles are initially spread on a 6 6 lattice with an average radius r 1 mm to consider the complexity of practical problems these bubbles are randomly shifted within 50 of the initial inter bubble distance and the radiuses of bubbles are randomly changed within 50 of the initial value as well the main calculation domain is set to be 26 6r 26 6r and a layer of the lighter fluid with a height of 8 5r is arranged above the heavier fluid at the initial moment the free slip boundary condition is imposed to all the tank walls the density and viscosity of the heavier fluid are 1000 kg m3 and 0 007 pa s and those of the bubbles and the lighter fluid are 800 kg m3 and 0 0065 pa s three different cases with the surface tension coefficient σ ranging from 7 85 10 5 n m to 7 85 10 3 n m are studied corresponding to the bond numbers ranging from 125 to 1 25 which is calculated based on the minimal bubble radius the mean reynolds number is equal to 40 in all cases time evolution of the bubbly flow at bo 12 5 is presented in fig 25 because the container is sufficiently narrow and the distribution of bubbles is compact the interactions between bubbles can be frequently observed and are quite violent in the present case the breaking and coalescence of different bubbles occur continuously resulting in very complex interfaces moreover when the bubbles rise and pass through the phase interface some of the heavier fluids are attached on the bubbles and also enter into the upper layer which then turn into a mass of droplets and make the interface between the upper and lower layers more complex as time goes on the heavier and lighter fluids are gradually separated under the influence of gravity and finally reach to a relatively steady state fig 26 shows the distribution of fluid density along the vertical direction it can be seen that the sharpness of spatial density variations becomes clear at t 2 s fig 27 shows the velocity distribution of the bubbly flow involving a set of bubbles at bo 12 5 from the figures it can be seen that due to the influence of bubble rising motion the velocities of bubbles as well as surrounding fluid increase rapidly after the beginning of simulation at the same time the fluid near two sidewalls moves downward to supplement the space originally occupied by bubbles which also causes an obvious increase in the velocity field during the bubble rising process a massive of bubbles are accelerated by wake flows of the upper bubbles similar with the interaction between two bubbles observed in the previous section especially in the region where the bubbles are densely distributed at the initial moment a significantly larger velocity field can be observed in the vertical direction due to the chasing of bubbles therefor the movement of bubbles become more violent in this region resulting in the large bubble deformations and complex interfaces for validation purpose the mps snapshots of bubbly flows at bo 12 5 are compared with the results of sph grenier et al 2013 in fig 28 however it should be noted that the initial distribution and initial size of bubbles are set to be with some randomness thus the numerical models adopted by the two methods are not completely consistent in general the evolutions of bubbly flows predicted by different methods show a good agreement due to the same bo number although the interaction between bubbles is more frequent in this paper due to the larger initial particle size and smaller particle distance the large bubble deformations and complex phases interfaces can still be accurately captured by the present multiphase mps method fig 29 and fig 30 show the time evolutions of the bubbly flows at bo 1 25 and bo 125 respectively combining the result of bo 12 5 in fig 29 it can be observed that the overall trend with the change of bond number keeps consistent with the two bubbles problem studied in section 3 4 with the increase of bond number the interactions between a set of bubbles become more violent and the bubbles experience larger deformations in the case of bo 1 25 the surface tension effects are strong enough to keep the shapes of most bubbles to be nearly circular during the rising process thus the interaction between bubbles is not significant at t 0 8 s the bubbly flow comes to an end and different fluids are completely separated in contrast due to the weak surface tension effects at bo 125 a mass of bubbles would be stretched along different directions causing frequent occurrences of breakup and coalescence phenomena compared with the case of bo 12 5 the bubbles become fragmented and it seems to be not possible for the complete separation of fluids again good agreements are observed between the mps and sph grenier et al 2013 in different cases besides the simulation results also indicate that in some separation equipment such as the oil water separator the appropriate addition of surfactant would be beneficial for the improvement of separation efficiency for a better illustration of the influence of bond number the energy dissipation rates in bubbly flows with different bond numbers are plotted and compared in fig 31 here the energy dissipation rate is defined as 27 r e d e m e 0 e 0 e l o w e s t where e m represents the mechanical energy at a given moment e 0 represents the mechanical energy at initial moment e lowest represents the lowest mechanical energy of the bubbly flow system which can be reached when the two fluid is completely separated and static with all of the lighter fluid laying above the heavier fluid as it can be seen from the figure the energy dissipation rate increases with the decrease of bond number which means that the bubbly flow with low bond number could develops to its final separation state faster this trend keeps consistent with the observation from the time evolutions of bubbly flows presented in figs 28 30 the reason for the difference of energy dissipation rates can be further explained by the vorticity fields displayed in fig 32 an obvious increase in the vorticity fields can be observed as the bond number decreases in the case of bo 1 25 the bubbly flow is not violent and therefore stable vortex structures can be formed on both sides of each bubble which are an important cause of the energy dissipation however when the bubby flows become violent with larger bond numbers the vortex structures are easy to be disturbed by the complicated bubble interactions thus the stable and strong vortex structures are not able to be generated and the energy dissipation rate is reduced benefiting from the improvement brought by gpu acceleration technology the above 2d simulations are further extended to 3d with the present multiphase mps method the fluid domain is set to be 19 2r 19 2r 45r where r 1 5 mm and a total of 27 bubbles are initially spread on a 3 3 3 lattice thus a total of more than two million particles are used in the 3d simulations in order to save the computation cost there is no lighter fluid arranged above the heavier fluid in the 3d model the fluid parameters keep consistent with that in the 2d simulations therefore the reynolds number is 40 and bond number is 12 5 respectively time evolutions of the 3d bubbly flows with different bond numbers are presented in figs 33 35 as shown in fig 33 the simulation results at bo 1 25 are most similar with practical bubbly flows the reason is that the bubble size in real environment is usually small thus both the interface curvature and the surface tension force are relatively large resulting in low bond number from fig 34 it can be observed that the bubbles severely break up at bo 12 5 with plenty number of tiny bubbles generated which can be accurately detected by the present multiphase mps method in fig 35 the surface tension force is too small to maintain a fixed shape for bubbles thus the particles consisted of bubbles are rapidly dispersed during the rising process compared with 2d results bubble interactions in the 3d simulations become more violent and the more complex interfaces are captured by multiphase mps method especially in the cases with large bond number 4 conclusions in this study an advanced multiphase mps method is developed for 2d 3d bubbly flows with complex interfaces by combining the single phase improved mps imps method proposed in our previous study with different multiphase models the main achievement is to be able to expand the application of mps method in bubbly flows especially for the cases with high reynolds number and high bond number detailed analysis is carried out for a series of bubbly flows with increasing complexity and the following conclusions can be obtained 1 in consideration of its great significance in bubbly flows the surface tension model is firstly validated through the simulations of 2d 3d square droplets deformation then overall performance of multiphase mps method is estimated by benchmark study of 2d 3d single bubble rising with high bond number good agreements between mps results and published data are achieved 2 the single bubble rising with high reynolds number is further simulated due to the much stronger inertia force compared with surface tension force the large deformation and violent breaking of bubble are observed which can still be accurately captured by multiphase mps method besides convergence is obtained to the experimental and sph results 3 the co axial coalescence of two bubbles is studied and it is found that the buoyant motion of the lower bubble would be speeded up by the wake flows resulting in the collision and coalescence of bubbles the interfaces captured by multiphase mps method show a good agreement with the results of level set and sph according to the simulation results with different bond numbers it can be concluded that the interaction of bubbles is intensified with the increase of bond number 4 the violent interactions between a set of bubbles are studied in which frequent breaking and coalescence of bubbles are observed benefiting from its lagrangian characteristic the multiphase mps method is able to reproduce the complicated phenomena in bubbly flows and achieve a good agreement with sph results as the bond number increases the bubbles experience larger deformations and the energy dissipation rate is slowed down due to the less formations of vortex structures on both sides of each bubble finally the large scale 3d simulations with more than two million particles are performed for this case which are close to the practical bubbly flows in summary the multiphase mps method developed in this paper shows high stability and accuracy for bubbly flows with complex interfaces however it has not yet reached the standard for the real bubbly flows in industrial process and future work is necessary focusing on further improvement of computational efficiency meanwhile it is important to develop and introduce the phase change model into the multiphase mps method to solve its weakness in the modeling of air diffusion phenomena we should also note that the mps particles are equidistantly distributed at the initial moment causing slight sawtooth shape of the bubble in consideration of some level of sensitivity to the initial particle distribution more advanced pre processing techniques are required in the future credit authorship contribution statement xiao wen data curation writing

20240,the bubbly flows have always been a key research object in the field of multiphase simulations however when the bubbly flows become violent to cause the large deformations of bubbles complex interfaces may be generated and bring great challenges to the traditional mesh based methods to overcome this challenge one of the most commonly used mesh free particle methods moving particles semi implicit mps method is adopted in this paper for the numerical simulations of bubbly flows with complex interfaces firstly a multiphase mps method is developed by combining the single phase improved mps imps method proposed in our previous study with different multiphase models including the improved density smoothing scheme interparticle viscosity model continuous acceleration model surface tension model incompressible compressible model and multiphase collision model then the deformations of 2d 3d square droplets are simulated to validate the surface tension model and the multiphase mps method is verified through the benchmark cases of 2d 3d single bubble rising with large density and viscosity ratios up to 1000 and 100 respectively finally a series of bubbly flows with increasing complexity are performed including the bubble rising and breaking at a high reynolds number the co axial coalescence of two bubbles with different radiuses and the violent interactions between a set of bubbles the mps results keep fair agreements with other numerical and experimental results through which the advantages of the present multiphase mps method in bubbly flows with complex interfaces can be well demonstrated keywords mps numerical simulation multiphase flows bubbly flows complex interface 1 introduction the bubbly flows are not only a kind of complex flow phenomenon commonly found in nature but also play important roles in various industrial processes such as the oil production massoud et al 2020 chen et al 2020 underwater explosion klaseboer et al 2005 yu et al 2021 ship wake zhang and liu 2020 murai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 etc a better understanding of the dynamic characteristics of bubbly flows would be great help to the optimization of industrial processes and design of more efficient and economical equipment during the past decades bubbly flows have been widely investigated using advanced experimental facilities and measuring techniques for example trevorrow et al 1994 employed the acoustic experimental techniques for the bubble wake measurements behind three surface ships and it is found that the wake bubbles last as strong acoustic scatterers for approximately 7 5 min with a maximum width of 60 m the bubbles in a cbm wellbore annulus are detected by wu et al 2018 using a bubble probe designed based on the apparent difference in conductivity between two media according to the results of bubble detection the two phase flow patterns can be well monitored and the mean density of the two phase flow is obtained abbaszadeh et al 2021 proposed a new bubbly flow measurement procedure based on the optical scattering behavior of a laser beam passing through a bubbly flow which can be successfully applied to capture the bubbly wake of ship models in the towing tank tests abbaszadeh et al 2020 given the complexity and high cost of experimental research a variety of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the volume of fluid vof level set ls and front tracking ft are introduced into the numerical simulations of bubbly flows and proven capable to obtain additional information and insight annaland et al 2005 croce et al 2010 pan and chen 2014 ma et al 2020 tian et al 2021 however an important common feature of the above cfd methods is that they all belong to mesh based methods in which the discretization of fluid domain is implemented in a eulerian mesh system to trace the phase interfaces in the mesh system complex interface capturing or front tracking algorithms need to be executed at each time step which brings two main deficiencies firstly the implementation of these algorithms is in fact to reconstruct the interfaces thus additional computational errors are inevitably produced during this process secondly when the bubbly flows are violent to cause the large deformations of bubbles complex interfaces may be generated and bring great challenges to the accuracy of these algorithms in recent decades the mesh free methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 and moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 koshizuka et al 1998 have been proposed as the next generation of cfd methods different from the mesh based methods the discretization of fluid domain in mesh free methods is carried out by the use of a set of interacting particles the motions of particles follow the governing equations in lagrangian description and there is no constant topology relationship existing between particles from the distribution of particles the interfaces can be directly obtained without special algorithms therefore the mesh free methods are particularly feasible in dealing with multiphase problems with complex interfaces in the field of bubbly flows an early research is conducted by colagrossi and landrini 2003 in which the rising and breaking of a single bubble are simulated by sph method and the captured interface shows a good agreement with the results of level set with an improved multi fluid sph formulation grenier et al 2013 performed the simulations of various bubbly flows including the evolution of an isolated bubble the merging of two bubbles and the oil water separation process in all cases good agreements are achieved between sph results and reference solutions moreover the influence of bond number on the evolutions of bubbly flows is well analyzed considering that most of existing researches focused on 2d simulations zhang et al 2015 and duan et al 2017 investigated the dynamic behaviors of 3d bubbly flows with the multiphase sph and mps methods respectively in mps method a semi implicit algorithm is adopted and the pressure field is calculated by solving the poisson pressure equation ppe thus the incompressibility of fluids can be guaranteed and the simulation is more stable than sph method which adopts an explicit algorithm based on the equation of state eos since it was originally proposed by koshizuka and oka 1996 the mps method has been widely used in violent free surface flows khayyer and gotoh 2008 zhang et al 2014 tang et al 2016 zhang and wan 2018 however due to its short history the development of multiphase methods in mps is immature and the applications of mps method in bubbly flows are far less extensive than that of the mesh based method or sph method moreover the calculation efficiency of mps method is greatly limited by the huge computational cost on neighbor particle searching and ppe solving thus it is difficult to deal with the more complicated calculation process and the sharp increase of particle number when extended to multiphase flows in this paper a multiphase mps method would be firstly developed by introducing a set of multiphase models into the single phase improved mps imps method proposed in our previous studies zhang and wan 2012 2017 specially the improved density smoothing scheme and interparticle viscosity model shakibaeinia and jin 2012 are adopted to solve the instability and inaccuracy caused by abrupt drop of density and viscosity across the phase interface then the continuous acceleration model duan et al 2017 is applied to keep the continuity of acceleration field which is important for multiphase problems with high density ratios in order to reproduce the bubble deformation surface tension effects are considered by the use of continuum surface force csf model brackbill et al 1992 moreover an incompressible compressible model khayyer and gotoh 2016 is employed to solve the liquid and bubble phases as incompressible and compressible respectively the multiphase collision model shakibaeinia and jin 2012 is adopted to deal with possible particle collisions and keep the uniform particle distribution finally the gpu graphics processing unit acceleration technique chen and wan 2019 developed in our previous study for single phase simulations is extended and applied thus the present multiphase mps method is capable to simulate large scale 3d bubbly flows with more than two million particles with the proposed multiphase mps method a series of bubbly flows with increasing complexity are simulated with a wide range from 2d to 3d and from single bubble to multiple bubbles firstly in consideration of its importance in bubbly flows the surface tension model is validated through the simulations of deformations of 2d 3d square droplets then the multiphase mps method is applied to sumulate 2d 3d single bubble rising with large density and viscosity ratios up to 1000 and 100 respectively and the numerical results are compared with the benchmark results hysing et al 2008 alexander et al 2014 given that the reynolds number in the benchmark study is relatively low re 35 the bubble rising and breaking at a high reynolds number re 35843 is further studied afterwards the bubbly flows with two or multiple bubbles are respectively simulated in which the interfaces become more complex due to the violent interactions between bubbles the expected advantage of multiphase mps method in capturing complex interfaces is demonstrated by comparison with other numerical and experimental results moreover the relationship between the interface evolution and the bond number is investigated and the mechanism of dynamic behaviors of bubbly flows is analyzed in detail 2 multiphase mps method 2 1 governing equations in mps method the motion of particles is governed by the continuity and momentum equations in lagrangian form koshizuka and oka 1996 written as 1 d ρ d t ρ u 2 ρ d u d t p f v f b f s where ρ u and p are the density velocity and pressure respectively p f v f b and f s denote the pressure gradient viscous force body force and surface tension force which are the four main forces in the bubbly flows studied in this paper in the present multiphase mps method the multiphase system is considered as a single fluid system thus the governing equations for different phases are uniform and can be solved simultaneously to deal with the abrupt drop of density and viscosity across the phase interface the multi density and multi viscosity models are employed in the multi density model an improved density smoothing scheme is proposed on the basis of the scheme of shakibaeinia and jin 2012 which realizes the smooth transition of density field by performing the spatial weighted averaging of density for particles near the phase interface as shown in fig 1 with the improved scheme the smoothed density field can be obtained by 3 ρ i ρ i w s e l f j i ρ j w r i j r e w s e l f j i w r i j r e where i includes the target particle i and all its neighboring particles w self is a weight function to amplify the effect of the target particle itself on the smoothed density through which the sharpness of density variation across the phase interface can be better preserved in the multi viscosity model the interparticle viscosity with a harmonic mean form shakibaeinia and jin 2012 is employed to substitute the real particle viscosity so that the viscous force between particles of different phases can be accurately calculated with the interparticle viscosity the viscous force term in eq 2 can be calculated according to the following formation 4 f v μ 2 u 2 d n 0 λ j i 2 μ i μ j μ i μ j u j u i w r i j r e 2 2 particle interaction models particle interaction models in mps method are utilized to discretize the differential operators in governing equations consisted of gradient model divergence model and laplacian models koshizuka and oka 1996 which are respectively defined as 5 φ i d n 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i w r i j r e 6 φ i d n 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i w r i j r e 7 2 φ i 2 d n 0 λ j i φ j φ i w r i j r e where φ is an arbitrary scalar function ф is an arbitrary vector d is the number of space dimensions n 0 is the particle number density at initial arrangement λ is a parameter defined as 8 λ j i w r i j r e r j r i 2 j i w r i j r e which is applied to keep the variance increase equal to that of the analytical solution the kernel function w r ij r e used here is the nonsingular one suggested by zhang and wan 2012 9 w r i j r e r e 0 85 r i j 0 15 r e 1 0 r r e 0 r e r where r and r e represent the particle distance and the largest radius of the particle interaction respectively when the particle distance is larger than a certain threshold the kernel function becomes zero value and no interaction exists the improved kernel function obtains a finite value when the particle distance is equal to zero thus the singularity problem of the original kernel function koshizuka and oka 1996 can be avoided 2 3 semi implicit algorithm in mps method a semi implicit algorithm is utilized to keep the incompressibility of fluid in which each time step is subdivided into two separate steps in the first step also called prediction step the temporal velocity field is explicitly calculated according to viscosity gravity and surface tension forces in the second step also called correction step the poisson pressure equation ppe is solved to obtain the pressure field with which the velocity and location of particles are finally updated to the next time step in this paper we employ the improved ppe with a mixed source term which is firstly proposed by tanaka and masunaga 2010 and rewritten by lee et al 2011a 10 2 p n 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t u i γ ρ δ t 2 n i n 0 n 0 where γ is a blending parameter less than 1 the source term on the right hand of eq 10 represents a combination of the divergence free incompressible condition and the particle number density incompressible condition respectively which proves to be effective to suppress the pressure oscillations in original mps method to consider the compressibility of bubble phase an incompressible compressible model is included in the present multiphase mps method by introducing a compressible term into the source term of ppe similar with the studies of khayyer and gotoh 2016 and duan el al 2017 the compressible term derived from equation of state eos is adopted with which the formation of ppe turns into 11 2 p k 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t u i γ ρ δ t 2 n k i n 0 n 0 1 δ t 2 c s 2 p i n 1 where c s is the speed of sound moreover the compressible term could be moved to the left hand side of ppe in the solution process thus the diagonal elements of the ppe matrix become larger and the stability of pressure calculation can be improved tanaka and masunaga 2010 2 4 continuous acceleration model for the bubbly flow with high density ratio a huge discrepancy of acceleration may exist on two sides of the phase interface according to the original pressure gradient model of eq 5 the pressure gradient forces between a pair of interacting particles have the same value when the two particles belong to different phases the acceleration of the lighter particle would be much larger than that of the heavier particle due to the high density ratio generating a discontinuous acceleration field which may cause blow up instability in the present multiphase mps method the continuous acceleration model duan et al 2017 is employed to improve the stability in simulations of bubbly flows with high density ratios the main ideal of this model is to introduce the concept of interparticle density into both the pressure gradient model and the ppe solving firstly an improved pressure gradient model with the interparticle density should be adopted written as 12 2 ρ i ρ j p i d n 0 j i 2 p j p i ρ i ρ j r j r i r j r i 2 w r i j r e d n 0 j i p i p i min ρ i r j r i r j r i 2 w r i j r e where p i min represents the minimal pressure among the same phase neighboring particles of particle i the first term on the right hand of eq 12 is a modified form of the original pressure gradient model in which the use of interparticle density guarantees an identical acceleration for the lighter and heavier particles as shown in fig 2 when the density ratio is equal to 1 1000 the acceleration ratio calculated by original model is also 1 1000 while the improved model can obtain the same particle acceleration on two sides of interface and keep the continuity of acceleration field the second term on the right hand of eq 12 can be regarded as a particle stabilizing term pst which exerts an artificial force on target particles with a direction from the dense particle region to the dilute region thus the uniform distribution of particles can be better maintained moreover in the transition region the pressure field suffers from great changes due to the rapid variation of density field therefore a large pressure gradient may be generated and causes the violent movement of particles especially for the lighter particles in order to keep the smoothness of pressure field the ppe with inter particle density is adopted in the present multiphase mps method with which the left hand side of ppe can be discretized as 13 2 ρ i ρ j 2 p n 1 i 2 d n 0 λ j i 2 ρ i ρ j p j n 1 p i n 1 w r i j r e 2 5 surface tension model surface tension force has important influence on the deformation of bubble in the present multiphase mps method the surface tension model follows the continuum surface force csf model proposed by brackbill et al 1992 which is also one of the most widely used surface tension models in mesh based or mesh free methods in csf model the surface tension force is converted into a kind of body force distributed in the transition region as shown in fig 3 the value of surface tension force can be calculated with the following equation 14 f s σ κ c where σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the interface curvature c is the gradient of color function in this paper the density weighted color function zhang et al 2015 is employed to keep the continuity of surface tension force which is defined as 15 c ij 0 if particle i and j belong to the same phase 2 ρ i ρ i ρ j if particle i and j belong to different phase as to the calculation of interface curvature κ the analytical method proposed in the contoured continuum surface force ccsf model duan et al 2015 is applied the main ideal of this method is to approximate phase interfaces by the contours of smoothed color function fig 4 in the first step the smoothed color function f at an arbitrary location x y can be obtained by performing a spatial weighted averaging of the above color function 16 f x y j c j g r i j r s j g r i j r s g r i j r s 9 π r s 2 exp 9 r i j 2 r s 2 with the smoothed color function known the local contour passing through particle i can be obtained through a taylor series expansion 17 f x i x x i f y i y y i 1 2 f x x i x x i 2 f x y i x x i y y i 1 2 f yy i y y i 2 0 where the subscripts x and y represent the partial derivatives with respect to x and y respectively finally the interface curvature at particle i can be analytically calculated as 18 κ i y 1 y i 3 2 2 f x i f y i f x y i f x i 2 f y y i f y i 2 f x x i f x i 2 f y i 2 3 2 moreover the above derivation is also be applicable for 3d model the only difference is that the derivatives of smoothed color function with respect to variable z should be considered therefore the mean curvature in 3d model can be calculated as 19 κ i f x x i f y i 2 f z i 2 f y y i f x i 2 f z i 2 f z z i f x i 2 f y i 2 2 f x i f y i f x y i f x i f z i f x z i f y i f z i f y z i f x i 2 f y i 2 f z i 2 3 2 2 6 multiphase collision model when particle distance becomes too small the uniform distribution of particles is no longer satisfied and unphysical penetrations between different phases are likely to occur in the present method the multiphase collision model shakibaeinia and jin 2012 is employed to exert an additional repulsive force when particle distance is below a certain threshold this model considers the collision of particles as the collision of two spheres with different masses initially different particles are uniformly distributed with an constant distance l 0 if the distance between any two particles becomes smaller than α times of l 0 during the simulation the particle collision is assumed to happen and the velocities of particles are corrected based on the following equations 20 u i u i 1 ρ i 1 ε ρ i ρ j ρ i ρ j u i j n 21 u j u j 1 ρ j 1 ε ρ i ρ j ρ i ρ j u i j n where u i is the velocity vector of particles after collision u i j n is the normal relative velocity of particles i and j and ε is the collision ratio 2 7 boundary conditions the wall boundary conditions in mps include the free slip and no slip wall conditions to impose the boundary conditions the concept of mirror particle lee et al 2011b is introduced to replace the wall and dummy particles in the calculation of viscous force the positions of mirror particles are symmetrical to corresponding fluid particles about the wall and the velocities of mirror particles are calculated with the follow equations 1 free slip condition 22 u mirror t u i t u mirror n 2 u w u i n 2 no slip condition 23 u mirror t 2 u w u i t u mirror n 2 u w u i n where n and t are the normal and tangential vectors to the wall respectively the subscripts mirror w and i represent the mirror wall and corresponding fluid particles respectively 2 8 gpu acceleration technique due to its multi core architecture gpu graphics processing unit is quite suitable for large scale parallel computing and has been widely applied in high performance computing crespo et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 chow et al 2018 for mps method the gpu acceleration technique has been successfully applied in the simulations of single phase flows hori et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 xie et al 2020 however up to now there have been few studies on the applications of gpu in the multiphase mps simulations in this paper the gpu acceleration technique developed based on the imps method chen and wan 2019a 2019b 2019b is further extended into the present multiphase mps method fig 5 shows the flowchart of multiphase mps method with gpu acceleration technique as it can be seen both cpu and gpu are utilized but with different tasks the cpu works as a host part to deal with logical works environment configuration instructions for setting parallelism and communicating data between cpu and gpu the gpu works as a device part which is responsible for all the parallel computing benefiting from simultaneous solution of different phase in this paper the calculation processes of single phase and multiphase mps method are basically consistent except for the insertion of above multi phase models thus the speedup of gpu in multiphase simulation can be considered as the same as that in single phase simulation 3 numerical simulations 3 1 deformations of 2d 3d square droplets the surface tension model is critical to simulate bubbly flows with deformed interfaces to validate the surface tension model in the present multiphase mps method deformations of 2d 3d square droplets are simulated in this section the initial conditions for 2d 3d cases are shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b respectively in 2d case an initial square droplet with a length of 0 4 m on each side is arranged in the middle of the calculation domain with a size of 1 m 1 m the densities of droplet and surrounding fluids are both 1 kg m3 and the dynamic viscosities are both 0 2 m2 s the surface tension coefficient is σ 1 n m and the gravitational force is ignored all boundary conditions are set as no slip wall the initial condition in 3d case is similar with the 2d case but the droplet and calculation domain are expanded into 3d in both cases the fluid pressures along the horizontal ordinate are measured and recorded the deformations of 2d square droplet simulated by multiphase mps method are presented in fig 7 as it can be seen due to the relatively larger interface curvature four corners of the square droplet are firstly drove by surface tension force at t 0 07 s and the four edges move away from the center of droplet then the droplet continues to deform and gradually turns into an almost perfect circle at t 1 s according to the laplace law the pressure inside the droplet is expected to be higher than that of the surrounding fluid after the fluid field becomes stable for 2d droplet the pressure drop can be estimated as 24 δ p p a p b σ r σ π l where r is the final radius of the droplet according to eq 24 the theoretical value of pressure drop in this case is equal to 4 431 pa in fig 8 the pressure distribution and pressure drop predicted by multiphase mps method are presented and compared with the theoretical results from the pressure distribution in fig 8 a obvious pressure drop can be observed between the droplet and surrounding fluid and in fig 8 b a good agreement is achieved between the calculated pressure profiles with the theoretical value from laplace law the simulation results of 3d square droplet s deformation are shown in fig 9 from the droplet deformations presented in fig 9 a c similar trend with the 2d case can be observed at t 0 12 s the eight corners of the 3d droplet are firstly drove by surface tension force and six faces move away from the center of droplet at t 1 s the droplet becomes an almost perfect sphere droplet fig 9 d compares the calculated pressure profiles with the theoretical value noted that in 3d case the formulation used to calculate the pressure drop becomes 25 δ p p a p b 2 σ r 2 σ 4 π 3 3 l therefore the theoretical value of pressure drop in 3d case is equal to 8 056 pa again the calculated pressure profiles show a good agreement with the theoretical value validating the accuracy of surface tension model in the present multiphase mps method 3 2 benchmark tests of 2d 3d single bubble rising the single bubble rising is the simplest but also the most common bubbly flow in nature in this section the simulations of 2d 3d single bubble rising are carried out and the performance of multiphase mps method is investigated the initial configurations are set to be identical with the 2d benchmark study by hysing et al 2008 and the 3d benchmark study by adelsberger et al 2014 as shown in fig 10 in 2d case a circular bubble with the diameter d 0 5 m is initially centered at 0 5 0 5 in a 1 2 rectangular container the no slip boundary condition is imposed on the top and bottom walls while the free slip boundary condition is imposed on the vertical sidewalls in 3d case a sphere bubble with the diameter d 0 5 m is initially centered at 0 5 0 5 0 5 in the 1 1 2 cuboid container and all boundaries are set as no slip wall the gravity acceleration is g 0 98 m s2 and points downwards the physical properties of fluids keep the same as the case 2 of the benchmark study in which the density ratio 1000 1 and viscosity ratio 100 1 are relatively higher and the phase interface is more complex in both 2d and 3d cases the two main non dimensional numbers in bubble dynamics including the reynolds number re and bond number bo also known as eotvos number eo are equal to 35 and 125 respectively for bubbly flows the reynolds number representing the ratio of inertial to viscous effects and the bond number which gives the ratio of gravitational forces to surface tension effects are defined as 26 re ρ 1 g d 3 μ 1 b o ρ 1 g d 2 σ from the above definition it can be seen that with the increase of reynolds number the inertial force becomes more dominant than the viscous force which means that the movement of bubble would be more violent with the increase of bond number the inertial force become more dominant than the surface tension force thus more severe deformation would occur during the bubble rising considering that the advantage of multiphase mps method is more significant in the violent flows with complex interfaces the bubble rising at high reynolds number will be further studied in section 3 3 and the bubbly flow with increasing bond number will be studied in section 3 4 and section 3 5 time evolution of bubble shape in 2d rising problem is presented in fig 11 due to the large bond number surface tension effects are weak in this case and the bubble experiences strong deformations during the rising process especially in the later stage where the breakup of bubble is observed and two tiny bubbles are separated from the skirt part of the main bubble the interface captured by multiphase mps method is compared with benchmark results and a good agreement can be observed fig 12 plots the quantitative results calculated by different methods including the center of mass and rise velocity of bubble compared with sph sun et al 2015 and mmps ca duan et al 2017 methods the multiphase mps method gives more consistent results with benchmark results besides the severe oscillations of rise velocity observed in other mesh free methods are not found in the multiphase mps results validating the stability of present method fig 13 shows the time evolution of bubble shape in 3d rising problem similarly the 3d bubble experiences a large deformation due to the relatively high bond number and weak surface tension effects however the breakup of bubble observed in previous 2d case does not occur in present 3d simulation which shows a good agreement with the 3d benchmark results adelsberger et al 2014 in the early stage of its buoyant motion the 3d bubble deforms fast and turns into a dimpled cap at t 1 s afterwards the diameter of bubble in the vertical direction gradually decreases while the diameter in the horizontal direction increases finally the shape of bubble is located in the dimpled ellipsoidal cap regime at t 3 5 s being same as the benchmark results in fig 14 the shapes of 3d bubble simulated by multiphase mps method at several typical time instants are compared with the benchmark results which is obtained by three different solvers including drops nast3d and openfoam adelsberger et al 2014 in general the result of multiphase mps method show a better agreement with the results of drops and openfoam the main difference is observed on the bottom edge of bubble where the interface curvature is large the center of mass and rise velocity are presented and compared in fig 15 the center of mass calculated by multiphase mps method agrees well with benchmark result and more accurate rise velocity can be predicted compared with mmps ca and mmps hd methods duan et al 2017 in summary the multiphase mps method proposed in this paper can be well validated through the above simulations of 2d and 3d single bubble rising there are some slight differences between mps results and benchmark results such as the profile of bubble edge and the evolution of tiny bubbles formed after bubble breaking however considering that these local deformations bring great challenges to numerical methods and even the three mesh based methods used in benchmark study obtained different results the results in present work are regarded as acceptable 3 3 bubble rising and breaking with high reynolds number it should be noted that in the simulations of section 3 2 the viscosities of fluids are large and the gravity is small resulting in low reynolds number in order to further examine the capacity of multiphase mps method in more violent bubbly flows with high reynolds number the rising and breaking of a single bubble in the low viscosity liquid which corresponds to the experimental study of walters and davidson 1962 are simulated and analyzed in this section the initial configuration is presented in fig 16 where the bubble with a radius r 0 0254 m is located in the middle of the container with a width of 10r and a height of 12r the distance from the center of bubble to the container bottom is 4 r the fluids inside and outside of the bubble are water and air respectively the density and viscosity of water phase are 1000 kg m3 and 0 001 pa s while the density and viscosity of the air bubble are 1 kg m3 and 1 77 10 5 pa s therefore the density and viscosity ratios in this case reach up to 1000 and 56 5 the surface tension coefficient is 0 0728 n m and the gravity acceleration is g 9 8 m s2 according to the parameters and fluid properties the reynolds number in this case is up to 35843 the mps snapshots of bubble shapes at some typical time instants are presented in fig 17 and compared with experimental snapshots provided in the study of walters and davidson 1962 due to the extremely high reynolds number the deformation of bubble observed in present case are more violent than the above benchmark tests in its rising process the bubble firstly deforms into a horseshoe shape due to the upwelling water motion below the bubble t 0 1375 s subsequently the cavity gradually grows and the bubble was continuously elongated at t 0 2375 s the breakup of bubble occurs and two small bubbles are separated from the main bubble besides some satellite droplets are formed during the bubble breaking process after that the bottom edge of bubble shrink upward rapidly due to the large interface curvature and the bubble turns into a cap shape finally from the comparison between numerical and experimental results a good agreement can be observed proving that the complex interfaces in bubbly flows can still be accurately captured by multiphase mps method even if the reynolds number is high fig 18 shows the quantitative results obtained by multiphase mps method in the high reynolds number problem and the comparison with sph sun et al 2015 and experimental results walters and davidson 1962 the quantitative results include the position of the top of bubble and the thickness at the axis of symmetry of bubble which represent the characteristics of bubble motion and deformation respectively from the comparisons it can be seen that both multiphase mps method and sph method are able to accurately predict the bubble characteristics and the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data 3 4 co axial coalescence of two bubbles with different radiuses when the bubbly flow contains more than one bubble the interaction between different bubbles may lead to larger bubble deformation and more complex evolution of interfaces in this section the co axial coalescence of two bubbles with different radiuses are simulated by multiphase mps method and the bubble interaction is investigated the initial configuration is displayed in fig 19 which is also used in the studies of grenier et al 2013 and duan et al 2017 two close bubbles are located on the same vertical line inside a 1 0 m 1 5 m rectangular container filled with pure water the radiuses of lower and upper bubbles are r 0 1 m and 1 5r 0 15 m respectively the densities of liquid and bubble phases are 1000 kg m3 and 100 kg m3 thus the density ratio is equal to 10 in this case the viscosities of liquid and bubble phases are 0 156 kg m s and 0 078 kg m s respectively three cases with different surface tension coefficients are considered including 49 n m 4 9 n m and 1 96 n m corresponding to the bond number of 8 80 and 200 respectively fig 20 shows the buoyant motion and coalescence process of two bubbles at bo 80 and the comparison with other numerical results in the open literature as it can be observed the characteristics of bubbly flow and complex interfaces captured by multiphase mps method achieve a good agreement with the results of level set and sph grenier et al 2013 initially the smaller bubble in the lower location moves with a significantly faster velocity than that of the larger bubble in the upper region the deformation of the smaller bubbles is more violent and the breakup of bubble is observed at the moment of t g r 1 2 2 53 with two separated tiny bubbles formed after the smaller bubble catches up with the larger one it is gradually sucked into the cavity below the larger bubble the liquid film between two bubbles becomes thinner and thinner leading to the coalescence of bubbles finally in fig 21 time history of velocities of bubbles during the rising and coalescence process is plotted in general the trend of rise velocity keeps consistent with the observations in fig 20 at the beginning the rise velocities of both two bubbles increase rapidly especially the smaller bubble the rise velocity of the leading bubble reaches its peak soon and starts to decrease while the smaller bubble keeps being accelerated until it catches up with the larger one at t g r 1 2 2 3 afterwards the velocity of the smaller bubble drops quickly due to the blocking effect of the larger one at the same time some upward momentum is transferred from the smaller bubble to the larger bubble inducing another increase of the large bubble s rise velocity finally the coalescence of bubbles occurs and average velocity of the merged bubble tends to be steady to explore the mechanism of bubble interaction in present case the velocity field and streamlines around these two bubbles are displayed in fig 22 it can be observed that two strong vortex structures are formed on two sides of the larger bubble and stably exists during the bubble rising process due to its small size and short distance to the larger bubble the smaller bubble is completely exposed to influence of the vortex structure from the distribution of streamlines it can be found that the smaller bubble is located in the region where the wake flows are moving upward thus the buoyant motion of the smaller bubble is greatly speeded up the surface tension effects on the bubble coalescence are further investigated by performing the simulations with different bond numbers as shown in fig 23 in the case of bo 8 the larger surface tension force could inhibit the deformations of bubbles and the lower bubble is less influenced by the wake flows therefore the bubble coalescence is not observed during the simulation as the bond number increases to 80 and 200 the surface tension effects are greatly reduced and the bubbles suffer from much larger deformations in these two cases the deformation and coalescence of two bubbles are very similar due to the negligible surface tension effect but it can still be observed that at t g r 1 2 2 53 and 3 16 the complex interfaces caused by bubble coalescence is more complex at bo 200 3 5 violent interactions between a set of bubbles in practical industrial process the bubbly flows are more complicated and difficult to be simulated because the bubbles usually appear in groups rather than in the form of single or a pair in this section the multiphase mps method is applied to model the rising of a set of bubbles as well as the chasing breaking coalescence and other violent interactions the initial configuration and bubbles distribution are displayed in fig 24 which is similar with the model used in the sph research of grenier et al 2013 a set of 36 bubbles are initially spread on a 6 6 lattice with an average radius r 1 mm to consider the complexity of practical problems these bubbles are randomly shifted within 50 of the initial inter bubble distance and the radiuses of bubbles are randomly changed within 50 of the initial value as well the main calculation domain is set to be 26 6r 26 6r and a layer of the lighter fluid with a height of 8 5r is arranged above the heavier fluid at the initial moment the free slip boundary condition is imposed to all the tank walls the density and viscosity of the heavier fluid are 1000 kg m3 and 0 007 pa s and those of the bubbles and the lighter fluid are 800 kg m3 and 0 0065 pa s three different cases with the surface tension coefficient σ ranging from 7 85 10 5 n m to 7 85 10 3 n m are studied corresponding to the bond numbers ranging from 125 to 1 25 which is calculated based on the minimal bubble radius the mean reynolds number is equal to 40 in all cases time evolution of the bubbly flow at bo 12 5 is presented in fig 25 because the container is sufficiently narrow and the distribution of bubbles is compact the interactions between bubbles can be frequently observed and are quite violent in the present case the breaking and coalescence of different bubbles occur continuously resulting in very complex interfaces moreover when the bubbles rise and pass through the phase interface some of the heavier fluids are attached on the bubbles and also enter into the upper layer which then turn into a mass of droplets and make the interface between the upper and lower layers more complex as time goes on the heavier and lighter fluids are gradually separated under the influence of gravity and finally reach to a relatively steady state fig 26 shows the distribution of fluid density along the vertical direction it can be seen that the sharpness of spatial density variations becomes clear at t 2 s fig 27 shows the velocity distribution of the bubbly flow involving a set of bubbles at bo 12 5 from the figures it can be seen that due to the influence of bubble rising motion the velocities of bubbles as well as surrounding fluid increase rapidly after the beginning of simulation at the same time the fluid near two sidewalls moves downward to supplement the space originally occupied by bubbles which also causes an obvious increase in the velocity field during the bubble rising process a massive of bubbles are accelerated by wake flows of the upper bubbles similar with the interaction between two bubbles observed in the previous section especially in the region where the bubbles are densely distributed at the initial moment a significantly larger velocity field can be observed in the vertical direction due to the chasing of bubbles therefor the movement of bubbles become more violent in this region resulting in the large bubble deformations and complex interfaces for validation purpose the mps snapshots of bubbly flows at bo 12 5 are compared with the results of sph grenier et al 2013 in fig 28 however it should be noted that the initial distribution and initial size of bubbles are set to be with some randomness thus the numerical models adopted by the two methods are not completely consistent in general the evolutions of bubbly flows predicted by different methods show a good agreement due to the same bo number although the interaction between bubbles is more frequent in this paper due to the larger initial particle size and smaller particle distance the large bubble deformations and complex phases interfaces can still be accurately captured by the present multiphase mps method fig 29 and fig 30 show the time evolutions of the bubbly flows at bo 1 25 and bo 125 respectively combining the result of bo 12 5 in fig 29 it can be observed that the overall trend with the change of bond number keeps consistent with the two bubbles problem studied in section 3 4 with the increase of bond number the interactions between a set of bubbles become more violent and the bubbles experience larger deformations in the case of bo 1 25 the surface tension effects are strong enough to keep the shapes of most bubbles to be nearly circular during the rising process thus the interaction between bubbles is not significant at t 0 8 s the bubbly flow comes to an end and different fluids are completely separated in contrast due to the weak surface tension effects at bo 125 a mass of bubbles would be stretched along different directions causing frequent occurrences of breakup and coalescence phenomena compared with the case of bo 12 5 the bubbles become fragmented and it seems to be not possible for the complete separation of fluids again good agreements are observed between the mps and sph grenier et al 2013 in different cases besides the simulation results also indicate that in some separation equipment such as the oil water separator the appropriate addition of surfactant would be beneficial for the improvement of separation efficiency for a better illustration of the influence of bond number the energy dissipation rates in bubbly flows with different bond numbers are plotted and compared in fig 31 here the energy dissipation rate is defined as 27 r e d e m e 0 e 0 e l o w e s t where e m represents the mechanical energy at a given moment e 0 represents the mechanical energy at initial moment e lowest represents the lowest mechanical energy of the bubbly flow system which can be reached when the two fluid is completely separated and static with all of the lighter fluid laying above the heavier fluid as it can be seen from the figure the energy dissipation rate increases with the decrease of bond number which means that the bubbly flow with low bond number could develops to its final separation state faster this trend keeps consistent with the observation from the time evolutions of bubbly flows presented in figs 28 30 the reason for the difference of energy dissipation rates can be further explained by the vorticity fields displayed in fig 32 an obvious increase in the vorticity fields can be observed as the bond number decreases in the case of bo 1 25 the bubbly flow is not violent and therefore stable vortex structures can be formed on both sides of each bubble which are an important cause of the energy dissipation however when the bubby flows become violent with larger bond numbers the vortex structures are easy to be disturbed by the complicated bubble interactions thus the stable and strong vortex structures are not able to be generated and the energy dissipation rate is reduced benefiting from the improvement brought by gpu acceleration technology the above 2d simulations are further extended to 3d with the present multiphase mps method the fluid domain is set to be 19 2r 19 2r 45r where r 1 5 mm and a total of 27 bubbles are initially spread on a 3 3 3 lattice thus a total of more than two million particles are used in the 3d simulations in order to save the computation cost there is no lighter fluid arranged above the heavier fluid in the 3d model the fluid parameters keep consistent with that in the 2d simulations therefore the reynolds number is 40 and bond number is 12 5 respectively time evolutions of the 3d bubbly flows with different bond numbers are presented in figs 33 35 as shown in fig 33 the simulation results at bo 1 25 are most similar with practical bubbly flows the reason is that the bubble size in real environment is usually small thus both the interface curvature and the surface tension force are relatively large resulting in low bond number from fig 34 it can be observed that the bubbles severely break up at bo 12 5 with plenty number of tiny bubbles generated which can be accurately detected by the present multiphase mps method in fig 35 the surface tension force is too small to maintain a fixed shape for bubbles thus the particles consisted of bubbles are rapidly dispersed during the rising process compared with 2d results bubble interactions in the 3d simulations become more violent and the more complex interfaces are captured by multiphase mps method especially in the cases with large bond number 4 conclusions in this study an advanced multiphase mps method is developed for 2d 3d bubbly flows with complex interfaces by combining the single phase improved mps imps method proposed in our previous study with different multiphase models the main achievement is to be able to expand the application of mps method in bubbly flows especially for the cases with high reynolds number and high bond number detailed analysis is carried out for a series of bubbly flows with increasing complexity and the following conclusions can be obtained 1 in consideration of its great significance in bubbly flows the surface tension model is firstly validated through the simulations of 2d 3d square droplets deformation then overall performance of multiphase mps method is estimated by benchmark study of 2d 3d single bubble rising with high bond number good agreements between mps results and published data are achieved 2 the single bubble rising with high reynolds number is further simulated due to the much stronger inertia force compared with surface tension force the large deformation and violent breaking of bubble are observed which can still be accurately captured by multiphase mps method besides convergence is obtained to the experimental and sph results 3 the co axial coalescence of two bubbles is studied and it is found that the buoyant motion of the lower bubble would be speeded up by the wake flows resulting in the collision and coalescence of bubbles the interfaces captured by multiphase mps method show a good agreement with the results of level set and sph according to the simulation results with different bond numbers it can be concluded that the interaction of bubbles is intensified with the increase of bond number 4 the violent interactions between a set of bubbles are studied in which frequent breaking and coalescence of bubbles are observed benefiting from its lagrangian characteristic the multiphase mps method is able to reproduce the complicated phenomena in bubbly flows and achieve a good agreement with sph results as the bond number increases the bubbles experience larger deformations and the energy dissipation rate is slowed down due to the less formations of vortex structures on both sides of each bubble finally the large scale 3d simulations with more than two million particles are performed for this case which are close to the practical bubbly flows in summary the multiphase mps method developed in this paper shows high stability and accuracy for bubbly flows with complex interfaces however it has not yet reached the standard for the real bubbly flows in industrial process and future work is necessary focusing on further improvement of computational efficiency meanwhile it is important to develop and introduce the phase change model into the multiphase mps method to solve its weakness in the modeling of air diffusion phenomena we should also note that the mps particles are equidistantly distributed at the initial moment causing slight sawtooth shape of the bubble in consideration of some level of sensitivity to the initial particle distribution more advanced pre processing techniques are required in the future credit authorship contribution statement xiao wen data curation writing

20241,this paper presents a predicted trajectory approach pta for global motion planning of an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle usv different from the conventional path planning algorithms which mostly focus on the shortest safest or smoothest paths pta takes all the dynamic constraints of the usv into account and finds the global trajectory that can be traced precisely via its own maneuvering system in present strategy the predicted trajectories produced by the mathematical model of the usv are decomposed into a series of waypoints on grid map then an efficient trajectory can be found for the usv by performing the a search method to improve the search efficiency and accuracy the pta is enhanced with global path guiding gpta when searching for feasible trajectories gpta can employ the global path obtained by theta to accurately estimate the heuristic cost of the objective function rather than using the euclidean distance directly as pta does numerical simulations in various scenarios are conducted to compare the performance of the pta gpta trajectory units tus and hybrid path planning algorithm combining global and local path planning hgl the results demonstrate that gpta has higher safety and navigation efficiency for motion planning of the underactuated usv keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv motion planning predicted trajectory approach collision avoidance 1 introduction due to the continuous demand for exploring oceanic resources unmanned surface vehicles usvs have been increasingly applied in both commercial and military fields including ocean sampling environmental monitoring bathymetric survey maritime search and rescue hydrologic survey harbor surveillance and defense svec and gupta 2012 sharma et al 2014 liu and bucknall 2016 to autonomously execute these sophisticated tasks it is vital to plan out a high efficiency trajectory for an usv however finding a practical trajectory becomes rather challenging since the feasibility safety and efficiency are compositely required to be optimized in complicated marine environments including static obstacles dynamic obstacles and environmental perturbations claussmann et al 2020 wang et al 2020 path planning as one of the critical technologies of usv navigation has been drawing much attention according to different dynamic constraints the path planning can be divided into three stages route planning trajectory planning and motion planning gu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b dynamic constraints zhou et al 2020b are defined as the restrictions on the ship s motion including position velocity and acceleration due to its physical limitations e g maximum minimum and change rate of surge force provided by propeller route planning regards the usv as a particle and ignores all dynamic constraints song et al 2019 proposed a smoothed a algorithm for route planning of unmanned surface vehicles compared to the conventional a algorithm the proposed approach retained the fast and efficient route searching and made it more suitable for usv navigation shah and gupta 2016 2019 presented the speeding up a on visibility graphs method to search long distance paths in large size of the marine environment to improve search efficiency the focused search algorithm and the associated search heuristics were developed to reduce the computational time without significantly sacrificing the optimality of the computed path however it is inevitable that the computational time of the developed algorithm will increase with the growing obstacle density wu et al 2021 proposed a long distance route planning method based on multi scale visibility graph to solve the problems of the slow planning and poor route accuracy in these researches the application scenarios of route planning mainly concentrate on large scale environments but for the usv performing in complex terrains such as the harbor and inland river route planning is difficult to be directly applied most usvs are underactuated and their motion is restricted by nonholonomic kinematic constraints and the limited control authority of real actuators to ensure that a usv can trace the planned trajectory with minimal errors and thus help to guarantee collision free operation the trajectories generated by the planner should account for the inherent limitations of the vehicle s dynamic response bertaska et al 2015 shah et al 2016 bertaska and von ellenrieder 2019 trajectory planning considers partial dynamic constraints like size speed heading and curvature chrpa and osborne 2014 du et al 2019 kim et al 2014 and lee et al 2015 suggested a new angular rate constrained theta arc theta algorithm in which the planned paths considered the constraints of both yaw rates and heading angles of the usv liu et al 2017 developed an angle guidance fast marching square algorithm which was able to search the optimal path based on usv s motion constraints chen et al 2020 proposed a hybrid approach of fast marching square and velocity obstacles method for global path planning with consideration of both velocity constraint of the ship and influences of collision risk all these methods had found feasible trajectories and achieved good results however some interactions among the constraints might be ignored in these trajectory planning approaches zhou et al 2020b motion planning considers the overall dynamic constraints petti and fraichard 2005 presented a variant of the rapidly exploring random tree rrt algorithm to obtain feasible trajectories in high dimensional state spaces for robots with dynamical constraints however the planned trajectories are generally rough due to the use of random sampling during the search the problem was solved by a newly developed variant of the algorithm named rrt karaman and frazzoli 2010 approaches based on random sampling are widely used in motion planning of the robotics such as industrial robots unmanned ground vehicle unmanned aerial vehicle etc moon and chung 2015 salzman and halperin 2016 li et al 2018 however the large inertia resistance and response time of the usv may introduce difficulties when applying the approach apart from the complicated interference of wind wave and current fossen et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 thus the above methods on random sampling need to be further improved for usv s motion planning zhou et al 2020b moreover the search based deliberative motion planning approach had also been widely used likhachev and ferguson 2009 dolgov et al 2010 bertaska et al 2013 svec et al 2013 švec et al 2014 the challenge of this approach is that the computational time significantly increases with the increase in the dimension of the state space complexity of the motion primitive set complexity of the environment etc as for the motion planning of usvs du et al 2018 proposed a trajectory units approach to realize the fine motion control in a small range of scenario however most trajectories from their search approach were not smooth under the influence of obstacles and its computational time increased exponentially with the expanded search area zhou et al 2020a further gave a novel motion planning method based on topological position relationships tpr for dealing with the long search time problem and making the planned trajectory more realistic yoo and kim 2016 adopted the reinforcement learning algorithm to produce feasible trajectories considering the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and ocean disturbances moreover some researchers proposed several hybrid algorithms that effectively combining global and local path planning to deal with the motion planning problem wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 wang and xu 2020 these hybrid algorithms can be divided into two steps first an unblocked initial path from the starting point to the goal can be acquired by means of a traditional global route planning algorithm such as a shi et al 2019 theta daniel et al 2010 fast marching method wang et al 2019 etc second the local planning approach is employed to produce the final trajectory which contains kinematics and dynamics constraints of usvs these hybrid path planning algorithms have good real time performance and strong dynamic obstacle avoidance capability however the hybrid scheme can only guarantee the optimality of the global path the trajectory obtained by local quadratic planning is just the fitting result of the global path and cannot be proved to be optimal therefore how to directly find an efficient trajectory through a global motion planning approach is an open problem in present paper we propose a predicted trajectory approach with global path guiding gpta to perform the global motion planning for usvs considering all dynamic constraints of the usv the approach combines the predicted trajectories with grid map and employs the a search method to find the efficient trajectory to improve the computational efficiency the theta is used to generate the global shortest path which can accurately estimate the heuristic cost of the objective function the rest of present paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the mathematical model for usvs motion under environmental perturbations in section 3 the pta and gpta are proposed to carry out the motion planning for an underactuated usv simulation results are presented and discussed in section 4 considering the algorithmic comparison and environmental influence section 5 gives concluding remarks concerning our works 2 mathematical model of the usv the horizontal motions and control variables of usv are defined and measured with respect to the north up coordinate system n and the body fixed coordinate system b as shown in fig 1 the north up coordinate system is denoted as x g o g y g frame in which the position and orientation of usv are measured relative to a defined origin the body fixed coordinate system x b o b y b is fixed to the usv and moves along with it horizontal motion responses of the usv including surge sway and yaw have dynamics resulting from the propeller rudder and environmental loads the relationship between the generalized position in n and generalized velocity in b is given through a transformation matrix r ψ 1 η r ψ v where r ψ is 2 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 to simulate the motion responses under environmental forces and control efforts the generalized three degrees of freedom equations that ignore the roll pitch and heave motions are used as follows fossen 2011 3 m r b v m a v r c r b v

corresponding coriolis and centripetal matrix due to added mass d v r is the damping matrix η x y ψ t is the generalized position vector of the usv corresponding to the x g axis position y g axis position and yaw angle respectively v u v r t is the vector of generalized velocity denoting the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate of the vehicle respectively v r v v c is the relative

ψ 14 v w v w sin β w ψ where v w is the wind speed and β w is the wind direction for a fully actuated system motion planning is unnecessary because the ship can trace most trajectories by adjusting and optimizing the control parameters however not all motion states can be satisfied for an underactuated system where the degrees of control are less than the degrees of freedom considering that most ships are underactuated equipped with limited propeller and rudder present paper focuses on underactuated usvs using motion planning approach to find an efficient trajectory from the starting point to the goal in order to simplify the model the surge force is assumed to be a constant considering that the sway force acting on the underactuated usvs is relatively small the sway force is assumed to be zero only the yaw moment is directly applied as the control input of the ship s mathematical model 3 global motion planning 3 1 environmental mapping based on grid map a global map containing environmental information is firstly established grid map as one of the most widely used methods in robotics and video games lee et al 2011 nash and koenig 2013 decomposes a satellite map into grids with blocked and unblocked cells each pixel in the satellite map is identified as either 1 or 0 by means of a binarization function im2bw in matlab thus the satellite map is converted to a binary array and conveniently stored in computers fig 2 shows an anchorage in the yangtze river and its grid map after rasterization to ensure the navigation safety of the usv the original grid map needs to be expanded with obstacles niu et al 2018 2020 in the strategy each blocked cell is expanded by s r meters as shown in fig 3 the expanded cells will be treated as the blocked cells for motion planning therefore only the trajectory that avoids all expanded cells can be viewed as a successful obstacle avoidance in this way the usv can travel safely in addition the safe grid map method zhong et al 2020 is also used to evaluate the risk costs of unblocked cells located near the expanded cells the following risk function r c can be defined as 15 r c 5 d s 1 4 s 1 d s 2 3 s 2 d s 3 2 s 3 d s 4 1 d s 4 where d represents the distance between the unblocked cell and its nearest expanded cell s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are the threshold values of distance the risk costs of all unblocked cells is evaluated by r c to obtain the safe grid map with risk areas as shown in fig 3 a layer of risk cells with decreasing gray values is produced near expanded cells 3 2 pta on grid map taking the physical characteristics of propeller and rudder into account pta firstly obtains two sets the dynamic window m d and the feasible region m f m d contains all the yaw moments the usv can achieve within the unit sampling interval δ t based on the current yaw moment the dynamic window is defined as 16 m d τ r r τ r τ r c τ r δ t τ r c τ r δ t where τ r c is current control input of yaw moment and τ r is the maximum differential of yaw moment determined by the usv s inherent properties the feasible region can be expressed as 17 m f τ r r τ r τ r min τ r max considering the two limitations the moment space m s is defined by their intersection 18 m s m d m f then the moment space is discretized into a series of feasible yaw moments according to a given interval δ τ r for each feasible yaw moment the trajectory can be predicted by using mathematical model of the usv han et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 during the whole process the usv travels forward within the predicted time t p and the feasible yaw moment maintains unchanged finally all predicted trajectories are decomposed into waypoints according to the unit sampling interval δ t if a waypoint is located in the blocked cells the blue dotted line in fig 4 or two adjacent waypoints are blocked the red dotted line in fig 4 the corresponding trajectory will be discarded the lineofsight function daniel et al 2010 is used to determine whether there is an obstacle between two waypoints in grid map 3 3 waypoint chosen by a search similar to the application of a on visibility graphs lozano pérez and wesley 1979 a search method can also be used for finding the feasible waypoints on grid map considering the risk costs of cells in grid map the objective function of the traditional a algorithm in present paper is updated as 19 f c g c h c λ r c where the g value g c is the actual time cost from the starting point to the waypoint found so far the user provided h value h c is the heuristic cost from the waypoint to the goal r c is the accumulated risk value from the starting point to the waypoint according to eq 15 λ is the safety weighting coefficient the f value f c is an estimate sailing time corresponding to the trajectory from the starting point via the waypoint to the goal when using the a search method the performance of final trajectory may deteriorate if the estimated cost of h value is greater than its actual cost hart et al 1968 therefore h c can be expressed as 20 h c l d v max where l d is the euclidean distance between the waypoint and the goal v max represents the maximum speed usv can achieve in addition a search method maintains two global data structures 1 the open list is a priority queue containing the cells that a considers for expansion 2 the closed list is a set containing all cells that a has already been expanded it ensures that a expands each cell at most once fig 5 shows an example trace of pta iteration 0 the coordinate of the starting point is l1 green triangle and the goal is a12 green pentagram at the starting point the initial motion states of usv including position information and speed information and current control input of yaw moment are given iteration 1 the starting point is selected as the current waypoint cwp according to eq 16 18 the moment space is obtained and the trajectories can be predicted by putting the discrete yaw moment into the mathematical model of usv if the predicted trajectory collides with the obstacle or boundary it will be discarded the green dotted trajectory in fig 5 b the remaining trajectories will be decomposed into waypoints and the f value of each waypoint is calculated according to eq 19 if there are multiple waypoints in the same cell like k2 the waypoint with the smallest f value will be selected and added to the open list the waypoint turns blue and the cell corresponding to the waypoint turns yellow so as to realize one to one matching between the waypoint and the cell at the same time the motion information and control input arriving at this waypoint are saved in the corresponding cell so as to retrieve the feasible trajectory from the cwp to the starting point in reverse finally the cwp adds to the close list the cell corresponding to the cwp will turn blue in the next iteration the flow chart of search process is shown in fig 6 iteration 2 the waypoint with the smallest f value in open list is taken as the new cwp taking the motion states and yaw moment of new cwp as the input of usv model the predicted trajectories can be generated in this way the initial and final states of each trajectory are continuous then the newly expanded waypoint and its f value can also be obtained through the flow chart as can be observed in fig 6 if the f value of the newly obtained waypoint is smaller than the old value of its corresponding cell in open list the old one will be replaced by the newly expanded waypoint to keep the one to one matching between the cell and the waypoint the motion information and control input stored in the corresponding cell are also be updated for example the f value of the newly expanded waypoint in cell i6 of iteration 2 is smaller than that of iteration 1 so the waypoint stored in cell i6 of open list needs to be replaced by the newly expanded waypoint iteration 5 it can be seen that several newly generated trajectories can bypass obstacles and gradually approach to the goal iteration 17 all predicted trajectories collide with the obstacles or exceed the boundary it means that no waypoints are generated in this iteration and the open list is not updated then pta need to determine whether the open list is empty according to the flow chart in fig 6 if the open list is empty the motion planning fails and no feasible trajectory can be found if not the waypoint with the smallest f value from open list will be chosen as the new cwp and the iteration continues iteration 20 a new expanded waypoint appears on the cell where the goal is located indicating that the algorithm has found a feasible trajectory from the starting point to the goal but this trajectory may not be optimal iteration 29 waypoint in the goal cell a12 have been updated indicating that the search algorithm has found a more efficient trajectory iteration 36 when the cwp is located at the goal cell the final trajectory can be reconstructed inversely according to the motion states of waypoints saved in cells previously 3 4 pta with global path guiding as a heuristic cost the larger the h value is the higher the searching efficiency of the algorithm will be however the estimated cost of h value should be less than its actual cost to ensure the performance of the final trajectory found by a search method hart et al 1968 lozano pérez and wesley 1979 pta directly uses the euclidean distance to calculate the sailing time from the waypoint to the goal while the true shortest distance between them is always greater than the euclidean distance as shown in fig 7 when the h value of waypoint c in cell h5 is calculated pta will directly use the straight line distance c a12 to estimate the sailing time of usv but the path c a12 does not represent the true shortest path taking the obstacle into account therefore using euclidean distance to estimate the sailing time from waypoint to the goal may lead to the decrease of search efficiency different from the pta this paper also proposed an pta with global path guiding gpta to improve the search efficiency gpta obtains a global shortest path from the starting point to the goal before the algorithm runs the solid blue line l1 p a12 in fig 7 is the true shortest path from the starting point to the goal using theta algorithm nash and koenig 2013 when calculating the true shortest distance the gpta needs to find a visible turning point closest to the waypoint for example p is the visible turning point that the waypoint c needs to seek in fig 7 so the true shortest distance from the waypoint c to the goal is the path c p a12 it should be noted that the lineofsight function daniel et al 2010 is used to judge whether two points are visible therefore the calculation of h value in gpta is changed to 21 h c l shortest v max where l shortest represents the true shortest distance from the waypoint to the goal 4 results and discussion in this section multiple simulation experiments with different methods and environmental perturbations are implemented to verify the proposed motion planning approaches considering the underactuated characteristic of usv cybership ii skjetne et al 2004 is used in present paper by ignoring the redundant propulsion and steering device its mass is 23 8 kg length is 1 255 m and breadth is 0 29 m the map in fig 2 b is consist of 900 600 grids and the length of each grid is 0 1 m other simulation parameters are shown in table 1 all path planning algorithms are implemented in matlab 2018b and executed on intel core 9 cpu 3 6 ghz with 32 gb ram 4 1 comparative studies in present subsection the initial generalized position of the usv is η 0 22 76 π 4 t the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t and the goal is η g 50 20 t 4 1 1 comparisons of pta and gpta the biggest difference between pta and gpta is that the h value used by pta is the euclidean distance while gpta uses the true shortest distance obtained by theta algorithm numerical simulations separately based on pta and gpta are conducted and the results of planned trajectories and expanded cells are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that the planned trajectories of both pta and gpta are smooth and none of them collide with obstacles for an intuitive comparison the performances of pta and gpta are summarized in table 2 the trajectory length and sailing time refer to the total length and efficiency of the usv s navigation from the starting point to the goal respectively heading change is the sum of yaw velocities during the whole voyage the computational time is an average value of 1000 runs according to the statistics gpta has better performance in terms of both computational efficiency and navigation efficiency compared to pta different from the local planning gpta is a global motion planning approach which does not perform real time reactions to uncertain obstacles accordingly it may take a long time to find the efficient trajectory in an intricate mapped environment considering the feature of offline computing the computational efficiency of gpta will be ignored in the following analysis 4 1 2 comparisons of tus hgl and gpta to validate the proposed approach the trajectory units tus proposed by du et al 2018 and hybrid algorithm combining global and local path planning hgl proposed by wang and xu 2020 are carried out to compare their performances of motion planning fig 9 shows the results of planned trajectories motion states including yaw angles surge and sway velocities and yaw moments as can be seen from fig 9 a trajectories obtained by hgl and gpta are significantly better than tus in terms of sailing time usv needs 125 5 s to reach the goal with the trajectory obtained by hgl while gpta needs 125 s in fig 9 b the yaw moment of hgl fluctuates greatly during steering frequent adjustment of rudder is not only harmful for navigation safety but also increases wear of mechanism devices inversely the yaw moments of both tus and gpta maintain relatively stable 4 1 3 comparisons of tus hgl and gpta on expanded grid map as the grid map expands some areas may become too narrow for the usv to pass through in present subsection tus hgl and gpta are performed on expanded grid map as can be observed in fig 10 after expanding the obstacles tus and gpta take 144 5 s and 129 s respectively for the whole voyage and hgl fails to plan at 33 5 s and no feasible trajectory is found as shown in fig 10 the core of hgl is to use global path to guide local planning in narrow waters the global planning method can still avoid obstacles to find the shortest path whereas the local planning is easy to fall into local extremum caused by the inflection points of large curvature in the global path which exceed the performance of usv and result in planning failure 4 1 4 comparisons of gpta with different safety weighting coefficients in order to avoid the usv being too close to obstacles the safe grid map is created to evaluate the risk costs of cells gpta with different safety weighting coefficients is performed to compare their performances of motion planning the results of planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments are shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a a layer of risk cells with decreasing gray values will be produced near expanded cells which is marked as the dangerous areas when the weight is 0 02 the planned trajectory directly passes through the dangerous areas and sails out of the dock while the usv will first choose to turn left to stay away from the dangerous areas when the weight is 0 05 or 0 08 this difference can also be seen from the yaw angle in the first 10 s of fig 11 b when the weights are 0 02 0 05 0 08 the sailing times from the starting point to the goal are 129 s 132 s and 133 s and the accumulated risk values r c are 178 91 and 78 respectively increasing of the safety weighting coefficient the planned trajectory will be far away from the obstacles and the sailing time of the ship will be longer considering the combination of the navigation efficiency and safety λ 0 05 is selected in the following simulations 4 2 motion planning under wind and current perturbations in present subsection the influence of environmental loads including wind and current is discussed for global motion planning 4 2 1 the influence of wind the initial generalized position of the usv is η 0 16 72 3 π 4 t the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t and the goal is η g 33 10 t when the wind direction is β w 3 π 4 the planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments obtained by using the gpta under different wind speeds are shown in fig 12 when the wind speeds are 0 5 m s 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s the usv needs 119 s 118 s and 116 5 s for arrival respectively therefore the current wind direction is favorable to the usv s navigation in terms of the accumulated risk value r c trajectories corresponding to different wind speeds are 7 8 and 8 respectively the usv can sail safely the performance of gpta under different wind directions is also discussed the results of planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments are shown in fig 13 in simulations the wind speed is fixed as v w 1 5 m s it can be seen from fig 13 a that all trajectories obtained by motion planning are relatively similar under different wind directions the corresponding sailing times of usv are 117 5 s 120 s and 119 s when the wind directions are π 3 π 3 and π respectively the force component of wind acting on usv increases the sailing speed when the wind direction is π 3 and the force component of wind acting on the usv reduces its speed and increases the time for arrival when the wind direction is π or π 3 in addition the accumulated risk values corresponding to different wind directions are 11 7 and 10 respectively so all planned trajectories are far away from obstacles compared with r c 12 when the wind speed is zero the impacts of both wind speed and wind direction on the safety of planned trajectory are almost negligible in these simulations 4 2 2 the influence of current in present simulations the initial generalized position of the usv is η 0 33 10 π 2 t the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t the goal is η g 33 86 t the wind speed is set to 1 5 m s and wind direction is set to π rad the current direction of the yangtze river is fixed at π 2 on grid map the planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments obtained by using the gpta under different current speeds are shown in fig 14 when the usv sails downstream it requires 135 5 s 130 5 s and 130 5 s to reach the goal under the different current speeds normally the sailing time is proportional to the current speed however compared to v c 0 1 m s the sailing time of the usv does not decrease when the current speed is added to 0 15 m s this is because moving too fast will increase the turning radius of usv meanwhile the trajectory become tortuous to avoid obstacles in addition the accumulated risk values corresponding to different current speeds are 90 45 and 72 respectively compared with r c 14 when the current speed is zero sailing downstream will significantly increase the accumulated risk value of planned trajectories it also indicates that a too large sailing speed will decrease the obstacle avoidance ability of usv under different current speeds we continue to compare the performance of sailing upstream the initial generalized position of the usv is changed to η 0 33 86 π 2 t and the goal is changed to η g 33 10 t and the results of planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments are shown in fig 15 when the usv sails upstream it takes 154 s 169 s and 186 5 s to reach the goal under the different current speeds correspondingly the accumulated risk values of the planned trajectories are 31 20 and 16 respectively compared with the tortuous trajectory of sailing downstream the trajectories obtained in fig 15 a are smooth in addition upstream voyage will decrease the relative speed of the usv the corresponding turning radius will also be reduced and the ability to avoid obstacles will be enhanced 4 2 3 comparisons of hgl and gpta under the environmental loads different from tus both hgl and gpta can take environmental influence into consideration for planning motion 100 cases are set by selecting different starting points and goal points as shown in fig 16 in which the initial yaw angle is the direction from the starting point to the goal and the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t then nine different environmental loads are set the wind direction is fixed at π and the wind speed is 0 5 m s 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s respectively the current direction is fixed at π 2 and the current speed is 0 05 m s 0 1 m s and 0 15 m s respectively the simulations are performed to compare the success rate of planning and sailing time of hgl and gpta under different environmental loads and the results are shown in table 3 the calculation of sailing time excludes the case where no feasible trajectory can be found by either hgl or gpta according to the data in table 3 the success rate of gpta in finding feasible trajectories is much higher than that of hgl and the average sailing time of planned trajectories is 2 94 faster than hgl there are 4 cases in total that no feasible trajectory can be found for gpta while 25 cases for hgl therefore gpta is superior to hgl in both success rate of planning and navigation efficiency the reason why gpta cannot find the feasible trajectory is that the starting point is too close to the obstacle which exceed the maneuverability of the underactuated usv for example when the starting point is 35 25 t and the goal is 35 31 t in fig 16 the usv will not be able to get the feasible trajectory because the starting point is too close to the obstacle therefore the failure to get the feasible trajectory is not caused by the algorithm itself but by the physical limitations of the usv and the layout of the map 5 conclusion in this paper two global motion planning approaches pta and gpta are proposed to find a high efficiency trajectory considering all dynamic constraints of the underactuated usv pta and gpta integrate predicted trajectories directly into the grid map and search the final trajectory by a search method with consideration of efficiency and safety in order to verify the efficacy of the proposed approaches multiple numerical experiments with different methods and environmental perturbations are implemented and relevant conclusions are summarized as follows 1 different from pta using euclidean distance directly gpta has a better estimate for the heuristic cost of the objective function through a global path obtained by theta therefore gpta is superior to pta in terms of both computational efficiency and navigation efficiency 2 compared to tus and hgl gpta can find a more efficient trajectory on both unexpanded and expanded grid maps in terms of success rate of planning gpta also has better performance especially in narrow waters 3 pta and gpta proposed in present paper can take environmental factors into account in a complex terrain like the anchorage used in present paper the planned trajectories of usv sailing downstream are more tortuous and dangerous than sailing upstream by comparing their voyage and accumulated risk values gpta usually takes ten or even tens of seconds to find the efficient trajectory although the global motion planning can ignore the real time performance it is an indisputable fact that the computational efficiency of gpta is relatively poor the algorithm will be improved to increase computational efficiency in the future credit authorship contribution statement sen han conceptualization methodology software data curation

20241,this paper presents a predicted trajectory approach pta for global motion planning of an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle usv different from the conventional path planning algorithms which mostly focus on the shortest safest or smoothest paths pta takes all the dynamic constraints of the usv into account and finds the global trajectory that can be traced precisely via its own maneuvering system in present strategy the predicted trajectories produced by the mathematical model of the usv are decomposed into a series of waypoints on grid map then an efficient trajectory can be found for the usv by performing the a search method to improve the search efficiency and accuracy the pta is enhanced with global path guiding gpta when searching for feasible trajectories gpta can employ the global path obtained by theta to accurately estimate the heuristic cost of the objective function rather than using the euclidean distance directly as pta does numerical simulations in various scenarios are conducted to compare the performance of the pta gpta trajectory units tus and hybrid path planning algorithm combining global and local path planning hgl the results demonstrate that gpta has higher safety and navigation efficiency for motion planning of the underactuated usv keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv motion planning predicted trajectory approach collision avoidance 1 introduction due to the continuous demand for exploring oceanic resources unmanned surface vehicles usvs have been increasingly applied in both commercial and military fields including ocean sampling environmental monitoring bathymetric survey maritime search and rescue hydrologic survey harbor surveillance and defense svec and gupta 2012 sharma et al 2014 liu and bucknall 2016 to autonomously execute these sophisticated tasks it is vital to plan out a high efficiency trajectory for an usv however finding a practical trajectory becomes rather challenging since the feasibility safety and efficiency are compositely required to be optimized in complicated marine environments including static obstacles dynamic obstacles and environmental perturbations claussmann et al 2020 wang et al 2020 path planning as one of the critical technologies of usv navigation has been drawing much attention according to different dynamic constraints the path planning can be divided into three stages route planning trajectory planning and motion planning gu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b dynamic constraints zhou et al 2020b are defined as the restrictions on the ship s motion including position velocity and acceleration due to its physical limitations e g maximum minimum and change rate of surge force provided by propeller route planning regards the usv as a particle and ignores all dynamic constraints song et al 2019 proposed a smoothed a algorithm for route planning of unmanned surface vehicles compared to the conventional a algorithm the proposed approach retained the fast and efficient route searching and made it more suitable for usv navigation shah and gupta 2016 2019 presented the speeding up a on visibility graphs method to search long distance paths in large size of the marine environment to improve search efficiency the focused search algorithm and the associated search heuristics were developed to reduce the computational time without significantly sacrificing the optimality of the computed path however it is inevitable that the computational time of the developed algorithm will increase with the growing obstacle density wu et al 2021 proposed a long distance route planning method based on multi scale visibility graph to solve the problems of the slow planning and poor route accuracy in these researches the application scenarios of route planning mainly concentrate on large scale environments but for the usv performing in complex terrains such as the harbor and inland river route planning is difficult to be directly applied most usvs are underactuated and their motion is restricted by nonholonomic kinematic constraints and the limited control authority of real actuators to ensure that a usv can trace the planned trajectory with minimal errors and thus help to guarantee collision free operation the trajectories generated by the planner should account for the inherent limitations of the vehicle s dynamic response bertaska et al 2015 shah et al 2016 bertaska and von ellenrieder 2019 trajectory planning considers partial dynamic constraints like size speed heading and curvature chrpa and osborne 2014 du et al 2019 kim et al 2014 and lee et al 2015 suggested a new angular rate constrained theta arc theta algorithm in which the planned paths considered the constraints of both yaw rates and heading angles of the usv liu et al 2017 developed an angle guidance fast marching square algorithm which was able to search the optimal path based on usv s motion constraints chen et al 2020 proposed a hybrid approach of fast marching square and velocity obstacles method for global path planning with consideration of both velocity constraint of the ship and influences of collision risk all these methods had found feasible trajectories and achieved good results however some interactions among the constraints might be ignored in these trajectory planning approaches zhou et al 2020b motion planning considers the overall dynamic constraints petti and fraichard 2005 presented a variant of the rapidly exploring random tree rrt algorithm to obtain feasible trajectories in high dimensional state spaces for robots with dynamical constraints however the planned trajectories are generally rough due to the use of random sampling during the search the problem was solved by a newly developed variant of the algorithm named rrt karaman and frazzoli 2010 approaches based on random sampling are widely used in motion planning of the robotics such as industrial robots unmanned ground vehicle unmanned aerial vehicle etc moon and chung 2015 salzman and halperin 2016 li et al 2018 however the large inertia resistance and response time of the usv may introduce difficulties when applying the approach apart from the complicated interference of wind wave and current fossen et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 thus the above methods on random sampling need to be further improved for usv s motion planning zhou et al 2020b moreover the search based deliberative motion planning approach had also been widely used likhachev and ferguson 2009 dolgov et al 2010 bertaska et al 2013 svec et al 2013 švec et al 2014 the challenge of this approach is that the computational time significantly increases with the increase in the dimension of the state space complexity of the motion primitive set complexity of the environment etc as for the motion planning of usvs du et al 2018 proposed a trajectory units approach to realize the fine motion control in a small range of scenario however most trajectories from their search approach were not smooth under the influence of obstacles and its computational time increased exponentially with the expanded search area zhou et al 2020a further gave a novel motion planning method based on topological position relationships tpr for dealing with the long search time problem and making the planned trajectory more realistic yoo and kim 2016 adopted the reinforcement learning algorithm to produce feasible trajectories considering the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and ocean disturbances moreover some researchers proposed several hybrid algorithms that effectively combining global and local path planning to deal with the motion planning problem wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 wang and xu 2020 these hybrid algorithms can be divided into two steps first an unblocked initial path from the starting point to the goal can be acquired by means of a traditional global route planning algorithm such as a shi et al 2019 theta daniel et al 2010 fast marching method wang et al 2019 etc second the local planning approach is employed to produce the final trajectory which contains kinematics and dynamics constraints of usvs these hybrid path planning algorithms have good real time performance and strong dynamic obstacle avoidance capability however the hybrid scheme can only guarantee the optimality of the global path the trajectory obtained by local quadratic planning is just the fitting result of the global path and cannot be proved to be optimal therefore how to directly find an efficient trajectory through a global motion planning approach is an open problem in present paper we propose a predicted trajectory approach with global path guiding gpta to perform the global motion planning for usvs considering all dynamic constraints of the usv the approach combines the predicted trajectories with grid map and employs the a search method to find the efficient trajectory to improve the computational efficiency the theta is used to generate the global shortest path which can accurately estimate the heuristic cost of the objective function the rest of present paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the mathematical model for usvs motion under environmental perturbations in section 3 the pta and gpta are proposed to carry out the motion planning for an underactuated usv simulation results are presented and discussed in section 4 considering the algorithmic comparison and environmental influence section 5 gives concluding remarks concerning our works 2 mathematical model of the usv the horizontal motions and control variables of usv are defined and measured with respect to the north up coordinate system n and the body fixed coordinate system b as shown in fig 1 the north up coordinate system is denoted as x g o g y g frame in which the position and orientation of usv are measured relative to a defined origin the body fixed coordinate system x b o b y b is fixed to the usv and moves along with it horizontal motion responses of the usv including surge sway and yaw have dynamics resulting from the propeller rudder and environmental loads the relationship between the generalized position in n and generalized velocity in b is given through a transformation matrix r ψ 1 η r ψ v where r ψ is 2 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 to simulate the motion responses under environmental forces and control efforts the generalized three degrees of freedom equations that ignore the roll pitch and heave motions are used as follows fossen 2011 3 m r b v m a v r c r b v v c a v r v r d v r v r τ τ wind where m r b is the rigid body inertia matrix m a is the hydrodynamic added mass c r b v is the matrix of rigid body coriolis and centripetal forces c a v r is the corresponding coriolis and centripetal matrix due to added mass d v r is the damping matrix η x y ψ t is the generalized position vector of the usv corresponding to the x g axis position y g axis position and yaw angle respectively v u v r t is the vector of generalized velocity denoting the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate of the vehicle respectively v r v v c is the relative velocity vector and v c is the generalized ocean current velocity of an irrotational fluid τ τ u τ v τ r t denotes the vector of control forces including surge force sway force and yaw moment τ wind is the wind loads the relevant vectors in eq 3 are expressed as 4 m r b m 0 0 0 m m x g 0 m x g i z m a x u 0 0 0 y v y r 0 n v n r 5 c r b v 0 0 m x g r v 0 0 m u m x g r v m u 0 6 c a v r 0 0 y v v

hydrodynamic derivatives because they are the partial derivatives of the forces and moment with respect to the corresponding velocities e g y r is the drag coefficient in the y direction due to angular velocity in the direction of r see box i the wind loads acting on usvs are computed as follows 8 τ wind x wind y wind n wind 1 2 ρ a v r w 2 c x γ r w a f w c y γ r w a l w c n γ r w a l w l o

be expressed by 9 v r w u r w 2 v r w 2 10 γ r w atan2 v r w u r w the relative velocities are 11 u r w u u w 12 v r w v v w the components of v w in the x b and y b directions are 13 u w v w cos β w ψ 14 v w v w sin β w ψ where v w is the wind speed and β w is the wind direction for a fully actuated system motion planning is unnecessary because the ship can trace most trajectories by adjusting and optimizing the control parameters however not all motion states can be satisfied for an underactuated system where the degrees of control are less than the degrees of freedom considering that most ships are underactuated equipped with limited propeller and rudder present paper focuses on underactuated usvs using motion planning approach to find an efficient trajectory from the starting point to the goal in order to simplify the model the surge force is assumed to be a constant considering that the sway force acting on the underactuated usvs is relatively small the sway force is assumed to be zero only the yaw moment is directly applied as the control input of the ship s mathematical model 3 global motion planning 3 1 environmental mapping based on grid map a global map containing environmental information is firstly established grid map as one of the most widely used methods in robotics and video games lee et al 2011 nash and koenig 2013 decomposes a satellite map into grids with blocked and unblocked cells each pixel in the satellite map is identified as either 1 or 0 by means of a binarization function im2bw in matlab thus the satellite map is converted to a binary array and conveniently stored in computers fig 2 shows an anchorage in the yangtze river and its grid map after rasterization to ensure the navigation safety of the usv the original grid map needs to be expanded with obstacles niu et al 2018 2020 in the strategy each blocked cell is expanded by s r meters as shown in fig 3 the expanded cells will be treated as the blocked cells for motion planning therefore only the trajectory that avoids all expanded cells can be viewed as a successful obstacle avoidance in this way the usv can travel safely in addition the safe grid map method zhong et al 2020 is also used to evaluate the risk costs of unblocked cells located near the expanded cells the following risk function r c can be defined as 15 r c 5 d s 1 4 s 1 d s 2 3 s 2 d s 3 2 s 3 d s 4 1 d s 4 where d represents the distance between the unblocked cell and its nearest expanded cell s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are the threshold values of distance the risk costs of all unblocked cells is evaluated by r c to obtain the safe grid map with risk areas as shown in fig 3 a layer of risk cells with decreasing gray values is produced near expanded cells 3 2 pta on grid map taking the physical characteristics of propeller and rudder into account pta firstly obtains two sets the dynamic window m d and the feasible region m f m d contains all the yaw moments the usv can achieve within the unit sampling interval δ t based on the current yaw moment the dynamic window is defined as 16 m d τ r r τ r τ r c τ r δ t τ r c τ r δ t where τ r c is current control input of yaw moment and τ r is the maximum differential of yaw moment determined by the usv s inherent properties the feasible region can be expressed as 17 m f τ r r τ r τ r min τ r max considering the two limitations the moment space m s is defined by their intersection 18 m s m d m f then the moment space is discretized into a series of feasible yaw moments according to a given interval δ τ r for each feasible yaw moment the trajectory can be predicted by using mathematical model of the usv han et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 during the whole process the usv travels forward within the predicted time t p and the feasible yaw moment maintains unchanged finally all predicted trajectories are decomposed into waypoints according to the unit sampling interval δ t if a waypoint is located in the blocked cells the blue dotted line in fig 4 or two adjacent waypoints are blocked the red dotted line in fig 4 the corresponding trajectory will be discarded the lineofsight function daniel et al 2010 is used to determine whether there is an obstacle between two waypoints in grid map 3 3 waypoint chosen by a search similar to the application of a on visibility graphs lozano pérez and wesley 1979 a search method can also be used for finding the feasible waypoints on grid map considering the risk costs of cells in grid map the objective function of the traditional a algorithm in present paper is updated as 19 f c g c h c λ r c where the g value g c is the actual time cost from the starting point to the waypoint found so far the user provided h value h c is the heuristic cost from the waypoint to the goal r c is the accumulated risk value from the starting point to the waypoint according to eq 15 λ is the safety weighting coefficient the f value f c is an estimate sailing time corresponding to the trajectory from the starting point via the waypoint to the goal when using the a search method the performance of final trajectory may deteriorate if the estimated cost of h value is greater than its actual cost hart et al 1968 therefore h c can be expressed as 20 h c l d v max where l d is the euclidean distance between the waypoint and the goal v max represents the maximum speed usv can achieve in addition a search method maintains two global data structures 1 the open list is a priority queue containing the cells that a considers for expansion 2 the closed list is a set containing all cells that a has already been expanded it ensures that a expands each cell at most once fig 5 shows an example trace of pta iteration 0 the coordinate of the starting point is l1 green triangle and the goal is a12 green pentagram at the starting point the initial motion states of usv including position information and speed information and current control input of yaw moment are given iteration 1 the starting point is selected as the current waypoint cwp according to eq 16 18 the moment space is obtained and the trajectories can be predicted by putting the discrete yaw moment into the mathematical model of usv if the predicted trajectory collides with the obstacle or boundary it will be discarded the green dotted trajectory in fig 5 b the remaining trajectories will be decomposed into waypoints and the f value of each waypoint is calculated according to eq 19 if there are multiple waypoints in the same cell like k2 the waypoint with the smallest f value will be selected and added to the open list the waypoint turns blue and the cell corresponding to the waypoint turns yellow so as to realize one to one matching between the waypoint and the cell at the same time the motion information and control input arriving at this waypoint are saved in the corresponding cell so as to retrieve the feasible trajectory from the cwp to the starting point in reverse finally the cwp adds to the close list the cell corresponding to the cwp will turn blue in the next iteration the flow chart of search process is shown in fig 6 iteration 2 the waypoint with the smallest f value in open list is taken as the new cwp taking the motion states and yaw moment of new cwp as the input of usv model the predicted trajectories can be generated in this way the initial and final states of each trajectory are continuous then the newly expanded waypoint and its f value can also be obtained through the flow chart as can be observed in fig 6 if the f value of the newly obtained waypoint is smaller than the old value of its corresponding cell in open list the old one will be replaced by the newly expanded waypoint to keep the one to one matching between the cell and the waypoint the motion information and control input stored in the corresponding cell are also be updated for example the f value of the newly expanded waypoint in cell i6 of iteration 2 is smaller than that of iteration 1 so the waypoint stored in cell i6 of open list needs to be replaced by the newly expanded waypoint iteration 5 it can be seen that several newly generated trajectories can bypass obstacles and gradually approach to the goal iteration 17 all predicted trajectories collide with the obstacles or exceed the boundary it means that no waypoints are generated in this iteration and the open list is not updated then pta need to determine whether the open list is empty according to the flow chart in fig 6 if the open list is empty the motion planning fails and no feasible trajectory can be found if not the waypoint with the smallest f value from open list will be chosen as the new cwp and the iteration continues iteration 20 a new expanded waypoint appears on the cell where the goal is located indicating that the algorithm has found a feasible trajectory from the starting point to the goal but this trajectory may not be optimal iteration 29 waypoint in the goal cell a12 have been updated indicating that the search algorithm has found a more efficient trajectory iteration 36 when the cwp is located at the goal cell the final trajectory can be reconstructed inversely according to the motion states of waypoints saved in cells previously 3 4 pta with global path guiding as a heuristic cost the larger the h value is the higher the searching efficiency of the algorithm will be however the estimated cost of h value should be less than its actual cost to ensure the performance of the final trajectory found by a search method hart et al 1968 lozano pérez and wesley 1979 pta directly uses the euclidean distance to calculate the sailing time from the waypoint to the goal while the true shortest distance between them is always greater than the euclidean distance as shown in fig 7 when the h value of waypoint c in cell h5 is calculated pta will directly use the straight line distance c a12 to estimate the sailing time of usv but the path c a12 does not represent the true shortest path taking the obstacle into account therefore using euclidean distance to estimate the sailing time from waypoint to the goal may lead to the decrease of search efficiency different from the pta this paper also proposed an pta with global path guiding gpta to improve the search efficiency gpta obtains a global shortest path from the starting point to the goal before the algorithm runs the solid blue line l1 p a12 in fig 7 is the true shortest path from the starting point to the goal using theta algorithm nash and koenig 2013 when calculating the true shortest distance the gpta needs to find a visible turning point closest to the waypoint for example p is the visible turning point that the waypoint c needs to seek in fig 7 so the true shortest distance from the waypoint c to the goal is the path c p a12 it should be noted that the lineofsight function daniel et al 2010 is used to judge whether two points are visible therefore the calculation of h value in gpta is changed to 21 h c l shortest v max where l shortest represents the true shortest distance from the waypoint to the goal 4 results and discussion in this section multiple simulation experiments with different methods and environmental perturbations are implemented to verify the proposed motion planning approaches considering the underactuated characteristic of usv cybership ii skjetne et al 2004 is used in present paper by ignoring the redundant propulsion and steering device its mass is 23 8 kg length is 1 255 m and breadth is 0 29 m the map in fig 2 b is consist of 900 600 grids and the length of each grid is 0 1 m other simulation parameters are shown in table 1 all path planning algorithms are implemented in matlab 2018b and executed on intel core 9 cpu 3 6 ghz with 32 gb ram 4 1 comparative studies in present subsection the initial generalized position of the usv is η 0 22 76 π 4 t the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t and the goal is η g 50 20 t 4 1 1 comparisons of pta and gpta the biggest difference between pta and gpta is that the h value used by pta is the euclidean distance while gpta uses the true shortest distance obtained by theta algorithm numerical simulations separately based on pta and gpta are conducted and the results of planned trajectories and expanded cells are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that the planned trajectories of both pta and gpta are smooth and none of them collide with obstacles for an intuitive comparison the performances of pta and gpta are summarized in table 2 the trajectory length and sailing time refer to the total length and efficiency of the usv s navigation from the starting point to the goal respectively heading change is the sum of yaw velocities during the whole voyage the computational time is an average value of 1000 runs according to the statistics gpta has better performance in terms of both computational efficiency and navigation efficiency compared to pta different from the local planning gpta is a global motion planning approach which does not perform real time reactions to uncertain obstacles accordingly it may take a long time to find the efficient trajectory in an intricate mapped environment considering the feature of offline computing the computational efficiency of gpta will be ignored in the following analysis 4 1 2 comparisons of tus hgl and gpta to validate the proposed approach the trajectory units tus proposed by du et al 2018 and hybrid algorithm combining global and local path planning hgl proposed by wang and xu 2020 are carried out to compare their performances of motion planning fig 9 shows the results of planned trajectories motion states including yaw angles surge and sway velocities and yaw moments as can be seen from fig 9 a trajectories obtained by hgl and gpta are significantly better than tus in terms of sailing time usv needs 125 5 s to reach the goal with the trajectory obtained by hgl while gpta needs 125 s in fig 9 b the yaw moment of hgl fluctuates greatly during steering frequent adjustment of rudder is not only harmful for navigation safety but also increases wear of mechanism devices inversely the yaw moments of both tus and gpta maintain relatively stable 4 1 3 comparisons of tus hgl and gpta on expanded grid map as the grid map expands some areas may become too narrow for the usv to pass through in present subsection tus hgl and gpta are performed on expanded grid map as can be observed in fig 10 after expanding the obstacles tus and gpta take 144 5 s and 129 s respectively for the whole voyage and hgl fails to plan at 33 5 s and no feasible trajectory is found as shown in fig 10 the core of hgl is to use global path to guide local planning in narrow waters the global planning method can still avoid obstacles to find the shortest path whereas the local planning is easy to fall into local extremum caused by the inflection points of large curvature in the global path which exceed the performance of usv and result in planning failure 4 1 4 comparisons of gpta with different safety weighting coefficients in order to avoid the usv being too close to obstacles the safe grid map is created to evaluate the risk costs of cells gpta with different safety weighting coefficients is performed to compare their performances of motion planning the results of planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments are shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a a layer of risk cells with decreasing gray values will be produced near expanded cells which is marked as the dangerous areas when the weight is 0 02 the planned trajectory directly passes through the dangerous areas and sails out of the dock while the usv will first choose to turn left to stay away from the dangerous areas when the weight is 0 05 or 0 08 this difference can also be seen from the yaw angle in the first 10 s of fig 11 b when the weights are 0 02 0 05 0 08 the sailing times from the starting point to the goal are 129 s 132 s and 133 s and the accumulated risk values r c are 178 91 and 78 respectively increasing of the safety weighting coefficient the planned trajectory will be far away from the obstacles and the sailing time of the ship will be longer considering the combination of the navigation efficiency and safety λ 0 05 is selected in the following simulations 4 2 motion planning under wind and current perturbations in present subsection the influence of environmental loads including wind and current is discussed for global motion planning 4 2 1 the influence of wind the initial generalized position of the usv is η 0 16 72 3 π 4 t the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t and the goal is η g 33 10 t when the wind direction is β w 3 π 4 the planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments obtained by using the gpta under different wind speeds are shown in fig 12 when the wind speeds are 0 5 m s 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s the usv needs 119 s 118 s and 116 5 s for arrival respectively therefore the current wind direction is favorable to the usv s navigation in terms of the accumulated risk value r c trajectories corresponding to different wind speeds are 7 8 and 8 respectively the usv can sail safely the performance of gpta under different wind directions is also discussed the results of planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments are shown in fig 13 in simulations the wind speed is fixed as v w 1 5 m s it can be seen from fig 13 a that all trajectories obtained by motion planning are relatively similar under different wind directions the corresponding sailing times of usv are 117 5 s 120 s and 119 s when the wind directions are π 3 π 3 and π respectively the force component of wind acting on usv increases the sailing speed when the wind direction is π 3 and the force component of wind acting on the usv reduces its speed and increases the time for arrival when the wind direction is π or π 3 in addition the accumulated risk values corresponding to different wind directions are 11 7 and 10 respectively so all planned trajectories are far away from obstacles compared with r c 12 when the wind speed is zero the impacts of both wind speed and wind direction on the safety of planned trajectory are almost negligible in these simulations 4 2 2 the influence of current in present simulations the initial generalized position of the usv is η 0 33 10 π 2 t the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t the goal is η g 33 86 t the wind speed is set to 1 5 m s and wind direction is set to π rad the current direction of the yangtze river is fixed at π 2 on grid map the planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments obtained by using the gpta under different current speeds are shown in fig 14 when the usv sails downstream it requires 135 5 s 130 5 s and 130 5 s to reach the goal under the different current speeds normally the sailing time is proportional to the current speed however compared to v c 0 1 m s the sailing time of the usv does not decrease when the current speed is added to 0 15 m s this is because moving too fast will increase the turning radius of usv meanwhile the trajectory become tortuous to avoid obstacles in addition the accumulated risk values corresponding to different current speeds are 90 45 and 72 respectively compared with r c 14 when the current speed is zero sailing downstream will significantly increase the accumulated risk value of planned trajectories it also indicates that a too large sailing speed will decrease the obstacle avoidance ability of usv under different current speeds we continue to compare the performance of sailing upstream the initial generalized position of the usv is changed to η 0 33 86 π 2 t and the goal is changed to η g 33 10 t and the results of planned trajectories motion states and yaw moments are shown in fig 15 when the usv sails upstream it takes 154 s 169 s and 186 5 s to reach the goal under the different current speeds correspondingly the accumulated risk values of the planned trajectories are 31 20 and 16 respectively compared with the tortuous trajectory of sailing downstream the trajectories obtained in fig 15 a are smooth in addition upstream voyage will decrease the relative speed of the usv the corresponding turning radius will also be reduced and the ability to avoid obstacles will be enhanced 4 2 3 comparisons of hgl and gpta under the environmental loads different from tus both hgl and gpta can take environmental influence into consideration for planning motion 100 cases are set by selecting different starting points and goal points as shown in fig 16 in which the initial yaw angle is the direction from the starting point to the goal and the initial generalized velocity is v 0 0 0 0 t then nine different environmental loads are set the wind direction is fixed at π and the wind speed is 0 5 m s 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s respectively the current direction is fixed at π 2 and the current speed is 0 05 m s 0 1 m s and 0 15 m s respectively the simulations are performed to compare the success rate of planning and sailing time of hgl and gpta under different environmental loads and the results are shown in table 3 the calculation of sailing time excludes the case where no feasible trajectory can be found by either hgl or gpta according to the data in table 3 the success rate of gpta in finding feasible trajectories is much higher than that of hgl and the average sailing time of planned trajectories is 2 94 faster than hgl there are 4 cases in total that no feasible trajectory can be found for gpta while 25 cases for hgl therefore gpta is superior to hgl in both success rate of planning and navigation efficiency the reason why gpta cannot find the feasible trajectory is that the starting point is too close to the obstacle which exceed the maneuverability of the underactuated usv for example when the starting point is 35 25 t and the goal is 35 31 t in fig 16 the usv will not be able to get the feasible trajectory because the starting point is too close to the obstacle therefore the failure to get the feasible trajectory is not caused by the algorithm itself but by the physical limitations of the usv and the layout of the map 5 conclusion in this paper two global motion planning approaches pta and gpta are proposed to find a high efficiency trajectory considering all dynamic constraints of the underactuated usv pta and gpta integrate predicted trajectories directly into the grid map and search the final trajectory by a search method with consideration of efficiency and safety in order to verify the efficacy of the proposed approaches multiple numerical experiments with different methods and environmental perturbations are implemented and relevant conclusions are summarized as follows 1 different from pta using euclidean distance directly gpta has a better estimate for the heuristic cost of the objective function through a global path obtained by theta therefore gpta is superior to pta in terms of both computational efficiency and navigation efficiency 2 compared to tus and hgl gpta can find a more efficient trajectory on both unexpanded and expanded grid maps in terms of success rate of planning gpta also has better performance especially in narrow waters 3 pta and gpta proposed in present paper can take environmental factors into account in a complex terrain like the anchorage used in present paper the planned trajectories of usv sailing downstream are more tortuous and dangerous than sailing upstream by comparing their voyage and accumulated risk values gpta usually takes ten or even tens of seconds to find the efficient trajectory although the global motion planning can ignore the real time performance it is an indisputable fact that the computational efficiency of gpta is relatively poor the algorithm will be improved to increase computational efficiency in the future credit authorship contribution statement sen han conceptualization methodology software data curation

20242,an analytical solution is developed to investigate the seismic responses of end bearing piles considering water pile soil interactions the pile is assumed to have a linear viscoelastic and circular cross section the soil and water are modelled as linear viscoelastic media and linear acoustic media respectively the seismic responses of the free field soil displacement under horizontal earthquakes are first given neglecting water soil interactions analytical expressions for the impedance of the soil and water media are further derived the pile displacements induced by horizontal earthquakes are then obtained based on the continuity conditions of the pile with soil and water the present solution is compared with the substructure method to verify the rationality of the present analytical solution parametric analyses are finally conducted to investigate the effects of the water soil and pile parameters on the seismic responses of the pile the results indicate that it is necessary to consider the water pile soil interaction in the design of piles installed in offshore areas keywords analytical solution dynamic response pile soil interaction pile water interaction horizontal earthquakes viscoelastic soil 1 introduction pile foundations play an important role in supporting offshore structures which are often subjected to horizontal dynamic loads such as wave loads wind loads and seismic loads hence analysing the dynamic characteristics of piles under horizontal earthquakes is of great significance for the design of offshore foundations wang et al 2010 mannaa and baidyab 2010 yang and pan 2010 since the vibration of the pile is directly affected by the surrounding soil the dynamic interaction between the pile and soil has always been a prominent research area gao et al 2017 dai et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in addition the coupling action between water piles and soil is also considered in offshore structures which is different from those on lands such as high pile wharfs offshore wind turbines and oil platforms therefore in consideration of the safety of offshore structures it is necessary to study the dynamic response of offshore structures considering water pile soil interaction under horizontal earthquakes in recent years the problem of coupled pile soil vibration under horizontal dynamic loads has been widely studied by scholars in the early stage many scholars regarded pile foundations as the beam model of the winkler foundation gazetas et al 1984 dezi et al 2009 desanctis et al 2010 laora et al 2012 anoyatis et al 2013 2017 the winkler model uses springs and dashpots instead of soil media to transform the multidimensional boundary value problem into a simple bar problem propagated by one dimensional waves in the vertical direction this model is simple and easy to use which promoted the theoretical study of the horizontal vibration response of pile foundations however most of the parameters are determined by empirical rather than theoretical derivation and cannot truly reflect the coupling vibration effect between the pile and soil novak et al 1974 proposed the plane strain model and obtained the expressions of the dynamic stiffness and damping of the pile top the plane strain model is better than the winker model but it cannot reflect the change in the internal stress gradient of soil therefore rajapakse and shah 1987 1989 developed the integral solution of the pile and soil taking the real interaction of the pile soil into account by considering the soil as the elastic half space and the pile as a virtual rod nogami et al 1977 obtained the horizontal vibration response solution of pile foundations by considering the soil stress gradient and treating the soil media as a three dimensional continuous medium zheng et al 2013 developed an analytical solution to investigate the horizontal dynamic responses of a large diameter pipe pile in a viscoelastic soil layer the influence of the vertical stress gradient change and the second order effect of the axial load were considered luan 2015 2016 revealed the lateral coupled vibration problem between the pile and soil in viscoelastic soil the dynamic analysis of offshore structures should consider water structure interactions because they may significantly affect the structural responses assuming that the foundation is rigid many scholars have conducted a series of studies on dynamic water structure interactions moreover the effect of the hydrodynamic pressure can be conveniently modelled as an added mass when surface wave and water compressibility are ignored williams 1986 han and xu 1996 wang et al 2020a b chwang and housner 1978 proposed an exact solution of hydrodynamic pressure for a rigid dam with an inclined face based on the two dimensional potential flow theory williams 1986 and tanaka 1988 utilized the boundary integral method and analytical method respectively in order to investigate the dynamic response of circular cylinders liu et al 2008 gave the general solution of the water velocity potential on circular hollow piers using the separation of variables which were modified and simplified by li and yang 2013 to some extent in addition du et al 2012 2014 proposed a time domain algorithm and time domain simplified formula for the seismic water pressure of cylindrical structures under compressible water conditions wei et al 2015 established a simplified method for the seismic design and analysis of axisymmetric structures with a uniform cross section wang et al 2018a proposed a substructure method for analyzing the seismic response of arbitrarily shaped structures and the results indicated that the accuracy is sufficient for engineering applications wang et al 2018b proposed an accurate time domain model to replace the problem of a water cylinder interaction in three dimensional infinite waters it was thus determined by the above that there are abundant studies on water pile interactions and soil pile interactions however for offshore structures numerous studies have shown that the hydrodynamic pressure and soil media under dynamic loads have a certain influence on the dynamic response of structures yamada et al 1988 spyrakos et al 1997 feng et al 2006 lou 2015 ni et al 2018 wang et al 2020a b liang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2021a b c currently most integral analysis methods and numerical methods can solve the water pile soil interactions problem conveniently and efficiently with a personal computer however for the study of some parameters the analytical method is sometimes more convenient than the numerical analysis method moreover to the best of the author s knowledge although analytical solutions for pile water interactions and pile soil interactions under vertical earthquakes and horizontal dynamic loads on pile top have been proposed williams 1986 wang et al 2019 novak 1974 luan et al 2015 2016 dai et al 2020 analytical solutions for water pile soil interactions have not yet been given in light of this this research aims to develop an analytical solution to investigate the horizontal seismic responses of piles under the action of water and soil impedance moreover parametric studies are performed to study the vibration characteristics of the pile the rest part of this paper is organized as follows the governing equations and boundary conditions of water body soil and pile are given in section 2 to obtain the total displacement of the pile an analytical solution is established by coupling the boundary conditions separation of variables and helmholtz decomposition in section 3 two degenerated interaction problems are firstly evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical solution in section 4 through the verification of the method it is applied to study the dynamic response of piles in soil and water and the influence of water on the displacement response of piles in frequency domain under different pile soil parameters is mainly studied in section 5 conclusion follow in section 6 2 modelling the water pile soil system 2 1 simplification and assumptions the assumptions adopted in this paper are as follows 1 the water is a horizontally infinite layer compressible irrotational inviscid and treaded as the calm before the action of the force 2 the pile is linear viscoelastic as well as vertical and end bearing its cross section is circular and it perfectly bonds with the soil water and rock base which means the displacement compatibility and contact forces equilibrium along the pile water and pile soil contact surface respectively liu et al 2008 2020 wang et al 2018a novak 1974 zheng et al 2013 luan et al 2015 2016 2016 dai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a 3 the soil layers are viscoelastic homogeneous isotropic overlying rigid bedrock and the material damping is of the frequency independent hysteresis type 4 the effects of water soil interactions under horizontal earthquakes are small and water soil interactions are not considered 5 vertical displacements associated with horizontal vibrations are negligibly small 6 the motion is harmonic the water pile soil system is shown in fig 1 and the nomenclature is shown in table 1 the pile is subjected to a time harmonic horizontal displacement u 0 e i ω t at the surface of the rock base where u 0 ω t and i 1 denote the displacement amplitude in the frequency domain the circle excitation frequency time and the imaginary unit respectively and the signs r z denote the cylindrical coordinate system the pile radius of the circular section is r 0 the thicknesses of the soil and water layers are h 1 and h 2 respectively the pile length exceeding the water level is h 3 and the sum of the three heights is h according to liaw and chopra 1974 and li and yang 2013 the free surface wave is of little consequence in the earthquake response of a cylinder surrounded by water therefore free surface waves are assumed to not be generated in this study 2 2 governing equation of the water according to the linear radiation wave theory the hydrodynamic pressure of the water in the cylindrical coordinate system can be expressed as p r θ z e i ω t here it should be noted that the inherent factor e i ω t will be omitted in the following analysis the governing equation of the water hydrodynamic pressure is expressed as 1 2 p r 2 1 r p r 1 r 2 2 p θ 2 2 p z 2 k w 2 p 0 where k w ω c w is the wavenumber and c w 1438 m s is the speed of sound in water when the water wave velocity c w tends to infinity k w tends to zero and the water is incompressible 2 3 governing equation of the soil in the soil medium the soil radial and circumferential displacements can be decomposed into free and scattered fields as u r r θ z e i ω t u r f z e i ω t u r s r θ z e i ω t and u θ r θ z e i ω t u θ f z e i ω t u θ s r θ z e i ω t respectively the horizontal dynamic equation of the free field soil displacement is expressed as 2 g s 2 u x f z 2 ρ s ω 2 u x f ρ s ω 2 u 0 the coupling dynamic equations of scattered field soil displacements are then expressed as 3 λ s 2 g s δ r 1 r g s e z θ ρ s ω 2 u r s g s 2 u

2 i β s g s is the soil shear modulus ν s and β s are the soil poisson s ratio and the soil hysteretic damping respectively and ρ s is the mass density of the soil 2 4 governing equation of the pile it is easy to establish the pile dynamic equation in the cylindrical coordinate system based on the dynamic equilibrium condition numerous studies williams 1986 mylonakis and gazetas 2002 liu et al 2013 luan et al 2016 have shown that euler beams can be used to study the dynamic response of piles in water and soil and that euler beams and solids have the same accuracy in most cases wang et al 2018b the internal forces on the left side of the governing equation of the pile and the inertial forces on the right side reach a dynamic balance in air under the action of horizontal earthquake hence the governing equation of the pile in air can be expressed by the horizontal displacement w p 3 z as 6a e p i p 4 w p 3 z 4 m p ω 2 w p 3 m p ω 2 u 0 similar to the pile in air the left side of the governing equation of the pile in water is affected by the resistance of the water to the pile f 2 in addition to the internal force hence the governing equation of the pile in water can be expressed by the horizontal displacement w p 2 z as 6b e p i p 4 w p 2 z 4 m p ω 2 w p 2 f 2 m p ω 2 u 0 similar to the pile in water the governing equation of the pile in soil can be expressed by the horizontal displacement w p 1 z as 6c e p i p 4 w p 1 z 4 m p ω 2 w p 1 f 1 m p ω 2 u 0 where e p e p 1 2 i β p β p e p i p and m p π ρ p r 0 2 are the hysteretic damping young s modulus cross sectional moment of inertia and the mass per unit length of the pile respectively and f 1 is the horizontal dynamic impedance of the soil to the pile 2 5 boundary conditions the boundary conditions

stiffness is defined as r 1 fig 5 shows that the ratio r 1 varies the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus at the first and second peak displacements in the absence of water fig 4 shows that the changes in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus have a great influence on the displacement at the pile head with static and dynamic stiffness in the absence of water when the earthquake frequency range is 3 10 hz moreover it can be seen from fig 5 that the ratio r 1 at the second peak displacement changes more with an increase in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus compared with the ratio r 1 at the first peak displacement 5 2 effect of the pile inertia force fig 6 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different soil thicknesses pile radii soil moduli and pile moduli both with and without inertial forces in the absence of water the ratio between the maximum displacement at the pile head with the inertia force and the maximum displacement at the pile head without the inertia force is defined as r 2 fig 7 shows that the ratio r 2 varies the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus at the first and second peak displacements in the absence of water fig 6 also shows that the changes in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus have a great influence on the absolute displacement at the pile head both with and without inertial forces in the absence of water when the earthquake frequency range is 3 10 hz moreover fig 7 indicates that the ratio r 2 changes greatly with an increase in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus at the second peak displacement but it changes little at the first peak displacement the main reasons for such difference in figs 4 7 soil dynamic stiffness and pile inertia force is that dynamic stiffness and static stiffness inertial force and non inertial force have little difference in the corresponding displacement peak at the first frequency that is the soil dynamic stiffness and pile inertial force have little influence at low frequency however the difference between the second and third order frequencies corresponding to the second and third displacement peaks namely higher frequencies is gradually increasing as also can be seen from fig 8 the difference between dynamic stiffness and static stiffness inertial forces and non inertial forces is gradually increasing with an increase in the frequency 5 3 effect of the water pile interaction for a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of pile soil parameters on the displacement at the pile head in the absence and presence of water the pile radius r 0 soil modulus e s pile modulus e p soil damping β s and pile damping β p are studied fig 9 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different water layer thicknesses fig 10 shows the maximum displacement at the pile head versus the soil thickness with different water layer thicknesses figs 9 and 10 show that the maximum displacement at the pile head changes to a certain extent with an increase in the water layer thickness when the soil thickness is constant moreover the maximum displacement at the pile head first increases and then decreases with an increase in the soil thicknesses fig 11 shows that the maximum displacement at the pile head varies the pile radius soil modulus pile modulus soil damping and pile damping in the absence and presence of water respectively it can be seen from fig 11 that the distance between the two curves decreases with an increase in the pile radius pile modulus soil damping and pile damping but the situation is opposite with an increase in the soil modulus that is the influence of water on the maximum displacement at the pile head decreases with an increase in the pile radius pile modulus soil damping and pile damping but the influence increases with an increase in the soil modulus 5 4 effect of water compressibility fig 12 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different soil moduli and soil thicknesses when considering and not considering the water compressibility the ratio between the maximum displacement at the pile head considering water compressibility and the maximum absolute displacement at the pile head without considering water compressibility is defined as r 3 fig 13 shows the ratio r 3 versus the soil modulus and soil thickness with different width to depth ratios of the pile in water 2r 0 h 2 at the first and second peak displacements as shown in figs 12 and 13 the water compressibility has a certain influence on the displacement at the pile head with the change in the soil modulus and soil thickness and it can be ignored to a certain extent 6 conclusions an analytical solution for the dynamic responses of an end bearing pile subjected to horizontal earthquakes considering the coupled vibration between the pile and both the water and soil was established a parametric study was conducted to investigate the vibration characteristics of the pile the conclusions drawn from the results can be categorized as follows 1 comparing the dynamic and static stiffness of soil the displacement at the pile head has little change with an increase in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus when the earthquake frequency range is 0 3 hz but the ratio changes significantly at higher frequencies 2 the pile inertia force has a certain influence on the maximum displacement at the pile head in the absence of water with the change in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus when the earthquake frequency range is 3 10 hz 3 the maximum displacement at the pile head increases with an increase in the water layer thicknesses moreover the influence of water shows an increasing trend with an increase in the water layer thicknesses and the trend first increases and then decreases with an increase in the soil thicknesses 4 the ratio of the maximum displacement at the pile head with water and without water shows a decreasing trend with an increase in the pile radius pile modulus soil damping and pile damping but the situation is the opposite with an increase in the soil modulus 5 the influence of water compressibility on the pile displacement is small with the change in the soil modulus and soil thickness and can be ignored to some extent it should be noted that the stratification of soil is indeed not considered in our subsequent work we will consider the stratification problem of soil and improve the analysis model of water pile soil interaction in which the soil is a two phase medium and take into account the influence of the

20242,an analytical solution is developed to investigate the seismic responses of end bearing piles considering water pile soil interactions the pile is assumed to have a linear viscoelastic and circular cross section the soil and water are modelled as linear viscoelastic media and linear acoustic media respectively the seismic responses of the free field soil displacement under horizontal earthquakes are first given neglecting water soil interactions analytical expressions for the impedance of the soil and water media are further derived the pile displacements induced by horizontal earthquakes are then obtained based on the continuity conditions of the pile with soil and water the present solution is compared with the substructure method to verify the rationality of the present analytical solution parametric analyses are finally conducted to investigate the effects of the water soil and pile parameters on the seismic responses of the pile the results indicate that it is necessary to consider the water pile soil interaction in the design of piles installed in offshore areas keywords analytical solution dynamic response pile soil interaction pile water interaction horizontal earthquakes viscoelastic soil 1 introduction pile foundations play an important role in supporting offshore structures which are often subjected to horizontal dynamic loads such as wave loads wind loads and seismic loads hence analysing the dynamic characteristics of piles under horizontal earthquakes is of great significance for the design of offshore foundations wang et al 2010 mannaa and baidyab 2010 yang and pan 2010 since the vibration of the pile is directly affected by the surrounding soil the dynamic interaction between the pile and soil has always been a prominent research area gao et al 2017 dai et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in addition the coupling action between water piles and soil is also considered in offshore structures which is different from those on lands such as high pile wharfs offshore wind turbines and oil platforms therefore in consideration of the safety of offshore structures it is necessary to study the dynamic response of offshore structures considering water pile soil interaction under horizontal earthquakes in recent years the problem of coupled pile soil vibration under horizontal dynamic loads has been widely studied by scholars in the early stage many scholars regarded pile foundations as the beam model of the winkler foundation gazetas et al 1984 dezi et al 2009 desanctis et al 2010 laora et al 2012 anoyatis et al 2013 2017 the winkler model uses springs and dashpots instead of soil media to transform the multidimensional boundary value problem into a simple bar problem propagated by one dimensional waves in the vertical direction this model is simple and easy to use which promoted the theoretical study of the horizontal vibration response of pile foundations however most of the parameters are determined by empirical rather than theoretical derivation and cannot truly reflect the coupling vibration effect between the pile and soil novak et al 1974 proposed the plane strain model and obtained the expressions of the dynamic stiffness and damping of the pile top the plane strain model is better than the winker model but it cannot reflect the change in the internal stress gradient of soil therefore rajapakse and shah 1987 1989 developed the integral solution of the pile and soil taking the real interaction of the pile soil into account by considering the soil as the elastic half space and the pile as a virtual rod nogami et al 1977 obtained the horizontal vibration response solution of pile foundations by considering the soil stress gradient and treating the soil media as a three dimensional continuous medium zheng et al 2013 developed an analytical solution to investigate the horizontal dynamic responses of a large diameter pipe pile in a viscoelastic soil layer the influence of the vertical stress gradient change and the second order effect of the axial load were considered luan 2015 2016 revealed the lateral coupled vibration problem between the pile and soil in viscoelastic soil the dynamic analysis of offshore structures should consider water structure interactions because they may significantly affect the structural responses assuming that the foundation is rigid many scholars have conducted a series of studies on dynamic water structure interactions moreover the effect of the hydrodynamic pressure can be conveniently modelled as an added mass when surface wave and water compressibility are ignored williams 1986 han and xu 1996 wang et al 2020a b chwang and housner 1978 proposed an exact solution of hydrodynamic pressure for a rigid dam with an inclined face based on the two dimensional potential flow theory williams 1986 and tanaka 1988 utilized the boundary integral method and analytical method respectively in order to investigate the dynamic response of circular cylinders liu et al 2008 gave the general solution of the water velocity potential on circular hollow piers using the separation of variables which were modified and simplified by li and yang 2013 to some extent in addition du et al 2012 2014 proposed a time domain algorithm and time domain simplified formula for the seismic water pressure of cylindrical structures under compressible water conditions wei et al 2015 established a simplified method for the seismic design and analysis of axisymmetric structures with a uniform cross section wang et al 2018a proposed a substructure method for analyzing the seismic response of arbitrarily shaped structures and the results indicated that the accuracy is sufficient for engineering applications wang et al 2018b proposed an accurate time domain model to replace the problem of a water cylinder interaction in three dimensional infinite waters it was thus determined by the above that there are abundant studies on water pile interactions and soil pile interactions however for offshore structures numerous studies have shown that the hydrodynamic pressure and soil media under dynamic loads have a certain influence on the dynamic response of structures yamada et al 1988 spyrakos et al 1997 feng et al 2006 lou 2015 ni et al 2018 wang et al 2020a b liang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2021a b c currently most integral analysis methods and numerical methods can solve the water pile soil interactions problem conveniently and efficiently with a personal computer however for the study of some parameters the analytical method is sometimes more convenient than the numerical analysis method moreover to the best of the author s knowledge although analytical solutions for pile water interactions and pile soil interactions under vertical earthquakes and horizontal dynamic loads on pile top have been proposed williams 1986 wang et al 2019 novak 1974 luan et al 2015 2016 dai et al 2020 analytical solutions for water pile soil interactions have not yet been given in light of this this research aims to develop an analytical solution to investigate the horizontal seismic responses of piles under the action of water and soil impedance moreover parametric studies are performed to study the vibration characteristics of the pile the rest part of this paper is organized as follows the governing equations and boundary conditions of water body soil and pile are given in section 2 to obtain the total displacement of the pile an analytical solution is established by coupling the boundary conditions separation of variables and helmholtz decomposition in section 3 two degenerated interaction problems are firstly evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical solution in section 4 through the verification of the method it is applied to study the dynamic response of piles in soil and water and the influence of water on the displacement response of piles in frequency domain under different pile soil parameters is mainly studied in section 5 conclusion follow in section 6 2 modelling the water pile soil system 2 1 simplification and assumptions the assumptions adopted in this paper are as follows 1 the water is a horizontally infinite layer compressible irrotational inviscid and treaded as the calm before the action of the force 2 the pile is linear viscoelastic as well as vertical and end bearing its cross section is circular and it perfectly bonds with the soil water and rock base which means the displacement compatibility and contact forces equilibrium along the pile water and pile soil contact surface respectively liu et al 2008 2020 wang et al 2018a novak 1974 zheng et al 2013 luan et al 2015 2016 2016 dai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a 3 the soil layers are viscoelastic homogeneous isotropic overlying rigid bedrock and the material damping is of the frequency independent hysteresis type 4 the effects of water soil interactions under horizontal earthquakes are small and water soil interactions are not considered 5 vertical displacements associated with horizontal vibrations are negligibly small 6 the motion is harmonic the water pile soil system is shown in fig 1 and the nomenclature is shown in table 1 the pile is subjected to a time harmonic horizontal displacement u 0 e i ω t at the surface of the rock base where u 0 ω t and i 1 denote the displacement amplitude in the frequency domain the circle excitation frequency time and the imaginary unit respectively and the signs r z denote the cylindrical coordinate system the pile radius of the circular section is r 0 the thicknesses of the soil and water layers are h 1 and h 2 respectively the pile length exceeding the water level is h 3 and the sum of the three heights is h according to liaw and chopra 1974 and li and yang 2013 the free surface wave is of little consequence in the earthquake response of a cylinder surrounded by water therefore free surface waves are assumed to not be generated in this study 2 2 governing equation of the water according to the linear radiation wave theory the hydrodynamic pressure of the water in the cylindrical coordinate system can be expressed as p r θ z e i ω t here it should be noted that the inherent factor e i ω t will be omitted in the following analysis the governing equation of the water hydrodynamic pressure is expressed as 1 2 p r 2 1 r p r 1 r 2 2 p θ 2 2 p z 2 k w 2 p 0 where k w ω c w is the wavenumber and c w 1438 m s is the speed of sound in water when the water wave velocity c w tends to infinity k w tends to zero and the water is incompressible 2 3 governing equation of the soil in the soil medium the soil radial and circumferential displacements can be decomposed into free and scattered fields as u r r θ z e i ω t u r f z e i ω t u r s r θ z e i ω t and u θ r θ z e i ω t u θ f z e i ω t u θ s r θ z e i ω t respectively the horizontal dynamic equation of the free field soil displacement is expressed as 2 g s 2 u x f z 2 ρ s ω 2 u x f ρ s ω 2 u 0 the coupling dynamic equations of scattered field soil displacements are then expressed as 3 λ s 2 g s δ r 1 r g s e z θ ρ s ω 2 u r s g s 2 u r s z 2 4 λ s 2 g s δ r θ g s e z r ρ s ω 2 u θ s g s 2 u θ s z 2 5 δ 1 r r r u r s 1 r u θ s θ e z 1 r r r u θ s u r s θ where λ s 2 g s ν s 1 2 ν s is the complex lamé constant of the soil g s g s 1 2 i β s g s is the soil shear modulus ν s and β s are the soil poisson s ratio and the soil hysteretic damping respectively and ρ s is the mass density of the soil 2 4 governing equation of the pile it is easy to establish the pile dynamic equation in the cylindrical coordinate system based on the dynamic equilibrium condition numerous studies williams 1986 mylonakis and gazetas 2002 liu et al 2013 luan et al 2016 have shown that euler beams can be used to study the dynamic response of piles in water and soil and that euler beams and solids have the same accuracy in most cases wang et al 2018b the internal forces on the left side of the governing equation of the pile and the inertial forces on the right side reach a dynamic balance in air under the action of horizontal earthquake hence the governing equation of the pile in air can be expressed by the horizontal displacement w p 3 z as 6a e p i p 4 w p 3 z 4 m p ω 2 w p 3 m p ω 2 u 0 similar to the pile in air the left side of the governing equation of the pile in water is affected by the resistance of the water to the pile f 2 in addition to the internal force hence the governing equation of the pile in water can be expressed by the horizontal displacement w p 2 z as 6b e p i p 4 w p 2 z 4 m p ω 2 w p 2 f 2 m p ω 2 u 0 similar to the pile in water the governing equation of the pile in soil can be expressed by the horizontal displacement w p 1 z as 6c e p i p 4 w p 1 z 4 m p ω 2 w p 1 f 1 m p ω 2 u 0 where e p e p 1 2 i β p β p e p i p and m p π ρ p r 0 2 are the hysteretic damping young s modulus cross sectional moment of inertia and the mass per unit length of the pile respectively and f 1 is the horizontal dynamic impedance of the soil to the pile 2 5 boundary conditions the boundary conditions

free field motion the interaction between soil and water is not considered under horizontal earthquakes so the general solution of equation 2 is 32 u x f z e 1 cos k z e 2 sin k z u 0 where e 1 and e 2 are undetermined coefficients k ω v s and v s g s ρ s substituting equation 32 into equations 12 and 15 the governing equation of free field soil displacement can be expressed as 33 u x f z u 0 cos k z u 0 tan k h 1 sin k z u 0 therefore further utilization of u r f r θ z u x f z cos θ and u θ f r θ z u x f z sin θ can obtain the free field soil radial and circumferential displacements 3 2 impedance of soil to pile according to helmholtz decomposition the vector displacement can be decomposed into two scalar potentials ϕ r θ z and ψ r θ z and the radial and circumferential scattered field soil displacements can be further expressed as 34 u r s r θ z ϕ r θ z r 1 r ψ r θ z θ 35 u θ s r θ z 1 r ϕ r θ z θ ψ r θ z r it is easily obtained that 36 δ 2 ϕ e z 2 ψ where 2 2 r 2 1 r r 1 r 2

separation of variables and given ϕ r θ z r r θ θ z z equation 37 can be split into the following three equations 39 1 r d 2 r d r 2 1 r 1 r d r d r 1 r 2 m 2 q 2 40 1 z d 2 z d z 2 g 2 41 1 θ d 2 θ d θ 2 m 2 where q 2 g s g 2 ρ s ω 2 λ s 2 g s the solutions for 39 41 can be easily obtained as 42 r a 1 k m q r b 1 i m q r z a 2 sin g z b 2 cos g z θ a 3 sin m θ b 3 cos m θ where a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 and b 3 are undetermined coefficients and i m and k m are modified bessel functions of the first and second kind of order m respectively then the potential function ϕ r θ z is expressed as 43 ϕ r θ z a 1 k m q r b 1 i m q r a 2 sin g z b 2 cos g z a 3 sin m θ b 3 cos m θ similarly the potential function ψ r θ z is expressed as 44 ψ r θ z a 4 k m s r b 4 i m s r a 5 sin g z b 5 cos g z a 6 sin m θ b 6 cos m θ where s 2 g s g 2 ρ s ω 2 g s and a 4 b 4 a 5 b 5 a 6 and b 6 are undetermined coefficients the soil displacement is equal to zero when r equations 30 and 31 hence b 1 b 4 0 equations 26 and 27 show that u r is an even function of θ and u θ is an odd function of θ thus a 3 b 6 0 and m 1 substituting equations 43 and 44 into equations 34 and 35 and utilizing boundary conditions 11 13 and 14 one obtains 45 b 2 b 5 0 g i 2 i 1 π 2 h 1 i 1 2 3 then the potential functions ϕ r θ z and ψ r θ z are written as 46 ϕ cos θ i 1 a i k 1 q i r sin g i z 47 ψ sin θ i 1 b i k 1 s i r sin g i z thereafter the scattered field soil displacements are as follows 48 u r s r θ z cos θ i 1 sin g i z a i 1 r k 1 q i r q i k 0 q i r b i 1 r k 1 s i r 49 u θ s r θ z sin θ i 1 sin g i z a i 1 r k 1 q i

4 method verification to evaluate the effects of the soil pile and water pile interaction on the displacement at the pile head the pile soil and water parameter values are listed in table 2 unless otherwise specified the hydrodynamic pressure of water and the displacement form of soil in the present method are an infinite series hence it is necessary to transform infinite series i and j into finite series fig 2 a and c show that the results will converge by truncating the infinite series into only 7 10 terms in the absence of water similarly fig 2 b and d show that the results will converge by truncating the infinite series into only 6 10 terms under certain conditions of the soil series in the presence of water therefore unless otherwise specified i and j are equal to 8 and 7 respectively to verify the rationality of the present method the obtained solution is verified via comparison with the substructure method wang et al 2018b 2021 the results are shown in fig 3 which indicates two methods for the real and imaginary parts of displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with the conditions of being in the absence of water and in the presence of water it is obvious that the present analytical solution agrees well with the substructure method 5 results and discussion 5 1 effect of the soil dynamic stiffness fig 4 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different soil thicknesses pile radii soil moduli and pile moduli with static and dynamic stiffness in the absence of water moreover 1 and 2 in figs 4 6 and 12 represent the first and second peak displacements respectively the ratio between the maximum displacement at the pile head with dynamic stiffness and the maximum displacement at the pile head with static stiffness is defined as r 1 fig 5 shows that the ratio r 1 varies the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus at the first and second peak displacements in the absence of water fig 4 shows that the changes in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus have a great influence on the displacement at the pile head with static and dynamic stiffness in the absence of water when the earthquake frequency range is 3 10 hz moreover it can be seen from fig 5 that the ratio r 1 at the second peak displacement changes more with an increase in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus compared with the ratio r 1 at the first peak displacement 5 2 effect of the pile inertia force fig 6 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different soil thicknesses pile radii soil moduli and pile moduli both with and without inertial forces in the absence of water the ratio between the maximum displacement at the pile head with the inertia force and the maximum displacement at the pile head without the inertia force is defined as r 2 fig 7 shows that the ratio r 2 varies the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus at the first and second peak displacements in the absence of water fig 6 also shows that the changes in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus have a great influence on the absolute displacement at the pile head both with and without inertial forces in the absence of water when the earthquake frequency range is 3 10 hz moreover fig 7 indicates that the ratio r 2 changes greatly with an increase in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus at the second peak displacement but it changes little at the first peak displacement the main reasons for such difference in figs 4 7 soil dynamic stiffness and pile inertia force is that dynamic stiffness and static stiffness inertial force and non inertial force have little difference in the corresponding displacement peak at the first frequency that is the soil dynamic stiffness and pile inertial force have little influence at low frequency however the difference between the second and third order frequencies corresponding to the second and third displacement peaks namely higher frequencies is gradually increasing as also can be seen from fig 8 the difference between dynamic stiffness and static stiffness inertial forces and non inertial forces is gradually increasing with an increase in the frequency 5 3 effect of the water pile interaction for a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of pile soil parameters on the displacement at the pile head in the absence and presence of water the pile radius r 0 soil modulus e s pile modulus e p soil damping β s and pile damping β p are studied fig 9 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different water layer thicknesses fig 10 shows the maximum displacement at the pile head versus the soil thickness with different water layer thicknesses figs 9 and 10 show that the maximum displacement at the pile head changes to a certain extent with an increase in the water layer thickness when the soil thickness is constant moreover the maximum displacement at the pile head first increases and then decreases with an increase in the soil thicknesses fig 11 shows that the maximum displacement at the pile head varies the pile radius soil modulus pile modulus soil damping and pile damping in the absence and presence of water respectively it can be seen from fig 11 that the distance between the two curves decreases with an increase in the pile radius pile modulus soil damping and pile damping but the situation is opposite with an increase in the soil modulus that is the influence of water on the maximum displacement at the pile head decreases with an increase in the pile radius pile modulus soil damping and pile damping but the influence increases with an increase in the soil modulus 5 4 effect of water compressibility fig 12 shows the displacement at the pile head versus the frequency f with different soil moduli and soil thicknesses when considering and not considering the water compressibility the ratio between the maximum displacement at the pile head considering water compressibility and the maximum absolute displacement at the pile head without considering water compressibility is defined as r 3 fig 13 shows the ratio r 3 versus the soil modulus and soil thickness with different width to depth ratios of the pile in water 2r 0 h 2 at the first and second peak displacements as shown in figs 12 and 13 the water compressibility has a certain influence on the displacement at the pile head with the change in the soil modulus and soil thickness and it can be ignored to a certain extent 6 conclusions an analytical solution for the dynamic responses of an end bearing pile subjected to horizontal earthquakes considering the coupled vibration between the pile and both the water and soil was established a parametric study was conducted to investigate the vibration characteristics of the pile the conclusions drawn from the results can be categorized as follows 1 comparing the dynamic and static stiffness of soil the displacement at the pile head has little change with an increase in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus when the earthquake frequency range is 0 3 hz but the ratio changes significantly at higher frequencies 2 the pile inertia force has a certain influence on the maximum displacement at the pile head in the absence of water with the change in the soil thickness pile radius soil modulus and pile modulus when the earthquake frequency range is 3 10 hz 3 the maximum displacement at the pile head increases with an increase in the water layer thicknesses moreover the influence of water shows an increasing trend with an increase in the water layer thicknesses and the trend first increases and then decreases with an increase in the soil thicknesses 4 the ratio of the maximum displacement at the pile head with water and without water shows a decreasing trend with an increase in the pile radius pile modulus soil damping and pile damping but the situation is the opposite with an increase in the soil modulus 5 the influence of water compressibility on the pile displacement is small with the change in the soil modulus and soil thickness and can be ignored to some extent it should be noted that the stratification of soil is indeed not considered in our subsequent work we will consider the stratification problem of soil and improve the analysis model of water pile soil interaction in which the soil is a two phase medium and take into account the influence of the

20243,as an important construction material in marine structure engineering concrete is subject to the dual erosion effects of sulfate and freeze thaw cycles in a high latitude marine environment which is easy to induce damage and affect the normal service life of the structure in this paper the behavior of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites under the coupled attack of sulfate and freeze thaw in a marine environment were macroscopically and microscopically investigated nine mixtures modified with different content of fly ash and bentonite were adopted in this investigation and samples were exposed to na2so4 aq water and mgso4 aq for 150 freeze thaw cycles in this study the durability of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites was investigated by weight relative dynamic elastic modulus and compressive strength moreover the acoustic emission method was used to monitor the damage process during uniaxial compression in real time meanwhile the microscopic characterization method was used to identify the microscopic morphology and composition of the aged samples to explore the degradation mechanism of the macroscopic performance results show that the durability performance of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites declined with the increase of the fly ash and bentonite addition in na2so4 aq however polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites had the highest durability performance when the ratio of fly ash to cement was 1 8 in water the acoustic emission characteristics were closely related to the damage development and stress strain curve and the acoustic emission signal can be divided into the initial stage stable expansion stage and unstable expansion stage with the increase of fly ash and bentonite addition the intensity and density of the acoustic emission signal were reduced and the signal distribution was relatively uniform this research provided a theoretical foundation for the application and popularization of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites in marine concrete structures which suffer from sulfate erosion and freeze thaw cycles keywords marine structure sulfate compressive strength 1 introduction with the rapid development of the marine economy and the acceleration use of marine space marine concrete structures such as port terminals cross sea bridges sea airports and subsea tunnels have become more and more widely used nie et al 2020 yao and li 2019 yu et al 2020 at the same time the marine environment is special and complex with both changeable meteorological conditions and heavy sea conditions which seriously endanger the safety and durability of marine concrete structures therefore the durability of marine concrete structures has been paid attention by many researchers in recent years alawi al sodani et al 2021 real and bogas 2018 yu et al 2018 it is reported that a large number of marine areas exist in high latitude and cold areas in northern europe and north america which make marine concrete structures suffer from sulfate erosion and freeze thaw f t cycles simultaneously therefore research on the durability of concrete under the combined effects of sulfate erosion and f t cycles is of great significance for improving the safety and durability of marine concrete structures and for the development and utilization of marine resources gao et al 2019 in order to improve the service life of concrete under the combined attack of sulfate and f t cycles some scholars proposed to use geopolymer to improve the durability of concrete mardani aghabaglou et al 2019 cement composition determines the resistance of concrete to sulfate and f t cycle calcium aluminate 3cao al2o3 c3a in cement is the main raw material for ettringite formation and the ca oh 2 generated in the hydration process of calcium silicate 3cao sio2 c3s in cement can directly participate in the sulfate corrosion reaction therefore the content of c3a and c3s in cement has an important influence on the resistance of sulfate attack the use of geopolymers can replace part of the cement reduce the c3a content and thus reduce the materials for the sulfate attack reaction the geopolymers such as fly ash and silica fume can also undergo secondary hydration with ca oh 2 in concrete which reduces the content of ca oh 2 and produces a relatively stable csh with a low ca si ratio at the same time the fineness and particle size of geopolymer are smaller than those of cement which can increase the compactness of concrete and reduce the porosity of concrete thus enhancing the ability of concrete to resist corrosion by f t cycles many scholars have done a lot of research on the use of geopolymers to improve the resistance of concrete to sulfate and f t cycles the research results of dulaijian al dulaijan et al 2003 showed that the addition of 20 fly ash fa improved the sulfate resistance of ordinary concrete and the sulfate resistance effect of fa was better than that of sulfate resistant cement toutanji toutanji et al 2004 reported the influence of fa granulated blast furnace slag ggbs and silica fume sf on the frost resistance of ordinary concrete the results showed that the frost resistance of ggbs sf and ggbs fa concrete was better than that of concrete mixed with fa alone türkmen 2003 studied the effects of three solutions of 5 nacl 5 na2so4 5 mgso4 on the strength of ordinary concrete sf and ggbs concrete the results showed that the strength of concrete in the three corrosive solutions continued to decrease but the strength of concrete mixed with sf and ggbs was higher than that of the ordinary concrete and the damage degree of the corrosive solution was in order mgso4 nacl na2so4 mangat mangat and khatib compared the sulfate corrosion resistance of ordinary concrete and concrete with 40 and 80 slag content and the results showed that concrete with 40 slag content was the first to destroy while concrete with 80 slag content had the best corrosion resistance geopolymer concrete can improve the durability of concrete under sulfate attack and f t cycles to a certain extent however like ordinary concrete geopolymer concrete can also generate macroscopic cracks in weak areas under internal temperature stress caused by f t cycles which not only provide channels for sulfate intrusion but also reduces the strength and durability of concrete structure therefore to solve the problem of long term durability of concrete structures it is necessary not only to improve the impermeability of materials in the non cracking state but also to control the crack width of structures after cracking in complex environments some researchers have proposed to add different kinds of fibers into concrete such as polypropylene pp fiber karahan and atis 2011 steel fiber alsaif et al 2019 glass fiber abedi et al 2020 polyethylene pe fiber zhu et al 2017 and polyvinyl alcohol pva fiber wang et al 2018 etc the use of fiber can improve the toughness of materials effectively reduce the crack width of concrete under the action of environment and load thereby improving the durability of the concrete under sulfate attack and f t cycles many scholars have done a lot of research on the use of fibers to improve the resistance of concrete to sulfate and f t cycles şahmaran şahmaran et al 2012 discussed the influence of the pva fibers and fa on the anti frost performance of concrete during 300 cycles and results showed that all concrete mixtures with a high content of fa remained good endurance moreover the addition of pva fiber notably improved the frost resistance ren ren and lai 2021 studied the failure mechanism of pp fiber concrete under f t cycles and sulfate erosion compressive strength quality change and porosity change were used to characterize the durability of concrete the results showed that due to the good bridging effect of polypropylene fiber the durability of concrete can be increased by 67 nam nam et al 2016 added pva fiber and pp fiber to cement based composite materials and discussed the influence of fiber length and tensile strength on the durability of frost resistance the mercury intrusion method and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the porosity characteristics the test results showed that the compressive strength of pva fiber reinforced concrete was higher than that of pp fiber reinforced concrete after 300 f t cycles wang wang et al 2021 studied the effects of pva fiber pp fiber and polyacrylonitrile pan fiber with different lengths on the frost resistance of concrete the test results showed that adding fiber can enhance frost resistance and the degree of frost resistance improvement was pva pan pp although many scholars have done a lot of research on the durability of concrete under the attack of sulfate and f t cycles the research on improving the combined attack of sulfate and frost resistance of concrete by using bentonite and fa modified polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites pfrgc is still very limited bentonite has excellent physical properties such as small particle size large surface area and high cation exchange rate at the same time bentonite has high reactivity to calcium hydroxide released by cement hydration reaction which can produce pozzolanic bond and this pozzolanic bond can improve the microstructure of concrete when dispersed in the cement slurry it produces a large number of nucleation sites to precipitate hydration products this mechanism is conducive to the densification and homogenization of cement thus reducing the internal pore diameter and generating pozzolanic activity rashad 2018 sha et al 2018 xu et al 2018 fa has the morphological effect micro aggregate effect and pozzolanic effect of spherical particles in addition to improving the workability of the concrete mixture reducing the heat of hydration of the concrete and improving the crack resistance fa also has the advantages of refining pores improving interface structure inhibiting alkali aggregate reaction and improving the ability to resist seawater erosion alnahhal et al 2018 rahla et al 2019 zhuang et al 2016 at the same time pva fiber has high elastic modulus which can improve the toughness of the substrate and has good acid and alkali resistance and hydrophilicity which is convenient for stirring and dispersion and has good bonding force with the substrate si et al 2020 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however adding fibers to concrete may also adversely affect its workability and homogeneity huang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 pva fibers have a high aspect ratio which increases the surface area to concrete volume ratio resulting in less excess water layer at a given free water content when a large amount of fiber is modified the wet packing density of concrete decreases which adversely affects the workability of fiber composite materials therefore the content of fiber usually is not greater than 1 of the concrete volume in the case of less fiber content the wet packing density of concrete is higher thus the workability and homogeneity of concrete are better at the same time the high wet packing density also leads to a significant reduction in the porosity of concrete which has greatly improved its strength and durability compared with traditional concrete de larrard and sedran 1994 richard and cheyrezy 1995 the main purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of pfrgc under the coupled attack of sulfate and f t in a marine environment nine pfrgc mixtures modified with different content of fa and bentonite were adopted in this investigation and pfrgc samples were exposed to na2so4 aq water and mgso4 aq for 150 f t cycles in this study the durability of pfrgc was investigated by weight relative dynamic elastic modulus rdem and compressive strength moreover the acoustic emission ae method was used to monitor the damage process of pfrgc during uniaxial compression in real time meanwhile the microscopic characterization method was used to identify the microscopic morphology and composition of the aged samples to explore the degradation mechanism of the macroscopic performance of pfrgc this research provided a theoretical foundation for the application and popularization of pfrgc in marine concrete structures which suffer from sulfate erosion and f t cycles 2 experimental programs 2 1 raw materials the information about the raw materials adopted in the pfrgc specimen is provided in table 1 this information contains the size types chemical compositions and physical properties 2 2 pfrgc mixtures the components of the pfrgc sample series were fa cement bentonite water silica sand high range water reducer hrwr and pva fibers there are nine mix proportions in which the fa content is 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 times by weight the cement content and the content of bentonite is 0 3 and 6 by weight of the cementitious material the proportions of mixtures are shown in table 2 2 3 sample preparation the production of pfrgc samples comprised of four stages mixing stage casting stage compacting stage and curing stage and the production and analysis stages of pfrgc are presented in fig 1 in this research the durability properties including the weight rdem compressive strength ae characteristics scanning electron microscope sem and x ray diffractometer xrd were taken as durability indexes to evaluate the durability of pfrgc under combined damage of sulfate and f t and sizes of the corresponding samples were 100 100 300 mm 100 100 300 mm 100 100 100 mm 100 100 300 mm in each test the average result of three specimens was taken as the final test result 2 4 experimental methods 2 4 1 f t cycles the f t cycles of pfrgc samples were performed in line with gb t 50082 2009 which is close to astm c666 c666m zhao et al 2020 one experimental period contains 25 cycles the following steps were listed during one cycle after 24 days of curing pfrgc samples were taken out from plastic bags and then the initial rdem weight and compressive strength were tested all samples were immersed for 96 h in water after that samples were carried into the rubber buckets of freezing and thawing equipment in one cycle the highest temperature was 5 2 c and the lowest temperature was 18 2 c and a f t cycle took 4 h from start to end after each freezing and thawing period the rdem weight and compressive strength were tested 2 4 2 ae ae refers to the phenomenon of concentrated and rapid release of energy in the form of elastic waves after accumulation within the material cao et al 2019 gu et al 2019 guan et al 2019 generally when concrete is subjected to external loads stress concentration occurs inside the concrete causing uneven stress distribution inside as the load continues to increase the stress concentration phenomenon becomes even more obvious when a certain threshold is reached the unstable high energy state inside the concrete transform to a stable low energy state causing micro cracks to occur and expand and the material release plastic strain energy outward in the form of stress waves ae mainly uses high sensitivity ae piezoelectric sensors to detect and collect the stress waves and to monitor crack growth inside in real time by processing the collected signals the internal damage inside concrete can be analyzed paul et al 2015 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the saeu2s digital ae system produced by jingshenghua xingye company was used in this test the sensor model was sr150n and the sensitivity peak value was greater than 75 db it can be used to collect 22 khz 220khz signals the preamplifier model was pa i broadband type after measuring the noise level of the on site environment and loading equipment the sampling frequency was set to 3 mhz the preamplifier gain was set to 40 db and the threshold was set to 40 db 2 4 3 sem in this experiment a scanning electron microscope sem s4800 hitachi was used to observe the microstructure of the pfrgc small pieces of pfrgc 5 10 mm in diameter and 1 2 mm in thickness were taken 2 4 mm under the surface of pfrgc and soaked in ethanol to stop hydration before scanning the samples were dried at 70 c for 4 h then platinum coating was implemented to enhance electrical conductivity the accelerating voltage was set at 3000 v and the distance is 8400 μm and the emission current was 8400 na 2 4 4 xrd the d8 advance x ray diffractometer produced by the german bruke company was used the light tube type was ceramic x ray tube cu target light tube power was 2 2w maximum tube pressure was 60 kv maximum tube current was 80 ma and goniometer adopted stepping motor drive and optical encoder technology in the sample preparation process the sample was broken firstly and then the sample was cleaned with absolute ethanol after the cleaning the sample was dried in an oven and then the sample was continuously ground with a mortar until the powder particle diameter was less than 10 μm finally the sample was bottled and sealed to prevent the sample from reacting with carbon dioxide and water in the air 3 results 3 1 mass change the effect of fa addition on the mass change of pfrgc samples in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 2 a and table 3 the serial numbers a b and c represent the content of fa is 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 times the content of cement the number 0 3 6 represents that the bentonite content is 0 3 and 6 of cementitious material the serial numbers s m and w respectively represent the corrosion environment as 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water as shown in fig 2 a under the dual influence of na2so4 aq attack and f t damage the weight of pfrgc with distinct fa addition displayed a continuously increasing tendency and the a3 s specimen reached the largest mass increase rate after 150 f t cycles in 10 na2so4 aq during the first 50 f t cycles the weight of pfrgc increased rapidly and during the next 100 f t cycles the weight increase rate tended to be flat and after 150 f t cycles in 10 na2so4 aq the weight increase rates of a3 s b3 s and c3 s were 1 71 0 85 and 3 55 respectively the reason for the increase in the mass of pfrgc samples is that the number of micro cracks in the pfrgc material increases with the extension of the f t cycle so the sulfate in the solution continues to penetrate the pfrgc and undergo physical crystallization and chemical reactions resulting expansive products to fill the pores inside the pfrgc so the mass of the pfrgc continues to rise the effect of bentonite addition on the mass change of pfrgc in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 2 b and table 3 it could be seen that during the first 50 f t cycles samples maintained a high mass growth rate while after the 50 f t cycles the weight of the samples exhibited a fluctuating condition with the increase of bentonite addition the growth rate of the mass also increased for example after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the weight growth rates of a0 s a3 s and a6 s were 0 68 1 71 and 2 46 respectively the effect of 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water on the change of pfrgc mass during 150 f t cycles is shown in fig 2 c and table 3 it could be found that in na2so4 aq and water as the number of f t cycles increased the weight of the pfrgc showed a trend of increasing while in mgso4 aq the weight of the samples increased first and then decreased with the progress of f t damage after 150 f t cycles the weight growth rates of the samples in different types of environments were 1 71 0 51 and 2 25 respectively indicating that water has the least corrosion to the pfrgc and the mgso4 aq has the greatest corrosion the reason lies in that the pfrgc samples were subjected to the double erosion of sulfate ions and magnesium ions in the mgso4 aq which not only generated swelling products during the corrosion progress causing the frost heave damage of the pfrgc but also decalcified the calcium silicate hydrate gel and this dual erosion effect increased with the rise of the progress of f t damage therefore the erosion effect of mgso4 aq on pfrgc was more serious than that of na2so4 aq and water 3 2 rdem the effect of fa addition on the rdem of pfrgc in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 3 a and table 4 it could be seen that the rdem showed a declining trend with the extension of f t damage after 150 f t cycles the lowest rdem was 20 8 c3 s when the bentonite addition was 3 the rdem reduced continuously with the rise of the fa addition in the specimen for example as the ratio of fa to cement raised from 1 2 to 2 4 the rdem of pfrgc decreased from 40 3 to 20 8 after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the effect of bentonite addition on the rdem of pfrgc in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 3 b and table 4 it could be found that the rdem of pfrgc reduced with the addition of bentonite raised in the situation of fa c 1 2 the rdem from large to small were a0 s 42 9 a3 s 40 3 and a6 s 24 9 after 150 f t cycles the effects of 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water on the rdem of pfrgc are shown in fig 3 c and table 4 it can be seen that in sodium sulfate and water as the cycles of f t raised the rdem decreased while in mgso4 aq the rdem of pfrgc rose slightly during the first 50 f t cycles while the rdem drop rapidly during the remaining f t cycles 3 3 compressive strength under the dual attack of na2so4 aq and f t damage the effect of fa addition on the compressive strength of pfrgc is shown in fig 4 a and table 5 it can be seen that when the ratio of fa to cement was 1 2 and 1 8 the compressive strength of the pfrgc samples during 150 f t cycles was similar while when the ratio of fa to cement reached 2 4 the compressive strength of pfrgc samples dropped significantly for example after 150 f t cycles the compressive strength of a3 s and b3 s were 30 44 mpa and 26 92 mpa respectively while the compressive strength of c3 s was 18 05 mpa the result shows that the increase in fa addition reduced the compressive strength on the one hand although the addition of fa can reduce the pore volume in pfrgc thereby reducing the pore solution used for f t damage on the other hand the higher fa can cause relatively lower early compressive strength therefore f t cycle causes serious damage to the surface of the specimen with a higher fa addition resulting a large amount of sulfate solution penetrate the internal pores of the pfrgc thus increasing the impact of the f t cycle on the pfrgc yuan et al 2020 under the dual attack of na2so4 aq and f t damage the effect of bentonite addition on the compressive strength of pfrgc is shown in fig 4 b and table 5 it can be seen that when the fa c ratio was 1 2 and the addition of bentonite was 0 a0 s the compressive strength of pfrgc remained unchanged during 150 f t cycles while in the situation of bentonite addition of 3 a3 s and 6 a6 s the compressive strength of the samples reduced with the ascent in the number of f t cycles for example the compressive strength of a3 s was 26 5 lower than the initial compressive strength after 150 f t cycles and the compressive strength of a6 s decreased by 44 2 compared to the initial compressive strength after 150 f t cycles during 150 f t cycles the influence of 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water on the compressive strength of pfrgc is shown in fig 4 c and table 5 it can be seen that in water and na2so4 aq the compressive strength decreased with the prolong of f t damage on the contrary in mgso4 aq the compressive strength of pfrgc continued to decline during the first 50 f t cycles and during the remaining f t cycles the compressive strength showed an upward trend and then continued to decline the research results of this paper are consistent with niu wang and niu 2016 who reported sulfate solution had positive and negative effects on the durability of concrete under f t cycles the positive aspect is that during the immersion in sulfate solution sulfate can penetrate the pores of the pfrgc and the concentration of the pore solution of the pfrgc raises as a result which indirectly decreases the freezing temperature of the pore solution thereby reducing the freezing temperature on the other hand the negative aspect is that the sulfate solution can chemically react with pfrgc to generate swelling products such as gypsum and ettringite which accelerate the destructive effect of f t cycles on pfrgc 3 4 interaction between sulfate erosion and f t the degradation of pfrgc was associated with the dual effects of sulfate erosion and f t attack and the impact of the sulfate attack on f t damage was evaluated by a coefficient defined by the equation followed λ compressive strength f s compressive strength f where λ is the influence coefficient that sulfate effect on f t cycles compressive strength f s represents the compressive strength of pfrgc suffer the combined effects of f t and sulfate damage while compressive strength f represents compressive strength of pfrgc suffer the single influence of f t attack different λ values show that sulfate solutions have a distinct effect on f t cycles for example if λ 1 the sulfate solution exerts a positive effect on the resistance of frost damage while if λ 1 the sulfate environment causes a negative influence on the resistance of f t attack the λ values of pfrgc samples containing fa and bentonite in 10 na2so4 aq after 50 and 150 f t cycles are shown in fig 5 a and b the two abscissas in the figure represent the different additions of fa and bentonite and the ordinate represents the influence coefficient λ of sulfate solution on the f t cycle it could be seen from fig 5 a that after 50 f t cycles the greater the addition of bentonite and fa in the pfrgc specimen the smaller the value of λ which indicated that in the early period of the f t cycle the greater the amount of fa and bentonite in the specimen the na2so4 aq aggravated the destructive effect of the f t damage on pfrgc the reason may be that the addition of fa and bentonite reduced the strength of the pfrgc samples at an early stage resulting in the surface mortar of the test piece being easier to fall off under the effect of frost heave so that the corrosive solution invaded the inside of the test piece resulting in intensified f t cycle damage at the same time it can be found from fig 5 b that after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the maximum value of λ was 1 33 c6 s and the minimum value of λ was 1 08 a0 s which indicated na2so4 aq played a positive role in resisting the frost heave damage of the pfrgc specimen in the later stage of f t cycle the reason may be that in the later period of the f t damage the na2so4 aq penetrated the pfrgc specimen lowering the freezing point of the pore solution thereby reducing the destructive effect of the f t cycle the λ values of pfrgc samples containing fa and bentonite in 10 mgso4 aq after 50 and 150 f t cycles are shown in fig 5 c and d it can be found that the effect of mgso4 aq on the f t cycle was dissimilar from the effect of na2so4 aq on the f t cycle after 50 and 150 f t cycles the minimum value of λ were 0 78 a0 m and 0 81 a6 m indicating that mgso4 aq can promote the frost heave damage of pfrgc samples 3 5 ae characteristics 3 5 1 effect of fa addition on ae characteristics fig 6 shows the relationship between ae signal parameters and stress strain curves of pfrgc samples with fa to cement ratios of 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 respectively after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the serial numbers a b and c represent the fa c ratio of 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 respectively the number 0 represents that the addition of bentonite in pfrgc accounts for 0 of the total cementitious material and the number s represents the corrosive environment is na2so4 aq it can be seen from fig 6 that the characteristics in the ae signal of the pfrgc after the f t cycle and sulfate solution erosion correspond to the different stages of the uniaxial compression process the ae ringing count rate can be roughly divided into the initial stage stable expansion stage and unstable expansion stage ae occurred in the initial stage of pfrgc compression and the ae signal was small and continuously and stably produced in the stable expansion stage the cracks in the pfrgc were connected and developed steadily and slowly in the unstable expansion stage the density and intensity of the ae signal increased rapidly the deformation rate inside the pfrgc material increased and the stress strain curve began to appear inflection points it showed that the cracks in the pfrgc appeared densely before the failure and the micro cracks developed into macro cracks the ae ringing count rate increased rapidly near the peak stress of the pfrgc specimen and reached the peak soon during the uniaxial compression of pfrgc samples with different fa addition the ae signal was continuous and uninterrupted and the intensity of the ae signal had a good correlation with the stress level it can be seen from fig 6 that after 150 f t cycles the lower the fa addition the higher the axial compressive strength of the specimen and the greater the intensity and density of the ae signal the reason was analyzed the high substitution rate of fa to cement leads to a decrease in the strength of pfrgc so that the energy required for cracking and failure of pfrgc samples decreases and the intensity and density of ae signals decrease accordingly 3 5 2 effect of bentonite addition on ae characteristics fig 7 shows the relationship between ae signal parameters and stress strain curves of pfrgc samples with bentonite addition of 0 3 and 6 after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the serial number a represents that the ratio of fa to cement in pfrgc is 1 2 and the numbers 0 3 and 6 represent that the addition of bentonite in pfrgc is 0 3 and 6 of the total cementitious material number s represents that the corrosive environment is na2so4 aq due to the hydration of the cementitious material in pfrgc and the reaction between the sulfate solution and the hydration product the defects and tiny pores were gradually filled by the reaction products so the ae activity in the early stage of uniaxial compression was low when the stress level reached about 80 of the peak stress the intensity and density of the ae signal increased significantly indicating that the cracks began to grow steadily at this time and the macroscopic appearance was that visible cracks began to appear on the surface of the samples when the load was close to the peak stress the energy inside the specimen was concentratedly released and the ringing count rate rose rapidly then the energy continued to be released until the specimen was broken it can be seen from fig 7 that the addition of bentonite had a great influence on the ae signal during the uniaxial compression of pfrgc when the 0 and 3 addition of bentonite the ae activity was higher and the ringing count was concentrated near the peak stress when the addition of bentonite in pfrgc rose to 6 the ae signal was significantly reduced and the signal distribution was relatively uniform the decrease in the activity of the ae signal indicates that the internal crack propagation rate decreased during the compression process and the energy released during crack generation and propagation declined 3 5 3 effect of solution environment on ae characteristics the relationship between ae signal parameters and stress strain curves of pfrgc samples in na2so4 aq mgso4 aq and water after 150 f t cycles is shown in fig 8 the serial number a represents that the ratio of fa to cement in pfrgc is 1 2 the number 0 represents that the addition of bentonite in pfrgc accounts for 0 of the total cementitious material and the serial numbers s m and w represent the corrosion environment as na2so4 aq mgso4 aq and water it can be seen from fig 8 that in the na2so4 aq and the mgso4 aq the ae signals of the pfrgc samples during the loading process were relatively dense and the ae signals appeared as a single peak moreover ae signals were generated more frequently when approaching the ultimate stress while in water the ae signal was more evenly distributed and the ae signal exhibited multiple peaks the value of the ae signal generated near the ultimate stress in water was lower than the signal value generated in the sodium sulfate and mgso4 aq indicating that the sulfate containing solution caused serious damage to the internal structure of the pfrgc after 150 f t cycles 3 5 4 pfrgc damage model and analysis ae signals are released when pfrgc is subjected to external loads at the same time the damage in the specimen continues to accumulate and the ae signals continue to change correspondingly ae parameters can be used to assess the degree of pfrgc damage in this section aiming at the damage caused by the dual damage of sulfate erosion and f t cycle a damage model was established based on the theory of ae rate process to evaluate the damage process of pfrgc by analyzing the relationship between the important ae parameters of energy ring and event labuz dai and labuz 1997 put forward the labuz model when studying ae phenomenon and thought that with the constant change of stress level the probability density function of ae event can be expressed as 2 f σ d σ d n n 0 where σ is the relative stress level n0 is the total number of ae events from loading to peak stress at the same time the stress level and the total number of ae cumulative events n in the loading process can be expressed as 3 σ a n b ln 1 c n where a b and c can be obtained by fitting the data obtained from the experiment and the derivative of formula 3 4 d σ d n a b c 1 c n by combining formula 2 and formula 4 we can get 5 f σ 1 c n a b c acn n 0 at this time it is not difficult to find 0 1 f σ d σ 1 the damage in the pfrgc can be evaluated by the area between the function curve and the coordinate axis based on the dai and labuz models the mathematical model of the pfrgc stress level and the cumulative number of events during the ae process is 6 n s σ take the derivative of equation 6 and put it into equation 2 to get 7 f σ 1 n 0 d s σ d σ from equation 7 the damage d of pfrgc at the stress level σ can be obtained 8 d 1 n 0 0 σ d s σ according to the trend of the number of cumulative events generated during this ae test the relevant stress level ae cumulative event model in equation 6 can be well fitted by a fourth order polynomial namely 9 n a b σ c σ 2 d σ 3 e σ 4 taking the derivative of equation 9 and substituting it into equation 2 the probability density function of the ae event can be obtained as 10 f σ b 2 c σ 3 d σ 2 4 e σ 3 n 0 integrating formula 10 the damage evolution model of pfrgc under uniaxial compression can be obtained as 11 d b σ c σ 2 d σ 3 e σ 4 n 0 n a n 0 according to the above analysis the number of ae events can be used to establish a mathematical model similarly the two important parameters of the ringing count and energy generated during the ae process can be used to establish a mathematical model therefore the ringing count energy and event number obtained from the ae test after 100 f t cycles of pfrgc were used for regression analysis and the polynomial coefficients obtained are shown in table 6 according to the polynomial coefficients the probability density function of pfrgc based on ae parameters can be obtained as cumulative ringing 12 f σ 0 958 2 764 σ 9 729 σ 2 12 576 σ 2 accumulated energy 13 f σ 1 327 1 628 σ 7 461 σ 2 16 876 σ 2 cumulative event 14 f σ 0 583 6 338 σ 16 308 σ 2 16 980 σ 2 according to the polynomial coefficients the relationship between pfrgc stress level and damage based on ae parameters can be obtained as cumulative ringing 15 d σ 0 958 σ 1 382 σ 2 3 243 σ 3 3 144 σ 4 accumulated energy 16 d σ 1 327 σ 0 814 σ 2 2 487 σ 3 4 219 σ 4 cumulative event 17 d σ 0 583 σ 3 169 σ 2 5 436 σ 3 4 245 σ 4 3 6 microstructure 3 6 1 sem analysis the macro durability performance of composite material depends on its internal microstructure to explore the microstructure of pfrgc after 150 f t cycles in 10 na2so4 aq water and 10 mgso4 aq a scanning electron microscope sem was used to observe the microstructure of pfrgc samples in different solutions micro morphology of pfrgc undergoing 150 times of f t attack in 10 na2so4 aq was observed and given in fig 9 a and b it can be seen that there were many hydrates in the surface region of pfrgc in which c s h and ettringite was the main component lots of needle like ettringite were mixed with amorphous c s h gels and ch crystals the hydration products were tightly combined in the surface of the cement matrix the connection between aggregate and paste was enhanced and this moderate dense contact between hydrate gels will contribute to the cohesive strength between silica aggregate and cement matrix besides it can also be seen that there existed looser structures and micro cracks which were caused by expansive destruction from matrix hydration production microcosmic structures of pfrgc after 150 f t attack in water is shown in fig 9 c and d the presence of lots of cement hydration products like needle shaped ettringite aft around the surface of the matrix could be seen in fig 9 c the internal structure of pfrgc was very loose at the same time from another sem picture of fig 9 d it can be seen that lots of c s h and bentonite combined tightly in the microstructure there also appeared some spherical fa particles in the cluster of needle like ettringite and these fa could cause the pozzolanic reaction in the later age and increased the compressive strength because of nonparticipation in the hydration reaction the sem result of pfrgc samples exposed to 150 f t attacks in 10 mgso4 aq is presented in fig 9 e and f it can be found that the cluster structure of ettringite crystals aft and sheet structure of ca oh 2 existed in the pfrgc interfacial transition zone from fig 9 e it can be seen that compact microstructure existed in the matrix which could form a strong cohesive force and contribute to the compressive strength the matrix was denser compared to that in water however in another sem picture of fig 9 f there were some voids or holes in the matrix leading to the worse mechanical performance of pfrgc 3 6 2 xrd analysis the reaction products of pfrgc samples subjected to 10 concentration na2so4 aq 10 concentration mgso4 aq and water after 150 f t cycles were analyzed by the xrd method fig 10 shows the xrd patterns of pfrgc samples subjected to three solutions under f t attack it can be seen that the erosion product of the samples was primarily composed of csh gypsum and ettringite gypsum exhibited the highest characteristic peaks in 10 concentration mgso4 aq followed by 10 concentration na2so4 aq and water this result indicated that compared with pfrgc in 10 concentration mgso4 aq it remained good durability performance in 10 concentration na2so4 aq and water after 150 f t cycles at the same time it was observed that the peaks referring to ettringite were the most intense in samples exposed to water second in 10 concentration na2so4 aq and least in magnesium sulfate environment and the xrd test result also was consistent with the sem results 4 conclusions to determine the behavior of pfrgc under the coupled attack of sulfate and f t in a marine environment nine pfrgc mixtures with different addition of fa and bentonite were adopted and pfrgc samples were exposed to na2so4 aq water and mgso4 aq for 150 f t cycles a series of experimental tests have been done involving mass increase rdem and compressive strength moreover the ae method was used to monitor the damage process of pfrgc during uniaxial compression in real time based on the presented experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the additions of fa and bentonite have a distinctive influence on the frost resistance of pfrgc in different types of solution environments the durability performance of pfrgc declined with the rise of the fa and bentonite addition in na2so4 aq while pfrgc reached the highest frost resistance when the fa c ratio was 1 8 1 in water 2 the impact of the sulfate attack on f t cycles was evaluated and different types of sulfate solutions had distinct effects on the frost resistance of pfrgc na2so4 aq played a positive role in resisting the frost heave damage of the pfrgc specimen in the later period of the f t cycle while mgso4 aq can promote the frost heave damage of pfrgc samples 3 the addition of fa and bentonite had a great influence on ae signals during the uniaxial compression of pfrgc with the rise of fa and bentonite addition the intensity and density of the ae signal were reduced and the signal distribution was relatively uniform and in na2so4 aq and mgso4 aq the ae signals were relatively dense during the loading process while in water the ae signal was more evenly distributed 4 the ae signal can be divided into the initial stage stable expansion stage and unstable expansion stage and the ae characteristics were closely related to the damage development and stress strain curve of pfrgc this research provided a theoretical foundation for the application and popularization of pfrgc with fa and bentonite credit authorship contribution statement nan zhao conceptualization methodology formal

20243,as an important construction material in marine structure engineering concrete is subject to the dual erosion effects of sulfate and freeze thaw cycles in a high latitude marine environment which is easy to induce damage and affect the normal service life of the structure in this paper the behavior of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites under the coupled attack of sulfate and freeze thaw in a marine environment were macroscopically and microscopically investigated nine mixtures modified with different content of fly ash and bentonite were adopted in this investigation and samples were exposed to na2so4 aq water and mgso4 aq for 150 freeze thaw cycles in this study the durability of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites was investigated by weight relative dynamic elastic modulus and compressive strength moreover the acoustic emission method was used to monitor the damage process during uniaxial compression in real time meanwhile the microscopic characterization method was used to identify the microscopic morphology and composition of the aged samples to explore the degradation mechanism of the macroscopic performance results show that the durability performance of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites declined with the increase of the fly ash and bentonite addition in na2so4 aq however polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites had the highest durability performance when the ratio of fly ash to cement was 1 8 in water the acoustic emission characteristics were closely related to the damage development and stress strain curve and the acoustic emission signal can be divided into the initial stage stable expansion stage and unstable expansion stage with the increase of fly ash and bentonite addition the intensity and density of the acoustic emission signal were reduced and the signal distribution was relatively uniform this research provided a theoretical foundation for the application and popularization of polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites in marine concrete structures which suffer from sulfate erosion and freeze thaw cycles keywords marine structure sulfate compressive strength 1 introduction with the rapid development of the marine economy and the acceleration use of marine space marine concrete structures such as port terminals cross sea bridges sea airports and subsea tunnels have become more and more widely used nie et al 2020 yao and li 2019 yu et al 2020 at the same time the marine environment is special and complex with both changeable meteorological conditions and heavy sea conditions which seriously endanger the safety and durability of marine concrete structures therefore the durability of marine concrete structures has been paid attention by many researchers in recent years alawi al sodani et al 2021 real and bogas 2018 yu et al 2018 it is reported that a large number of marine areas exist in high latitude and cold areas in northern europe and north america which make marine concrete structures suffer from sulfate erosion and freeze thaw f t cycles simultaneously therefore research on the durability of concrete under the combined effects of sulfate erosion and f t cycles is of great significance for improving the safety and durability of marine concrete structures and for the development and utilization of marine resources gao et al 2019 in order to improve the service life of concrete under the combined attack of sulfate and f t cycles some scholars proposed to use geopolymer to improve the durability of concrete mardani aghabaglou et al 2019 cement composition determines the resistance of concrete to sulfate and f t cycle calcium aluminate 3cao al2o3 c3a in cement is the main raw material for ettringite formation and the ca oh 2 generated in the hydration process of calcium silicate 3cao sio2 c3s in cement can directly participate in the sulfate corrosion reaction therefore the content of c3a and c3s in cement has an important influence on the resistance of sulfate attack the use of geopolymers can replace part of the cement reduce the c3a content and thus reduce the materials for the sulfate attack reaction the geopolymers such as fly ash and silica fume can also undergo secondary hydration with ca oh 2 in concrete which reduces the content of ca oh 2 and produces a relatively stable csh with a low ca si ratio at the same time the fineness and particle size of geopolymer are smaller than those of cement which can increase the compactness of concrete and reduce the porosity of concrete thus enhancing the ability of concrete to resist corrosion by f t cycles many scholars have done a lot of research on the use of geopolymers to improve the resistance of concrete to sulfate and f t cycles the research results of dulaijian al dulaijan et al 2003 showed that the addition of 20 fly ash fa improved the sulfate resistance of ordinary concrete and the sulfate resistance effect of fa was better than that of sulfate resistant cement toutanji toutanji et al 2004 reported the influence of fa granulated blast furnace slag ggbs and silica fume sf on the frost resistance of ordinary concrete the results showed that the frost resistance of ggbs sf and ggbs fa concrete was better than that of concrete mixed with fa alone türkmen 2003 studied the effects of three solutions of 5 nacl 5 na2so4 5 mgso4 on the strength of ordinary concrete sf and ggbs concrete the results showed that the strength of concrete in the three corrosive solutions continued to decrease but the strength of concrete mixed with sf and ggbs was higher than that of the ordinary concrete and the damage degree of the corrosive solution was in order mgso4 nacl na2so4 mangat mangat and khatib compared the sulfate corrosion resistance of ordinary concrete and concrete with 40 and 80 slag content and the results showed that concrete with 40 slag content was the first to destroy while concrete with 80 slag content had the best corrosion resistance geopolymer concrete can improve the durability of concrete under sulfate attack and f t cycles to a certain extent however like ordinary concrete geopolymer concrete can also generate macroscopic cracks in weak areas under internal temperature stress caused by f t cycles which not only provide channels for sulfate intrusion but also reduces the strength and durability of concrete structure therefore to solve the problem of long term durability of concrete structures it is necessary not only to improve the impermeability of materials in the non cracking state but also to control the crack width of structures after cracking in complex environments some researchers have proposed to add different kinds of fibers into concrete such as polypropylene pp fiber karahan and atis 2011 steel fiber alsaif et al 2019 glass fiber abedi et al 2020 polyethylene pe fiber zhu et al 2017 and polyvinyl alcohol pva fiber wang et al 2018 etc the use of fiber can improve the toughness of materials effectively reduce the crack width of concrete under the action of environment and load thereby improving the durability of the concrete under sulfate attack and f t cycles many scholars have done a lot of research on the use of fibers to improve the resistance of concrete to sulfate and f t cycles şahmaran şahmaran et al 2012 discussed the influence of the pva fibers and fa on the anti frost performance of concrete during 300 cycles and results showed that all concrete mixtures with a high content of fa remained good endurance moreover the addition of pva fiber notably improved the frost resistance ren ren and lai 2021 studied the failure mechanism of pp fiber concrete under f t cycles and sulfate erosion compressive strength quality change and porosity change were used to characterize the durability of concrete the results showed that due to the good bridging effect of polypropylene fiber the durability of concrete can be increased by 67 nam nam et al 2016 added pva fiber and pp fiber to cement based composite materials and discussed the influence of fiber length and tensile strength on the durability of frost resistance the mercury intrusion method and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the porosity characteristics the test results showed that the compressive strength of pva fiber reinforced concrete was higher than that of pp fiber reinforced concrete after 300 f t cycles wang wang et al 2021 studied the effects of pva fiber pp fiber and polyacrylonitrile pan fiber with different lengths on the frost resistance of concrete the test results showed that adding fiber can enhance frost resistance and the degree of frost resistance improvement was pva pan pp although many scholars have done a lot of research on the durability of concrete under the attack of sulfate and f t cycles the research on improving the combined attack of sulfate and frost resistance of concrete by using bentonite and fa modified polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced geopolymer composites pfrgc is still very limited bentonite has excellent physical properties such as small particle size large surface area and high cation exchange rate at the same time bentonite has high reactivity to calcium hydroxide released by cement hydration reaction which can produce pozzolanic bond and this pozzolanic bond can improve the microstructure of concrete when dispersed in the cement slurry it produces a large number of nucleation sites to precipitate hydration products this mechanism is conducive to the densification and homogenization of cement thus reducing the internal pore diameter and generating pozzolanic activity rashad 2018 sha et al 2018 xu et al 2018 fa has the morphological effect micro aggregate effect and pozzolanic effect of spherical particles in addition to improving the workability of the concrete mixture reducing the heat of hydration of the concrete and improving the crack resistance fa also has the advantages of refining pores improving interface structure inhibiting alkali aggregate reaction and improving the ability to resist seawater erosion alnahhal et al 2018 rahla et al 2019 zhuang et al 2016 at the same time pva fiber has high elastic modulus which can improve the toughness of the substrate and has good acid and alkali resistance and hydrophilicity which is convenient for stirring and dispersion and has good bonding force with the substrate si et al 2020 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however adding fibers to concrete may also adversely affect its workability and homogeneity huang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 pva fibers have a high aspect ratio which increases the surface area to concrete volume ratio resulting in less excess water layer at a given free water content when a large amount of fiber is modified the wet packing density of concrete decreases which adversely affects the workability of fiber composite materials therefore the content of fiber usually is not greater than 1 of the concrete volume in the case of less fiber content the wet packing density of concrete is higher thus the workability and homogeneity of concrete are better at the same time the high wet packing density also leads to a significant reduction in the porosity of concrete which has greatly improved its strength and durability compared with traditional concrete de larrard and sedran 1994 richard and cheyrezy 1995 the main purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of pfrgc under the coupled attack of sulfate and f t in a marine environment nine pfrgc mixtures modified with different content of fa and bentonite were adopted in this investigation and pfrgc samples were exposed to na2so4 aq water and mgso4 aq for 150 f t cycles in this study the durability of pfrgc was investigated by weight relative dynamic elastic modulus rdem and compressive strength moreover the acoustic emission ae method was used to monitor the damage process of pfrgc during uniaxial compression in real time meanwhile the microscopic characterization method was used to identify the microscopic morphology and composition of the aged samples to explore the degradation mechanism of the macroscopic performance of pfrgc this research provided a theoretical foundation for the application and popularization of pfrgc in marine concrete structures which suffer from sulfate erosion and f t cycles 2 experimental programs 2 1 raw materials the information about the raw materials adopted in the pfrgc specimen is provided in table 1 this information contains the size types chemical compositions and physical properties 2 2 pfrgc mixtures the components of the pfrgc sample series were fa cement bentonite water silica sand high range water reducer hrwr and pva fibers there are nine mix proportions in which the fa content is 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 times by weight the cement content and the content of bentonite is 0 3 and 6 by weight of the cementitious material the proportions of mixtures are shown in table 2 2 3 sample preparation the production of pfrgc samples comprised of four stages mixing stage casting stage compacting stage and curing stage and the production and analysis stages of pfrgc are presented in fig 1 in this research the durability properties including the weight rdem compressive strength ae characteristics scanning electron microscope sem and x ray diffractometer xrd were taken as durability indexes to evaluate the durability of pfrgc under combined damage of sulfate and f t and sizes of the corresponding samples were 100 100 300 mm 100 100 300 mm 100 100 100 mm 100 100 300 mm in each test the average result of three specimens was taken as the final test result 2 4 experimental methods 2 4 1 f t cycles the f t cycles of pfrgc samples were performed in line with gb t 50082 2009 which is close to astm c666 c666m zhao et al 2020 one experimental period contains 25 cycles the following steps were listed during one cycle after 24 days of curing pfrgc samples were taken out from plastic bags and then the initial rdem weight and compressive strength were tested all samples were immersed for 96 h in water after that samples were carried into the rubber buckets of freezing and thawing equipment in one cycle the highest temperature was 5 2 c and the lowest temperature was 18 2 c and a f t cycle took 4 h from start to end after each freezing and thawing period the rdem weight and compressive strength were tested 2 4 2 ae ae refers to the phenomenon of concentrated and rapid release of energy in the form of elastic waves after accumulation within the material cao et al 2019 gu et al 2019 guan et al 2019 generally when concrete is subjected to external loads stress concentration occurs inside the concrete causing uneven stress distribution inside as the load continues to increase the stress concentration phenomenon becomes even more obvious when a certain threshold is reached the unstable high energy state inside the concrete transform to a stable low energy state causing micro cracks to occur and expand and the material release plastic strain energy outward in the form of stress waves ae mainly uses high sensitivity ae piezoelectric sensors to detect and collect the stress waves and to monitor crack growth inside in real time by processing the collected signals the internal damage inside concrete can be analyzed paul et al 2015 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the saeu2s digital ae system produced by jingshenghua xingye company was used in this test the sensor model was sr150n and the sensitivity peak value was greater than 75 db it can be used to collect 22 khz 220khz signals the preamplifier model was pa i broadband type after measuring the noise level of the on site environment and loading equipment the sampling frequency was set to 3 mhz the preamplifier gain was set to 40 db and the threshold was set to 40 db 2 4 3 sem in this experiment a scanning electron microscope sem s4800 hitachi was used to observe the microstructure of the pfrgc small pieces of pfrgc 5 10 mm in diameter and 1 2 mm in thickness were taken 2 4 mm under the surface of pfrgc and soaked in ethanol to stop hydration before scanning the samples were dried at 70 c for 4 h then platinum coating was implemented to enhance electrical conductivity the accelerating voltage was set at 3000 v and the distance is 8400 μm and the emission current was 8400 na 2 4 4 xrd the d8 advance x ray diffractometer produced by the german bruke company was used the light tube type was ceramic x ray tube cu target light tube power was 2 2w maximum tube pressure was 60 kv maximum tube current was 80 ma and goniometer adopted stepping motor drive and optical encoder technology in the sample preparation process the sample was broken firstly and then the sample was cleaned with absolute ethanol after the cleaning the sample was dried in an oven and then the sample was continuously ground with a mortar until the powder particle diameter was less than 10 μm finally the sample was bottled and sealed to prevent the sample from reacting with carbon dioxide and water in the air 3 results 3 1 mass change the effect of fa addition on the mass change of pfrgc samples in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 2 a and table 3 the serial numbers a b and c represent the content of fa is 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 times the content of cement the number 0 3 6 represents that the bentonite content is 0 3 and 6 of cementitious material the serial numbers s m and w respectively represent the corrosion environment as 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water as shown in fig 2 a under the dual influence of na2so4 aq attack and f t damage the weight of pfrgc with distinct fa addition displayed a continuously increasing tendency and the a3 s specimen reached the largest mass increase rate after 150 f t cycles in 10 na2so4 aq during the first 50 f t cycles the weight of pfrgc increased rapidly and during the next 100 f t cycles the weight increase rate tended to be flat and after 150 f t cycles in 10 na2so4 aq the weight increase rates of a3 s b3 s and c3 s were 1 71 0 85 and 3 55 respectively the reason for the increase in the mass of pfrgc samples is that the number of micro cracks in the pfrgc material increases with the extension of the f t cycle so the sulfate in the solution continues to penetrate the pfrgc and undergo physical crystallization and chemical reactions resulting expansive products to fill the pores inside the pfrgc so the mass of the pfrgc continues to rise the effect of bentonite addition on the mass change of pfrgc in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 2 b and table 3 it could be seen that during the first 50 f t cycles samples maintained a high mass growth rate while after the 50 f t cycles the weight of the samples exhibited a fluctuating condition with the increase of bentonite addition the growth rate of the mass also increased for example after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the weight growth rates of a0 s a3 s and a6 s were 0 68 1 71 and 2 46 respectively the effect of 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water on the change of pfrgc mass during 150 f t cycles is shown in fig 2 c and table 3 it could be found that in na2so4 aq and water as the number of f t cycles increased the weight of the pfrgc showed a trend of increasing while in mgso4 aq the weight of the samples increased first and then decreased with the progress of f t damage after 150 f t cycles the weight growth rates of the samples in different types of environments were 1 71 0 51 and 2 25 respectively indicating that water has the least corrosion to the pfrgc and the mgso4 aq has the greatest corrosion the reason lies in that the pfrgc samples were subjected to the double erosion of sulfate ions and magnesium ions in the mgso4 aq which not only generated swelling products during the corrosion progress causing the frost heave damage of the pfrgc but also decalcified the calcium silicate hydrate gel and this dual erosion effect increased with the rise of the progress of f t damage therefore the erosion effect of mgso4 aq on pfrgc was more serious than that of na2so4 aq and water 3 2 rdem the effect of fa addition on the rdem of pfrgc in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 3 a and table 4 it could be seen that the rdem showed a declining trend with the extension of f t damage after 150 f t cycles the lowest rdem was 20 8 c3 s when the bentonite addition was 3 the rdem reduced continuously with the rise of the fa addition in the specimen for example as the ratio of fa to cement raised from 1 2 to 2 4 the rdem of pfrgc decreased from 40 3 to 20 8 after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the effect of bentonite addition on the rdem of pfrgc in 10 na2so4 aq is shown in fig 3 b and table 4 it could be found that the rdem of pfrgc reduced with the addition of bentonite raised in the situation of fa c 1 2 the rdem from large to small were a0 s 42 9 a3 s 40 3 and a6 s 24 9 after 150 f t cycles the effects of 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water on the rdem of pfrgc are shown in fig 3 c and table 4 it can be seen that in sodium sulfate and water as the cycles of f t raised the rdem decreased while in mgso4 aq the rdem of pfrgc rose slightly during the first 50 f t cycles while the rdem drop rapidly during the remaining f t cycles 3 3 compressive strength under the dual attack of na2so4 aq and f t damage the effect of fa addition on the compressive strength of pfrgc is shown in fig 4 a and table 5 it can be seen that when the ratio of fa to cement was 1 2 and 1 8 the compressive strength of the pfrgc samples during 150 f t cycles was similar while when the ratio of fa to cement reached 2 4 the compressive strength of pfrgc samples dropped significantly for example after 150 f t cycles the compressive strength of a3 s and b3 s were 30 44 mpa and 26 92 mpa respectively while the compressive strength of c3 s was 18 05 mpa the result shows that the increase in fa addition reduced the compressive strength on the one hand although the addition of fa can reduce the pore volume in pfrgc thereby reducing the pore solution used for f t damage on the other hand the higher fa can cause relatively lower early compressive strength therefore f t cycle causes serious damage to the surface of the specimen with a higher fa addition resulting a large amount of sulfate solution penetrate the internal pores of the pfrgc thus increasing the impact of the f t cycle on the pfrgc yuan et al 2020 under the dual attack of na2so4 aq and f t damage the effect of bentonite addition on the compressive strength of pfrgc is shown in fig 4 b and table 5 it can be seen that when the fa c ratio was 1 2 and the addition of bentonite was 0 a0 s the compressive strength of pfrgc remained unchanged during 150 f t cycles while in the situation of bentonite addition of 3 a3 s and 6 a6 s the compressive strength of the samples reduced with the ascent in the number of f t cycles for example the compressive strength of a3 s was 26 5 lower than the initial compressive strength after 150 f t cycles and the compressive strength of a6 s decreased by 44 2 compared to the initial compressive strength after 150 f t cycles during 150 f t cycles the influence of 10 na2so4 aq 10 mgso4 aq and water on the compressive strength of pfrgc is shown in fig 4 c and table 5 it can be seen that in water and na2so4 aq the compressive strength decreased with the prolong of f t damage on the contrary in mgso4 aq the compressive strength of pfrgc continued to decline during the first 50 f t cycles and during the remaining f t cycles the compressive strength showed an upward trend and then continued to decline the research results of this paper are consistent with niu wang and niu 2016 who reported sulfate solution had positive and negative effects on the durability of concrete under f t cycles the positive aspect is that during the immersion in sulfate solution sulfate can penetrate the pores of the pfrgc and the concentration of the pore solution of the pfrgc raises as a result which indirectly decreases the freezing temperature of the pore solution thereby reducing the freezing temperature on the other hand the negative aspect is that the sulfate solution can chemically react with pfrgc to generate swelling products such as gypsum and ettringite which accelerate the destructive effect of f t cycles on pfrgc 3 4 interaction between sulfate erosion and f t the degradation of pfrgc was associated with the dual effects of sulfate erosion and f t attack and the impact of the sulfate attack on f t damage was evaluated by a coefficient defined by the equation followed λ compressive strength f s compressive strength f where λ is the influence coefficient that sulfate effect on f t cycles compressive strength f s represents the compressive strength of pfrgc suffer the combined effects of f t and sulfate damage while compressive strength f represents compressive strength of pfrgc suffer the single influence of f t attack different λ values show that sulfate solutions have a distinct effect on f t cycles for example if λ 1 the sulfate solution exerts a positive effect on the resistance of frost damage while if λ 1 the sulfate environment causes a negative influence on the resistance of f t attack the λ values of pfrgc samples containing fa and bentonite in 10 na2so4 aq after 50 and 150 f t cycles are shown in fig 5 a and b the two abscissas in the figure represent the different additions of fa and bentonite and the ordinate represents the influence coefficient λ of sulfate solution on the f t cycle it could be seen from fig 5 a that after 50 f t cycles the greater the addition of bentonite and fa in the pfrgc specimen the smaller the value of λ which indicated that in the early period of the f t cycle the greater the amount of fa and bentonite in the specimen the na2so4 aq aggravated the destructive effect of the f t damage on pfrgc the reason may be that the addition of fa and bentonite reduced the strength of the pfrgc samples at an early stage resulting in the surface mortar of the test piece being easier to fall off under the effect of frost heave so that the corrosive solution invaded the inside of the test piece resulting in intensified f t cycle damage at the same time it can be found from fig 5 b that after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the maximum value of λ was 1 33 c6 s and the minimum value of λ was 1 08 a0 s which indicated na2so4 aq played a positive role in resisting the frost heave damage of the pfrgc specimen in the later stage of f t cycle the reason may be that in the later period of the f t damage the na2so4 aq penetrated the pfrgc specimen lowering the freezing point of the pore solution thereby reducing the destructive effect of the f t cycle the λ values of pfrgc samples containing fa and bentonite in 10 mgso4 aq after 50 and 150 f t cycles are shown in fig 5 c and d it can be found that the effect of mgso4 aq on the f t cycle was dissimilar from the effect of na2so4 aq on the f t cycle after 50 and 150 f t cycles the minimum value of λ were 0 78 a0 m and 0 81 a6 m indicating that mgso4 aq can promote the frost heave damage of pfrgc samples 3 5 ae characteristics 3 5 1 effect of fa addition on ae characteristics fig 6 shows the relationship between ae signal parameters and stress strain curves of pfrgc samples with fa to cement ratios of 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 respectively after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the serial numbers a b and c represent the fa c ratio of 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 respectively the number 0 represents that the addition of bentonite in pfrgc accounts for 0 of the total cementitious material and the number s represents the corrosive environment is na2so4 aq it can be seen from fig 6 that the characteristics in the ae signal of the pfrgc after the f t cycle and sulfate solution erosion correspond to the different stages of the uniaxial compression process the ae ringing count rate can be roughly divided into the initial stage stable expansion stage and unstable expansion stage ae occurred in the initial stage of pfrgc compression and the ae signal was small and continuously and stably produced in the stable expansion stage the cracks in the pfrgc were connected and developed steadily and slowly in the unstable expansion stage the density and intensity of the ae signal increased rapidly the deformation rate inside the pfrgc material increased and the stress strain curve began to appear inflection points it showed that the cracks in the pfrgc appeared densely before the failure and the micro cracks developed into macro cracks the ae ringing count rate increased rapidly near the peak stress of the pfrgc specimen and reached the peak soon during the uniaxial compression of pfrgc samples with different fa addition the ae signal was continuous and uninterrupted and the intensity of the ae signal had a good correlation with the stress level it can be seen from fig 6 that after 150 f t cycles the lower the fa addition the higher the axial compressive strength of the specimen and the greater the intensity and density of the ae signal the reason was analyzed the high substitution rate of fa to cement leads to a decrease in the strength of pfrgc so that the energy required for cracking and failure of pfrgc samples decreases and the intensity and density of ae signals decrease accordingly 3 5 2 effect of bentonite addition on ae characteristics fig 7 shows the relationship between ae signal parameters and stress strain curves of pfrgc samples with bentonite addition of 0 3 and 6 after 150 f t cycles in na2so4 aq the serial number a represents that the ratio of fa to cement in pfrgc is 1 2 and the numbers 0 3 and 6 represent that the addition of bentonite in pfrgc is 0 3 and 6 of the total cementitious material number s represents that the corrosive environment is na2so4 aq due to the hydration of the cementitious material in pfrgc and the reaction between the sulfate solution and the hydration product the defects and tiny pores were gradually filled by the reaction products so the ae activity in the early stage of uniaxial compression was low when the stress level reached about 80 of the peak stress the intensity and density of the ae signal increased significantly indicating that the cracks began to grow steadily at this time and the macroscopic appearance was that visible cracks began to appear on the surface of the samples when the load was close to the peak stress the energy inside the specimen was concentratedly released and the ringing count rate rose rapidly then the energy continued to be released until the specimen was broken it can be seen from fig 7 that the addition of bentonite had a great influence on the ae signal during the uniaxial compression of pfrgc when the 0 and 3 addition of bentonite the ae activity was higher and the ringing count was concentrated near the peak stress when the addition of bentonite in pfrgc rose to 6 the ae signal was significantly reduced and the signal distribution was relatively uniform the decrease in the activity of the ae signal indicates that the internal crack propagation rate decreased during the compression process and the energy released during crack generation and propagation declined 3 5 3 effect of solution environment on ae characteristics the relationship between ae signal parameters and stress strain curves of pfrgc samples in na2so4 aq mgso4 aq and water after 150 f t cycles is shown in fig 8 the serial number a represents that the ratio of fa to cement in pfrgc is 1 2 the number 0 represents that the addition of bentonite in pfrgc accounts for 0 of the total cementitious material and the serial numbers s m and w represent the corrosion environment as na2so4 aq mgso4 aq and water it can be seen from fig 8 that in the na2so4 aq and the mgso4 aq the ae signals of the pfrgc samples during the loading process were relatively dense and the ae signals appeared as a single peak moreover ae signals were generated more frequently when approaching the ultimate stress while in water the ae signal was more evenly distributed and the ae signal exhibited multiple peaks the value of the ae signal generated near the ultimate stress in water was lower than the signal value generated in the sodium sulfate and mgso4 aq indicating that the sulfate containing solution caused serious damage to the internal structure of the pfrgc after 150 f t cycles 3 5 4 pfrgc damage model and analysis ae signals are released when pfrgc is subjected to external loads at the same time the damage in the specimen continues to accumulate and the ae signals continue to change correspondingly ae parameters can be used to assess the degree of pfrgc damage in this section aiming at the damage caused by the dual damage of sulfate erosion and f t cycle a damage model was established based on the theory of ae rate process to evaluate the damage process of pfrgc by analyzing the relationship between the important ae parameters of energy ring and event labuz dai and labuz 1997 put forward the labuz model when studying ae phenomenon and thought that with the constant change of stress level the probability density function of ae event can be expressed as 2 f σ d σ d n n 0 where σ is the relative stress level n0 is the total number of ae events from loading to peak stress at the same time the stress level and the total number of ae cumulative events n in the loading process can be expressed as 3 σ a n b ln 1 c n where a b and c can be obtained by fitting the data obtained from the experiment and the derivative of formula 3 4 d σ d n a b c 1 c n by combining formula 2 and formula 4 we can get 5 f σ 1 c n a b c acn n 0 at this time it is not difficult to find 0 1 f σ d σ 1 the damage in the pfrgc can be evaluated by the area between the function curve and the coordinate axis based on the dai and labuz models the mathematical model of the pfrgc stress level and the cumulative number of events during the ae process is 6 n s σ take the derivative of equation 6 and put it into equation 2 to get 7 f σ 1 n 0 d s σ d σ from equation 7 the damage d of pfrgc at the stress level σ can be obtained 8 d 1 n 0 0 σ d s σ according to the trend of the number of cumulative events generated during this ae test the relevant stress level ae cumulative event model in equation 6 can be well fitted by a fourth order polynomial namely 9 n a b σ c σ 2 d σ 3 e σ 4 taking the derivative of equation 9 and substituting it into equation 2 the probability density function of the ae event can be obtained as 10 f σ b 2 c σ 3 d σ 2 4 e σ 3 n 0 integrating formula 10 the damage evolution model of pfrgc under uniaxial compression can be obtained as 11 d b σ c σ 2 d σ 3 e σ 4 n 0 n a n 0 according to the above analysis the number of ae events can be used to establish a mathematical model similarly the two important parameters of the ringing count and energy generated during the ae process can be used to establish a mathematical model therefore the ringing count energy and event number obtained from the ae test after 100 f t cycles of pfrgc were used for regression analysis and the polynomial coefficients obtained are shown in table 6 according to the polynomial coefficients the probability density function of pfrgc based on ae parameters can be obtained as cumulative ringing 12 f σ 0 958 2 764 σ 9 729 σ 2 12 576 σ 2 accumulated energy 13 f σ 1 327 1 628 σ 7 461 σ 2 16 876 σ 2 cumulative event 14 f σ 0 583 6 338 σ 16 308 σ 2 16 980 σ 2 according to the polynomial coefficients the relationship between pfrgc stress level and damage based on ae parameters can be obtained as cumulative ringing 15 d σ 0 958 σ 1 382 σ 2 3 243 σ 3 3 144 σ 4 accumulated energy 16 d σ 1 327 σ 0 814 σ 2 2 487 σ 3 4 219 σ 4 cumulative event 17 d σ 0 583 σ 3 169 σ 2 5 436 σ 3 4 245 σ 4 3 6 microstructure 3 6 1 sem analysis the macro durability performance of composite material depends on its internal microstructure to explore the microstructure of pfrgc after 150 f t cycles in 10 na2so4 aq water and 10 mgso4 aq a scanning electron microscope sem was used to observe the microstructure of pfrgc samples in different solutions micro morphology of pfrgc undergoing 150 times of f t attack in 10 na2so4 aq was observed and given in fig 9 a and b it can be seen that there were many hydrates in the surface region of pfrgc in which c s h and ettringite was the main component lots of needle like ettringite were mixed with amorphous c s h gels and ch crystals the hydration products were tightly combined in the surface of the cement matrix the connection between aggregate and paste was enhanced and this moderate dense contact between hydrate gels will contribute to the cohesive strength between silica aggregate and cement matrix besides it can also be seen that there existed looser structures and micro cracks which were caused by expansive destruction from matrix hydration production microcosmic structures of pfrgc after 150 f t attack in water is shown in fig 9 c and d the presence of lots of cement hydration products like needle shaped ettringite aft around the surface of the matrix could be seen in fig 9 c the internal structure of pfrgc was very loose at the same time from another sem picture of fig 9 d it can be seen that lots of c s h and bentonite combined tightly in the microstructure there also appeared some spherical fa particles in the cluster of needle like ettringite and these fa could cause the pozzolanic reaction in the later age and increased the compressive strength because of nonparticipation in the hydration reaction the sem result of pfrgc samples exposed to 150 f t attacks in 10 mgso4 aq is presented in fig 9 e and f it can be found that the cluster structure of ettringite crystals aft and sheet structure of ca oh 2 existed in the pfrgc interfacial transition zone from fig 9 e it can be seen that compact microstructure existed in the matrix which could form a strong cohesive force and contribute to the compressive strength the matrix was denser compared to that in water however in another sem picture of fig 9 f there were some voids or holes in the matrix leading to the worse mechanical performance of pfrgc 3 6 2 xrd analysis the reaction products of pfrgc samples subjected to 10 concentration na2so4 aq 10 concentration mgso4 aq and water after 150 f t cycles were analyzed by the xrd method fig 10 shows the xrd patterns of pfrgc samples subjected to three solutions under f t attack it can be seen that the erosion product of the samples was primarily composed of csh gypsum and ettringite gypsum exhibited the highest characteristic peaks in 10 concentration mgso4 aq followed by 10 concentration na2so4 aq and water this result indicated that compared with pfrgc in 10 concentration mgso4 aq it remained good durability performance in 10 concentration na2so4 aq and water after 150 f t cycles at the same time it was observed that the peaks referring to ettringite were the most intense in samples exposed to water second in 10 concentration na2so4 aq and least in magnesium sulfate environment and the xrd test result also was consistent with the sem results 4 conclusions to determine the behavior of pfrgc under the coupled attack of sulfate and f t in a marine environment nine pfrgc mixtures with different addition of fa and bentonite were adopted and pfrgc samples were exposed to na2so4 aq water and mgso4 aq for 150 f t cycles a series of experimental tests have been done involving mass increase rdem and compressive strength moreover the ae method was used to monitor the damage process of pfrgc during uniaxial compression in real time based on the presented experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the additions of fa and bentonite have a distinctive influence on the frost resistance of pfrgc in different types of solution environments the durability performance of pfrgc declined with the rise of the fa and bentonite addition in na2so4 aq while pfrgc reached the highest frost resistance when the fa c ratio was 1 8 1 in water 2 the impact of the sulfate attack on f t cycles was evaluated and different types of sulfate solutions had distinct effects on the frost resistance of pfrgc na2so4 aq played a positive role in resisting the frost heave damage of the pfrgc specimen in the later period of the f t cycle while mgso4 aq can promote the frost heave damage of pfrgc samples 3 the addition of fa and bentonite had a great influence on ae signals during the uniaxial compression of pfrgc with the rise of fa and bentonite addition the intensity and density of the ae signal were reduced and the signal distribution was relatively uniform and in na2so4 aq and mgso4 aq the ae signals were relatively dense during the loading process while in water the ae signal was more evenly distributed 4 the ae signal can be divided into the initial stage stable expansion stage and unstable expansion stage and the ae characteristics were closely related to the damage development and stress strain curve of pfrgc this

20244,umbilical is preferred as a remote controlling device in the subsea production system during the offshore oil and gas exploitation which is composed of some functional and strengthening components in the form of helically wound structure there is an obvious tension torsion coupling effect due to helical structural characteristic and the radial behavior of core structure of an umbilical involves nonlinearity because of polymer material and space gaps between components a methodology calculating the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect is proposed in this paper the theoretical description of the tension torsion coupled behavior of the helically wound structure is derived and the tension torsion stiffness matrix expression with the parameter the radial stiffness of the core structure of the umbilical is obtained then a semi analytical calculation methodology of the tension torsion stiffness of the umbilical is further established furthermore a practical case of an umbilical is given the nonlinear stiffness of tension is calculated through the established calculation methodology meanwhile the tensile test of this umbilical is conducted and the testing datas verify the correctness of above results finally the nonlinear tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior of an umbilical is performed which can provide a reasonable reference for the design and analysis of umbilicals used in deep water keywords umbilical nonlinear behavior tension torsion coupling radial stiffness semi analytical calculation 1 introduction as oil and gas exploration moves to deep or ultra deep water umbilical is preferred to supply subsea facilities electrical power signals and hydraulic liquids it is regarded as the life line api 2008 iso13628 5 2002 therefore the strength capacity of the umbilical should be guaranteed in the specific sea conditions the functional and strengthening components inside the umbilical are designated to helically wind on the supporting layers for permitting slip between layers which achieves the flexibility for the global configuration with a high capability of compensating the upheaval motion of the offshore floating structures such as platforms or fpso see fig 1 the top segment of the umbilical connecting to the floating body would involves the tension and torsion hereinafter referred to as tension torsion coupling effect during the in position operation because of the large tension and the geometric deformation coordination under the boundary constrained conditions kumar and botsis 2001 in addition there will be torsion accumulation of the umbilical when being transferred from the reel to the chute in the process of installation and laying meanwhile considering the geometric characteristics of the helically wound structure of the umbilical there is also an obvious tension torsion coupling effect kumar and botsis 2001 since the directions of tensile and torsional loads are along the axial direction of the umbilical they are collectively referred to as axisymmetric loads which are mainly borne by the tensile armor layers moreover the core structure of the umbilical surrounded by the armor layers will undergo radial shrinkage deformation due to radially compression under the combined action of tension and torsion witz and tan 1992 however there is nonlinear radial behavior of core structure due to nonlinearity of material and the space gap between components cust odio and vaz 2002 therefore the tension torsion coupling effect has a characteristic of nonlinearity which determines the tension and torsion stiffness of the umbilical these mechanical properties directly affects the global response of the umbilical such as the accuracy of dynamic stress and fatigue life prediction sævik and bruaseth 2005 therefore a methodology calculating the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect is proposed in this research there already exists some other similar models about cable modeling such as absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf and cosserat rod model the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf is widely used in the large deformation analysis of flexible multi body systems an absolute nodal coordinate formulation was presented for the large rotation and deformation analysis of the three dimension beam elements which takes into account the effect of rotary inertia torsion and shear and ensures continuity of the slopes as well as the rotation of the beam cross section at the nodal points ahmed and refaat 2001b a cosserat rod model takes into account deformations such as bending torsion tension and compression and accurately describes the physical properties of the static and dynamic problems for flexible slender structure holger et al 2011 presented a viscoelastic rod model which is based on cosserat s geometrically exact theory of rods and is able to represent extension shearing bending and torsion besides liu et al 2018 developed a kirchhoff nonlinear mechanical model of cables in complex space environments the recent research carried out by many scholars has focused on the structural tensional torsional or combined mechanical behavior of the umbilical which is generally simplified to the mechanical model that slender helical curved beams being the wound cylindrical structure under the linear elastic assumption hruska 1953 ignored the interaction between the armor wires and assumed that the wires only had the slight deformation along the cylindrical generatrix the overall tensile stiffness of the armor layer was derived by superimposing armor wires afterwards knapp 2010 introduced the equivalent poisson s ratio parameter of the inner core based on the structure of the umbilical in the elastic range and updated the tensile stiffness calculation obtained by hruska costello 1997 considered the poisson effect of the armor wires and introduced the macroscopic poisson s ratio parameter of the structure for the mathematic description the linearizes derivation process was conducted to obtain the tensile stiffness but it is often necessary to rely on multiple iterations calculation to get the accurate tensile mechanical behavior of the umbilical in yue s work yue et al 2013 it is found that there is a radial shrinkage phenomenon during the axial tensile process in the test of the umbilical and introduced the radial stiffness parameter to derive the expression of the tensile stiffness lu et al 2017 established a three dimensional finite element model of the umbilical using numerical simulation methods to study the tensile stiffness the numerical results were compared with experimental and theoretical analysis results to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulation method bai et al 2015 introduced the contact problem into the virtual work principle and proposed a theoretical model that considers the contact problem between layers this theoretical model can be used to predict the mechanical behavior of the umbilical under tension and compression load liu et al 2020 built an axisymmetric structural responses model to analyze the axisymmetric structural behaviours and shown that tensile stiffness of armor layers is overestimated with the interlayer gap ignored concerning the torsion behavior knapp 1981 addressed the torque and stress balanced problem of helically armours and gave a design methodology ramos et al 2008 studied on axial torsional behavior tests in a 2 5 flexible riser comparisons between analytically calculated values of the axial and torsional stiffnesses with those obtained experimentally are made and a brief discussion about the validity of some hypotheses is performed merino et al 2010 presented a numerical model of a flexible pipe with its ability to deal with friction and adhesion between layers which agreed quite well with the experimental measures under torsion wu et al 2021 studied the failure mechanism of flexible pipes under large torsion and analyzed the torsional behavior based on a mechanical model which considered the layer interaction it can be seen that the above mentioned literature work only studies the mechanical behavior of the structure of the umbilical under a single tensile or torsional load but does not conduct an in depth study on the tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior of the structure of the umbilical sousa et al 2018 found that a flexible pipe with damaged tensile armor wires had significant impact on its extensional torsional balance chang and chen 2019 studied in detail the mechanical behavior of submarine cables under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads through a numerical model it was found that the coupling effects of tensile torsional and compressive loads had a great influence on analysis and design of the submarine cables based on experimental and numerical simulation methods fang et al 2019 focused on the mechanical behavior of metallic strip flexible pipes under the action of pure torsion and analyzed the detailed stress conditions of each layer dai et al 2020 proposed a simplified method to determine the contact stiffness of the steel tube umbilical and investigated hoop contacts effect on the dynamic stress behavior and fatigue life prediction however few research works involve the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect the nonlinear characteristics of this structure brings greater challenges to the analysis of the tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior of the umbilical based on the tension behavior analysis in yue s work yue et al 2013 this research focuses on the analysis of the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the umbilical under the tension and torsion loads the relationship between the tension torsion load and deformation of the umbilical with the radial stiffness of the inner core structure as a parameter is derived in this paper the two dimensional plane numerical model of the cross sectional core structure of the umbilical is constructed to obtain nonlinear radial stiffness which is substituted into the derived three dimensional theoretical formula and the nonlinear tension torsion mechanical behavior of the structure is analyzed at the same time a prototype experimental test system was built in the laboratory to further verify the accuracy of the semi analytical analysis method proposed for the tensile torsional coupling mechanical behavior of umbilicals 2 mechanical model establishing 2 1 the description of the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect in this section a detailed description of the nonlinear mechanical behavior of tension torsion coupling in the cross sectional structure of the umbilical is given an umbilical is composed of strengthening armor layers and functional components which refer to the core structure see fig 2 it is found that there are the irregular gaps between the core functional components such as steel tubes electric cables and optical cables they provide the space for the nonlinear geometric large deformation moreover the material of the polymer sheath performs the nonlinear characteristics therefore the core section of the umbilical has obvious nonlinear deformation during the process of bearing the radial compression load the nonlinearity of the core section of the umbilical has a great impact on the mechanical properties of umbilical such as stiffness strength and fatigue life the tensional and torsional stiffnesses will decrease with increasing tension and torque so the design results of umbilicals will be more accurate with consideration of nonlinearity moreover stress evaluation of the umbilical will be influenced by the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect which will break through the traditional linear design criteria furthermore the fatigue life evaluation based on stresses will be redefined therefore it is necessary that the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect is analyzed and the mechanical behavior is discussed which can improve the accurate analysis of mechanical properties and expend the design space of an umbilical 2 2 mechanical model description considering the interaction between the multi layer tensile armor wires and the inner core of the umbilical the typical mechanical model under tensile and torsion loads is the structure of a multi layer slender curved beam helically wound with the inner core cylinder as shown in fig 3 assuming that the number of helically wound armor layers is m the number of helical components contained in the j th layer is n j i represents a certain helical component in this layer the upper and lower sections of the entire structure are respectively subjected to symmetrical tension f f and torque t t and correspondingly produce tensile deformation u u and torsion angle φ φ considering the structural complexity of the umbilical in order to facilitate the derivation of the analytical method the following reasonable assumptions are made 1 the structural model is an axial straight model 2 the cross sectional diameter of the slender helical component is much smaller than the diameter of the inner core cylinder usually about an order of magnitude difference 3 under the action of axial load the section remains plane after deformation i e the assumption of plane section 4 under the above load the section deformation of the helical component can be ignored relative to the overall structure size 5 the helical components may contact each other during deformation the influence of the interaction on the overall deformation is ignored in the derivation 6 all the materials involved in the model are homogeneous and isotropic 7 the helical components in the same layer has the same cross section and helical angle 8 in addition although the helical component in the model has a circular cross section the entire derivation is also applicable to the helical component with rectangular or other cross section assuming that the radial pressure on the cylindrical surface of the inner core is p the overall radial deformation under the integrated action of all helically wound layers is δ r then the loads involved in the structure can be expressed as a vector π t f t f t p and the key deformation of the structure under the loads can be described as a vector u t u φ u φ δ r then the relationship between loads and deformation can be described as eq 1 where k is the stiffness matrix 1 π ku due to the special form of the helically wound structure the mechanical behavior of the structure under the action of axial tension torsion load is symmetrical and the stiffness matrix k can be changed into a block matrix form 2 k k k k k k k k t k t k for the block sub matrix and k it can be assumed as 3 k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 4 k k 1 k 2 substituting eq 3 and eq 4 into eq 2 the relationship can be expressed as the following equation 5 f t f t p k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 1 k 2 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k u φ u φ δ r the first two rows of the matrix equation and the first two rows are taken to get the following expression 6 k 11 u u k 12 φ φ k 1 f k 21 u u k 22 φ φ k 2 t let u u δ u and φ φ δ φ considering the symmetry characteristic the matrix expression can be simplified as 7 f t p k 11 k 12 k 1 k 21 k 22 k 2 k 1 k 2 k δ u δ φ δ r where k 11 and k 22 are tension stiffness and torsion stiffness respectively k 12 and k 21 are the tension torsion coupled stiffnesses which are equal due to the tension torsion coupled mechanical behavior is symmetrical k is the radial stiffness of the inner core k 1 and k 2 are the radial coupled stiffness under the influence of tensile behavior and torsion behavior respectively therefore the relationship between the deformation δ u δ φ δ r and the load f t p is obtained based on the principles of force balance and deformation coordination this paper deduces the relationship between force and deformation of helically wound structure under tension torsion load since the structure contains multiple helical components with multilayer a certain helical component in one layer is selected as the research object for the convenience of derivation without loss of generality assuming that the radius of the inner core cylinder is r c the helical component with the cross sectional radius r h is wound on the cylindrical surface of the inner core at an angle α i j the subscript represents the i th helical component in the j th helically wound layer and then the helically wound radius r i j is the sum of r c and r h as shown in fig 3 3 calculation methodology 3 1 theoretical derivation of tension torsion stiffness since the winding direction of the helical component is the same as its axis direction of the umbilical the deformation of the helically wound structure under tension torsion load is shown in fig 4 based on the assumption of plane cross section the deformation of the helically wound structure includes axial extension hoop torsion and radial contraction the height of the cylinder and the length of the helical component are expressed as h and l the deformed height length and spiral winding angle are h l and α i j respectively the relationship between the length of the helical component and the inner core structure are shown in eq 8 and eq 9 8 h l cos α i j 9 h l cos α i j the axial strain of the helical component can be expressed as ε i j l l l there is expression cos α i j cos α i j δ α i j sin α i j when the change of the helical angle is tiny where δ α i j is the difference between the spiral winding angles before and after deformation the axial strain ε 1 of the structure can be expressed as following eq 10 10 ε 1 l cos α i j l cos α i j l cos α i j 1 ε i j cos α i j cos α i j 1 ε i j δ α i j tan α i j ε i j δ α i j tan α i j as previously mentioned the helically wound structure is also subjected to torsional deformation in the hoop direction the initial and deformed twist angle of the helical component are denoted as φ i j and φ i j and the initial and deformed winding radius of the central axis of helical components are denoted as r i j and r i j respectively ignoring the influence of infinitesimal of higher order the torsion deformation per unit length δ φ i j is shown in eq 11 11 δ φ i j φ i j φ i j h h tan α i j r i j h tan α i j r i j h 1 r i j r i j r i j 1 ε 1 tan α i j δ α i j tan α i j in addition the inner core the helically wound structure is subjected to the radial deformation it can be seen that the initial winding radius of the central axis of the helical component r i j is shown in eq 12 12 r i j r c r h where r c the radius of the inner core cylinder and r h is the radius of the helical component considering the poisson effect of the component section the deformed winding radius can be obtained as 13 r i j r c 1 ν 1 ε 1 r h 1 ν 2 ε i j where ν 1 and ν 2 are the poisson s ratios of the inner core cylinder and the helical component respectively the ratio of the deformed winding radius r i j to the initial winding radius r i j is expressed as 14 r i j r i j r c 1 ν 1 ε 1 r h 1 ν 2 ε i j r c r h 1 r c ν 1 ε 1 r h ν 2 ε i j r c r h since the size of the helical component is smaller than the whole structure in practice its poisson effect can often be ignored at the same time in order to describe the radial contraction deformation intuitively the difference δ r i j of the radial deformation is introduced the expression is shown in eq 15 15 r i j r i j δ r i j combining eq 10 eq 11 and eq 15 the expression of the axial strain ε i j under tension torsion load can be obtained as eq 16 it can be seen that it is jointly affected by the axial strain of the overall structure ε 1 the radial deformation of the helical component δ r i j and the torsional deformation of the overall structure δ φ i j 16 ε i j cos 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r i j δ r i j r i j sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j in addition according to the mathematical expressions of the curvature and twist of the helically wound curve it can be known that the helical component will undergo slight torsion and bending deformation under the action of tension torsion load the mathematical descriptions are shown in eq 17 and eq 18 respectively 17 δ τ sin 3 α i j cos α i j r i j ε 1 sin 3 α i j cos α i j r i j 2 δ r i j cos 4 α i j δ φ i j 18 δ κ sin 2 α i j cos 2 α i j r i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j cos 2 α i j r i j 2 δ r 2 sin α i j cos 3 α i j sin 3 α i j cos α i j δ φ i j it is not difficult to find that when the winding angle of the helical component is small and the cross sectional radius of the helical component is much smaller than the radius of the inner core structure the above mentioned deformation is negligible 17 the ratio of the tension along the axis of the helical component f i j and the projected tension in the axial direction of the overall structure f ij is shown as follows 19 f i j f i j ε

component in the j th layer respectively ignoring small changes in spiral winding angle the relationship between the tension along the axis of the helical component f i j and the projected tension in the axial direction of the global structure f ij can be expressed as eq 20 the torque t ij is the moment produced by the f i j toroidal component to the centerline of the structure can be expressed as

mathematical expressions are shown in eq 22 the schematic diagram of radial contraction of helically wound structure is shown in fig 4 according to the geometric relationship the radial pressure q ij

expression of f i j into the above equation the detailed expression of radial pressure is obtained as shown in eq 24 24 q i j sin 2 α i j r i j e i j h a i j h ε i j sin 2 α i j r i j e i j h a i j h c o s 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r δ r i j r sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j considering the interaction between the helical component and the inner core structure it can be obtained that the contact area per unit length of the helically wound structure can be expressed as follows 25 s i j d i j d l where d i j is the cross sectional diameter of the helical component and d l is the unit length along the axis line therefore the radial pressure p ij of the outer helical component acting on the surface of the inner core structure can be expressed as eq 26 26 p i j q i j s i j due to the gaps among the helically wound steel wires the arrangement is not compact the density coefficient f f is introduced which is usually 0 95 according to engineering experience fergestad and løtveit 2014 the relationship among the above geometric parameters is expressing as follows 27 n j d i j d l 2 π r i j cos α i j d l f f considering eq 24 eq 25 eq 26 and eq 27 comprehensively the relationship between

helical component when considering the multi layer helically wound structure of unit axial length the force and deformation of each layer of helical components are superimposed that is the eq 20 eq 21 and eq 28 are integrated into an expression similar to the aforementioned matrix 7 therefore then obtain the mathematical description of the tension torsion stiffness matrix of the structure of the umbilical is obtained and the mechanical behavior of the helically wound armor layer squeezing the inner core is considered as shown in eq 29 29 f t p j m i n j a i j h e i j h cos 3 α i j r i j sin α

and radial deformation in eq 29 are set to zero δ φ 0 δ r 0 the tensile stiffness expression can be obtained if the influence of axial and radial shrinkage on the torsional behavior is ignored that is the tensile and radial deformation in eq 29 are zero δ u 0 δ r 0 the expression of the torsional stiffness can be obtained 3 2 the semi analytical calculation methodology the armored steel wire wound on the outer layer of the inner core structure of the umbilical plays an important role in the bearing capacity of the structure and its mechanical performance parameters have a decisive impact on the mechanical performance of the whole structure in the above section the tensile and torsion behavior of helically wound structures are analyzed and mathematical relationships were obtained however the existing research all consider the inner core as a uniform elastic cylinder when analyzing the mechanical behavior of helically wound structures without considering the inner core components considering the influence of the radial deformation of the inner core there is a certain error between the result and the reality because of the gap and material nonlinearity therefore the radial stiffness parameter is introduced and the tension torsion coupling stiffness matrix expression of the helically wound structure is derived based on the theoretical model the semi analytical analysis method is introduced to study the influence of nonlinear factors of the inner core on the tension torsion coupling behavior the structure of the inner core of the umbilical is often complex and analytical theories are usually difficult to accurately describe the radial mechanical behavior of the internal structure therefore this study introduces the equivalent radial stiffness ω of the inner core structure it is defined as the ratio of the radial pressure and deformation caused by helically wound components to the surface of the inner core as shown in eq 30 30 ω p δ r in order to simplify the expression the auxiliary parameters are introduced as shown in eq 31 which can be obtained by the structural geometry and material mechanical parameters of the umbilical 31 ψ 11 j m i n j a i j h e i j h c o s 3 α i j ψ 12 j m i n j a i j h e i j h r i j s i n α i j c o s 2 α i j ψ 13 j m i n j a i j h e i j h s i n 2 α i j c o s α i j r i j ψ 21 j m i n j a i j h e i j h r i j s i n α i j c o

structure of the umbilical based on the radial stiffness of the core can be obtained by combining eq 30 and eq 29 32 f t ψ 11 ψ 13 ψ 31 ω ψ 33 ψ 12 ψ 13 ψ 32 ω ψ 33 ψ 21 ψ 23 ψ 31 ω ψ 33 ψ 22 ψ 23 ψ 32 ω ψ 33 δ u δ φ it can be seen from the above equations that the equivalent radial stiffness of the inner core is an important input parameter for calculating the tensile and torsional stiffness of the umbilical therefore the analysis of the tensile and torsional behavior can be converted into the solution of the radial stiffness if the radial stiffness of the inner core of the umbilical can be accurately predicted high precision tensile behavior characteristics can be obtained which is of great significance for the structural analysis and design and engineering applications of the umbilical as far as the inner core structure of the umbilical is concerned there are many complex components which often contain nonlinear polymer materials in addition there are gaps between the components especially the cross sectional shape of the filler is often more diverse therefore for the multi component and multi material composite structure of the inner core of the umbilical it will be difficult to accurately give the radial stiffness of the core if the theoretical calculation method is directly used most of the existing tension and torsion theoretical analytical methods assume that the inner core structure is a homogeneous cylinder with equivalent mechanical properties generally its tensile stiffness and bending stiffness are consistent with the real structure but other mechanical properties such as equivalent elastic modulus or radial stiffness parameters cannot be guaranteed to be consistent with the actual structure therefore the analysis results obtained by the equivalent homogeneous material conversion method are often difficult to accurately describe the radial nonlinear mechanical behavior of the actual structure resulting in large errors due to component gaps and material nonlinearities numerical simulation analysis methods are usually used the helical winding angle of the functional component of the inner core of the umbilical is very small usually about 5 api 2008 therefore the radial mechanical behavior of the core structure of the umbilical can be reasonably transformed into a two dimensional plane strain problem considering the nonlinear factors caused by internal component materials and gaps a certain radial pressure is applied to obtain the average radial deformation of the outer layer and the nonlinear mechanical behavior characteristics of the inner core structure of the umbilical are solved according to the definition of radial stiffness of the inner core structure it is can be found that the numerical simulation analysis of the inner core structure of the umbilical under radial external pressure load does not require the establishment of a huge three dimensional numerical model to accurately analyze its mechanical behavior the radial numerical simulation results are combined with the aforementioned theoretical model methods to obtain the true tensile and torsional behavior of the umbilical to sum up the above mentioned semi analytical umbilical nonlinear tension torsional behavior analysis process is shown in fig 5 3 3 validation based on numerical simulation considering that there are some assumptions in the analytic derivation of tensile and torsional behavior there are certain limitations in semi analytical calculations in order to verify the accuracy of the tensile and torsional stiffness expressions of helically wound structures a three dimensional numerical model of a typical helically wound structure is established and the mechanical behavior under the combined action of tension and torsion loads is simulated the load and deformation of numerical results are extracted and compared with semi analytical results to verify the feasibility of the tension and torsion analytical stiffness matrix expression 3 3 1 3d numerical model the selected model includes two parts a central core cylinder which is used to simulate the inner core of the umbilical and one layer helically wound steel wires which is used to simulate the steel armor wires as shown in fig 6 the steel wire has a circular cross section with a radius of 4 0 mm and the radius of the inner core cylinder is 38 652 mm the helically wound pitch of the steel wire is 300 mm that is the helically wound angle is 40 4 the aforementioned helically wound angle 5 refers to the winding angle of components in the inner core there are 36 steel wires densely distributed around the outside of the cylinder in this numerical example it is assumed that the material of the inner core cylinder is a certain polymer material and the equivalent elastic modulus of this polymer material is calculated according to the tensile stiffness and bending stiffness of the inner core of the umbilical the helically wound steel wire is a typical steel material as shown in table 1 the numerical simulation is only limited to the linear elastic range of the material based on abaqus software abaqus 2012 to build the three dimensional numerical model of the above mentioned structure the central cylinder in this model is established by cross sectional stretching and the helically wound steel wire is established by rotating and stretching around the central axis in order to ensure the calculation accuracy the model uses the c3d8r unit which is a physical unit that reduces integrals and it can improve the calculation accuracy while ensuring the calculation efficiency in order to model the helically wound structure more realistically the contact is set between the steel wire and the steel wire and the steel wire and the central cylinder the normal direction is hard contact and the tangential direction is free sliding ignoring the influence of friction factors as shown in fig 6 for the tension torsion load case combinations the end sections of the armored steel wires are coupled to an out of plane reference point and the load is applied where the reference point is on the central axis of the whole structure the fixed end of the model constrains all the degrees of freedom of the reference point and the other end applies the specific torsion angle and tensile displacement step by step while constraining the axial degrees of freedom and relaxing the hoop and radial contraction degrees of freedom to simulate quasi static mechanical behavior due to the relatively complex load application the explicit algorithm is used in order to ensure the quasi static form of the mechanical behavior simulation of the structure the kinetic energy of the structure response is checked the kinetic energy of the entire deformation stage is lower than 2 51 of the internal energy which ensures the rationality of the result the finite element model of the entire structure is shown in fig 7 3 3 2 comparison and validation analysis since the central core cylinder is a homogeneous material the radial stiffness obtained according to the theory of elasticity is 2 597 10 11 p a m substituting it into eq 32 for calculation the tensile and torsional stiffness values can be obtained in order to verify the accuracy of the semi analytical results the numerical simulation results of the helically wound structure are extracted and the curves of the tension and the torque with the torsion angle and the tensile displacement are obtained as shown in fig 8 the blue points represent numerical simulation results and the red points represent semi analytical results it can be observed that the results of the numerical simulation are basically consistent with the theoretical results showing the characteristics of linear changes the reason is that the material of the inner core cylinder is linear and the tension and torsion are simulated small deformations as the load increases there is a slight fluctuation phenomenon but it is not enough to affect the macroscopic load change rule under the same rotation angle and displacement the tension load and torque load are slightly higher than the semi analytical results there are two reasons for this on the one hand the end of the numerical model is fixed to be fully constrained which prevents effective contraction and deformation around this section under the action of the radial pressure thereby increasing the axial resistance of the structure on the other hand in the process of torsional and contractive deformation the gap between the steel wires will gradually decrease until they contact each other which will play a certain role in resistance to deformation to sum up the slight difference between the theory and the numerical results fully verified the correctness of the tension torsion stiffness matrix expression proposed in this section the global and radial contraction deformations are present in fig 9 according to fig 9 a it can be found that the outer armor steel wires in the helically wound structure mainly bear tensile and torsional loads as the tension torsion combined load increases the positive torsion of the steel wire causes significant radial pressure which causes the inner core to undergo radial contraction and deformation especially in the middle cross section of the structure see fig 9 b the end effect limits the radial contraction of the end therefore the middle section of the structure is selected and the results of the radial contraction displacement changes with tension and torsion loads are extracted the corresponding radial pressure is calculated by eq 28 fig 10 shows the curve of radial pressure versus the average contraction of radial displacement which includes the numerical result curve and the theoretical result curve it can be observed that the radial contraction of the cross section of the inner core cylinder is smaller than the theoretical result this is because in the process of extruding the steel wires on the cylindrical surface the extrusion of the steel wire and the cylinder is non uniform surface contact and the contact is nonlinear as shown in table 2 the error between the theoretical stiffness result and the numerical stiffness result is only 3 20 the above discussion and analysis not only verified the accuracy of the theoretical derivation method but also proved the validity of the numerical model 4 case study of an umbilical the feasibility of the calculation methodology proposed is verified in the last section this section focuses on the nonlinear tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior characteristics of the umbilical used in engineering which used in an oil and gas field in the south china sea fig 11 shows the structure of the umbilical which is mainly composed of six steel tubes three electrical cables one optical cable inner sheath two layers of armored steel wires and outer sheath the corresponding geometric dimensions of each component are shown in table 3 considering nonlinear factors such as component materials contact and gap a finite element model of the core section of the umbilical is established the radial pressure is applied to obtain the average radial deformation of the outer boundary and the nonlinear law of the radial stiffness of the inner core of the umbilical is analyzed the aforementioned semi analytical calculation methodology is further used to explore the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the umbilical under combined tension and torsion finally the structure of the umbilical is tested and then the effectiveness of the above methodology is verified by comparing with the experimental results 4 1 numerical simulation of the core structure 4 1 1 simplify components of the umbilical since the functional components such as electrical cables and optical cables inside the umbilical often contain a large number of copper wires or steel wires it is necessary to reasonably simplify components of the umbilical before establishing the finite element model to improve the efficiency of modeling and analysis the electrical cable is composed of multiple copper conductors and insulating layer which can be simplified as a section that polymer wrapping the circular copper cores an optical cable is composed of a core steel shell multiple steel wires and a polymer sheath which can be simplified as a section that polymer wrapping steel shell the above simplification process is realized based on the equivalent method of section stiffness in addition the filling body is used to fill the gap space of the cross section to support each functional component so as to avoid excessive contact force between each other since the filling body is a non axial load bearing component it is traditionally ignored in the previous structural analysis of the umbilical however the filling body has a significant impact on the radial contraction mechanical behavior of the structure of the umbilical therefore the filling bodies cannot be ignored when establishing the finite element model of the inner core to analyze the radial stiffness otherwise the result may be low 4 1 2 mechanical properties of materials for steel pipes and sheathed polymer materials they have a greater impact on the mechanical properties of the umbilical section especially polymer materials with the obvious nonlinear characteristics therefore it is necessary to obtain the constitutive relationship of the materials through test the specimens from steel pipe are made according to the specifications and the stress strain relationship measured by the testing machine is shown in fig 12 which has three typical stages linear elastic stage yield stage and strengthening stage in actual engineering design the stress response of the structure of the umbilical is often not allowed to enter the plastic stage of the material therefore the elastic modulus and yield strength of steel materials are important input parameters for steel pipes there are two main types of polymers used in the structure of the umbilical one is the low density polyethylene polymer used for the inner and outer sheaths and the other is the high density polyethylene polymer used for the sheath of functional components and filling bodies polymer materials exhibit typical viscoelastic behavior and the constitutive relationship of typical nonlinear viscoelastic materials is shown in eq 33 shen et al 1987 33 σ c 0 ε a ε 2 β ε 3 0 t c t τ ε τ τ d τ the first three terms are used to describe the nonlinear elastic mechanical behavior of the material and the stress and strain have no time dependence the following integral term refer to the viscous effect of the material and the strain rate ε are involved the correlation coefficient in the formula needs to be determined through test however its viscosity effect of the umbilical is relatively weak due to the slower frequency of the ocean environment load during operation therefore the time related characteristics can be ignored when simulating the constitutive relationship of polymer materials in the structure that is the stress strain relationship mainly involves its nonlinear elastic part two kinds of polymers with sufficient length are selected and processed into standard tensile specimens respectively the testing machine is adopted as shown in fig 13 six specimens are selected and the average values are calculated to obtain tensile stress strain curves of the low density polyethylene material and high density polyethylene material as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the test data of the polymer be used as the material properties input for the numerical simulation analysis in summary the material properties are shown in table 4 4 1 3 numerical model establishing in this section taking into account the nonlinear factors of polymer materials and the mutual contact between components a two dimensional finite element model of the inner core section of the umbilical is constructed through abaqus software abaqus 2012 and the radial mechanical behavior is obtained through numerical simulation considering that the core structure is a two dimensional plane strain problem the non coordination mode cpe4i element is selected for modeling which can overcome the shear self locking problem and the distortion of the element during the deformation process of the structure in addition using this type of element can shorten the calculation time and improve the calculation accuracy meanwhile the constitutive relationship data of the material obtained through the test is input to characterize its nonlinearity since the radial pressure is a centrally symmetric load and the sliding friction between components has little effect on the response of the inner core structure which can be ignored the bonded state of surface to surface contact elements is used to simulate the interaction between components which can effectively reduce calculation time without reducing analysis efficiency and accuracy in addition in order to more accurately simulate the effect of radial external pressure the constraints are set to limit the radial and circumferential displacement of the four nodes of the inner layer of the central steel pipe and uniform radial pressure is applied to the outermost layer of the outer sheath the cross sectional numerical model of the core structure of the umbilical is shown in fig 16 the radial deformation of all nodes in the outer layer is extracted through post processing and the equivalent radial deformation is obtained by averaging to obtain the equivalent radial stiffness of the inner core structure 4 1 4 analysis of radial mechanical behavior the radial pressure on the outer circumferential nodes of the sheath is applied gradually up to 3 0 mpa which is corresponding to the radial pressure due to tensile armor layers the equivalent radial displacement on the nodes is simultaneously obtained then the trend curve of radial displacement with pressure presented as shown in fig 17 it is not difficult to find that the inner core structure of the umbilical performs obvious nonlinear behavior under the increasing radial pressure in the initial stage the radial contraction is very obvious with the increase of radial pressure and the displacement changes rapidly this is because there are a lot of gaps between the components the outer sheath has not enough capacity to resist external radial compression with reducing gaps due to its continuous deformation when the pressure is higher than about 1 5 mpa the gaps between the components are almost completely squeezed to the minimum limit at this time the structure mainly resists the radial pressure load through the material deformation of the section observed from the graph the nonlinear characteristics of the material appear in the radial deformation with the increase of the pressure but the nonlinear behavior is not obvious due to the relatively small strain of the material moreover the change trend of the radial stiffness of the inner core with the radial pressure is calculated as shown in fig 18 it can be found that the overall radial stiffness still presents an obvious nonlinear trend it can be basically divided into two stages in the first stage the radial stiffness shows a continuous increase trend with the continuous increase of pressure in the second stage the corresponding radial stiffness tends to be flat and almost keep stable when it reaches about 1 5 mpa 4 2 tension test and result comparison analysis in order to verify the influence of nonlinear factors on the tensile behavior of the umbilical a sectional stiffness test experiment under the tensile load of the umbilical was carried out in this section the schematic diagram of tension test of the umbilical is shown in fig 19 the experimental plan adopted the horizontal stretching method and used tripods to restrain and support both ends both end fittings of the umbilical sample were specially designed which could not only connect with armored steel wires but also internal steel tubes through threaded connection so that they can bear the force together one end of the joint was fixed to the tripod on one side by a flange connection and the other end joint was also connected to the tripod on the other side by a flange through a hydraulic servo actuator the actuator can provide stable load input and the internal force sensor can monitor the tensile force in real time in order to avoid errors caused by the end measurement an extensometer was installed in the middle of the experimental sample to measure the deformation of the cable body under tension as shown in fig 20 considering that the hydraulic actuator can output tensile force but cannot restrict rotation special devices needed to be added during the experiment to limit the twisting deformation of one end of the umbilical to sum up the experimental device is shown in fig 21 the specific experimental plan is as follows i select an umbilical sample length 300 cm assemble the joint and connect the tripod with the actuator ii during the experimental test the actuator slowly applies a tensile force until 170 kn and then unloads repeat this step 3 times iii the axial elongation and radial contraction are measured simultaneously throughout the experiment the above three sets of the measured data are averaged in order to avoid operational errors iv base on the eq 30 the radial pressure under a given tension can be calculated and then the experimentally measured radial stiffness value can be obtained v the tensile force can be calculated by axial and radial deformation and then compare with the actual tensile force measured in the experiment 4 2 1 comparative analysis of radial stiffness fig 22 presents the comparison between experimental data and nonlinear numerical simulation results since the radial pressure was only increased to 2 0 mpa in the experiment in order to clearly discuss the influence of nonlinear factors on the radial stiffness of the structure the radial pressure was increased to 3 mpa in the numerical simulation through the curve of the experimental data it can be found that it is highly consistent with the trend of the numerical simulation results and the entire compression process can also be divided into two stages from the first stage with obvious nonlinearity 0 mpa 1 50 mpa to the relatively stable second stage 1 50 mpa 3 0 mpa the degree of nonlinearity of material deformation at this stage is not obvious enough from the constitutive relationship curve of the material tested in the previous experiment it is found that the strain value of the material at this stage is relatively small and the nonlinear characteristic of the constitutive relationship is weak in order to compare the results of the experimental test and the numerical simulation in more detail the radial stiffness was calculated according to the measured tensile displacement and radial contraction the changing curves of the two results with pressure were shown in fig 23 and the error comparison was shown in table 5 it was not difficult to find that the maximum error range of the experimental results and numerical simulation is 5 41 considering the uncertainty of the experimental operation and the complexity of the inner core structure of the umbilical the above error value fully verified the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis method based on the radial stiffness and showed that the radial stiffness is obviously nonlinear 4 2 2 comparative analysis of axial mechanical behavior in addition to the need to consider the radial deformation characteristics of the umbilical the relationship between the overall load and displacement of the umbilical is also an important design index in the engineering design according to the expression of tensile torsional stiffness substituting the measured tensile strain and radial contraction into the formula can obtain the change rule of tensile load and compare it with the measured curve as shown in fig 24 it could be seen from the figure that the two curves are very close the initial stage showed obvious nonlinear changes and gradually stabilized in the later stage as the load was applied according to the previous discussion and analysis although the later data had certain nonlinearity the inner core sheath material after compaction was still in a state of small strain under the action of pressure therefore the macroscopic nonlinear characteristics of the structure were not obvious and the overall linear characteristics were present moreover most of the bearing conditions of the umbilical in practical applications are in this deformed state it is necessary to obtain the mechanical performance index of the axial tensile stiffness of the umbilical at this deformation stage to facilitate the guidance of engineering design for this reason the numerical simulation and the second half of the experiment data were linearly fitted and the axial tensile stiffnesses were 1 181 10 8 n and 1 113 10 8 n and the relative error is 5 76 from the above analysis it could be seen that the main reason for the nonlinear tension behavior of the umbilical is the gap between the components which resulted in the obvious reduction of the inner core radius during the extrusion process and reduced the tensile resistance of the umbilical in order to explore the difference between the method in this study and the traditional tensile stiffness solution method the commonly used knapp θ 0 tensile stiffness model was selected and its tensile stiffness value was obtained and compared by substituting relevant parameters as shown in table 6 below it could be found that the traditional method of ignoring the radial contraction will seriously overestimate the tensile and torsional mechanical properties of the umbilical structure 5 conclusion concerning the axial tension and torsion coupling mechanical behavior of the umbilical in practical applications the tension torsion stiffness matrix expression based on the radial stiffness of the inner core structure through the beam model theory is derived and a three dimensional helically wound numerical model is built to verify the correctness of the above methods furthermore a case study of the umbilical is conducted the nonlinear behavior of the umbilical under tension is explored through the plane finite element model of the core structure with consideration of the stress strain relationship of the material of umbilical polymer measured by experiment in addition the tensile test of the umbilical is copied with and the comparison with the measured data verifies the accuracy of the semi analytical methodology combining numerical and theoretical analysis the nonlinear tension torsion behavior of the umbilical is performed it is found that the tension behavior is not only related to the axial and rotational displacement but also the radial displacement that is the radial stiffness which has a significant influence on it therefore the radial stiffness of the core structure of the umbilical is the main factor that affects the nonlinear tension torsion coupling behavior in summary the calculation methodology of tensile and torsional mechanical behavior of umbilical based on radial stiffness can be applied to the structural design of umbilicals which provides a useful reference for ensuring the safe operation of umbilicals such as the evaluation of tension bending capacity curve and fatigue life the constitutive model of helically wound structure deduced by the work of this paper is currently reasonably ignoring the mutual effect of the deformation of the armored steel wire however when the structure is subjected to extreme tension and torsion conditions the large axial and radial deformation of the umbilical cable causes the gap between the steel wires to gradually decrease until they contact and push against each other therefore it is necessary to establish a more refined numerical analysis model in further analysis to more accurately explore the tension and torsion failure mechanism of the umbilical cable structure in addition due to the increasing requirements of industrial equipment for integration umbilical cables integrated with high power cables may generate a lot of heat during operation which will cause the temperature of the structure to rise exploring the influence of temperature effect on the mechanical behavior of the umbilical cable is also the focus of subsequent research work credit authorship contribution statement zhixun yang

20244,umbilical is preferred as a remote controlling device in the subsea production system during the offshore oil and gas exploitation which is composed of some functional and strengthening components in the form of helically wound structure there is an obvious tension torsion coupling effect due to helical structural characteristic and the radial behavior of core structure of an umbilical involves nonlinearity because of polymer material and space gaps between components a methodology calculating the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect is proposed in this paper the theoretical description of the tension torsion coupled behavior of the helically wound structure is derived and the tension torsion stiffness matrix expression with the parameter the radial stiffness of the core structure of the umbilical is obtained then a semi analytical calculation methodology of the tension torsion stiffness of the umbilical is further established furthermore a practical case of an umbilical is given the nonlinear stiffness of tension is calculated through the established calculation methodology meanwhile the tensile test of this umbilical is conducted and the testing datas verify the correctness of above results finally the nonlinear tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior of an umbilical is performed which can provide a reasonable reference for the design and analysis of umbilicals used in deep water keywords umbilical nonlinear behavior tension torsion coupling radial stiffness semi analytical calculation 1 introduction as oil and gas exploration moves to deep or ultra deep water umbilical is preferred to supply subsea facilities electrical power signals and hydraulic liquids it is regarded as the life line api 2008 iso13628 5 2002 therefore the strength capacity of the umbilical should be guaranteed in the specific sea conditions the functional and strengthening components inside the umbilical are designated to helically wind on the supporting layers for permitting slip between layers which achieves the flexibility for the global configuration with a high capability of compensating the upheaval motion of the offshore floating structures such as platforms or fpso see fig 1 the top segment of the umbilical connecting to the floating body would involves the tension and torsion hereinafter referred to as tension torsion coupling effect during the in position operation because of the large tension and the geometric deformation coordination under the boundary constrained conditions kumar and botsis 2001 in addition there will be torsion accumulation of the umbilical when being transferred from the reel to the chute in the process of installation and laying meanwhile considering the geometric characteristics of the helically wound structure of the umbilical there is also an obvious tension torsion coupling effect kumar and botsis 2001 since the directions of tensile and torsional loads are along the axial direction of the umbilical they are collectively referred to as axisymmetric loads which are mainly borne by the tensile armor layers moreover the core structure of the umbilical surrounded by the armor layers will undergo radial shrinkage deformation due to radially compression under the combined action of tension and torsion witz and tan 1992 however there is nonlinear radial behavior of core structure due to nonlinearity of material and the space gap between components cust odio and vaz 2002 therefore the tension torsion coupling effect has a characteristic of nonlinearity which determines the tension and torsion stiffness of the umbilical these mechanical properties directly affects the global response of the umbilical such as the accuracy of dynamic stress and fatigue life prediction sævik and bruaseth 2005 therefore a methodology calculating the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect is proposed in this research there already exists some other similar models about cable modeling such as absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf and cosserat rod model the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf is widely used in the large deformation analysis of flexible multi body systems an absolute nodal coordinate formulation was presented for the large rotation and deformation analysis of the three dimension beam elements which takes into account the effect of rotary inertia torsion and shear and ensures continuity of the slopes as well as the rotation of the beam cross section at the nodal points ahmed and refaat 2001b a cosserat rod model takes into account deformations such as bending torsion tension and compression and accurately describes the physical properties of the static and dynamic problems for flexible slender structure holger et al 2011 presented a viscoelastic rod model which is based on cosserat s geometrically exact theory of rods and is able to represent extension shearing bending and torsion besides liu et al 2018 developed a kirchhoff nonlinear mechanical model of cables in complex space environments the recent research carried out by many scholars has focused on the structural tensional torsional or combined mechanical behavior of the umbilical which is generally simplified to the mechanical model that slender helical curved beams being the wound cylindrical structure under the linear elastic assumption hruska 1953 ignored the interaction between the armor wires and assumed that the wires only had the slight deformation along the cylindrical generatrix the overall tensile stiffness of the armor layer was derived by superimposing armor wires afterwards knapp 2010 introduced the equivalent poisson s ratio parameter of the inner core based on the structure of the umbilical in the elastic range and updated the tensile stiffness calculation obtained by hruska costello 1997 considered the poisson effect of the armor wires and introduced the macroscopic poisson s ratio parameter of the structure for the mathematic description the linearizes derivation process was conducted to obtain the tensile stiffness but it is often necessary to rely on multiple iterations calculation to get the accurate tensile mechanical behavior of the umbilical in yue s work yue et al 2013 it is found that there is a radial shrinkage phenomenon during the axial tensile process in the test of the umbilical and introduced the radial stiffness parameter to derive the expression of the tensile stiffness lu et al 2017 established a three dimensional finite element model of the umbilical using numerical simulation methods to study the tensile stiffness the numerical results were compared with experimental and theoretical analysis results to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulation method bai et al 2015 introduced the contact problem into the virtual work principle and proposed a theoretical model that considers the contact problem between layers this theoretical model can be used to predict the mechanical behavior of the umbilical under tension and compression load liu et al 2020 built an axisymmetric structural responses model to analyze the axisymmetric structural behaviours and shown that tensile stiffness of armor layers is overestimated with the interlayer gap ignored concerning the torsion behavior knapp 1981 addressed the torque and stress balanced problem of helically armours and gave a design methodology ramos et al 2008 studied on axial torsional behavior tests in a 2 5 flexible riser comparisons between analytically calculated values of the axial and torsional stiffnesses with those obtained experimentally are made and a brief discussion about the validity of some hypotheses is performed merino et al 2010 presented a numerical model of a flexible pipe with its ability to deal with friction and adhesion between layers which agreed quite well with the experimental measures under torsion wu et al 2021 studied the failure mechanism of flexible pipes under large torsion and analyzed the torsional behavior based on a mechanical model which considered the layer interaction it can be seen that the above mentioned literature work only studies the mechanical behavior of the structure of the umbilical under a single tensile or torsional load but does not conduct an in depth study on the tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior of the structure of the umbilical sousa et al 2018 found that a flexible pipe with damaged tensile armor wires had significant impact on its extensional torsional balance chang and chen 2019 studied in detail the mechanical behavior of submarine cables under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads through a numerical model it was found that the coupling effects of tensile torsional and compressive loads had a great influence on analysis and design of the submarine cables based on experimental and numerical simulation methods fang et al 2019 focused on the mechanical behavior of metallic strip flexible pipes under the action of pure torsion and analyzed the detailed stress conditions of each layer dai et al 2020 proposed a simplified method to determine the contact stiffness of the steel tube umbilical and investigated hoop contacts effect on the dynamic stress behavior and fatigue life prediction however few research works involve the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect the nonlinear characteristics of this structure brings greater challenges to the analysis of the tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior of the umbilical based on the tension behavior analysis in yue s work yue et al 2013 this research focuses on the analysis of the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the umbilical under the tension and torsion loads the relationship between the tension torsion load and deformation of the umbilical with the radial stiffness of the inner core structure as a parameter is derived in this paper the two dimensional plane numerical model of the cross sectional core structure of the umbilical is constructed to obtain nonlinear radial stiffness which is substituted into the derived three dimensional theoretical formula and the nonlinear tension torsion mechanical behavior of the structure is analyzed at the same time a prototype experimental test system was built in the laboratory to further verify the accuracy of the semi analytical analysis method proposed for the tensile torsional coupling mechanical behavior of umbilicals 2 mechanical model establishing 2 1 the description of the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect in this section a detailed description of the nonlinear mechanical behavior of tension torsion coupling in the cross sectional structure of the umbilical is given an umbilical is composed of strengthening armor layers and functional components which refer to the core structure see fig 2 it is found that there are the irregular gaps between the core functional components such as steel tubes electric cables and optical cables they provide the space for the nonlinear geometric large deformation moreover the material of the polymer sheath performs the nonlinear characteristics therefore the core section of the umbilical has obvious nonlinear deformation during the process of bearing the radial compression load the nonlinearity of the core section of the umbilical has a great impact on the mechanical properties of umbilical such as stiffness strength and fatigue life the tensional and torsional stiffnesses will decrease with increasing tension and torque so the design results of umbilicals will be more accurate with consideration of nonlinearity moreover stress evaluation of the umbilical will be influenced by the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect which will break through the traditional linear design criteria furthermore the fatigue life evaluation based on stresses will be redefined therefore it is necessary that the nonlinear tension torsion coupling effect is analyzed and the mechanical behavior is discussed which can improve the accurate analysis of mechanical properties and expend the design space of an umbilical 2 2 mechanical model description considering the interaction between the multi layer tensile armor wires and the inner core of the umbilical the typical mechanical model under tensile and torsion loads is the structure of a multi layer slender curved beam helically wound with the inner core cylinder as shown in fig 3 assuming that the number of helically wound armor layers is m the number of helical components contained in the j th layer is n j i represents a certain helical component in this layer the upper and lower sections of the entire structure are respectively subjected to symmetrical tension f f and torque t t and correspondingly produce tensile deformation u u and torsion angle φ φ considering the structural complexity of the umbilical in order to facilitate the derivation of the analytical method the following reasonable assumptions are made 1 the structural model is an axial straight model 2 the cross sectional diameter of the slender helical component is much smaller than the diameter of the inner core cylinder usually about an order of magnitude difference 3 under the action of axial load the section remains plane after deformation i e the assumption of plane section 4 under the above load the section deformation of the helical component can be ignored relative to the overall structure size 5 the helical components may contact each other during deformation the influence of the interaction on the overall deformation is ignored in the derivation 6 all the materials involved in the model are homogeneous and isotropic 7 the helical components in the same layer has the same cross section and helical angle 8 in addition although the helical component in the model has a circular cross section the entire derivation is also applicable to the helical component with rectangular or other cross section assuming that the radial pressure on the cylindrical surface of the inner core is p the overall radial deformation under the integrated action of all helically wound layers is δ r then the loads involved in the structure can be expressed as a vector π t f t f t p and the key deformation of the structure under the loads can be described as a vector u t u φ u φ δ r then the relationship between loads and deformation can be described as eq 1 where k is the stiffness matrix 1 π ku due to the special form of the helically wound structure the mechanical behavior of the structure under the action of axial tension torsion load is symmetrical and the stiffness matrix k can be changed into a block matrix form 2 k k k k k k k k t k t k for the block sub matrix and k it can be assumed as 3 k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 4 k k 1 k 2 substituting eq 3 and eq 4 into eq 2 the relationship can be expressed as the following equation 5 f t f t p k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 1 k 2 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k u φ u φ δ r the first two rows of the matrix equation and the first two rows are taken to get the following expression 6 k 11 u u k 12 φ φ k 1 f k 21 u u k 22 φ φ k 2 t let u u δ u and φ φ δ φ considering the symmetry characteristic the matrix expression can be simplified as 7 f t p k 11 k 12 k 1 k 21 k 22 k 2 k 1 k 2 k δ u δ φ δ r where k 11 and k 22 are tension stiffness and torsion stiffness respectively k 12 and k 21 are the tension torsion coupled stiffnesses which are equal due to the tension torsion coupled mechanical behavior is symmetrical k is the radial stiffness of the inner core k 1 and k 2 are the radial coupled stiffness under the influence of tensile behavior and torsion behavior respectively therefore the relationship between the deformation δ u δ φ δ r and the load f t p is obtained based on the principles of force balance and deformation coordination this paper deduces the relationship between force and deformation of helically wound structure under tension torsion load since the structure contains multiple helical components with multilayer a certain helical component in one layer is selected as the research object for the convenience of derivation without loss of generality assuming that the radius of the inner core cylinder is r c the helical component with the cross sectional radius r h is wound on the cylindrical surface of the inner core at an angle α i j the subscript represents the i th helical component in the j th helically wound layer and then the helically wound radius r i j is the sum of r c and r h as shown in fig 3 3 calculation methodology 3 1 theoretical derivation of tension torsion stiffness since the winding direction of the helical component is the same as its axis direction of the umbilical the deformation of the helically wound structure under tension torsion load is shown in fig 4 based on the assumption of plane cross section the deformation of the helically wound structure includes axial extension hoop torsion and radial contraction the height of the cylinder and the length of the helical component are expressed as h and l the deformed height length and spiral winding angle are h l and α i j respectively the relationship between the length of the helical component and the inner core structure are shown in eq 8 and eq 9 8 h l cos α i j 9 h l cos α i j the axial strain of the helical component can be expressed as ε i j l l l there is expression cos α i j cos α i j δ α i j sin α i j when the change of the helical angle is tiny where δ α i j is the difference between the spiral winding angles before and after deformation the axial strain ε 1 of the structure can be expressed as following eq 10 10 ε 1 l cos α i j l cos α i j l cos α i j 1 ε i j cos α i j cos α i j 1 ε i j δ α i j tan α i j ε i j δ α i j tan α i j as previously mentioned the helically wound structure is also subjected to torsional deformation in the hoop direction the initial and deformed twist angle of the helical component are denoted as φ i j and φ i j and the initial and deformed winding radius of the central axis of helical components are denoted as r i j and r i j respectively ignoring the influence of infinitesimal of higher order the torsion deformation per unit length δ φ i j is shown in eq 11 11 δ φ i j φ i j φ i j h h tan α i j r i j h tan α i j r i j h 1 r i j r i j r i j 1 ε 1 tan α i j δ α i j tan α i j in addition the inner core the helically wound structure is subjected to the radial deformation it can be seen that the initial winding radius of the central axis of the helical component r i j is shown in eq 12 12 r i j r c r h where r c the radius of the inner core cylinder and r h is the radius of the helical component considering the poisson effect of the component section the deformed winding radius can be obtained as 13 r i j r c 1 ν 1 ε 1 r h 1 ν 2 ε i j where ν 1 and ν 2 are the poisson s ratios of the inner core cylinder and the helical component respectively the ratio of the deformed winding radius r i j to the initial winding radius r i j is expressed as 14 r i j r i j r c 1 ν 1 ε 1 r h 1 ν 2 ε i j r c r h 1 r c ν 1 ε 1 r h ν 2 ε i j r c r h since the size of the helical component is smaller than the whole structure in practice its poisson effect can often be ignored at the same time in order to describe the radial contraction deformation intuitively the difference δ r i j of the radial deformation is introduced the expression is shown in eq 15 15 r i j r i j δ r i j combining eq 10 eq 11 and eq 15 the expression of the axial strain ε i j under tension torsion load can be obtained as eq 16 it can be seen that it is jointly affected by the axial strain of the overall structure ε 1 the radial deformation of the helical component δ r i j and the torsional deformation of the overall structure δ φ i j 16 ε i j cos 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r i j δ r i j r i j sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j in addition according to the mathematical expressions of the curvature and twist of the helically wound curve it can be known that the helical component will undergo slight torsion and bending deformation under the action of tension torsion load the mathematical descriptions are shown in eq 17 and eq 18 respectively 17 δ τ sin 3 α i j cos α i j r i j ε 1 sin 3 α i j cos α i j r i j 2 δ r i j cos 4 α i j δ φ i j 18 δ κ sin 2 α i j cos 2 α i j r i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j cos 2 α i j r i j 2 δ r 2 sin α i j cos 3 α i j sin 3 α i j cos α i j δ φ i j it is not difficult to find that when the winding angle of the helical component is small and the cross sectional radius of the helical component is much smaller than the radius of the inner core structure the above mentioned deformation is negligible 17 the ratio of the tension along the axis of the helical component f i j and the projected tension in the axial direction of the overall structure f ij is shown as follows 19 f i j f i j ε 1 e i j h a i j h ε i j e i j h a i j h ε 1 ε i j cos α i j δ α i j cos α i j δ α i j sin α i j where a i j h e i j h are the cross sectional area and the elasticity modulus of the i th helical component in the j th layer respectively ignoring small changes in spiral winding angle the relationship between the tension along the axis of the helical component f i j and the projected tension in the axial direction of the global structure f ij can be expressed as eq 20 the torque t ij is the moment produced by the f i j toroidal component to the centerline of the structure can be expressed as eq 21 20 f i j cos α i j f i j cos α i j e i j h a i j h ε i j cos α i j e i j h a i j h cos 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r i j δ r i j r i j sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j 21 t i j sin α i j r i j e i j h a i j h ε i j sin α i j r i j e i j h a i j h cos 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r i j δ r i j r i j sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j for any helical line each section has a certain curvature and torsion and its mathematical expressions are shown in eq 22 the schematic diagram of radial contraction of helically wound structure is shown in fig 4 according to the geometric relationship the radial pressure q ij generated by f i j on the surface of the inner core can be expressed as eq 23 22 κ sin 2 α i j r i j κ 0 τ sin α i j cos α i j r i j 23 q i j f i j κ f i j sin 2 α i j r i j substituting the expression of f i j into the above equation the detailed expression of radial pressure is obtained as shown in eq 24 24 q i j sin 2 α i j r i j e i j h a i j h ε i j sin 2 α i j r i j e i j h a i j h c o s 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r δ r i j r sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j considering the interaction between the helical component and the inner core structure it can be obtained that the contact area per unit length of the helically wound structure can be expressed as follows 25 s i j d i j d l where d i j is the cross sectional diameter of the helical component and d l is the unit length along the axis line therefore the radial pressure p ij of the outer helical component acting on the surface of the inner core structure can be expressed as eq 26 26 p i j q i j s i j due to the gaps among the helically wound steel wires the arrangement is not compact the density coefficient f f is introduced which is usually 0 95 according to engineering experience fergestad and løtveit 2014 the relationship among the above geometric parameters is expressing as follows 27 n j d i j d l 2 π r i j cos α i j d l f f considering eq 24 eq 25 eq 26 and eq 27 comprehensively the relationship between radial pressure and axial strain generated by the helical component can be obtained as shown in eq 28 28 p i j n j e i j h a i j h ε i j sin 2 α i j 2 π r i j 2 f f cos α i j n j e i j h a i j h sin 2 α i j 2 π r i j 2 f f cos α i j cos 2 α i j ε 1 sin 2 α i j r δ r i j r sin α i j cos α i j δ φ i j the above derivation process is only for the relationship between load and deformation of a single helical component when considering the multi layer helically wound structure of unit axial length the force and deformation of each layer of helical components are superimposed that is the eq 20 eq 21 and eq 28 are integrated into an expression similar to the aforementioned matrix 7 therefore then obtain the mathematical description of the tension torsion stiffness matrix of the structure of the umbilical is obtained and the mechanical behavior of the helically wound armor layer squeezing the inner core is considered as shown in eq 29 29 f t p j m i n j a i j h e i j h cos 3 α i j r i j sin α i j cos 2 α i j sin 2 α i j cos α i j r i j r i j sin α i j cos 2 α i j r i j 2 sin 2 α i j cos α i j r i j sin 3 α i j sin 2 α i j cos α i j 2 π r i j 2 f f sin 3 α i j 2 π r i j f f sin 4 α i j 2 π r i j 3 f f cos α i j δ u δ φ δ r this expression is universal for the tensile and torsional behaviors of similar structures such as the armor layer of flexible pipes wire ropes etc if the torsional and radial deformation in eq 29 are set to zero δ φ 0 δ r 0 the tensile stiffness expression can be obtained if the influence of axial and radial shrinkage on the torsional behavior is ignored that is the tensile and radial deformation in eq 29 are zero δ u 0 δ r 0 the expression of the torsional stiffness can be obtained 3 2 the semi analytical calculation methodology the armored steel wire wound on the outer layer of the inner core structure of the umbilical plays an important role in the bearing capacity of the structure and its mechanical performance parameters have a decisive impact on the mechanical performance of the whole structure in the above section the tensile and torsion behavior of helically wound structures are analyzed and mathematical relationships were obtained however the existing research all consider the inner core as a uniform elastic cylinder when analyzing the mechanical behavior of helically wound structures without considering the inner core components considering the influence of the radial deformation of the inner core there is a certain error between the result and the reality because of the gap and material nonlinearity therefore the radial stiffness parameter is introduced and the tension torsion coupling stiffness matrix expression of the helically wound structure is derived based on the theoretical model the semi analytical analysis method is introduced to study the influence of nonlinear factors of the inner core on the tension torsion coupling behavior the structure of the inner core of the umbilical is often complex and analytical theories are usually difficult to accurately describe the radial mechanical behavior of the internal structure therefore this study introduces the equivalent radial stiffness ω of the inner core structure it is defined as the ratio of the radial pressure and deformation caused by helically wound components to the surface of the inner core as shown in eq 30 30 ω p δ r in order to simplify the expression the auxiliary parameters are introduced as shown in eq 31 which can be obtained by the structural geometry and material mechanical parameters of the umbilical 31 ψ 11 j m i n j a i j h e i j h c o s 3 α i j ψ 12 j m i n j a i j h e i j h r i j s i n α i j c o s 2 α i j ψ 13 j m i n j a i j h e i j h s i n 2 α i j c o s α i j r i j ψ 21 j m i n j a i j h e i j h r i j s i n α i j c o

structure of the umbilical based on the radial stiffness of the core can be obtained by combining eq 30 and eq 29 32 f t ψ 11 ψ 13 ψ 31 ω ψ 33 ψ 12 ψ 13 ψ 32 ω ψ 33 ψ 21 ψ 23 ψ 31 ω ψ 33 ψ 22 ψ 23 ψ 32 ω ψ 33 δ u δ φ it can be seen from the above equations that the equivalent radial stiffness of the inner core is an important input parameter for calculating the tensile and torsional stiffness of the umbilical therefore the analysis of the tensile and torsional behavior can be converted into the solution of the radial stiffness if the radial stiffness of the inner core of the umbilical can be accurately predicted high precision tensile behavior characteristics can be obtained which is of great significance for the structural analysis and design and engineering applications of the umbilical as far as the inner core structure of the umbilical is concerned there are many complex components which often contain nonlinear polymer materials in addition there are gaps between the components especially the cross sectional shape of the filler is often more diverse therefore for the multi component and multi material composite structure of the inner core of the umbilical it will be difficult to accurately give the radial stiffness of the core if the theoretical calculation method is directly used most of the existing tension and torsion theoretical analytical methods assume that the inner core structure is a homogeneous cylinder with equivalent mechanical properties generally its tensile stiffness and bending stiffness are consistent with the real structure but other mechanical properties such as equivalent elastic modulus or radial stiffness parameters cannot be guaranteed to be consistent with the actual structure therefore the analysis results obtained by the equivalent homogeneous material conversion method are often difficult to accurately describe the radial nonlinear mechanical behavior of the actual structure resulting in large errors due to component gaps and material nonlinearities numerical simulation analysis methods are usually used the helical winding angle of the functional component of the inner core of the umbilical is very small usually about 5 api 2008 therefore the radial mechanical behavior of the core structure of the umbilical can be reasonably transformed into a two dimensional plane strain problem considering the nonlinear factors caused by internal component materials and gaps a certain radial pressure is applied to obtain the average radial deformation of the outer layer and the nonlinear mechanical behavior characteristics of the inner core structure of the umbilical are solved according to the definition of radial stiffness of the inner core structure it is can be found that the numerical simulation analysis of the inner core structure of the umbilical under radial external pressure load does not require the establishment of a huge three dimensional numerical model to accurately analyze its mechanical behavior the radial numerical simulation results are combined with the aforementioned theoretical model methods to obtain the true tensile and torsional behavior of the umbilical to sum up the above mentioned semi analytical umbilical nonlinear tension torsional behavior analysis process is shown in fig 5 3 3 validation based on numerical simulation considering that there are some assumptions in the analytic derivation of tensile and torsional behavior there are certain limitations in semi analytical calculations in order to verify the accuracy of the tensile and torsional stiffness expressions of helically wound structures a three dimensional numerical model of a typical helically wound structure is established and the mechanical behavior under the combined action of tension and torsion loads is simulated the load and deformation of numerical results are extracted and compared with semi analytical results to verify the feasibility of the tension and torsion analytical stiffness matrix expression 3 3 1 3d numerical model the selected model includes two parts a central core cylinder which is used to simulate the inner core of the umbilical and one layer helically wound steel wires which is used to simulate the steel armor wires as shown in fig 6 the steel wire has a circular cross section with a radius of 4 0 mm and the radius of the inner core cylinder is 38 652 mm the helically wound pitch of the steel wire is 300 mm that is the helically wound angle is 40 4 the aforementioned helically wound angle 5 refers to the winding angle of components in the inner core there are 36 steel wires densely distributed around the outside of the cylinder in this numerical example it is assumed that the material of the inner core cylinder is a certain polymer material and the equivalent elastic modulus of this polymer material is calculated according to the tensile stiffness and bending stiffness of the inner core of the umbilical the helically wound steel wire is a typical steel material as shown in table 1 the numerical simulation is only limited to the linear elastic range of the material based on abaqus software abaqus 2012 to build the three dimensional numerical model of the above mentioned structure the central cylinder in this model is established by cross sectional stretching and the helically wound steel wire is established by rotating and stretching around the central axis in order to ensure the calculation accuracy the model uses the c3d8r unit which is a physical unit that reduces integrals and it can improve the calculation accuracy while ensuring the calculation efficiency in order to model the helically wound structure more realistically the contact is set between the steel wire and the steel wire and the steel wire and the central cylinder the normal direction is hard contact and the tangential direction is free sliding ignoring the influence of friction factors as shown in fig 6 for the tension torsion load case combinations the end sections of the armored steel wires are coupled to an out of plane reference point and the load is applied where the reference point is on the central axis of the whole structure the fixed end of the model constrains all the degrees of freedom of the reference point and the other end applies the specific torsion angle and tensile displacement step by step while constraining the axial degrees of freedom and relaxing the hoop and radial contraction degrees of freedom to simulate quasi static mechanical behavior due to the relatively complex load application the explicit algorithm is used in order to ensure the quasi static form of the mechanical behavior simulation of the structure the kinetic energy of the structure response is checked the kinetic energy of the entire deformation stage is lower than 2 51 of the internal energy which ensures the rationality of the result the finite element model of the entire structure is shown in fig 7 3 3 2 comparison and validation analysis since the central core cylinder is a homogeneous material the radial stiffness obtained according to the theory of elasticity is 2 597 10 11 p a m substituting it into eq 32 for calculation the tensile and torsional stiffness values can be obtained in order to verify the accuracy of the semi analytical results the numerical simulation results of the helically wound structure are extracted and the curves of the tension and the torque with the torsion angle and the tensile displacement are obtained as shown in fig 8 the blue points represent numerical simulation results and the red points represent semi analytical results it can be observed that the results of the numerical simulation are basically consistent with the theoretical results showing the characteristics of linear changes the reason is that the material of the inner core cylinder is linear and the tension and torsion are simulated small deformations as the load increases there is a slight fluctuation phenomenon but it is not enough to affect the macroscopic load change rule under the same rotation angle and displacement the tension load and torque load are slightly higher than the semi analytical results there are two reasons for this on the one hand the end of the numerical model is fixed to be fully constrained which prevents effective contraction and deformation around this section under the action of the radial pressure thereby increasing the axial resistance of the structure on the other hand in the process of torsional and contractive deformation the gap between the steel wires will gradually decrease until they contact each other which will play a certain role in resistance to deformation to sum up the slight difference between the theory and the numerical results fully verified the correctness of the tension torsion stiffness matrix expression proposed in this section the global and radial contraction deformations are present in fig 9 according to fig 9 a it can be found that the outer armor steel wires in the helically wound structure mainly bear tensile and torsional loads as the tension torsion combined load increases the positive torsion of the steel wire causes significant radial pressure which causes the inner core to undergo radial contraction and deformation especially in the middle cross section of the structure see fig 9 b the end effect limits the radial contraction of the end therefore the middle section of the structure is selected and the results of the radial contraction displacement changes with tension and torsion loads are extracted the corresponding radial pressure is calculated by eq 28 fig 10 shows the curve of radial pressure versus the average contraction of radial displacement which includes the numerical result curve and the theoretical result curve it can be observed that the radial contraction of the cross section of the inner core cylinder is smaller than the theoretical result this is because in the process of extruding the steel wires on the cylindrical surface the extrusion of the steel wire and the cylinder is non uniform surface contact and the contact is nonlinear as shown in table 2 the error between the theoretical stiffness result and the numerical stiffness result is only 3 20 the above discussion and analysis not only verified the accuracy of the theoretical derivation method but also proved the validity of the numerical model 4 case study of an umbilical the feasibility of the calculation methodology proposed is verified in the last section this section focuses on the nonlinear tension torsion coupling mechanical behavior characteristics of the umbilical used in engineering which used in an oil and gas field in the south china sea fig 11 shows the structure of the umbilical which is mainly composed of six steel tubes three electrical cables one optical cable inner sheath two layers of armored steel wires and outer sheath the corresponding geometric dimensions of each component are shown in table 3 considering nonlinear factors such as component materials contact and gap a finite element model of the core section of the umbilical is established the radial pressure is applied to obtain the average radial deformation of the outer boundary and the nonlinear law of the radial stiffness of the inner core of the umbilical is analyzed the aforementioned semi analytical calculation methodology is further used to explore the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the umbilical under combined tension and torsion finally the structure of the umbilical is tested and then the effectiveness of the above methodology is verified by comparing with the experimental results 4 1 numerical simulation of the core structure 4 1 1 simplify components of the umbilical since the functional components such as electrical cables and optical cables inside the umbilical often contain a large number of copper wires or steel wires it is necessary to reasonably simplify components of the umbilical before establishing the finite element model to improve the efficiency of modeling and analysis the electrical cable is composed of multiple copper conductors and insulating layer which can be simplified as a section that polymer wrapping the circular copper cores an optical cable is composed of a core steel shell multiple steel wires and a polymer sheath which can be simplified as a section that polymer wrapping steel shell the above simplification process is realized based on the equivalent method of section stiffness in addition the filling body is used to fill the gap space of the cross section to support each functional component so as to avoid excessive contact force between each other since the filling body is a non axial load bearing component it is traditionally ignored in the previous structural analysis of the umbilical however the filling body has a significant impact on the radial contraction mechanical behavior of the structure of the umbilical therefore the filling bodies cannot be ignored when establishing the finite element model of the inner core to analyze the radial stiffness otherwise the result may be low 4 1 2 mechanical properties of materials for steel pipes and sheathed polymer materials they have a greater impact on the mechanical properties of the umbilical section especially polymer materials with the obvious nonlinear characteristics therefore it is necessary to obtain the constitutive relationship of the materials through test the specimens from steel pipe are made according to the specifications and the stress strain relationship measured by the testing machine is shown in fig 12 which has three typical stages linear elastic stage yield stage and strengthening stage in actual engineering design the stress response of the structure of the umbilical is often not allowed to enter the plastic stage of the material therefore the elastic modulus and yield strength of steel materials are important input parameters for steel pipes there are two main types of polymers used in the structure of the umbilical one is the low density polyethylene polymer used for the inner and outer sheaths and the other is the high density polyethylene polymer used for the sheath of functional components and filling bodies polymer materials exhibit typical viscoelastic behavior and the constitutive relationship of typical nonlinear viscoelastic materials is shown in eq 33 shen et al 1987 33 σ c 0 ε a ε 2 β ε 3 0 t c t τ ε τ τ d τ the first three terms are used to describe the nonlinear elastic mechanical behavior of the material and the stress and strain have no time dependence the following integral term refer to the viscous effect of the material and the strain rate ε are involved the correlation coefficient in the formula needs to be determined through test however its viscosity effect of the umbilical is relatively weak due to the slower frequency of the ocean environment load during operation therefore the time related characteristics can be ignored when simulating the constitutive relationship of polymer materials in the structure that is the stress strain relationship mainly involves its nonlinear elastic part two kinds of polymers with sufficient length are selected and processed into standard tensile specimens respectively the testing machine is adopted as shown in fig 13 six specimens are selected and the average values are calculated to obtain tensile stress strain curves of the low density polyethylene material and high density polyethylene material as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the test data of the polymer be used as the material properties input for the numerical simulation analysis in summary the material properties are shown in table 4 4 1 3 numerical model establishing in this section taking into account the nonlinear factors of polymer materials and the mutual contact between components a two dimensional finite element model of the inner core section of the umbilical is constructed through abaqus software abaqus 2012 and the radial mechanical behavior is obtained through numerical simulation considering that the core structure is a two dimensional plane strain problem the non coordination mode cpe4i element is selected for modeling which can overcome the shear self locking problem and the distortion of the element during the deformation process of the structure in addition using this type of element can shorten the calculation time and improve the calculation accuracy meanwhile the constitutive relationship data of the material obtained through the test is input to characterize its nonlinearity since the radial pressure is a centrally symmetric load and the sliding friction between components has little effect on the response of the inner core structure which can be ignored the bonded state of surface to surface contact elements is used to simulate the interaction between components which can effectively reduce calculation time without reducing analysis efficiency and accuracy in addition in order to more accurately simulate the effect of radial external pressure the constraints are set to limit the radial and circumferential displacement of the four nodes of the inner layer of the central steel pipe and uniform radial pressure is applied to the outermost layer of the outer sheath the cross sectional numerical model of the core structure of the umbilical is shown in fig 16 the radial deformation of all nodes in the outer layer is extracted through post processing and the equivalent radial deformation is obtained by averaging to obtain the equivalent radial stiffness of the inner core structure 4 1 4 analysis of radial mechanical behavior the radial pressure on the outer circumferential nodes of the sheath is applied gradually up to 3 0 mpa which is corresponding to the radial pressure due to tensile armor layers the equivalent radial displacement on the nodes is simultaneously obtained then the trend curve of radial displacement with pressure presented as shown in fig 17 it is not difficult to find that the inner core structure of the umbilical performs obvious nonlinear behavior under the increasing radial pressure in the initial stage the radial contraction is very obvious with the increase of radial pressure and the displacement changes rapidly this is because there are a lot of gaps between the components the outer sheath has not enough capacity to resist external radial compression with reducing gaps due to its continuous deformation when the pressure is higher than about 1 5 mpa the gaps between the components are almost completely squeezed to the minimum limit at this time the structure mainly resists the radial pressure load through the material deformation of the section observed from the graph the nonlinear characteristics of the material appear in the radial deformation with the increase of the pressure but the nonlinear behavior is not obvious due to the relatively small strain of the material moreover the change trend of the radial stiffness of the inner core with the radial pressure is calculated as shown in fig 18 it can be found that the overall radial stiffness still presents an obvious nonlinear trend it can be basically divided into two stages in the first stage the radial stiffness shows a continuous increase trend with the continuous increase of pressure in the second stage the corresponding radial stiffness tends to be flat and almost keep stable when it reaches about 1 5 mpa 4 2 tension test and result comparison analysis in order to verify the influence of nonlinear factors on the tensile behavior of the umbilical a sectional stiffness test experiment under the tensile load of the umbilical was carried out in this section the schematic diagram of tension test of the umbilical is shown in fig 19 the experimental plan adopted the horizontal stretching method and used tripods to restrain and support both ends both end fittings of the umbilical sample were specially designed which could not only connect with armored steel wires but also internal steel tubes through threaded connection so that they can bear the force together one end of the joint was fixed to the tripod on one side by a flange connection and the other end joint was also connected to the tripod on the other side by a flange through a hydraulic servo actuator the actuator can provide stable load input and the internal force sensor can monitor the tensile force in real time in order to avoid errors caused by the end measurement an extensometer was installed in the middle of the experimental sample to measure the deformation of the cable body under tension as shown in fig 20 considering that the hydraulic actuator can output tensile force but cannot restrict rotation special devices needed to be added during the experiment to limit the twisting deformation of one end of the umbilical to sum up the experimental device is shown in fig 21 the specific experimental plan is as follows i select an umbilical sample length 300 cm assemble the joint and connect the tripod with the actuator ii during the experimental test the actuator slowly applies a tensile force until 170 kn and then unloads repeat this step 3 times iii the axial elongation and radial contraction are measured simultaneously throughout the experiment the above three sets of the measured data are averaged in order to avoid operational errors iv base on the eq 30 the radial pressure under a given tension can be calculated and then the experimentally measured radial stiffness value can be obtained v the tensile force can be calculated by axial and radial deformation and then compare with the actual tensile force measured in the experiment 4 2 1 comparative analysis of radial stiffness fig 22 presents the comparison between experimental data and nonlinear numerical simulation results since the radial pressure was only increased to 2 0 mpa in the experiment in order to clearly discuss the influence of nonlinear factors on the radial stiffness of the structure the radial pressure was increased to 3 mpa in the numerical simulation through the curve of the experimental data it can be found that it is highly consistent with the trend of the numerical simulation results and the entire compression process can also be divided into two stages from the first stage with obvious nonlinearity 0 mpa 1 50 mpa to the relatively stable second stage 1 50 mpa 3 0 mpa the degree of nonlinearity of material deformation at this stage is not obvious enough from the constitutive relationship curve of the material tested in the previous experiment it is found that the strain value of the material at this stage is relatively small and the nonlinear characteristic of the constitutive relationship is weak in order to compare the results of the experimental test and the numerical simulation in more detail the radial stiffness was calculated according to the measured tensile displacement and radial contraction the changing curves of the two results with pressure were shown in fig 23 and the error comparison was shown in table 5 it was not difficult to find that the maximum error range of the experimental results and numerical simulation is 5 41 considering the uncertainty of the experimental operation and the complexity of the inner core structure of the umbilical the above error value fully verified the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis method based on the radial stiffness and showed that the radial stiffness is obviously nonlinear 4 2 2 comparative analysis of axial mechanical behavior in addition to the need to consider the radial deformation characteristics of the umbilical the relationship between the overall load and displacement of the umbilical is also an important design index in the engineering design according to the expression of tensile torsional stiffness substituting the measured tensile strain and radial contraction into the formula can obtain the change rule of tensile load and compare it with the measured curve as shown in fig 24 it could be seen from the figure that the two curves are very close the initial stage showed obvious nonlinear changes and gradually stabilized in the later stage as the load was applied according to the previous discussion and analysis although the later data had certain nonlinearity the inner core sheath material after compaction was still in a state of small strain under the action of pressure therefore the macroscopic nonlinear characteristics of the structure were not obvious and the overall linear characteristics were present moreover most of the bearing conditions of the umbilical in practical applications are in this deformed state it is necessary to obtain the mechanical performance index of the axial tensile stiffness of the umbilical at this deformation stage to facilitate the guidance of engineering design for this reason the numerical simulation and the second half of the experiment data were linearly fitted and the axial tensile stiffnesses were 1 181 10 8 n and 1 113 10 8 n and the relative error is 5 76 from the above analysis it could be seen that the main reason for the nonlinear tension behavior of the umbilical is the gap between the components which resulted in the obvious reduction of the inner core radius during the extrusion process and reduced the tensile resistance of the umbilical in order to explore the difference between the method in this study and the traditional tensile stiffness solution method the commonly used knapp θ 0 tensile stiffness model was selected and its tensile stiffness value was obtained and compared by substituting relevant parameters as shown in table 6 below it could be found that the traditional method of ignoring the radial contraction will seriously overestimate the tensile and torsional mechanical properties of the umbilical structure 5 conclusion concerning the axial tension and torsion coupling mechanical behavior of the umbilical in practical applications the tension torsion stiffness matrix expression based on the radial stiffness of the inner core structure through the beam model theory is derived and a three dimensional helically wound numerical model is built to verify the correctness of the above methods furthermore a case study of the umbilical is conducted the nonlinear behavior of the umbilical under tension is explored through the plane finite element model of the core structure with consideration of the stress strain relationship of the material of umbilical polymer measured by experiment in addition the tensile test of the umbilical is copied with and the comparison with the measured data verifies the accuracy of the semi analytical methodology combining numerical and theoretical analysis the nonlinear tension torsion behavior of the umbilical is performed it is found that the tension behavior is not only related to the axial and rotational displacement but also the radial displacement that is the radial stiffness which has a significant influence on it therefore the radial stiffness of the core structure of the umbilical is the main factor that affects the nonlinear tension torsion coupling behavior in summary the calculation methodology of tensile and torsional mechanical behavior of umbilical based on radial stiffness can be applied to the structural design of umbilicals which provides a useful reference for ensuring the safe operation of umbilicals such as the evaluation of tension bending capacity curve and fatigue life the constitutive model of helically wound structure deduced by the work of this paper is currently reasonably ignoring the mutual effect of the deformation of the armored steel wire however when the structure is subjected to extreme tension and torsion conditions the large axial and radial deformation of the umbilical cable causes the gap between the steel wires to gradually decrease until they contact and push against each other therefore it is necessary to establish a more refined numerical analysis model in further analysis to more accurately explore the tension and torsion failure mechanism of the umbilical cable structure in addition due to the increasing requirements of industrial equipment for integration umbilical cables integrated with high power cables may generate a lot of heat during operation which will cause the temperature of the structure to rise exploring the influence of temperature effect on the mechanical behavior of the umbilical cable is also the focus of subsequent research work credit authorship contribution statement zhixun yang
