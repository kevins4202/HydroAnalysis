19070,environmental fate or transport of pharmaceutical waste depends on the adsorptive interactions of pharmaceuticals with various environmental phases e g soil sediment microalgae and bacteria etc therefore it is important to understand these adsorptive interactions as part of the study we studied the adsorptive interaction of 30 chemicals with microalgae i e chlorella vulgaris because it is ubiquitous and its surface area occupies a high proportion in aquatic environments for this study isotherms between c vulgaris and 30 micropollutants in neutral and ionic forms i e 15 cations 5 anions and 10 neutrals were experimentally measured and their adsorptive affinities were then theoretically predicted based on the concept of the linear free energy relationship for modeling the dataset was divided into a training set and a test set where the training set was used for model development and the test set was performed for model validation this process was repeated ten times finally we suggested one model which has high predictability in r2 of 0 96 and standard error se of 0 17 log unit for the training set r2 of 0 818 and se 0 217 log unit for the test set and r2 of 0 926 and se of 0 169 log unit for the total dataset moreover it was found that dispersive force h bond basicity molecular volume and electrostatic interaction of anion significantly contribute to the model developed based on the entire dataset here dispersive and hydrophobic interactions proportional to the magnitude of molecular size are main attractive forces while the rest cases are repulsive in addition it was found that the adsorption property of the surface of c vulgaris differs from those of gram negative bacteria escherichia coli and dissolved organic matters in an aquatic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption prediction ionic pharmaceuticals lfer modeling micropollutants qsar 1 introduction pharmaceutical waste is an increasing environmental issue because generally pharmaceuticals are hardly treatable in wastewater treatment plant clara et al 2005 tijani et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 and they are released to the environments via several routes the released chemicals can play a role as toxicants to microorganisms and can become a threat to human and animals in fact many studies have reported that some pharmaceuticals have toxicity vasquez et al 2014 bruce et al 2010 khan and nicell 2015 leung et al 2013 and endocrine disrupting effects catanese et al 2015 kiyama and wada kiyama 2015 petrie et al 2015 therefore for safe treatment and protection against risk it is essential to understand the environmental properties of pharmaceutical waste however since new pharmaceuticals have been continuously introduced achieving the environmental properties of pharmaceuticals is a considerable challenge for environmental scientists and engineers because experimental determination is time and material consuming and labor intensive therefore the development of a solid and robust prediction model is essential among the environmental properties the adsorption behaviors of chemicals in environmental media are important to understand because the adsorption properties affect their environmental properties girardi et al 2011 in fact if such micropollutants are released into nature they can be adsorbed on the surface of environmental media such as bacteria soil and microalgae etc and depending on the adsorption of the environmental phases the environmental properties of the chemicals can be determined for example if micropollutants are adsorbed in soil and or sediment their transport might change depending on the movement of soil and sediment moreover the adsorption of chemicals on microalgae leads to chemical concentration and the chemicals are then supplied to higher organisms e g zooplankton and fish thus possibly increasing the bioconcentration factor among the interactions between chemicals and environmental media adsorption on microalgae is important because microalgae are ubiquitous in surface and sea water and have a high proportional surface area of 0 98 2 2 m2 mg of dried cells khoshmanesh et al 1997 which is two or three times larger than that of soil organic matter i e 0 56 0 80 m2 mg chiou et al 1990 moreover microalgae can be also used to remove emerging contaminants in wastewater treatment e g matamoros et al 2016 escapa et al 2017 villar navarro et al 2018 however the adsorption property has not be sufficiently investigated several groups have characterized the adsorptive interactions between environmental phases and micropollutants as summarized in table 1 for the study they were experimentally measured the adsorptive interaction with several environmental phases e g dissolved organic matters soils and soil like sorbents based on two different methods batch experiment and chromatography analysis the previous studies also presented several prediction models based on the linear free energy relationship lfer model pool and pool 1999 and nguyen et al 2005 studied the adsorption of chemicals onto soil using a chromatographic system and data collection respectively similarly endo and schmidt 2006 endo et al 2008 2009 and bronner and goss 2011 examined the sorption properties of the soil like materials i e coal tar and peat niederder et al 2006 2007 and neale et al 2012 estimated partition behaviours of chemicals onto humic or fulvic acids recently our group presented sorption properties between ionic and neutral pharmaceuticals and gram negative bacteria escherichia coli cho et al 2017 however in most of the previous works only neutral chemicals were studied which indicates that ionic compounds cannot be applied to their prediction models actually this constitutes a significantly large application gap because around 70 of chemicals are ionized in the natural ph range bryan and huggett 2012 in this study we therefore present the adsorptive interactions of neutral and ionic micropollutants on microalgae and develop an accurate prediction model for this study we selected the chemicals that currently are considered environmentally problematic i e pharmaceuticals and environmental hormones firstly the adsorption affinities between them were experimentally measured by isotherm experiments and the measured values were then compared with previous presented models for predicting octanol water partitioning coefficients and adsorption onto dissolved organic matters and escherichia coli moreover we developed a new lfer model subsequently the adsorption mechanisms between pharmaceuticals and microalgae were explained based on the developed model and experimental results 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent preparation the microalgae chlorella vulgaris used were cultivated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks including slightly modified ohm medium fabragas et al 2000 comprising of in g l kno3 0 41 na2hpo4 0 03

15 for light source cool white fluorescent lights approximately 50 μmol m 2 s 1 were used in a shacking incubator at 25 1 c after cultivation the cells were washed with distilled di water more than five times and then were freeze dried for the following adsorption tests because the freeze drying method can be used to preserve cell constituents without rupturing the cell wall becker 1994 2 2 chemicals pharmaceuticals environmental hormones and other chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich seoul korea the selected chemicals have structural diversities as shown by their lfer descriptors e 0 73 to 2 55 s 0 87 to 7 7 a 0 to 4 33 b 0 to 4 38 v 0 89 to 3 81 j 0 to 4 16 j 0 188 to 2 99 their stock solution was prepared with distilled water and kept in a refrigerator 4 c to avoid light decomposition acetonitrile and phosphate buffer were purchased from honeywell burdick jackson mi usa and sigma aldrich ltd seoul korea respectively 2 3 isotherm experiment calculation of adsorption affinity and kinetic experiment while the isotherm experiments for each of the target compounds were performed at a low level of concentration the concentration was dependent on water solubility and the linearity of the isotherm the isotherm experiments were performed within the concentration of 2 5 100 μm first 0 01 g of biomass was brought into contact with 30 ml solutions with different concentrations of compounds in 50 ml conical tube corning usa the biomass solution was then agitated in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm for 24 h at 25 1 c in control experiment without microalgae it was observed that there is no hydrolysis or adsorption effect of the tested chemicals during the incubation the ph was carefully adjusted at 6 5 0 2 by using 0 01 0 1 and 1 m hcl and naoh solution which were used to determine the actual natural ph value in an environment at ph 6 5 most pharmaceuticals were totally ionized as anionic or cationic forms since the pka values of cationic pharmaceuticals are higher than 8 7 and those of anionic pharmaceuticals are lower than 4 5 see table 2 the equilibrium concentration was calculated using the following mass balance pehlivan et al 2012 below q e c i c e v s o l m where q e is equilibrium concentration μmol g and c i and c e means initial and final concentrations μmol l respectively v sol is the working volume l and m is the mass of adsorbent g here the adsorption affinity was estimated by linear fitting because the isotherm data points were nearly linear at trace level of concentration hörsing et al 2011 zeng et al 2009 except for the verapamil all isotherm results were analyzed using more than 3 data points the experiments were duplicated in order to determine when adsorption equilibrium was reached kinetic experiments of three compounds i e diphenhydramine amitriptyline and clomipramine were performed as shown in fig s1 when 0 033 g of c vulgaris were brought into contact with 50 μm of the compounds the sorption equilibrium states were attained within 1 h the detailed explanation is given in supporting information 2 4 analytical condition for quantitative analysis of the chemicals a high performance liquid chromatography hplc with dual pump uv detector and temperature controllable column incubator was applied for that 1 ml of sample was taken from the batch and filtered using 0 2 μm of syringe filter based on cellulose acetate advantec japan the column in the stationary phase was c18 150 mm 4 6 mm ymc co ltd japan the injected volume of the sample was 10 μl most chemicals were detected at 211 nm using an ultraviolet uv detector except for tetraphenylborate which was detected at 265 nm the mobile phase condition was dependent on the chemical species but most of the chemicals i e amitriptyline chlorpromazine clomipramine desipramine diphenhydramine propafenone verapamil thioridazine caffeine imipramine promethazine doxepin nortriptyline quinidine carbamazepine 2 phenylethanol acetophenone benzyl alcohol bisphenol a diethyl phthalate ibuprofen diclofenac 1 naphthol hydrocortisone nitrobenzene naproxen 3 4 dichlorobenzoate and flurbiprofen were detected at isocratic condition with 0 4 ml min of acetonitrile and 0 4 ml min of buffer solution with 30 mm phosphate buffer nah2po4 solution the remaining cases were as follows a mixture of 0 3 ml min acetonitrile acn and 0 5 ml min buffer for propranolol and a mixture of 1 0 ml min and 0 5 ml min for tetraphenylborate 2 5 model development for the development of the prediction model linear free energy relationship lfer as one of classical quantitative structure relationship concepts can be used because it has well defined descriptors and can support highly accurate predictability abraham and acree 2016 moreover the developed model can help us interpret the chemical meanings of sorbent sorbate interactions on a molecular basis the lfer model abraham and acree 2016 is shown below 1 log k d ee ss aa bb vv j j j j c where the dependent variable log k d is the adsorptive interaction i e adsorption affinity between sorbents and the surface of c vulgaris the capital letters refer to the lfer descriptors of the solute as follows e excess molar refraction cm3 mol 1 10 s dipolarity polarisability dimensionless a and b hydrogen bonding acidity dimensionless and hydrogen bonding basicity dimensionless v mcgowan volume cm3 mol 1 100 and j and j ionic interactions of cations and anions small letters e s a b v j and j are system dependent parameters the system parameters can be determined by multiple linear regression analysis this model was successfully applied for characterizing some adsorbents i e ion exchange resins jadbabaei and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2014 which can be used for the removal of anionic and cationic micropollutants 2 6 statistical analysis to determine the system parameters of eq 1 and their statistical variables multiple linear regressions were performed using spss 12 0k windows software for the fitting of figures and data calculation sigma plot version 10 0 was used in order to check the prediction acceptability the xternal validationplus tool roy et al 2016 developed by prof kunal roy and his colleagues was applied the estimation of which involves checking the mean absolute error mae based criteria of 95 of the dataset after removing 5 high residuals the criteria of prediction roy et al 2016 can be considered as follows i good level mae 0 1 training set range and mae 3 η standard deviation of the absolute error values of test set 0 2 training set range ii moderate level it was considered when the predictions are not under either of the two conditions for bad prediction iii bad level mae 0 15 training set range or mae 3 η 0 25 training set range mae and η calculation can be performed using the following equations mae mean absolute error 1 n y o b s y p r e d η standard deviation y obs y pred 2 n where yobs and ypred represent the measured and predicted log k d values respectively the method for the mae estimation is well explained on the homepage of prof roy http dtclab webs com software tools and http teqip jdvu ac in qsar tools roy et al 2016 2 7 previous lfer models for predicting environmental properties in order to find some correlative environmental properties the experimentally measured log k d values were correlated with log p octanol water partitioning coefficient abraham and acree 2010c log k oc organic matter water partition coefficient nguyen et al 2005 and log k d escherichia coli water partitioning coefficient cho et al 2017 the environmental properties were calculated based on previous models i e eq 2 4 2 log p dimensionless 0 088 0 562 e 1 054 s 0 034 a 3 460 b 3 814 v 3 023 j 2

sorbate has two main properties adsorption affinity and adsorption capacity adsorption affinity literally refers to the adsorption affinity between a chemical and an adsorbent at low concentration while adsorption capacity refers to the adsorption ability of adsorbents for a certain sorbate since the concentration of micropollutants present in aquatic environments is generally at a trace level only the adsorption affinity between c vulgaris and the chemicals was estimated at low concentration range i e 2 5 100 μm moreover an experimental ph value was fixed at 6 5 which is used to reflect the neutral ph value since we used hcl and naoh solutions for adjusting the ph value we needed to check the salt effect whereby we selected three compounds including a neutral compound caffeine an anion diclofenac and a cation desipramine and performed one point check depending on the different nacl concentrations from 0 to 60 μm the result showed that the three compounds have similar uptake values as shown in fig s2 here the isotherm value was estimated by calculating the slope value based on a linear fitting between the adsorption uptake μmol g and the equilibrium concentration μmol l some example fittings are shown in fig 1 the estimated adsorption affinity values in the log unit ranged from 1 04 to 1 59 in general it was shown that among the chemical species tested the cationic chemicals have high adsorption affinity values while anionic chemicals have low adsorption affinity values especially anions with a small molecular structure showed negligible adsorption affinity on c vulgaris while large molecular structures with negative charge were slightly adsorbed onto the surface of c vulgaris although their adsorption was at a low level among the estimated values except for tetraphenylborate in the anionic form in cationic compounds thioridazine has the highest adsorption affinity value in the log unit which is 1 59 3 2 correlation between adsorption affinity and physicochemical properties of chemicals to investigate the similarity of previous prediction models with the adsorption affinities of micropollutants on the surface of c vulgaris log k d we compared the measured log k d values with the octanol water partitioning coefficient log p the adsorption affinity of chemicals on bacteria and dissolved organic matters first we correlated between the log k d and log p values since it is known that log p has a high correlation with the environmental properties of chemicals here for comparison we used calculated log p values based on eq 2 because the log p values of most of the ionic compounds have not yet been measured the comparison between log k d and log p fig 2 shows that generally the log p values have a poor relationship with the log k d values of the entire dataset whose r2 value was 0 046 however when correlating log p values with only the log k d of neutral compounds a remarkable correlation was shown at r2 of 0 726 this indicates that while the hydrophobicity of neutral compounds strongly contributes to the correlation in the case of ions their hydrophobicity may not be the main factor for explaining the adsorption property because ions are hydrophilic substances due to their charges next the log k d values were compared with partitioning behaviors log k oc which were determined based on the partitioning coefficient of chemicals between water and organic matters in sediments and soil nguyen et al 2005 in comparison since the model was developed based on the use of neutral compounds the ionic terms of cations and anions were not considered and the combination of only five lfer descriptors e s a b and v were used the correlation between the log k oc calculated by eq 3 and the measured log k d of chemicals given in table 2 shows a remarkable relationship whose r2 is 0 59 see fitting 1 in fig 3 however this relationship may not be due to some relationship but to the difference among the values in anionic neutral and cationic compounds meanwhile when individually considering cationic compounds or neutral compounds they have remarkable correlations within r2 of 0 62 and 0 66 respectively and their equations are y 0 589x 2 49 and y 0 518x 1 131 respectively see fitting 2 and 3 in fig 3 it is shown that the fittings have similar slope values 0 589 vs 0 518 yet different y axis values this might be due to the missing cationic term j in eq 3 in addition anions were not discussed because the number of datasets was insufficient next the lfer model previously developed by our group cho et al 2017 i e eq 4 for predicting the adsorptive interaction between e coli and chemicals was applied to correlate the log k d values onto c vulgaris the previous model was developed based on only cationic and neutral compounds because the surface of e coli has no adsorptive interaction with anions in correlations between the measured log k d on c vulgaris and the calculated log k d by eq 4 it was observed that both properties have a relationship at r2 of 0 513 the main reason for the correlation may be the difference of log k d values according to the chemical species i e anionic neutral and cationic compounds meanwhile in correlations of cations or neutral compounds with the calculated log k d values e coli both species have several remarkable relationships at r2 of 0 84 and 0 51 respectively fig 4 in addition the anion species shows a poor correlation 3 3 development of a new lfer model for predicting log k d as explained above the previous prediction models show several good agreements for cations and or neutral compounds however overall the prediction models cannot predict the log k d values on c vulgaris thus to achieve better predictability a new prediction model should be developed therefore we attempted to directly correlate the log k d values of the targeted micropollutants on c vulgaris with their corresponding lfer descriptors for the modelling the experimentally obtained dataset was randomly divided into a training set and a test set the numbers of which are 20 and 10 respectively firstly the lfer descriptors of chemicals in the training set and their measured log k d values were used for model development to determine the system parameters e s a b v j and j multiple linear regression was performed and the test set and the total data set were then used to validate the predictability of the developed model this prediction study was repeated ten times the estimated system parameters and the statistical results of the models are given in table 3 as shown in table 3 the obtained results depended on the selected data set as seen in table 3 all models have high predictabilities within r2 of 0 936 0 970 for each training set among these models model 7 has the highest correlation for its training set which was estimated based on the r2 value the r2 value and standard error se are 0 970 and 0 150 log unit respectively the predictabilities for the corresponding test set and total data seems also acceptable which are r2 of 0 847 and se of 0 194 log unit and r2 of 0 946 and se of 0 156 log unit respectively especially the validation result for total data was the best among the ten models for further verification of the acceptability of the model we employed the mae based validation method by roy et al 2016 because the correlation based estimation can be misleading the criteria of the mae based estimation are explained in the materials and methods section the validation can be simply performed by attaching the measured and calculated values to an excel sheet and adding the training set response mean and range for a detailed explanation see roy et al 2016 surprisingly the validation results shown in table 4 indicated that model 7 was not selected as the best prediction model the program estimated it as moderate because the data range of the selected training set for model 7 is narrow i e 2 628 maximum value minimum value the mae 3 standard deviation value i e 0 584 increases to more than 0 2 of the training set range i e 0 525 and mae value i e 0 151 therefore the predictability level is moderate the statistical results according to the mae based criteria of the 10 models are given in table 4 meanwhile the validation software suggested seven models classified as good which are models 2 5 and 8 10 which also have high predictabilities for the training set test set and total data set here among the selected models model 8 has the highest predictability r2 and se are 0 941 and 0 163 log unit respectively to understand the adsorptive mechanism between the neutral and ionic micropollutants and c vulgaris we re estimated the system parameters and statistical results using the total dataset without dividing into the training set and test set this reflected a greater range of chemical structures of the model by performing multiple linear regression the results could then be obtained as follows 5 log k d c vulgaris 1 149 0 876 e 0 514 s 0 150 a 1 764 b 1 465 v 0 419 j 1 786 j r2 0 950 se 0 170 log unit r2 adj 0 934 n 30 f 59 2 where r2 was 0 950 and the standard error was 0 170 log units here except h bonding donor term all of the lfer descriptors used for modeling have lower probability p values than 0 05 indicating the used descriptors are within 95 of a confidential level the p value of term a was 0 06 which is almost within the acceptable range moreover the adjusted r2 value r2 adj i e 0 934 has a similar r2 value proving that the combination of the selected descriptors is reasonable the fitting between the predicted and measured log k d values is given in fig 5 based on eq 5 the adsorption phenomena may be explained first system parameters for excess molar refraction molecular volume and anionic interaction have a positive sign while those of dipolarity polarizability hydrogen bonding acidity and basicity and cationic interaction terms are negative signs this indicates that with an increase in the magnitude of the former three terms i e e v j the adsorptive affinity will increase while the latter s will have an opposite trend however the opposite trend was shown when correlating between the single j with log k d values it has a negative sign for its system parameter the difference may be because the j term acts as complementary role to the h bonding basicity term since both terms are internally correlated at r2 of 0 885 therefore it should be understood that the anionic term has a negative correlation with the measured log k d values among the seven terms h bond basicity b is the highest correlated descriptor the correlation factor of which was 0 388 next adding the induced dipole term e to b helps to enhance the prediction of the log k d value to r2 of 0 544 the addition of dipolarity polarizability s to the combination of b and e slightly increases the predictability with r2 of 0 581 next the further addition of ionic interaction terms for the anion and molecular volume v increases its prediction accuracy to r2 of 0 893 by addressing the j term the accuracy of the prediction model increased the r2 of which was 0 941 finally whole descriptors with an inclusion of h bonding acidity could achieve the highest prediction model with r2 of 0 950 4 conclusion in this study we showed that neutral and ionic micropollutants can have an adsorptive interaction with the surface of microalgae c vulgaris and developed its prediction model based on the linear free energy relationship to investigate the adsorptive interaction adsorption affinities between 30 micropollutants including several pharmaceuticals in neutral or ionic forms and microalgae chlorella vulgaris were experimentally determined their values were correlated with several different properties i e octanol water partitioning coefficient log p and adsorption properties in water organic matters and water bacteria in comparison it was clearly observed that the overall log k d on c vulgaris could not be well explained by previous prediction models therefore we developed new lfer models using training sets and test sets and was validated with the mae based criteria among these models model 8 in table 3 was suggested as superior which has r2 0 953 and se 0 176 log unit for training set it could predict its corresponding test set in r2 of 0 921 and se of 0 210 moreover when applying model 8 for predicting the total dataset i e 30 chemicals its predictability r2 0 941 and se 0 163 log unit is very similar to the result r2 0 950 and se 0 170 log unit developed using the entire dataset of eq 5 based on the developed model the adsorptive mechanisms were interpreted such that there were various important molecular interaction potentials contributing to the prediction model including dispersive force dipolarity polarizability h bond basicity molecular volume and electrostatic interaction of anion here dispersive force and molecular volume play the role of attractive forces while h bonding basicity dipolarity polarizability and h bonding forces have an opposite role although the prediction model showed that the anionic term acts as an attractive force it actually has a repulsive interaction because j term acted as a complementary parameter to the h bonding basicity term in the determination of the system parameters of eq 5 therefore it was

five times and then were freeze dried for the following adsorption tests because the freeze drying method can be used to preserve cell constituents without rupturing the cell wall becker 1994 2 2 chemicals pharmaceuticals environmental hormones and other chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich seoul korea the selected chemicals have structural diversities as shown by their lfer descriptors

decomposition acetonitrile and phosphate buffer were purchased from honeywell burdick jackson mi usa and sigma aldrich ltd seoul korea respectively 2 3 isotherm experiment calculation of adsorption affinity and kinetic experiment while the isotherm experiments for each of the target compounds were performed at a low level of concentration the concentration was dependent on water solubility and the linearity of the isotherm the isotherm experiments were performed within the concentration of 2 5 100 μm first 0 01 g of biomass was brought into contact with 30 ml solutions with different concentrations of compounds in 50 ml conical tube corning usa the biomass solution was then agitated in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm for 24 h at 25 1 c in control experiment without microalgae it was observed that there is no hydrolysis or adsorption effect of the tested chemicals during the incubation the ph was carefully adjusted at 6 5 0 2 by using 0 01 0 1 and 1 m hcl and naoh solution which were used to determine the actual natural ph value in an environment at ph 6 5 most pharmaceuticals were totally ionized as anionic or cationic forms since the pka values of cationic pharmaceuticals are higher than 8 7 and those of anionic pharmaceuticals are lower than 4 5 see table 2 the equilibrium concentration was calculated using the following mass balance pehlivan et al 2012 below q e c i c e v s o l m where q e is equilibrium concentration μmol g and c i and c e means initial and final concentrations μmol l respectively v sol is the working volume l and m is the mass of adsorbent g here the adsorption affinity was estimated by linear fitting because the isotherm data points were nearly linear at trace level of concentration hörsing et al 2011 zeng et al 2009 except for the verapamil all isotherm results were analyzed using more than 3 data points the experiments were duplicated in order to determine when adsorption equilibrium was reached kinetic experiments of three compounds i e diphenhydramine amitriptyline and clomipramine were performed as shown in fig s1 when 0 033 g of c vulgaris were brought into contact with 50 μm of the compounds the sorption equilibrium states were attained within 1 h the detailed explanation is given in supporting information 2 4 analytical condition for quantitative analysis of the chemicals a high performance

filter based on cellulose acetate advantec japan the column in the stationary phase was c18 150 mm 4 6 mm ymc co ltd japan the injected volume of the sample was 10 μl most chemicals were detected at 211 nm using an ultraviolet uv detector except for tetraphenylborate which was detected at 265 nm the mobile phase condition was dependent on the chemical species but most of the chemicals i e amitriptyline chlorpromazine clomipramine desipramine diphenhydramine propafenone verapamil thioridazine caffeine imipramine promethazine doxepin nortriptyline quinidine carbamazepine 2 phenylethanol acetophenone benzyl alcohol bisphenol a diethyl phthalate ibuprofen diclofenac 1 naphthol hydrocortisone nitrobenzene naproxen 3 4 dichlorobenzoate and flurbiprofen were detected at isocratic

and 0 5 ml min buffer for propranolol and a mixture of 1 0 ml min and 0 5 ml min for tetraphenylborate 2 5 model development for the development of the prediction model linear free energy relationship lfer as one of classical quantitative structure relationship concepts can be used because it has well defined descriptors and can support highly accurate predictability abraham and acree 2016 moreover the developed model can help us interpret the chemical meanings of sorbent sorbate interactions on a molecular basis the lfer model abraham and acree 2016 is shown below 1 log k d ee ss aa bb vv j j j

volume cm3 mol 1 100 and j and j ionic interactions of cations and anions small letters e s a b v j and j are system dependent parameters the system parameters can be determined by multiple linear regression analysis this model was successfully applied for characterizing some adsorbents i e ion exchange resins jadbabaei and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2014 which can be used for the removal of anionic and cationic micropollutants 2 6 statistical analysis to determine the system parameters of eq 1 and their statistical variables multiple linear regressions were performed using spss 12 0k windows software for the fitting of figures and data calculation sigma plot version 10 0 was used in order to check the prediction acceptability the xternal validationplus tool roy et al 2016 developed by prof kunal roy and his colleagues was applied the estimation of which involves checking the mean absolute error mae based criteria of 95 of the dataset after removing 5 high residuals the criteria of prediction roy et al 2016 can be considered as follows i good level mae 0 1 training set range and mae 3 η standard deviation of the absolute error values of test set 0 2 training set

tools roy et al 2016 2 7 previous lfer models for predicting environmental properties in order to find some correlative environmental properties the experimentally measured log k d values were correlated with log p octanol water partitioning coefficient abraham and acree 2010c log k oc organic matter water partition coefficient nguyen et al 2005 and log k d escherichia coli water

sorbate has two main properties adsorption affinity and adsorption capacity adsorption affinity literally refers to the adsorption affinity between a chemical and an adsorbent at low concentration while adsorption capacity refers to the adsorption ability of adsorbents for a certain sorbate since the concentration of micropollutants present in aquatic environments is generally at a trace level only the adsorption affinity between c vulgaris and the chemicals was estimated at low concentration range i e 2 5 100 μm moreover an experimental ph value was fixed at 6 5 which is used to reflect the neutral ph value since we used hcl and naoh solutions for adjusting the ph value we needed to check the salt effect whereby we selected three compounds including a neutral compound caffeine an anion diclofenac and a cation desipramine and performed one point check depending on the different nacl concentrations from 0 to 60 μm the result showed that the three compounds have similar uptake values as shown in fig s2 here the isotherm value was estimated by calculating the slope value based on a linear fitting between the adsorption uptake μmol g and the equilibrium concentration μmol l some example fittings are shown in fig 1 the estimated adsorption affinity values in the log unit ranged from 1 04 to 1 59 in general it was shown that among the chemical species tested the cationic chemicals have high adsorption affinity values while anionic chemicals have low adsorption affinity values especially anions with a small molecular structure showed negligible adsorption affinity on c vulgaris while large molecular structures with negative charge were slightly adsorbed onto the surface of c vulgaris although their adsorption was at a low level among the estimated values except for tetraphenylborate in the anionic form in cationic compounds thioridazine has the highest adsorption affinity value in the log unit which is 1 59 3 2 correlation between adsorption affinity and physicochemical properties of chemicals to investigate the similarity of previous prediction models with the adsorption affinities of micropollutants on the surface of c vulgaris log k d we compared the measured log k d values with the octanol water partitioning coefficient log p the adsorption affinity of chemicals on bacteria and dissolved organic matters first we correlated between the log k d and log p values since it is known that log p has a high correlation with the environmental properties of chemicals here for comparison we used calculated log p values based on eq 2 because the log p values of most of the ionic compounds have not yet been measured the comparison between log k d and log p fig 2 shows that generally the log p values have a poor relationship with the log k d values of the entire dataset whose r2 value was 0 046 however when correlating log p values with only the log k d of neutral compounds a remarkable correlation was shown at r2 of 0 726 this indicates that while the hydrophobicity of neutral compounds strongly contributes to the correlation in the case of ions their hydrophobicity may not be the main factor for explaining the adsorption property because ions are hydrophilic substances due to their charges next the log k d values were compared with partitioning behaviors log k oc which were determined based on the partitioning coefficient of chemicals between water and organic matters in sediments and soil nguyen et al 2005 in comparison since the model was developed based on the use of neutral compounds the ionic terms of cations and anions were not considered and the combination of only five lfer descriptors e s a b and v were used the correlation between the log k oc calculated by eq 3 and the measured log k d of chemicals given in table 2 shows a remarkable relationship whose r2 is 0 59 see fitting 1 in fig 3 however this relationship may not be due to some relationship but to the difference among the values in anionic neutral and cationic compounds meanwhile when individually considering cationic compounds or neutral compounds they have remarkable correlations within r2 of 0 62 and 0 66 respectively and their equations are y 0 589x 2 49 and y 0 518x 1 131 respectively see fitting 2 and 3 in fig 3 it is shown that the fittings have similar slope values 0 589 vs 0 518 yet different y axis values this might be due to the missing cationic term j in eq 3 in addition anions were not discussed because the number of datasets was insufficient next the lfer model previously developed by our group cho et al 2017 i e eq 4 for predicting the adsorptive interaction between e coli and chemicals was applied to correlate the log k d values onto c vulgaris the previous model was developed based on only cationic and neutral compounds because the surface of e coli has no adsorptive interaction with anions in correlations between the measured log k d on c vulgaris and the calculated log k d by eq 4 it was observed that both properties have a relationship at r2 of 0 513 the main reason for the correlation may be the difference of log k d values according to the chemical species i e anionic neutral and cationic compounds meanwhile in correlations of cations or neutral compounds with the calculated log k d values e coli both species have several remarkable relationships at r2 of 0 84 and 0 51 respectively fig 4 in addition the anion species shows a poor correlation 3 3 development of a new lfer model for predicting log k d as explained above the previous prediction models show several good agreements for cations and or neutral compounds however overall the prediction models cannot predict the log k d values on c vulgaris thus to achieve better predictability a new prediction model should be developed therefore we attempted to directly correlate the log k d values of the targeted micropollutants on c vulgaris with their corresponding lfer descriptors for the modelling the experimentally obtained dataset was randomly divided into a training set and a test set the numbers of which are 20 and 10 respectively firstly the lfer descriptors of chemicals in the training set and their measured log k d values were used for model development to determine the system parameters e s a b v j and j multiple linear regression was performed and the test set and the total data set were then used to validate the predictability of the developed model this prediction study was repeated ten times the estimated system parameters and the statistical results of the models are given in table 3 as shown in table 3 the obtained results depended on the selected data set as seen in table 3 all models have high predictabilities within r2 of 0 936 0 970 for each training set among these models model 7 has the highest correlation for its training set which was estimated based on the r2 value the r2 value and standard error se are 0 970 and 0 150 log unit respectively the predictabilities for the corresponding test set and total data seems also acceptable which are r2 of 0 847 and se of 0 194 log unit and r2 of 0 946 and se of 0 156 log unit respectively especially the validation result for total data was the best among the ten models for further verification of the acceptability of the model we employed the mae based validation method by roy et al 2016 because the correlation based estimation can be misleading the criteria of the mae based estimation are explained in the materials and methods section the validation can be simply performed by attaching the measured and calculated values to an excel sheet and adding the training set response mean and range for a detailed explanation see roy et al 2016 surprisingly the validation results shown in table 4 indicated that model 7 was not selected as the best prediction model the program estimated it as moderate because the data range of the selected training set for model 7 is narrow i e 2 628 maximum value minimum value the mae 3 standard deviation value i e 0 584 increases to more than 0 2 of the training set range i e 0 525 and mae value i e 0 151 therefore the predictability level is moderate the statistical results according to the mae based criteria of the 10 models are given in table 4 meanwhile the validation software suggested seven models classified as good which are models 2 5 and 8 10 which also have high predictabilities for the training set test set and total data set here among the selected models model 8 has the highest predictability r2 and se are 0 941 and 0 163 log unit respectively to understand the adsorptive mechanism between the neutral and ionic micropollutants and c vulgaris we re estimated the system parameters and statistical results using the total dataset without dividing into the training set and test set this reflected a greater range of chemical structures of the model by performing multiple linear regression the results could then be obtained as follows 5 log k d c vulgaris 1 149 0 876 e 0 514 s 0 150 a 1 764 b 1 465 v 0 419 j 1 786 j r2 0 950 se 0 170 log unit r2 adj 0 934 n 30 f 59 2 where r2 was 0 950 and the standard error was 0 170 log units here except h bonding donor term all of the lfer descriptors used for modeling have lower probability p values than 0 05 indicating the used descriptors are within 95 of a confidential level the p value of term a was 0 06 which is almost within the acceptable range moreover the adjusted r2 value r2 adj i e 0 934 has a similar r2 value proving that the combination of the selected descriptors is reasonable the fitting between the predicted and measured log k d values is given in fig 5 based on eq 5 the adsorption phenomena may be explained first system parameters for excess molar refraction molecular volume and anionic interaction have a positive sign while those of dipolarity polarizability hydrogen bonding acidity and basicity and cationic interaction terms are negative signs this indicates that with an increase in the magnitude of the former three terms i e e v j the adsorptive affinity will increase while the latter s will have an opposite trend however the opposite trend was shown when correlating between the single j with log k d values it has a negative sign for its system parameter the difference may be because the j term acts as complementary role to the h bonding basicity term since both terms are internally correlated at r2 of 0 885 therefore it should be understood that the anionic term has a negative correlation with the measured log k d values among the seven terms h bond basicity b is the highest correlated descriptor the correlation factor of which was 0 388 next adding the induced dipole term e to b helps to enhance the prediction of the log k d value to r2 of 0 544 the addition of dipolarity polarizability s to the combination of b and e slightly increases the predictability with r2 of 0 581 next the further addition of ionic interaction terms for the anion and molecular volume v increases its prediction accuracy to r2 of 0 893 by addressing the j term the accuracy of the prediction model increased the r2 of which was 0 941 finally whole descriptors with an inclusion of h bonding acidity could achieve the highest prediction model with r2 of 0 950 4 conclusion in this study we showed that neutral and ionic micropollutants can have an adsorptive interaction with the surface of microalgae c vulgaris and developed its prediction model based on the linear free energy relationship to investigate the adsorptive interaction adsorption affinities between 30 micropollutants including several pharmaceuticals in neutral or ionic forms and microalgae chlorella vulgaris were experimentally determined their values were correlated with several different properties i e octanol water partitioning coefficient log p and adsorption properties in water organic matters and water bacteria in comparison it was clearly observed that the overall log k d on c vulgaris could not be well explained by previous prediction models therefore we developed new lfer models using training sets and test sets and was validated with the mae based criteria among these models model 8 in table 3 was suggested as superior which has r2 0 953 and se 0 176 log unit for training set it could predict its corresponding test set in r2 of 0 921 and se of 0 210 moreover when applying model 8 for predicting the total dataset i e 30 chemicals its predictability r2 0 941 and se 0 163 log unit is very similar to the result r2 0 950 and se 0 170 log unit developed using the entire dataset of eq 5 based on the developed model the adsorptive mechanisms were interpreted such that there were various important molecular interaction potentials contributing to the prediction model including dispersive force dipolarity polarizability h bond basicity molecular volume and electrostatic interaction of anion here dispersive force and molecular volume play the role of attractive forces while h bonding basicity dipolarity polarizability and h bonding forces have an opposite role although the prediction model showed that the anionic term acts as an attractive force it actually has a repulsive interaction because j term acted as a complementary parameter to the h bonding basicity term in the determination of the system parameters of eq 5 therefore it was

19071,this study evaluated attachment of a 30 nm nanoparticle to and detachment from fractal surfaces by calculating derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energies in three dimensional space using the surface element integration technique the fractal surfaces were generated using the weierstass mandelbrot function with varying values of fractal dimension d 2 3 d 2 7 and fractal roughness g 0 000136 g 0 136 results show that maximum energy barrier is reduced at peak areas of a fractal surface and hence attachment in primary minima is favored some nanoparticles attached in primary minima at the peak areas can be detached by decreasing ionic strength is due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance at low iss while the attachment in primary minima at valley areas is irreversible to is reduction the attachment is inhibited due to enhanced maximum energy barrier at these areas a nonmonotonic variation of attachment efficiency in primary minimum aepm with is is present at high fractal dimension d 2 4 or low fractal roughness g 0 00136 whereas the aepm decreases monotonically with decreasing is at low fractal dimension d 2 4 or high fractal roughness g 0 00136 the aepm decreases monotonically with increasing d or decreasing g at iss from 1 mm to 200 mm the decrease of aepm with d or g is much slower at 10 mm compared to other iss these theoretical findings can explain various experimental observations in the literature and can have important utility to development of water filtration techniques in engineered systems and to assessment of environmental risks of nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanoparticle fractal surface interaction energy attachment detachment 1 introduction transport of hazardous particles e g pathogenic viruses bacteria and protozoa and toxic nanomaterials in porous media such as soil has been extensively investigated during the past two decades due to intense interest in preventing groundwater pollution and developing water and wastewater filtration technologies ryan and elimelech 1996 de jonge et al 2004 batley et al 2013 attachment on and detachment from collector surfaces are two primary processes that inhibit and facilitate particle transport in porous media respectively bradford and torkzaban 2015 molnar et al 2015 whether particles attach to or detach from collector surfaces is dependent on the energy balance between adhesive energy and brownian diffusion and or the torque balance between adhesive torque and hydrodynamic torque bergendahl and grasso 2003 pazmino et al 2014a 2014b bradford et al 2017 both energy and torque balance analysis require accurate determination of the adhesive force energy that arises due to colloidal interactions between particles and surfaces the colloidal interactions include van der waals vdw attraction electrical double layer dl interaction and short range repulsion e g hydration and steric repulsion hoek and agarwal 2006 israelachvili 2011 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory quantitatively describes the interaction energy profile as a function of separation distance between a particle and a surface ryan and elimelech 1996 when particles and collector surfaces are like charged both primary and secondary minima are present in the energy profile between which an energy barrier exists if the two surfaces are oppositely charged both secondary minimum and energy barrier disappear from the profile and only primary minimum exists the primary and secondary energy minima are considered as the locations for particle attachment grasso et al 2002 hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 in the classic dlvo theory calculation of interaction energies is based on the assumption that particle and collector surfaces are perfectly smooth in real systems surfaces of natural particles and collectors however all contain some degree of physical nonuniformity at small scales shellenberger and logan 2002 the influence of surface roughness has been frequently taken as the cause of discrepancies between the theoretical prediction and experimental observations of particle deposition fischer et al 2014 jin et al 2015 2017 rasmuson et al 2017 theoretical studies huang et al 2010 bradford and torkzaban 2015 bendersky et al 2015 have shown that the nanoscale protruding asperities can increase particle attachment at primary minima by reducing energy barrier under the unfavorable conditions however the favorably attached particles are readily to be detached by perturbation of solution chemistry and or hydrodynamics because the depths of the primary minima are also decreased by nanoscale protruding asperities shen et al 2012 2014 such reduction of primary minimum depth by nanoscale protruding asperities can also decrease particle attachment at primary minima under favorable conditions rasmuson et al 2017 while various mechanisms controlling interactions of particles with rough surfaces have been elucidated as shown above the aforementioned theoretical results were obtained by modeling the rough surfaces as smooth surfaces carrying geometrically regular asperities e g pillars hemispheres and cones this technique is capable of characterizing the actual morphologies of rough surfaces to some extent by using the measured values of rough parameters e g root means square roughness and surface area difference from atomic force microscopy afm scans to constrain the distribution of asperities on the smooth surfaces hoek et al 2003 the modeling of rough surface was further improved in recent studies jaiswal et al 2009 siegismund et al 2014 by using fast fourier transform algorithm to model the roughness based on the afm measurement this technique can generate more realistic roughness profiles than using the regular geometries however all of these modeled surfaces are stationary because the rough parameter values of the surfaces i e those from afm scans are fixed which do not change with the length scale used to measure the modeled surfaces eichenlaub et al 2004 many natural and engineered surfaces such as sand and membrane surfaces are fractal and their rough parameter values change with the resolution and afm scan size yang et al 2016 cai et al 2017 a fractal surface bears the property of self affinity specifically when a part of the fractal surface is magnified the magnified image looks very similar to the original surface chen et al 2009 in addition the fractal surface possesses the properties of continuity and non differentiability mandelbrot 1983 these mathematical properties are satisfied by the weierstrass mandelbrot w m function which is a superposition of sinusoids with geometrically spaced frequencies and amplitudes that follow a power law yan and komvopoulos 1998 eichenlaub et al 2004 the w m function has been used to represent fractal surfaces for investigating influence of surface topography on engineered processes such as gaseous and fluid flow and thermal contact resistance majumdar and tien 1990 yan et al 2015 the w m function has also been employed recently to model membrane surfaces for examining the interactions between a particle and the surfaces cai et al 2017 chen et al 2017 feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 it was found that the adhesions between particles and fractal surfaces are significantly lowered compared to those of particle flat surface interactions while these studies advanced understanding about influence of fractal on colloidal interaction they only investigated the variation of interaction energy with separation distance for a particle at a single horizontal location above a fractal surface the interaction energy that acts on the particle should change with its horizontal location due to the randomness of fractal surface moreover the influence of environmental factors such as ionic strength is on interaction energies between particles and fractal surfaces has not been investigated to date the detachment of particles from fractal surfaces is also unclear this study systematically evaluated the attachment and detachment of nanoparticles nps on from fractal surfaces represented using the w m function by calculating interaction energies at various horizontal and vertical locations the surface element integration sei technique bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 siegismund et al 2014 was used for the energy calculations and the interaction energy maps were obtained to describe the variation of interaction energy in three dimensional space for various iss and fractal roughness parameter values we showed that the fractal dimension and fractal roughness are more effective for predicting attachment and detachment on from primary and secondary minima than traditional roughness parameters such as average roughness height the findings in this study can help explain various observations in the literature for example our results could explain why a nonmonotonic variation of attachment with is for nps was predicted in a theoretical study lin and wiesner 2012 through exact interaction energy calculations but not observed experimentally 2 theory 2 1 the w m function the modified two variable w m function by yan and komvopoulos 1998 was employed to generate fractal surfaces in this study 1 z x y l g l d 2 ln γ

height scaling parameter commonly termed as the fractal roughness that is independent of frequency l is the sample length γ γ 1 is a scaling variable that determines the density of the frequency spectrum m m 3 is the number of superposed ridges commonly taken as 10 n is the spatial frequency index and φ m n is the random phase the fractal roughness g and the fractal dimension d are two critical parameters that determine the fractal topography the fractal dimension determines the relative contributions of high and low frequency components in the fractal surface profile higher value of d means that high frequency components in the surface profile are more dominant than low frequency components yin and komvopoulos 2010 the fractal roughness is a height scaling parameter i e amplitude coefficient and the amplitudes of wavelengths comprising the surface profile increase with increasing the value of g both values of d and g are independent of the measurement scale for a given fractal surface the spatial index n assumes finite values in practice yan and komvopoulos 1998 the lower limit of n is commonly taken as zero and the higher limit of n is given by n int log l l

interval 0 2π to prevent the coincidence of frequencies at any point of surface profile 2 2 calculation of dlvo interaction energies fig 1 schematically illustrates the interaction between a spherical np and a fractal surface generated by the w m function detailed procedure for calculating interaction energy between a spherical particle and a rough surface using the sei technique can be referred to previous studies bhattacharjee et al 1998 duffadar and davis 2007 hoss et al 2017 briefly the cartesian coordinate system was employed for the model system in fig 1 the xy plane of the coordinate system is oriented parallel to the zero plane of the fractal surface which divides the np into two identical hemispheres the z axis passes through the np center and faces toward the fractal surface similar to the grid surface integration technique duffadar and davis 2007 both np and fractal surfaces were discretized into small area elements the differential interaction energy du between an area element on np surface ds p and the corresponding area element on fractal surface ds c is calculated as bhattacharjee et al 1998 hoss et al 2017 2 d u n 1 k 1 n 2 k 2 e h d s c where k 1 and k 2 are unit vectors directed towards the positive and negative z axis respectively n 1 and n 2 are outward units normal to the np and collector surfaces respectively e h is the differential interaction energy between element ds p and ds c and h is the local separation distance between the two elements the total interaction energy u that the np experiences is then obtained by summation of the differential interaction energy du for each ds c on the projected area of the np on the fractal surface the equation used to calculate the total interaction energy can be expressed as 3 u s c n 1 k 1 n 2 k 2 e h d s c where s c is the project area of the np on the fractal surface it is very difficult to directly determine the value of n 2 k 2 due to the randomness of the fractal surface however the term of n 2 k 2 can be eliminated from equation 3 by expressing the element ds c in terms of its projection da on the xy plane as 4 d s c 1 n 2 k 2 d a substituting equation 4 into equation 3 we obtain 5 u a n 1 k 1 n 2 k 2 n 2 k 2 e h d a when the unit normal to the fractal surface at a given point n 2 makes an obtuse or acute angle with k 2 the value of n 2 k 2 n 2 k 2 is equal to 1 or 1 hence the total interaction energy can be obtained by integrating the differential interaction energy over the projected area of the np on the xy plane without determining the value of n 2 k 2 by using n 1 k 1 z x 2 y 2 z 2 equation 5 is changed to 6 u a z x 2 y 2 z 2 e h d a the differential interaction energy between element ds and da i e e h was calculated by summing van der waals vdw

vacuum κ is the inverse debye screening length ψ p and ψ c are the surface potentials of np and collector respectively h 0 is the minimum separation distance between the np and the fractal surface 0 158 nm hoek and agarwal 2006 both np and fractal surfaces were discretized into grid elements with projection areas on the xy plane of 0 1 nm 0 1 nm a matlab program was developed to calculate dlvo interaction energies for the aforementioned interaction configuration and the calculated energies were expressed in terms of kt k is boltzmann constant and t is absolute temperature a horizontal interaction energy map denoted as hep was obtained by varying the horizontal positions x y of the np center in a rasterized manner and keeping the vertical distance between the np center and the rough surface fixed various heps were produced at different vertical distances between the np center and the rough surface vertical interaction energy maps veps were also calculated by varying the vertical positions x z or y z of the np center for a given value of y or x note that the interaction energy maps have also been calculated by varying the horizontal positions x y of a particle center and keeping the vertical distance between the np center and the zero plane of a rough surface fixed hoek et al 2003 we did not adopt this approach because physical overlaps can occur between the particles and protruding asperities on the rough surfaces a number of studies siegismund et al 2014 feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 have examined the interaction of a particle and a surface with random roughness however these studies only examined adhesion or primary minimum depth for the particle at a single location of the surface in contrast by using the heps and veps the maps of primary minimum maximum energy barrier and secondary minimum were obtained in this study as such the distribution of attachment in primary and secondary minima and subsequent detachment as well as the variation of the attachment and detachment with surface morphology e g height and curvature can be obtained for theoretical calculation of interaction energies the nps and fractal collector surfaces were assumed to be 30 nm polystyrene latex particles and quartz sand respectively which have the same properties as those used in shen et al 2007 table 1 presents the zeta potentials of the latex nps and quartz sand used to calculate the interaction energies at different solution iss a value of 1 10 20 j was taken as the hamaker constant for latex water sand system elimelech and o melia 1990a 1990b shen et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 generated fractal surfaces fig 2 presents simulated fractal surfaces using the w m function with projected surface areas on xy plane of 150 nm 150 nm for varying d values 2 3 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 and a g value of 0 0136 nm the scale bar to the right of each plot represents height in units of nm we adopted these values of d and g because for most fractal surfaces the values of d range from 2 3 to 2 7 and the values of g range from 0 000136 nm to 0 136 nm sahoo and ghosh 2007 fig 2 shows that for a given value of g larger value of d yields smoother surface this is because high frequency components are more dominant than low frequency components in the surface topography profile at larger d values chatterjee and sahoo 2014 for a given value of d larger g value results in rougher surfaces due to an increase in the amplitude of surface wavelength with g as shown in supplementary information si fig s1 the variation of surface roughness with d and g are in agreement with those in previous studies yan and komvopoulos 1998 chatterjee and sahoo 2014 yan et al 2015 3 2 attachment in primary minima fig 3 presents heps for interactions of a 30 nm np with a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and d 2 3 or d 2 6 i e the surface in fig 2a or 2d at 0 001 m at varying separation distances the scale bar to the right of each plot represents interaction energy in units of kt k is the boltmann constant t 297 13 k is absolute temperature the interaction energy is non uniformly distributed plaque like in the horizontal direction due to the random variation of surface curvature shen et al 2015 the magnitude of interaction energy is reduced and enhanced at peak and valley regions respectively as shown by the veps in si fig s2 the variation of interaction energy with surface curvature can be explained by the concept of interaction volume developed by huang et al 2010 the interaction volume is defined as the volume between the leading half of a spherical particle and a substrate surface the interaction volume is smaller for a np interacting with a peak surface than with a valley surface huang et al 2010 illustrated that smaller interaction volume between a particle and a substrate surface causes larger interaction energy because the mean plane of the surface is closer to the apex of the particle therefore the magnitude of interaction energy is reduced at peak areas whereas enhanced at valley areas the interaction energy is more uniformly distributed at larger separation distance because the influence of local variation of surface curvature on interaction energy decreases with increasing separation distance cf fig 3 the energy plaques on the maps are larger for smaller d value because of more dominance of high frequency components than low frequency components due to a similar reason increasing the value of g increases the sizes of the plaques cf fig 4 for a given fractal surface the interaction energy decreases with increasing is si fig s3 fig 5 shows maximum energy barrier maps for interactions of the 30 nm np with a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and d 2 3 or d 2 6 at different solution iss the plaques on the energy barrier maps are larger for smaller value of d i e smoother surface the value of maximum energy barrier is smaller for smaller value of d interestingly white spots are present on the heps for d 2 3 at is 10 mm these spots are located at peak areas where the maximum energy barrier is absent due to a monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance in this case the primary energy minimum between the np and a peak is eliminated by the repulsion from the rest of the surface causing the monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance shen et al 2012 inspection of fig 5 also shows that while the maximum energy barrier increases monotonically with decreasing solution is for d 2 3 a nonmonotonic variation of energy barrier with is exists for d 2 6 the energy barrier increases with decreasing is from 0 2 m and reaches maximum at 0 01 m for d 2 6 and increases with increasing is at is 0 01 m the increase of energy barrier with increasing solution is at the low is range has also been observed in lin and wiesner 2012 by exactly examining the interaction energy of a np with a planar surface similar to the sei technique lin and wiesner 2012 considered both screening effect and the osmotic pressure between the np and the planar surface in electrolyte solutions increasing is increases both screening effect and osmotic pressure which decreases and increases energy barrier respectively a net increase of the energy barrier with increasing is will occur if the enlargement of the energy barrier by the osmotic pressure exceeds the energy barrier reduction by the screening effect the maximum energy barrier increases monotonically with decreasing solution is for d 2 3 because the wide distribution of peaks on the surface significantly reduces the osmotic pressure effect between the np and the surface this could explain why monotonic increase of attachment in primary minima with is for nps was frequently observed in experimental studies shen et al 2015 jin et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2017 since roughness always exists on natural collector surfaces due to a similar reason the maximum energy barrier increases monotonically with decreasing is at large values of g whereas a nonmonotonic variation of energy barrier with is exists at small values of g cf fig 6 fig 7 presents maximum energy barrier maps for the 30 nm np interacting with a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and different values of d at 0 2 m the blue plaques mean that the values of energy barrier are negative indicating favorable attachment at primary minima the blue plaques cover most fraction of the map at d 2 3 consequently favorable attachment at primary minima occurs at most locations of the fractal surface the fraction of blue plaques on a map is less for larger d values the blue plaques completely disappear at the largest d value considered i e d 2 6 hence the attachment is unfavorable on the entire fractal surface fig 8 shows that for a given value of d the value of maximum energy barrier increases with decreasing the value of g demonstrating that attachment at primary minima is inhibited at lower value of g i e smoother surface note that smaller d value or larger g value means larger average height if the surface is modeled as a planar surface covered with regular asperities such as hemispheres the maximum energy barrier decreases with increasing the average roughness height or hemisphere radius at large height range shen et al 2011 our results however show that the maximum energy barrier is smallest for the largest average height i e the smallest d or largest g this is because asperities on a fractal surface are covered by smaller asperities due to self affinity the fractal surface with smaller d or larger g has more nanoscale protruding asperities which can significantly decrease maximum energy barrier the use of simple rough models composed of regular geometries cannot capture this structure and accordingly can cause incorrect prediction of colloid attachment on natural collector surfaces where fractal roughness is frequently present the obtained maximum energy barrier maps were used to determine the average attachment efficiency at primary minima α for interaction of the np with a fractal surface via boltzmann factor equation elimelech and o melia 1990a 1990b shen et al 2007 the expression used the determine the value of α is given by α a exp u max x y d a a where u max is maximum energy barrier fig 9 presents calculated value of α for interaction between the 30 nm np and a fractal surface as a function of d or g at different solution iss the value of α decreases monotonically with increasing d or decreasing g at all the iss considered the value of α decreases more slowly with d or g at 0 01 m compared to other iss it is noted that previous studies shen et al 2012 2014 tian et al 2012 jin et al 2015 2017 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 li et al 2017 frequently used roughness height to describe the degree of roughness however both monotonic and non monotonic variations of attachment in primary minima with roughness height existed for example torkzaban and bradford 2016 modeled rough surfaces as planar surfaces covered with pillars and showed that the primary minimum attachment increased monotonically with increasing pillar height and decreasing pillar density jin et al 2017 conducted column experiments to investigate influence of collector surface roughness on particle attachment under unfavorable conditions they showed that a critical roughness height associated with minimum particle attachment at primary minima was consistently observed particle attachment decreased with increasing roughness height when the roughness is smaller than the critical height and it increased with increasing roughness when its size was greater the critical value the inconsistent variation of α with roughness height is likely because the variation of roughness height can also cause change of other roughness parameters such as asperity density and surface curvature therefore the fractal dimension and fractal roughness are more robust for predicting attachment of colloids on natural collector surfaces with fractal roughness compared to traditional roughness parameters such as roughness height 3 3 detachment from primary minima fig 10 presents maps of detachment energy barrier from primary minima for interaction of the 30 nm np with a fractal surface for g 0 0136 nm and d 2 3 or d 2 6 at different iss the detachment energy barrier was calculated by subtracting primary minimum from maximum energy barrier similar to the maximum energy barrier maps white spots are also present at 0 01 and 0 001 m for d 2 3 where the detachment energy barrier or primary minimum well is absent due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance the white spots are located at peak areas and the nps attached at these locations via primary minimum association at a higher is will be detached upon is reduction as mentioned previously the maximum energy barrier is also reduced at the peak areas therefore the peaks on rough surfaces facilitates both particle attachment at primary minima and subsequent detachment by is reduction fang et al 2014 at other locations the detachment energy barrier increases with decreasing solution is illustrating that the np attachment is irreversible to reduction of is however the detachment energy barriers are low at all locations of a map at d 2 3 for all solution iss illustrating that the nps attached at primary minima experience weak attractions these weakly attached nps could be detached by increasing flow velocity if the hydrodynamic torques that act on the nps exceed the adhesive torques bergendahl and grasso 2003 bradford and torkzaban 2015 the detachment from primary minima by increasing flow velocity is more significant for large particles e g microparticles than nps because they experience much greater hydrodynamic torques at a given flow velocity bergendahl and grasso 2003 fig 10 shows that the detachment energy barrier increases with increasing the value of d from 2 3 to 2 6 the detachment energy barrier is distributed more nonuniformly at d 2 6 compared to the case of d 2 3 the blue subdomains low detachment energy barriers are circumscribed by yellow or red nets high detachment energy barriers at d 2 6 the yellow or red nets are located at the valleys of the fractal surface the detachment energy barriers at the valleys increases with decreasing solution is illustrating that attachment in primary minima at the valleys is irreversible to is reduction li et al 2017 has experimentally observed irreversible attachment in primary minima at valleys of rough surfaces via scanning electron microscope examinations si fig s4 shows that the variation of detachment energy barrier with decreasing g is similar to that with increasing d particularly the detachment from primary minima by is reduction occurs more at a high value of g i e with peaks widely existing on the fractal surface decreasing the value of g results in more irreversible attachments at the primary minima note that the maximum energy barrier is also enhanced at the valleys as have been shown previously therefore the particles are less readily to access the primary minima at the valleys than at the peaks although the primary minimum attachment at the valleys is very stable 3 4 role of secondary minimum fig 11 presents secondary energy minimum maps for interactions of the 30 nm np and a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and different values of d at 0 2 m the secondary minimum is enhanced at the valley areas whereas reduced at the peak areas the secondary minimum increases with increasing the value of d for a given value of d the secondary minimum increases with decreasing the value of g cf si fig s5 the values of secondary energy minimum are small which are comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid i e 1 5 kt at both valleys and peaks at 0 2 m note that the value of secondary energy minimum will further decrease with decreasing solution is therefore the 30 nm nps cannot be attached on the fractal surfaces via secondary minimum association due to brownian diffusion however as the value of secondary minimum is proportional to the size of a particle hahn et al 2004 the enhancement of secondary minimum may play a significant role in immobilization of large colloids such as microparticles the attachment of microparticles at valleys via secondary minimum associated could be further facilitated due to reduced hydrodynamic shear at these areas it has been traditionally believed that particle attachment at secondary minimum can occur only at the stagnation point regions of a porous medium and particles at other locations of a collector surface will translate and rotate along the surface until they reach those areas elimelech and o melia 1990a 1990b hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 the presence of roughness on surface however can cause attachment of particles at secondary minima distributed on an open collector surface 4 conclusions the interaction energy between a np and fractal surfaces modeled using the w m function was examined in three dimensional space the roughness of a fractal surface increases with increasing the fractal roughness g and decreasing the fractal dimension d a nonmonotonic variation of primary minimum attachment with solution is exists for the np on fractal surfaces with high values of d or low values of g whereas the attachment decreases monotonically with decreasing is at low values of d or high values of g a consistent decrease of primary minimum attachment with d or g exists at all iss the primary minimum attachment occurs at peak areas where the repulsive energy barriers are reduced or eliminated a fraction of nps attached at the peak areas via primary minimum association can detached by is reduction due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance at low iss although the primary minimum attachment at valley regions is irreversible to is reduction the nps are difficult to be attached in these areas due to enhanced repulsive energy barriers in contrast the secondary minimum depths are enhanced at the valley regions which may play an important role in immobilization of particles particularly microparticles our results indicate that the fractal dimension and fractal roughness are more robust for predicting attachment and detachment on from natural collector surface surfaces than traditional roughness parameters e g average roughness height these findings have important implication to accurate

19071,this study evaluated attachment of a 30 nm nanoparticle to and detachment from fractal surfaces by calculating derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energies in three dimensional space using the surface element integration technique the fractal surfaces were generated using the weierstass mandelbrot function with varying values of fractal dimension d 2 3 d 2 7 and fractal roughness g 0 000136 g 0 136 results show that maximum energy barrier is reduced at peak areas of a fractal surface and hence attachment in primary minima is favored some nanoparticles attached in primary minima at the peak areas can be detached by decreasing ionic strength is due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance at low iss while the attachment in primary minima at valley areas is irreversible to is reduction the attachment is inhibited due to enhanced maximum energy barrier at these areas a nonmonotonic variation of attachment efficiency in primary minimum aepm with is is present at high fractal dimension d 2 4 or low fractal roughness g 0 00136 whereas the aepm decreases monotonically with decreasing is at low fractal dimension d 2 4 or high fractal roughness g 0 00136 the aepm decreases monotonically with increasing d or decreasing g at iss from 1 mm to 200 mm the decrease of aepm with d or g is much slower at 10 mm compared to other iss these theoretical findings can explain various experimental observations in the literature and can have important utility to development of water filtration techniques in engineered systems and to assessment of environmental risks of nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanoparticle fractal surface interaction energy attachment detachment 1 introduction transport of hazardous particles e g pathogenic viruses bacteria and protozoa and toxic nanomaterials in porous media such as soil has been extensively investigated during the past two decades due to intense interest in preventing groundwater pollution and developing water and wastewater filtration technologies ryan and elimelech 1996 de jonge et al 2004 batley et al 2013 attachment on and detachment from collector surfaces are two primary processes that inhibit and facilitate particle transport in porous media respectively bradford and torkzaban 2015 molnar et al 2015 whether particles attach to or detach from collector surfaces is dependent on the energy balance between adhesive energy and brownian diffusion and or the torque balance between adhesive torque and hydrodynamic torque bergendahl and grasso 2003 pazmino et al 2014a 2014b bradford et al 2017 both energy and torque balance analysis require accurate determination of the adhesive force energy that arises due to colloidal interactions between particles and surfaces the colloidal interactions include van der waals vdw attraction electrical double layer dl interaction and short range repulsion e g hydration and steric repulsion hoek and agarwal 2006 israelachvili 2011 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory quantitatively describes the interaction energy profile as a function of separation distance between a particle and a surface ryan and elimelech 1996 when particles and collector surfaces are like charged both primary and secondary minima are present in the energy profile between which an energy barrier exists if the two surfaces are oppositely charged both secondary minimum and energy barrier disappear from the profile and only primary minimum exists the primary and secondary energy minima are considered as the locations for particle attachment grasso et al 2002 hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 in the classic dlvo theory calculation of interaction energies is based on the assumption that particle and collector surfaces are perfectly smooth in real systems surfaces of natural particles and collectors however all contain some degree of physical nonuniformity at small scales shellenberger and logan 2002 the influence of surface roughness has been frequently taken as the cause of discrepancies between the theoretical prediction and experimental observations of particle deposition fischer et al 2014 jin et al 2015 2017 rasmuson et al 2017 theoretical studies huang et al 2010 bradford and torkzaban 2015 bendersky et al 2015 have shown that the nanoscale protruding asperities can increase particle attachment at primary minima by reducing energy barrier under the unfavorable conditions however the favorably attached particles are readily to be detached by perturbation of solution chemistry and or hydrodynamics because the depths of the primary minima are also decreased by nanoscale protruding asperities shen et al 2012 2014 such reduction of primary minimum depth by nanoscale protruding asperities can also decrease particle attachment at primary minima under favorable conditions rasmuson et al 2017 while various mechanisms controlling interactions of particles with rough surfaces have been elucidated as shown above the aforementioned theoretical results were obtained by modeling the rough surfaces as smooth surfaces carrying geometrically regular asperities e g pillars hemispheres and cones this technique is capable of characterizing the actual morphologies of rough surfaces to some extent by using the measured values of rough parameters e g root means square roughness and surface area difference from atomic force microscopy afm scans to constrain the distribution of asperities on the smooth surfaces hoek et al 2003 the modeling of rough surface was further improved in recent studies jaiswal et al 2009 siegismund et al 2014 by using fast fourier transform algorithm to model the roughness based on the afm measurement this technique can generate more realistic roughness profiles than using the regular geometries however all of these modeled surfaces are stationary because the rough parameter values of the surfaces i e those from afm scans are fixed which do not change with the length scale used to measure the modeled surfaces eichenlaub et al 2004 many natural and engineered surfaces such as sand and membrane surfaces are fractal and their rough parameter values change with the resolution and afm scan size yang et al 2016 cai et al 2017 a fractal surface bears the property of self affinity specifically when a part of the fractal surface is magnified the magnified image looks very similar to the original surface chen et al 2009 in addition the fractal surface possesses the properties of continuity and non differentiability mandelbrot 1983 these mathematical properties are satisfied by the weierstrass mandelbrot w m function which is a superposition of sinusoids with geometrically spaced frequencies and amplitudes that follow a power law yan and komvopoulos 1998 eichenlaub et al 2004 the w m function has been used to represent fractal surfaces for investigating influence of surface topography on engineered processes such as gaseous and fluid flow and thermal contact resistance majumdar and tien 1990 yan et al 2015 the w m function has also been employed recently to model membrane surfaces for examining the interactions between a particle and the surfaces cai et al 2017 chen et al 2017 feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 it was found that the adhesions between particles and fractal surfaces are significantly lowered compared to those of particle flat surface interactions while these studies advanced understanding about influence of fractal on colloidal interaction they only investigated the variation of interaction energy with separation distance for a particle at a single horizontal location above a fractal surface the interaction energy that acts on the particle should change with its horizontal location due to the randomness of fractal surface moreover the influence of environmental factors such as ionic strength is on interaction energies between particles and fractal surfaces has not been investigated to date the detachment of particles from fractal surfaces is also unclear this study systematically evaluated the attachment and detachment of nanoparticles nps on from fractal surfaces represented using the w m function by calculating interaction energies at various horizontal and vertical locations the surface element integration sei technique bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 siegismund et al 2014 was used for the energy calculations and the interaction energy maps were obtained to describe the variation of interaction energy in three dimensional space for various iss and fractal roughness parameter values we showed that the fractal dimension and fractal roughness are more effective for predicting attachment and detachment on from primary and secondary minima than traditional roughness parameters such as average roughness height the findings in this study can help explain various observations in the literature for example our results could explain why a nonmonotonic variation of attachment with is for nps was predicted in a theoretical study lin and wiesner 2012 through exact interaction energy calculations but not observed experimentally 2 theory 2 1 the w m function the modified two variable w m function by yan and komvopoulos 1998 was employed to generate fractal surfaces in this study 1 z x y l g l d 2 ln γ

critical parameters that determine the fractal topography the fractal dimension determines the relative contributions of high and low frequency components in the fractal surface profile higher value of d means that high frequency components in the surface profile are more dominant than low frequency components yin and komvopoulos 2010 the fractal roughness is a height scaling parameter i e amplitude coefficient and the amplitudes of wavelengths comprising the surface profile increase with increasing the value of g both values of d and g are independent of the measurement scale for a

np and a fractal surface generated by the w m function detailed procedure for calculating interaction energy between a spherical particle and a rough surface using the sei technique can be referred to previous studies bhattacharjee et al 1998 duffadar and davis 2007 hoss et al 2017 briefly the cartesian coordinate system was employed for the model system in fig 1 the xy plane of the coordinate system is oriented parallel to the zero plane of the fractal surface which divides the np into two identical hemispheres the z axis passes through the np center and faces toward the fractal surface similar to the grid surface integration technique duffadar and davis 2007 both np and fractal surfaces were discretized into small area elements the differential interaction energy du between an area element on np surface ds p and the corresponding area element on fractal surface ds c is calculated as bhattacharjee et al 1998 hoss et al 2017 2 d u n 1 k 1 n 2 k 2 e h d s c where k 1 and k 2 are unit vectors directed towards the positive and negative z axis respectively n 1 and n 2 are outward units normal to the np and collector surfaces respectively e h is the differential interaction energy between element ds p and ds c and h is the local separation distance between the two elements the total interaction energy u that the np experiences is then obtained by summation of the differential interaction energy du for each ds c on the projected area of the np on the fractal surface the equation used to calculate the total interaction energy can be expressed as 3 u s c n 1 k 1 n 2 k 2 e h d s c where s c is the project area of the np on the fractal surface it is very difficult to directly determine the value of n 2 k 2 due to the randomness of the fractal surface however the term of n 2 k 2 can be eliminated from equation 3 by expressing the element ds c in terms of its projection da on the xy plane as 4 d s c 1 n 2 k 2 d a substituting equation 4 into equation 3 we obtain 5 u a n 1 k 1 n 2 k 2 n 2 k 2 e h d a when the unit normal to the fractal surface at a given point n 2 makes an obtuse or acute angle with k 2 the value of n 2 k 2 n 2 k 2 is equal to 1 or 1 hence the total interaction energy can be obtained by integrating the differential interaction energy over the projected area of the np on the xy plane without determining the value of n 2 k 2 by using n 1 k 1 z x 2 y 2 z 2 equation 5 is changed to 6 u a z x 2 y 2 z 2 e h d a the differential interaction energy between element ds and da i e e h was calculated by summing van der waals vdw

158 nm hoek and agarwal 2006 both np and fractal surfaces were discretized into grid elements with projection areas on the xy plane of 0 1 nm 0 1 nm a matlab program was developed to calculate dlvo interaction energies for the aforementioned interaction configuration and the calculated energies were expressed in terms of kt k is boltzmann constant and t is absolute temperature a horizontal interaction energy map denoted as hep was obtained by varying the horizontal positions x y of the np center in a rasterized manner and keeping the vertical distance between the np center and the rough surface fixed various heps were produced at different vertical distances between the np center and the rough surface vertical interaction energy maps veps were also calculated by varying the vertical positions x z or y z of the np center for a given value of y or x note that the interaction energy maps have also been calculated by varying the horizontal positions x y of a particle center and keeping the vertical distance between the np center and the zero plane of a rough surface fixed hoek et al 2003 we did not adopt this approach because physical overlaps can occur between the particles and protruding asperities on the rough surfaces a number of studies siegismund et al 2014 feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 have examined the interaction of a particle and a surface with random roughness however these studies only examined adhesion or primary minimum depth for the particle at a single location of the surface in contrast by using the heps and veps the maps of primary minimum maximum energy barrier and secondary minimum were obtained in this study as such the distribution of attachment in primary and secondary minima and subsequent detachment as well as the variation of the attachment and detachment with surface morphology e g height and curvature can be obtained for theoretical calculation of interaction energies the nps and fractal collector surfaces were assumed to be 30 nm polystyrene latex particles and quartz sand respectively which have the same properties as those used in shen et al 2007 table 1 presents the zeta potentials of the latex nps and quartz sand used to calculate the interaction energies at different solution iss a value of 1 10 20 j was taken as the hamaker constant for latex water sand system elimelech and o melia 1990a 1990b shen et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 generated fractal surfaces fig 2 presents simulated fractal surfaces using the w m function with projected surface areas on xy plane of 150 nm 150 nm for varying d values 2 3 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 and a g value of 0 0136 nm the scale bar to the right of each plot represents height in units of nm we adopted these values of d and g because for most fractal surfaces the values of d range from 2 3 to 2 7 and the values of g range from 0 000136 nm to 0 136 nm sahoo and ghosh 2007 fig 2 shows that for a given value of g larger value of d yields smoother surface this is because high frequency components are more dominant than low frequency components in the surface topography profile at larger d values chatterjee and sahoo 2014 for a given value of d larger g value results in rougher surfaces due to an increase in the amplitude of surface wavelength with g as shown in supplementary information si fig s1 the variation of surface roughness with d and g are in agreement with those in previous studies yan and komvopoulos 1998 chatterjee and sahoo 2014 yan et al 2015 3 2 attachment in primary minima fig 3 presents heps for interactions of a 30 nm np with a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and d 2 3 or d 2 6 i e the surface in fig 2a or 2d at 0 001 m at varying separation distances the scale bar to the right of each plot represents interaction energy in units of kt k is the boltmann constant t 297 13 k is absolute temperature the interaction energy is non uniformly distributed plaque like in the horizontal direction due to the random variation of surface curvature shen et al 2015 the magnitude of interaction energy is reduced and enhanced at peak and valley regions respectively as shown by the veps in si fig s2 the variation of interaction energy with surface curvature can be explained by the concept of interaction volume developed by huang et al 2010 the interaction volume is defined as the volume between the leading half of a spherical particle and a substrate surface the interaction volume is smaller for a np interacting with a peak surface than with a valley surface huang et al 2010 illustrated that smaller interaction volume between a particle and a substrate surface causes larger interaction energy because the mean plane of the surface is closer to the apex of the particle therefore the magnitude of interaction energy is reduced at peak areas whereas enhanced at valley areas the interaction energy is more uniformly distributed at larger separation distance because the influence of local variation of surface curvature on interaction energy decreases with increasing separation distance cf fig 3 the energy plaques on the maps are larger for smaller d value because of more dominance of high frequency components than low frequency components due to a similar reason increasing the value of g increases the sizes of the plaques cf fig 4 for a given fractal surface the interaction energy decreases with increasing is si fig s3 fig 5 shows maximum energy barrier maps for interactions of the 30 nm np with a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and d 2 3 or d 2 6 at different solution iss the plaques on the energy barrier maps are larger for smaller value of d i e smoother surface the value of maximum energy barrier is smaller for smaller value of d interestingly white spots are present on the heps for d 2 3 at is 10 mm these spots are located at peak areas where the maximum energy barrier is absent due to a monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance in this case the primary energy minimum between the np and a peak is eliminated by the repulsion from the rest of the surface causing the monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance shen et al 2012 inspection of fig 5 also shows that while the maximum energy barrier increases monotonically with decreasing solution is for d 2 3 a nonmonotonic variation of energy barrier with is exists for d 2 6 the energy barrier increases with decreasing is from 0 2 m and reaches maximum at 0 01 m for d 2 6 and increases with increasing is at is 0 01 m the increase of energy barrier with increasing solution is at the low is range has also been observed in lin and wiesner 2012 by exactly examining the interaction energy of a np with a planar surface similar to the sei technique lin and wiesner 2012 considered both screening effect and the osmotic pressure between the np and the planar surface in electrolyte solutions increasing is increases both screening effect and osmotic pressure which decreases and increases energy barrier respectively a net increase of the energy barrier with increasing is will occur if the enlargement of the energy barrier by the osmotic pressure exceeds the energy barrier reduction by the screening effect the maximum energy barrier increases monotonically with decreasing solution is for d 2 3 because the wide distribution of peaks on the surface significantly reduces the osmotic pressure effect between the np and the surface this could explain why monotonic increase of attachment in primary minima with is for nps was frequently observed in experimental studies shen et al 2015 jin et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2017 since roughness always exists on natural collector surfaces due to a similar reason the maximum energy barrier increases monotonically with decreasing is at large values of g whereas a nonmonotonic variation of energy barrier with is exists at small values of g cf fig 6 fig 7 presents maximum energy barrier maps for the 30 nm np interacting with a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and different values of d at 0 2 m the blue plaques mean that the values of energy barrier are negative indicating favorable attachment at primary minima the blue plaques cover most fraction of the map at d 2 3 consequently favorable attachment at primary minima occurs at most locations of the fractal surface the fraction of blue plaques on a map is less for larger d values the blue plaques completely disappear at the largest d value considered i e d 2 6 hence the attachment is unfavorable on the entire fractal surface fig 8 shows that for a given value of d the value of maximum energy barrier increases with decreasing the value of g demonstrating that attachment at primary minima is inhibited at lower value of g i e smoother surface note that smaller d value or larger g value means larger average height if the surface is modeled as a planar surface covered with regular asperities such as hemispheres the maximum energy barrier decreases with increasing the average roughness height or hemisphere radius at large height range shen et al 2011 our results however show that the maximum energy barrier is smallest for the largest average height i e the smallest d or largest g this is because asperities on a fractal surface are covered by smaller asperities due to self affinity the fractal surface with smaller d or larger g has more nanoscale protruding asperities which can significantly decrease maximum energy barrier the use of simple rough models composed of regular geometries cannot capture this structure and accordingly can cause incorrect prediction of colloid attachment on natural collector surfaces where fractal roughness is frequently present the obtained maximum energy barrier maps were used to determine the average attachment efficiency at primary minima α for interaction of the np with a fractal surface via boltzmann factor equation elimelech and o melia 1990a 1990b shen et al 2007 the expression used the determine the value of α is given by α a exp u max x y d a a where u max is maximum energy barrier fig 9 presents calculated value of α for interaction between the 30 nm np and a fractal surface as a function of d or g at different solution iss the value of α decreases monotonically with increasing d or decreasing g at all the iss considered the value of α decreases more slowly with d or g at 0 01 m compared to other iss it is noted that previous studies shen et al 2012 2014 tian et al 2012 jin et al 2015 2017 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 li et al 2017 frequently used roughness height to describe the degree of roughness however both monotonic and non monotonic variations of attachment in primary minima with roughness height existed for example torkzaban and bradford 2016 modeled rough surfaces as planar surfaces covered with pillars and showed that the primary minimum attachment increased monotonically with increasing pillar height and decreasing pillar density jin et al 2017 conducted column experiments to investigate influence of collector surface roughness on particle attachment under unfavorable conditions they showed that a critical roughness height associated with minimum particle attachment at primary minima was consistently observed particle attachment decreased with increasing roughness height when the roughness is smaller than the critical height and it increased with increasing roughness when its size was greater the critical value the inconsistent variation of α with roughness height is likely because the variation of roughness height can also cause change of other roughness parameters such as asperity density and surface curvature therefore the fractal dimension and fractal roughness are more robust for predicting attachment of colloids on natural collector surfaces with fractal roughness compared to traditional roughness parameters such as roughness height 3 3 detachment from primary minima fig 10 presents maps of detachment energy barrier from primary minima for interaction of the 30 nm np with a fractal surface for g 0 0136 nm and d 2 3 or d 2 6 at different iss the detachment energy barrier was calculated by subtracting primary minimum from maximum energy barrier similar to the maximum energy barrier maps white spots are also present at 0 01 and 0 001 m for d 2 3 where the detachment energy barrier or primary minimum well is absent due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance the white spots are located at peak areas and the nps attached at these locations via primary minimum association at a higher is will be detached upon is reduction as mentioned previously the maximum energy barrier is also reduced at the peak areas therefore the peaks on rough surfaces facilitates both particle attachment at primary minima and subsequent detachment by is reduction fang et al 2014 at other locations the detachment energy barrier increases with decreasing solution is illustrating that the np attachment is irreversible to reduction of is however the detachment energy barriers are low at all locations of a map at d 2 3 for all solution iss illustrating that the nps attached at primary minima experience weak attractions these weakly attached nps could be detached by increasing flow velocity if the hydrodynamic torques that act on the nps exceed the adhesive torques bergendahl and grasso 2003 bradford and torkzaban 2015 the detachment from primary minima by increasing flow velocity is more significant for large particles e g microparticles than nps because they experience much greater hydrodynamic torques at a given flow velocity bergendahl and grasso 2003 fig 10 shows that the detachment energy barrier increases with increasing the value of d from 2 3 to 2 6 the detachment energy barrier is distributed more nonuniformly at d 2 6 compared to the case of d 2 3 the blue subdomains low detachment energy barriers are circumscribed by yellow or red nets high detachment energy barriers at d 2 6 the yellow or red nets are located at the valleys of the fractal surface the detachment energy barriers at the valleys increases with decreasing solution is illustrating that attachment in primary minima at the valleys is irreversible to is reduction li et al 2017 has experimentally observed irreversible attachment in primary minima at valleys of rough surfaces via scanning electron microscope examinations si fig s4 shows that the variation of detachment energy barrier with decreasing g is similar to that with increasing d particularly the detachment from primary minima by is reduction occurs more at a high value of g i e with peaks widely existing on the fractal surface decreasing the value of g results in more irreversible attachments at the primary minima note that the maximum energy barrier is also enhanced at the valleys as have been shown previously therefore the particles are less readily to access the primary minima at the valleys than at the peaks although the primary minimum attachment at the valleys is very stable 3 4 role of secondary minimum fig 11 presents secondary energy minimum maps for interactions of the 30 nm np and a fractal surface with g 0 0136 nm and different values of d at 0 2 m the secondary minimum is enhanced at the valley areas whereas reduced at the peak areas the secondary minimum increases with increasing the value of d for a given value of d the secondary minimum increases with decreasing the value of g cf si fig s5 the values of secondary energy minimum are small which are comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid i e 1 5 kt at both valleys and peaks at 0 2 m note that the value of secondary energy minimum will further decrease with decreasing solution is therefore the 30 nm nps cannot be attached on the fractal surfaces via secondary minimum association due to brownian diffusion however as the value of secondary minimum is proportional to the size of a particle hahn et al 2004 the enhancement of secondary minimum may play a significant role in immobilization of large colloids such as microparticles the attachment of microparticles at valleys via secondary minimum associated could be further facilitated due to reduced hydrodynamic shear at these areas it has been traditionally believed that particle attachment at secondary minimum can occur only at the stagnation point regions of a porous medium and particles at other locations of a collector surface will translate and rotate along the surface until they reach those areas elimelech and o melia 1990a 1990b hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 the presence of roughness on surface however can cause attachment of particles at secondary minima distributed on an open collector surface 4 conclusions the interaction energy between a np and fractal surfaces modeled using the w m function was examined in three dimensional space the roughness of a fractal surface increases with increasing the fractal roughness g and decreasing the fractal dimension d a nonmonotonic variation of primary minimum attachment with solution is exists for the np on fractal surfaces with high values of d or low values of g whereas the attachment decreases monotonically with decreasing is at low values of d or high values of g a consistent decrease of primary minimum attachment with d or g exists at all iss the primary minimum attachment occurs at peak areas where the repulsive energy barriers are reduced or eliminated a fraction of nps attached at the peak areas via primary minimum association can detached by is reduction due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance at low iss although the primary minimum attachment at valley regions is irreversible to is reduction the nps are difficult to be attached in these areas due to enhanced repulsive energy barriers in contrast the secondary minimum depths are enhanced at the valley regions which may play an important role in immobilization of particles particularly microparticles our results indicate that the fractal dimension and fractal roughness are more robust for predicting attachment and detachment on from natural collector surface surfaces than traditional roughness parameters e g average roughness height these findings have important implication to accurate

19072,applications of fenton s oxidation of landfill leachate is limited by both high reagent requirements and a large amount of sludge generation to address those issues forward osmosis fo and humic acid ha recovery were incorporated with fenton s treatment in the fo leachate was concentrated by 3 2 times in 10 hours using a 5 m nacl draw solution the ha recovery increased from 1 86 to 2 45 g l 1 at ph 2 after fo concentration mainly because of the replacement of o in the ha structure by other inorganics i e cl na k with higher molecular weights due to the movement of alkalinity causing species i e hco3 co3 2 to the draw side driven by a concentration gradient the h2so4 requirement per g of recovered ha and per g of removed cod decreased by 46 4 and 17 1 respectively the ha recovery also decreased sludge generation by 30 at a dimensionless oxidant dose of 0 5 the proposed system reduced the overall requirement of h2so4 by 25 2 naoh by 34 6 and both feso4 7h2o and h2o2 by 35 compared to the standalone fenton s treatment of raw leachate those results have demonstrated that the proposed system could greatly decrease the leachate volume lower the reagent requirements and reduce the sludge production towards sustainable leachate treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill leachate forward osmosis humic acid fenton s oxidation sludge reduction 1 introduction landfill leachate contains recalcitrant organics such as humic acid fulvic acid and hydrophilics kang et al 2002 kjeldsen et al 2002 zhao et al 2013a in addition the presence of inorganics i e ions such as mg2 na cl etc xenobiotics i e aromatic compounds and metals i e fe ni co etc have labeled leachate as a complex wastewater kjeldsen et al 2002 the recalcitrance and complexity of leachate have triggered a wide array of treatment methods including biological physical chemical and electrochemical treatments renou et al 2008 li et al 2017 among those biological treatment is widely practiced though limited by treatment efficiency kurniawan et al 2010 chemical treatments particularly advanced oxidation processes aop such as uv h2o2 ozone h2o2 and fenton s oxidation have been implemented for leachate treatment by taking advantages of the reaction of hydroxyl radical oh a very strong oxidant with the organics deng and englehardt 2006 renou et al 2008 as a well known aop fenton s oxidation is considered the most effective for leachate treatment deng and englehardt 2006 it has been reported that fenton s treatment of leachate could achieve up to 90 cod removal 82 toc removal 92 decolorization and a significant increase in biodegradability bod5 cod deng and englehardt 2006 jung et al 2017 zhang et al 2005 zhao et al 2013b fenton s oxidation is a reaction of fe ii and h2o2 that produces hydroxyl radical oh to oxidize organics walling 1975 despite its efficacy fenton s oxidation possesses a few inherent drawbacks for the effective application of fenton s oxidation the optimum ph range is 2 4 deng and englehardt 2006 hermosilla et al 2009 which demands the addition of inorganic acid e g h2so4 hcl foaming could occur in leachate at such a low ph because of the production of co2 from the conversion of hco3 and co3 2 resulting in the requirement of a large reactor volume deng and englehardt 2006 at the end of the fenton s reaction base e g naoh lime is added to neutralize the solution with the production of a large amount of ferric based sludge benatti et al 2006 wu et al 2010 disposal of this sludge is one of the major costs for fenton s applications umar et al 2010 another key cost of fenton s treatment comes from the reagents i e feso4 7h2o as a source of fe ii and h2o2 that are highly related to the concentrations of organic matter in a leachate vilar et al 2013 therefore it is of strong interest to reduce the reagent dosage and sludge production towards enhancing cost efficiency of fenton s oxidation technology for leachate treatment herein we hypothesized that reducing leachate volume and organic contents would help accomplish the reduction of both the reagent dosage and sludge generation and this may be realized by incorporating two additional processes forward osmosis fo and recovery of humic acid ha forward osmosis is a membrane based separation technology that utilizes an osmotic gradient between a draw solution and a feed solution for extracting water cath et al 2006 shaffer et al 2015 and has been investigated for recovering water from landfill leachate iskander et al 2017b 2018 it was reported that fo treatment could recover 12 3 51 5 water from landfill leachates and this recovery was dictated by the leachate properties e g organics content conductivity etc and fo operating conditions e g draw solute type and concentration recirculation rate etc iskander et al 2018 qin et al 2016 wu et al 2018 ha consists of a substantial amount of aliphatic and aromatic moieties containing phenolic carboxylic and alkoxy groups along with the occasional presence of esters and quinones castagnoli et al 1990 jones and bryan 1998 it has several useful applications in agriculture such as a highly efficient organic fertilizer or a key fertilizer component li et al 2009 2014 morozesk et al 2017 ha can also be used to remove aqueous phosphorus nitrogen heavy metals and chlorinated solvents by forming stable complexes followed by precipitation zanin and boetti 1995 furthermore it can improve the aggregation capability of soils and be used as a soil stabilizer piccolo and mbagwu 1999 thus ha could be a potentially valuable resource and recovery of ha from a leachate in which the ha concentration increases with time because of humification artiola fortuny and fuller 1982 nanny and ratasuk 2002 may make leachate treatment more sustainable jones and bryan 1998 in the proposed system fo is used to concentrate the leachate by extracting water followed by ha recovery because of the low ph 2 requirement for ha recovery the leachate after ha recovery would still have a low ph that can be utilized by the subsequent fenton s oxidation in addition ha recovery could decrease the organic concentration and thus benefit the subsequent fenton s oxidation with a lower reagent requirement fe ii and h2o2 and less sludge production in this way the drawbacks of fenton s treatment of leachate i e initial ph adjustment reagent requirement sludge generation can be addressed or alleviated in the present study we have experimentally investigated the proposed system for treatment of organic contaminants in an actual landfill leachate experiments were performed to understand the effects of fo treatment and or ha recovery on fenton s oxidation ha recovery and associated inorganic acid h2so4 requirement were quantified and the recovered ha was characterized and compared with a commercial ha fenton s oxidation of raw leachate or the leachate pre treated by different methods was conducted to compare the treatment performance in terms of organics removal reagent requirement and sludge generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedures three experiments cases a c

leachate was collected from a municipal solid waste landfill in virginia usa after collection the leachate was stored at 4 c and used for the experiment without modification the stable leachate was

ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o fisher scientific hampton nh were used as the sources of h2o2 and fe2 in cases a and b the raw or concentrated leachate was adjusted to an initial ph of 3 with

for 5 min followed by the slow addition of h2o2 to avoid spill of the reactants due to vigorous reactions the solution was further mixed at 800 rpm for 2 5 hours and its final ph was adjusted to 6 5 with the addition of 10 m naoh and gentle mixing for 30 min then a settling period of 30 min was allowed and the supernatant was filtered through a 1 5 μm filter for further analysis 2 6 measurement

respectively apha 2005 for acidity measurement the recovered ha was dissolved in a 1 m nano3 solution to have the same concentration of ha in either the raw leachate 1 86 g l 1 or fo concentrate 7 78

total organic carbon mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 forward osmosis treatment the fo treatment concentrated the feed leachate by a factor of 3 18 0 06 in 10 hours previous studies of fo treatment of leachates reported a concentration factor cf of 1 14 2 06 which was dictated by leachate properties and fo operating conditions iskander et al 2018 qin et al 2016 wu et al 2018 those prior studies used both nacl 3 4 m and nh4hco3 0 5 4 m draw solutions at recirculation rates varying from 40 to 125 ml min 1 the higher cf 3 18 in the present study was because of a high draw solute concentration 5 m nacl the highest water flux was 5 23 0 20 lmh which decreased to 2 46 0 02 lmh in 10 hours fig 2 a mainly because of the dilution of the draw solution fouling of the membrane and reverse solute flux 10 35 0 50 gmh of the draw solute table s2 due to the concentrating effect the ha fa hpi and total toc concentrations increased from 763 to 1789 mg l 1 739 to 1091 mg l 1 1857 to 5251 mg l 1 and 3360 to 8131 mg l 1 in the feed side respectively fig 2b in the presence of forward substrate flux the diluted draw solution contained 119 2 mg l 1 ha 166 2 mg l 1 fa 152 2 mg l 1 hpi and 437 5 mg l 1 total toc which was 16 9 24 4 8 9 and 14 1 of the initial absolute mass in mg of the respective organic fractions in the raw leachate table s2 the concentrated feed solution contained 73 7 ha 46 4 fa 88 9 hpi and 76 1 total toc of the initial absolute mass in the raw leachate the unaccounted portion 9 4 ha 29 2 fa 2 2 hpi and 9 8 total toc was lost either in the degradation process or during separation e g fa can be lost in the ion exchange resin column the total cod concentration in the feed solution increased significantly by 219 3 from 10 750 mg l 1 to 34 340 mg l 1 meanwhile the nh3 n concentration increased by 31 from 2 900 to 3 800 mg l 1 the diluted draw solution contained 1 367 mg l 1 nh3 n which was 51 2 of the absolute mass of ammonia nitrogen in the raw leachate while the fo concentrate contained 41 2 and the remaining 7 6 was unaccounted for which might have lost during the measurement the higher movement of nh3 n 51 2 compared to toc 9 8 to the draw side is because of the smaller hydrated radius 0 331 nm and low molecular weight of ammonia that facilitated forward substrate flux howitt and udvardi 2000 3 2 humic acid recovery ha was recovered from both raw and fo concentrated leachates at two ph values 1 5 and 2 0 the recovered ha from 1 l raw leachate at ph 1 5 and 2 was 1 85 0 03 g and 1 86 0 05 g respectively fig 3 this amount increased by 28 4 to 2 37 0 26 g and 31 7 to 2 45 0 32 g at ph 1 5 and 2 from 0 31 l fo concentrated leachate which was generated from 1 l raw leachate fig 3 because of the insignificant difference between the recovered ha at ph 1 5 and 2 0 p 0 05 ph 2 was used in the rest of the study for ha recovery to reduce the inorganic acid consumption given that ph adjustment is a critical cost factor in treatment more studies on the optimum ph for ha recovery from leachate which can be specific to a leachate are required after fo the normalized mass percent increased for na 1 25 2 95 mg 0 01 0 17 cl 3 49 9 54 and k 0 63 1 62 in the recovered ha however the mass percent of c stayed relatively stable and the mass percent of o decreased from 47 50 to 35 99 the replacement of o with higher molecular weight elements such as na cl k and mg table 1 might have led to increased ha recovery some of those elements such as k and mg are important nutrients for plant growth and thus their increase after fo could be beneficial malhi et al 2005 the o c ratio in the recovered ha after fo treatment decreased from 1 08 to 0 81 meanwhile the absolute phenolic acidity decreased by 44 3 7 0 3 9 meq table s3 those results indicate that the replacement of o by other elements might have happened in the weak acidity zones i e phenolic acidity compared to a standard ha alfa aesar the c content of the recovered ha was almost twice the values of the standard ha in addition several other elements such as mg p s and k showed a higher mass percent the higher carbon content is beneficial to improving soil stability because humic substances are central to enhanced soil aggregation haynes and naidu 1998 the inorganic acid requirement normalized over the recovered ha decreased after the fo treatment fig 3 the acid usage decreased significantly from 6 80 to 3 05 ml g 1 55 1 decrease p 0 05 at ph 1 5 and from 4 87 to 2 61 ml g 1 46 4 decrease p 0 05 at ph 2 0 such a decrease could be related to the decrease in the absolute alkalinity 266 0 177 6 meq after fo treatment likely caused by the movement of the alkalinity causing species i e hco3 co3 2 from the feed leachate into the draw solution driven by a concentration gradient table s4 this movement resulted in 51 3 0 7 meq bicarbonate alkalinity in the diluted draw solution the ph of the draw solution increased from 5 74 0 03 to 8 35 0 01 at which bicarbonate ions would dominate the alkalinity 3 3 fenton s oxidation of leachate the removal of both cod and toc by fenton s oxidation in each of the three cases has demonstrated similar behavior in terms of dod effects and became less responsive to the increased dods i e increased reagent dose probably because of the recalcitrance of the remaining organics jung et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however there are differences among those cases and the overall cod and toc removal performance were enhanced by ha recovery prior to fenton s oxidation the maximum cod removal in case c with ha recovery was 80 3 significantly higher p 0 05 than that in case a 75 2 or b 74 0 fig 4 a the toc removal in case c at dods 0 5 and 1 0 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that of case b fig 4b however at dod 0 25 it was not significantly different possibly because at this dod the ultimate degradation i e conversion to co2 of the fa hpi fraction in case c was significantly lower than that at higher dods for instance the removal of the fa hpi fraction was 63 4 at dod 0 25 while it was higher at 75 6 at dod 0 5 usually ha are converted into lower molecular weight organic fractions after oxidation i e fenton s and those fractions exert a lower cod than the initial organics jung et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however the recovery of ha prior to fenton s oxidation has reduced the possibility of such conversion because of the interconversion of larger molecular weight organics the decrease of toc is always lower than the decrease of cod wang et al 2016 for example at dod of 0 5 case b had 74 0 cod decreased and 63 8 toc decreased the removals of uv absorbance and nh3 n were also enhanced by ha recovery prior to fenton s oxidation the uv absorbance removal in case c 93 2 was higher than that in the other two cases because that the recovery of ha decreased the amount of uv quenching compounds that could have contributed about 47 5 of the total uv absorbance table s5 due to the reduction of ha suva 5 15 0 47 l mg 1 m 1 prior to fenton s oxidation the final effluent suva was lower in case c than other cases table s6 in all three cases suva value decreased below 2 l mg 1 m 1 at all the dods proving that fenton s oxidation has removed or converted most of the aromatic organic structures into aliphatic structures gupta et al 2014 wang et al 2016 like uv absorbance nh3 n removal was higher in case c 55 5 than that in cases a and b because of the removal of 1270 90 mg l 1 nh3 n in ha prior to fenton s application table s7 the overall nh3 n removal in cases a and b was 11 0 31 6 table s7 indicating that hydroxyl radicals generated during fenton s was not highly reactive to ammonia deng and englehardt 2006 these results have clearly demonstrated that the recovery of ha prior to fenton s oxidation can help enhance the removal of organics uv absorbance suva and nh3 n from leachate the enhanced removal of uv absorbance and ammonia nitrogen prior to any biological co treatment of leachate with conventional wastewater would help maintain uv disinfection effectiveness and biological nitrogen removal reinhart and bolyard 2015 zhao et al 2013a 3 4 reduction of reagent requirements and sludge generation assuming the reagent requirements in case a as 100 the major reagents including feso4 7h2o h2o2 h2so4 and naoh have shown a generally decreasing trend in cases b and c though behaving differently fig 5 a the volume of inorganic acid or base requirement normalized over g cod removed decreased after fo treatment and or ha recovery for example at dod 0 5 case a consumed 1 05 ml 0 25 m h2so4 per g of cod removed which decreased to 0 72 ml 0 25 m h2so4 per g of cod in case b and to 0 87 ml 0 25 m h2so4 per g of cod in case c fig 5b this corresponded to 38 4 and 25 2 decrease in h2so4 requirement in cases b and c compared to that of case a fig 5a the possible reason was the decrease in absolute alkalinity of the raw leachate after fo treatment as discussed previously a higher acid consumption in case c than that in case b was due to the ph adjustment for ha recovery although this consumption also served the purpose of initial ph adjustment for the subsequent fenton s oxidation likewise the consumption of base solution also decreased from 5 92 ml 10 m naoh per g cod removed in case a to 5 53 ml 10 m naoh per g cod in case b and to 4 19 ml 10 m naoh per g cod in case c fig 5b this decrease corresponded to 13 9 and 34 6 base decrease in cases b and c compared to case a fig 5a this decrease was mainly because of the lower feso4 7h2o dose in cases b and c than case a attributed to the lower organics concentration after fo and ha recovery as the major base requirement in fenton s comes from neutralization of residual fe species into ferric hydroxo complexes for effective coagulation removal of organics deng and englehardt 2006 kang and hwang 2000 neyens and baeyens 2003 in addition the decrease in base requirement was enhanced by the absolute acidity decrease of the fa hpi fraction from 219 0 6 meq raw leachate to 89 1 1 1 meq after fo treatment and a reduction of 12 2 0 1 meq absolute acidity from fo concentrate because of ha recovery table s3 the significantly higher cod removal in case c compared to cases a and b contributed as another factor for the significantly lower base requirement normalized over cod removed in case c than cases a and b the consumption of feso4 7h2o and h2o2 decreased by 10 each for case b and 35 each for case c compared to case a benefited from the lower cod concentrations attributed to the substrate movement to the fo draw side and ha recovery respectively those results have demonstrated that the applications of fo and ha recovery can reduce the overall reagents requirement for fenton s oxidation of leachate another benefit of the ha recovery was the significant reduction of sludge generation from fenton s oxidation the absolute mass of generated sludge in cases a and b at dod 0 5 was 83 9 1 7 g and 76 4 1 4 g respectively this has significantly decreased to 59 5 1 2 g in case c that had the ha recovery fig 6 sludge generation in case b was 8 9 lower p 0 05 than that in case a fig 6 likely because of the loss of organics during fo concentration as demonstrated by 440 mg l 1 toc in the fo draw solution table s2 which reduced the reagents dose requirements the 29 reduction in fenton s sludge after fo treatment and ha recovery in case c which was also because of the lower fenton s reagents dose would greatly decrease the expense associated with sludge disposal 3 5 perspectives of recovered resources despite the advantages and benefits demonstrated by the results we must also note that the proposed system has two major challenges to address water recovery from diluted draw solution from fo and applications of recovered ha the concentrate from fo is further treated by ha recovery and fenton s oxidation the recovered water diluted draw solution on the other hand will also need a post treatment to separate draw solute and the recovered water to obtain reusable water a typical separation method is to use reverse osmosis ro which can generate a high quality water for either reuse or direct discharge although ro could be energy intensive the diluted draw solution is a much simpler liquid than leachate and thus it is expected to have less membrane fouling and energy consumption when treating the diluted draw solution as discussed previously shaffer et al 2015 the incorporation of ro as a post treatment after fo can be more energy efficient for high strength wastewater e g leachate than an standalone ro unit this is because of the lower susceptibility and higher reversibility of fo membrane fouling than ro the recovered ha may be used as fertilizer or soil stabilizer although further purification would be needed for agricultural applications the composition may need adjustment as demonstrated by a previous study that amended an ultrafiltration recovered liquid ha with extra nutrients n p and k to meet the guideline of liquid fertilizers xu et al 2017 the adjustment of the nutrients content can be accomplished by simple addition of external nutrients however the toxicity of the ha towards plants and soil microbial population should be determined as discussed previously the leachate recovered ha have a higher carbon content than the commercial counterpart this is highly desirable for application as a soil stabilizer in regions where soil erosion is dominant however the toxicity to soil microbiota still needs careful investigation 4 conclusions this study has presented a successful integration of fo and ha recovery with fenton s oxidation to treat landfill leachate with notable benefits of reduced chemical reagents and decreased sludge production some specific conclusions are as follows fo treatment has decreased the volume of leachate and also reduced its alkalinity attributed to the concentration gradient driven movement of the alkalinity causing species resulting in the decreased h2so4 requirement from 4 87 ml g 1 to 2 61 ml g 1 during the subsequent ha recovery at ph 2 ha recovery increased from 1 86 to 2 45 g l 1 at ph 2 after fo treatment of raw leachate likely because of the replacement of o in the weak acidity zones of ha by other elements i e cl na k with higher molecular weight the incorporation of ha recovery prior to fenton s oxidation has improved the removal of cod toc uv absorbance and nh3 n benefited from the removal of humic substances during ha recovery with both fo and ha recovery the overall reagents requirement by fenton s oxidation has decreased by 25 2 for h2so4 34 6 for naoh 35 for feso4 7h2o and h2o2 at dod 0 5 sludge volume decreased significantly by 29 mainly because of the lower reagent dose for lower organics concentrations a smaller sludge generation will reduce the requirement for handling of ferric based sludge declaration of interests the authors declare that

19072,applications of fenton s oxidation of landfill leachate is limited by both high reagent requirements and a large amount of sludge generation to address those issues forward osmosis fo and humic acid ha recovery were incorporated with fenton s treatment in the fo leachate was concentrated by 3 2 times in 10 hours using a 5 m nacl draw solution the ha recovery increased from 1 86 to 2 45 g l 1 at ph 2 after fo concentration mainly because of the replacement of o in the ha structure by other inorganics i e cl na k with higher molecular weights due to the movement of alkalinity causing species i e hco3 co3 2 to the draw side driven by a concentration gradient the h2so4 requirement per g of recovered ha and per g of removed cod decreased by 46 4 and 17 1 respectively the ha recovery also decreased sludge generation by 30 at a dimensionless oxidant dose of 0 5 the proposed system reduced the overall requirement of h2so4 by 25 2 naoh by 34 6 and both feso4 7h2o and h2o2 by 35 compared to the standalone fenton s treatment of raw leachate those results have demonstrated that the proposed system could greatly decrease the leachate volume lower the reagent requirements and reduce the sludge production towards sustainable leachate treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill leachate forward osmosis humic acid fenton s oxidation sludge reduction 1 introduction landfill leachate contains recalcitrant organics such as humic acid fulvic acid and hydrophilics kang et al 2002 kjeldsen et al 2002 zhao et al 2013a in addition the presence of inorganics i e ions such as mg2 na cl etc xenobiotics i e aromatic compounds and metals i e fe ni co etc have labeled leachate as a complex wastewater kjeldsen et al 2002 the recalcitrance and complexity of leachate have triggered a wide array of treatment methods including biological physical chemical and electrochemical treatments renou et al 2008 li et al 2017 among those biological treatment is widely practiced though limited by treatment efficiency kurniawan et al 2010 chemical treatments particularly advanced oxidation processes aop such as uv h2o2 ozone h2o2 and fenton s oxidation have been implemented for leachate treatment by taking advantages of the reaction of hydroxyl radical oh a very strong oxidant with the organics deng and englehardt 2006 renou et al 2008 as a well known aop fenton s oxidation is considered the most effective for leachate treatment deng and englehardt 2006 it has been reported that fenton s treatment of leachate could achieve up to 90 cod removal 82 toc removal 92 decolorization and a significant increase in biodegradability bod5 cod deng and englehardt 2006 jung et al 2017 zhang et al 2005 zhao et al 2013b fenton s oxidation is a reaction of fe ii and h2o2 that produces hydroxyl radical oh to oxidize organics walling 1975 despite its efficacy fenton s oxidation possesses a few inherent drawbacks for the effective application of fenton s oxidation the optimum ph range is 2 4 deng and englehardt 2006 hermosilla et al 2009 which demands the addition of inorganic acid e g h2so4 hcl foaming could occur in leachate at such a low ph because of the production of co2 from the conversion of hco3 and co3 2 resulting in the requirement of a large reactor volume deng and englehardt 2006 at the end of the fenton s reaction base e g naoh lime is added to neutralize the solution with the production of a large amount of ferric based sludge benatti et al 2006 wu et al 2010 disposal of this sludge is one of the major costs for fenton s applications umar et al 2010 another key cost of fenton s treatment comes from the reagents i e feso4 7h2o as a source of fe ii and h2o2 that are highly related to the concentrations of organic matter in a leachate vilar et al 2013 therefore it is of strong interest to reduce the reagent dosage and sludge production towards enhancing cost efficiency of fenton s oxidation technology for leachate treatment herein we hypothesized that reducing leachate volume and organic contents would help accomplish the reduction of both the reagent dosage and sludge generation and this may be realized by incorporating two additional processes forward osmosis fo and recovery of humic acid ha forward osmosis is a membrane based separation technology that utilizes an osmotic gradient between a draw solution and a feed solution for extracting water cath et al 2006 shaffer et al 2015 and has been investigated for recovering water from landfill leachate iskander et al 2017b 2018 it was reported that fo treatment could recover 12 3 51 5 water from landfill leachates and this recovery was dictated by the leachate properties e g organics content conductivity etc and fo operating conditions e g draw solute type and concentration recirculation rate etc iskander et al 2018 qin et al 2016 wu et al 2018 ha consists of a substantial amount of aliphatic and aromatic moieties containing phenolic carboxylic and alkoxy groups along with the occasional presence of esters and quinones castagnoli et al 1990 jones and bryan 1998 it has several useful applications in agriculture such as a highly efficient organic fertilizer or a key fertilizer component li et al 2009 2014 morozesk et al 2017 ha can also be used to remove aqueous phosphorus nitrogen heavy metals and chlorinated solvents by forming stable complexes followed by precipitation zanin and boetti 1995 furthermore it can improve the aggregation capability of soils and be used as a soil stabilizer piccolo and mbagwu 1999 thus ha could be a potentially valuable resource and recovery of ha from a leachate in which the ha concentration increases with time because of humification artiola fortuny and fuller 1982 nanny and ratasuk 2002 may make leachate treatment more sustainable jones and bryan 1998 in the proposed system fo is used to concentrate the leachate by extracting water followed by ha recovery because of the low ph 2 requirement for ha recovery the leachate after ha recovery would still have a low ph that can be utilized by the subsequent fenton s oxidation in addition ha recovery could decrease the organic concentration and thus benefit the subsequent fenton s oxidation with a lower reagent requirement fe ii and h2o2 and less sludge production in this way the drawbacks of fenton s treatment of leachate i e initial ph adjustment reagent requirement sludge generation can be addressed or alleviated in the present study we have experimentally investigated the proposed system for treatment of organic contaminants in an actual landfill leachate experiments were performed to understand the effects of fo treatment and or ha recovery on fenton s oxidation ha recovery and associated inorganic acid h2so4 requirement were quantified and the recovered ha was characterized and compared with a commercial ha fenton s oxidation of raw leachate or the leachate pre treated by different methods was conducted to compare the treatment performance in terms of organics removal reagent requirement and sludge generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedures three experiments cases a c were performed for comparison and analysis fig 1 two of them were without ha recovery case a and b and one was with ha recovery case c case a was the direct application of fenton s oxidation of raw leachate at ph 3 providing a control for comparison as ph 2 4 has been described as the optimum ph for fenton s application ph 3 was chosen as the midpoint of the range deng and englehardt 2006 fo treatment was performed in case b to concentrate the leachate prior to fenton s oxidation in case c after fo concentration ha was recovered at ph 2 followed by fenton s oxidation of the remaining organic fractions at ph 3 the dimensionless oxidant doses dods investigated were 0 25 0 5 and 1 considering the different initial cod in different cases the application of dod which is the ratio of chemical equivalent of oxidant to chemical equivalent of initial cod eqns 1 and 2 would facilitate comparison of the fenton s oxidation performance among different cases jung et al 2017 singh et al 2013 1 dimensionless oxidant dose dod chemical equivalent of oxidant chemical equivalent of cod 0 2 dod in fenton s oxidation 0 471 h 2 o 2 cod 0 because of the comparable organics removal at dod 0 5

leachate was collected from a municipal solid waste landfill in virginia usa after collection the leachate was stored at 4 c and used for the experiment without modification the stable leachate was dark brown in color indicating the presence of humic substances and had the following characteristics 10 750 520 mg cod l 1 bod5 cod 0 08 2 900 115 mg nh3 n l 1 8 46 0 01 ph and a conductivity of 30

an aquaporin embedded flat sheet fo membrane aquaporin a s lyngby denmark with a 139 cm2 active surface area was used with its active layer facing the feed side leachate fo test was conducted by using 200 ml 5 m nacl as draw solution and with an initial feed leachate volume of 500 ml in a batch mode of 10 h each batch to reduce the concentration polarization effect a 40 ml min 1 3 5 cm s 1 recirculation flow rate was applied to both the draw and feed chambers to ensure consistent water recovery in fo after each batch the fo membrane was cleaned via osmotic backwashing with the same concentration of draw solution for 2 hours 2 4 recovery of humic acid ha was recovered by precipitation at a ph of either 1 5 or 2 the leachate sample either raw or fo concentrated was filtered through a 1 5 μm dsc grade tss borosilicate glass fiber filter labfilterz p city ca to remove suspended particles the ph adjustment was conducted by using a 0 25 m h2so4 solution fisher scientific hampton nh the acid addition was conducted slowly by controlling foaming from carbon dioxide generation the precipitated ha was separated by using centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 30 min beckman coulter brea ca and then filtration through 1 5 μm filter to quantify the recovered ha the mass of the filter was subtracted from the mass of the filter ha after heating at 70 c for 24 hours and the difference in mass was then normalized over the initial leachate fo concentrate volume 100 ml after ha recovery the filtrate containing fulvic acid fa and hydrophilics hpi was collected for further analysis and fenton s oxidation the fa hpi fraction was further separated into fa and hpi by using an ion exchange resin column amberlite xad 8 ion exchange resin sigma aldrich st louis mo according to a literature iskander et al 2017a a schematic of the fractionation protocol is demonstrated in fig s2 2 5 fenton s oxidation fenton s oxidation was performed on raw leachate or pre treated leachate at three different dods and at a fixed molar ratio of fe2 h2o2 1 1 5 an optimal ratio reported for batch operations of fenton s oxidation of leachate hermosilla et al 2009 zhang et al 2005 all the reactions were conducted in triplicates in 220 ml snap cap plastic bottles weber scientific hamilton nj with a 50 ml volume of the leachate in this study 30 wt h2o2 fisher scientific hampton nh and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o fisher scientific hampton nh were used as the sources of h2o2 and fe2 in cases a and b the raw or concentrated leachate was adjusted to an initial ph of 3 with 0 25 m h2so4 while in case c the ph of the leachate after ha recovery was increased to 3 with 10 m naoh fisher scientific hampton nh fig 1 after ph adjustment feso4 7h2o was added and mixed at 500 rpm for 5 min followed by the slow addition of h2o2 to avoid spill of the reactants due to vigorous reactions the solution was further mixed at 800 rpm for 2 5 hours and its final ph was adjusted to 6 5 with the addition of 10 m naoh and gentle mixing for 30 min then a settling period of 30 min was allowed and the supernatant was filtered through a 1 5 μm filter for further analysis 2 6 measurement and analysis the concentrations of cod and nh3 n were measured by using a colorimeter according to the manufacturer s instruction dr 890 hach company usa conductivity was measured with a benchtop conductivity meter mettler toledo columbus oh usa and ph was measured by using an oakton ph 700 m oakton instruments vernon hills il usa hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured by using iodometric titration schumb et al 1955 and no detectable h2o2 was present after neutralization of fenton s reactions alkalinity and acidity were measured by titration with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh respectively apha 2005 for acidity measurement the recovered ha was dissolved in a 1 m nano3 solution to have the same concentration of ha in either the raw leachate 1 86 g l 1 or fo concentrate 7 78 g l 1 according to previous literature christensen et al 1998 alkalinity was measured as total alkalinity up to ph 4 5 carbonate alkalinity up to ph 8 3 and bicarbonate alkalinity from ph 8 3 to 4 5 while acidity was measured as total acidity ph 3 11 carboxylic acidity ph 3 8 and phenolic or weak acidity ph 8 11 christensen et al 1998 scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds of ha was performed by coating 5 nm coating with 6 4 wt of au pd to quantify the elemental composition for the sludge volume determination experiment the plastic reactor containing the fenton

total organic carbon mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 forward osmosis treatment the fo treatment concentrated the feed leachate by a factor of 3 18 0 06 in 10 hours previous studies of fo treatment of leachates reported a concentration factor cf of 1 14 2 06 which was dictated by leachate properties and fo operating conditions iskander et al 2018 qin et al 2016 wu et al 2018 those prior studies used both nacl 3 4 m and nh4hco3 0 5 4 m draw solutions at recirculation rates varying from 40 to 125 ml min 1 the higher cf 3 18 in the present study was because of a high draw solute concentration 5 m nacl the highest water flux was 5 23 0 20 lmh which decreased to 2 46 0 02 lmh in 10 hours fig 2 a mainly because of the dilution of the draw solution fouling of the membrane and reverse solute flux 10 35 0 50 gmh of the draw solute table s2 due to the concentrating effect the ha fa hpi and total toc concentrations increased from 763 to 1789 mg l 1 739 to 1091 mg l 1 1857 to 5251 mg l 1 and 3360 to 8131 mg l 1 in the feed side respectively fig 2b in the presence of forward substrate flux the diluted draw solution contained 119 2 mg l 1 ha 166 2 mg l 1 fa 152 2 mg l 1 hpi and 437 5 mg l 1 total toc which was 16 9 24 4 8 9 and 14 1 of the initial absolute mass in mg of the respective organic fractions in the raw leachate table s2 the concentrated feed solution contained 73 7 ha 46 4 fa 88 9 hpi and 76 1 total toc of the initial absolute mass in the raw leachate the unaccounted portion 9 4 ha 29 2 fa 2 2 hpi and 9 8 total toc was lost either in the degradation process or during separation e g fa can be lost in the ion exchange resin column the total cod concentration in the feed solution increased significantly by 219 3 from 10 750 mg l 1 to 34 340 mg l 1 meanwhile the nh3 n concentration increased by 31 from 2 900 to 3 800 mg l 1 the diluted draw solution contained 1 367 mg l 1 nh3 n which was 51 2 of the absolute mass of ammonia nitrogen in the raw leachate while the fo concentrate contained 41 2 and the remaining 7 6 was unaccounted for which might have lost during the measurement the higher movement of nh3 n 51 2 compared to toc 9 8 to the draw side is because of the smaller hydrated radius 0 331 nm and low molecular weight of ammonia that facilitated forward substrate flux howitt and udvardi 2000 3 2 humic acid recovery ha was recovered from both raw and fo concentrated leachates at two ph values 1 5 and 2 0 the recovered ha from 1 l raw leachate at ph 1 5 and 2 was 1 85 0 03 g and 1 86 0 05 g respectively fig 3 this amount increased by 28 4 to 2 37 0 26 g and 31 7 to 2 45 0 32 g at ph 1 5 and 2 from 0 31 l fo concentrated leachate which was generated from 1 l raw leachate fig 3 because of the insignificant difference between the recovered ha at ph 1 5 and 2 0 p 0 05 ph 2 was used in the rest of the study for ha recovery to reduce the inorganic acid consumption given that ph adjustment is a critical cost factor in treatment more studies on the optimum ph for ha recovery from leachate which can be specific to a leachate are required after fo the normalized mass percent increased for na 1 25 2 95 mg 0 01 0 17 cl 3 49 9 54 and k 0 63 1 62 in the recovered ha however the mass percent of c stayed relatively stable and the mass percent of o decreased from 47 50 to 35 99 the replacement of o with higher molecular weight elements such as na cl k and mg table 1 might have led to increased ha recovery some of those elements such as k and mg are important nutrients for plant growth and thus their increase after fo could be beneficial malhi et al 2005 the o c ratio in the recovered ha after fo treatment decreased from 1 08 to 0 81 meanwhile the absolute phenolic acidity decreased by 44 3 7 0 3 9 meq table s3 those results indicate that the replacement of o by other elements might have happened in the weak acidity zones i e phenolic acidity compared to a standard ha alfa aesar the c content of the recovered ha was almost twice the values of the standard ha in addition several other elements such as mg p s and k showed a higher mass percent the higher carbon content is beneficial to improving soil stability because humic substances are central to enhanced soil aggregation haynes and naidu 1998 the inorganic acid requirement normalized over the recovered ha decreased after the fo treatment fig 3 the acid usage decreased significantly from 6 80 to 3 05 ml g 1 55 1 decrease p 0 05 at ph 1 5 and from 4 87 to 2 61 ml g 1 46 4 decrease p 0 05 at ph 2 0 such a decrease could be related to the decrease in the absolute alkalinity 266 0 177 6 meq after fo treatment likely caused by the movement of the alkalinity causing species i e hco3 co3 2 from the feed leachate into the draw solution driven by a concentration gradient table s4 this movement resulted in 51 3 0 7 meq bicarbonate alkalinity in the diluted draw solution the ph of the draw solution increased from 5 74 0 03 to 8 35 0 01 at which bicarbonate ions would dominate the alkalinity 3 3 fenton s oxidation of leachate the removal of both cod and toc by fenton s oxidation in each of the three cases has demonstrated similar behavior in terms of dod effects and became less responsive to the increased dods i e increased reagent dose probably because of the recalcitrance of the remaining organics jung et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however there are differences among those cases and the overall cod and toc removal performance were enhanced by ha recovery prior to fenton s oxidation the maximum cod removal in case c with ha recovery was 80 3 significantly higher p 0 05 than that in case a 75 2 or b 74 0 fig 4 a the toc removal in case c at dods 0 5 and 1 0 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that of case b fig 4b however at dod 0 25 it was not significantly different possibly because at this dod the ultimate degradation i e conversion to co2 of the fa hpi fraction in case c was significantly lower than that at higher dods for instance the removal of the fa hpi fraction was 63 4 at dod 0 25 while it was higher at 75 6 at dod 0 5 usually ha are converted into lower molecular weight organic fractions after oxidation i e fenton s and those fractions exert a lower cod than the initial organics jung et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however the recovery of ha prior to fenton s oxidation has reduced the possibility of such conversion because of the interconversion of larger molecular weight organics the decrease of toc is always lower than the decrease of cod wang et al 2016 for example at dod of 0 5 case b had 74 0 cod decreased and 63 8 toc decreased the removals of uv absorbance and nh3 n were also enhanced by ha recovery prior to fenton s oxidation the uv absorbance removal in case c 93 2 was higher than that in the other two cases because that the recovery of ha decreased the amount of uv quenching compounds that could have contributed about 47 5 of the total uv absorbance table s5 due to the reduction of ha suva 5 15 0 47 l mg 1 m 1 prior to fenton s oxidation the final effluent suva was lower in case c than other cases table s6 in all three cases suva value decreased below 2 l mg 1 m 1 at all the dods proving that fenton s oxidation has removed or converted most of the aromatic organic structures into aliphatic structures gupta et al 2014 wang et al 2016 like uv absorbance nh3 n removal was higher in case c 55 5 than that in cases a and b because of the removal of 1270 90 mg l 1 nh3 n in ha prior to fenton s application table s7 the overall nh3 n removal in cases a and b was 11 0 31 6 table s7 indicating that hydroxyl radicals generated during fenton s was not highly reactive to ammonia deng and englehardt 2006 these results have clearly demonstrated that the recovery of ha prior to fenton s oxidation can help enhance the removal of organics uv absorbance suva and nh3 n from leachate the enhanced removal of uv absorbance and ammonia nitrogen prior to any biological co treatment of leachate with conventional wastewater would help maintain uv disinfection effectiveness and biological nitrogen removal reinhart and bolyard 2015 zhao et al 2013a 3 4 reduction of reagent requirements and sludge generation assuming the reagent requirements in case a as 100 the major reagents including feso4 7h2o h2o2 h2so4 and naoh have shown a generally decreasing trend in cases b and c though behaving differently fig 5 a the volume of inorganic acid or base requirement normalized over g cod removed decreased after fo treatment and or ha recovery for example at dod 0 5 case a consumed 1 05 ml 0 25 m h2so4 per g of cod removed which decreased to 0 72 ml 0 25 m h2so4 per g of cod in case b and to 0 87 ml 0 25 m h2so4 per g of cod in case c fig 5b this corresponded to 38 4 and 25 2 decrease in h2so4 requirement in cases b and c compared to that of case a fig 5a the possible reason was the decrease in absolute alkalinity of the raw leachate after fo treatment as discussed previously a higher acid consumption in case c than that in case b was due to the ph adjustment for ha recovery although this consumption also served the purpose of initial ph adjustment for the subsequent fenton s oxidation likewise the consumption of base solution also decreased from 5 92 ml 10 m naoh per g cod removed in case a to 5 53 ml 10 m naoh per g cod in case b and to 4 19 ml 10 m naoh per g cod in case c fig 5b this decrease corresponded to 13 9 and 34 6 base decrease in cases b and c compared to case a fig 5a this decrease was mainly because of the lower feso4 7h2o dose in cases b and c than case a attributed to the lower organics concentration after fo and ha recovery as the major base requirement in fenton s comes from neutralization of residual fe species into ferric hydroxo complexes for effective coagulation removal of organics deng and englehardt 2006 kang and hwang 2000 neyens and baeyens 2003 in addition the decrease in base requirement was enhanced by the absolute acidity decrease of the fa hpi fraction from 219 0 6 meq raw leachate to 89 1 1 1 meq after fo treatment and a reduction of 12 2 0 1 meq absolute acidity from fo concentrate because of ha recovery table s3 the significantly higher cod removal in case c compared to cases a and b contributed as another factor for the significantly lower base requirement normalized over cod removed in case c than cases a and b the consumption of feso4 7h2o and h2o2 decreased by 10 each for case b and 35 each for case c compared to case a benefited from the lower cod concentrations attributed to the substrate movement to the fo draw side and ha recovery respectively those results have demonstrated that the applications of fo and ha recovery can reduce the overall reagents requirement for fenton s oxidation of leachate another benefit of the ha recovery was the significant reduction of sludge generation from fenton s oxidation the absolute mass of generated sludge in cases a and b at dod 0 5 was 83 9 1 7 g and 76 4 1 4 g respectively this has significantly decreased to 59 5 1 2 g in case c that had the ha recovery fig 6 sludge generation in case b was 8 9 lower p 0 05 than that in case a fig 6 likely because of the loss of organics during fo concentration as demonstrated by 440 mg l 1 toc in the fo draw solution table s2 which reduced the reagents dose requirements the 29 reduction in fenton s sludge after fo treatment and ha recovery in case c which was also because of the lower fenton s reagents dose would greatly decrease the expense associated with sludge disposal 3 5 perspectives of recovered resources despite the advantages and benefits demonstrated by the results we must also note that the proposed system has two major challenges to address water recovery from diluted draw solution from fo and applications of recovered ha the concentrate from fo is further treated by ha recovery and fenton s oxidation the recovered water diluted draw solution on the other hand will also need a post treatment to separate draw solute and the recovered water to obtain reusable water a typical separation method is to use reverse osmosis ro which can generate a high quality water for either reuse or direct discharge although ro could be energy intensive the diluted draw solution is a much simpler liquid than leachate and thus it is expected to have less membrane fouling and energy consumption when treating the diluted draw solution as discussed previously shaffer et al 2015 the incorporation of ro as a post treatment after fo can be more energy efficient for high strength wastewater e g leachate than an standalone ro unit this is because of the lower susceptibility and higher reversibility of fo membrane fouling than ro the recovered ha may be used as fertilizer or soil stabilizer although further purification would be needed for agricultural applications the composition may need adjustment as demonstrated by a previous study that amended an ultrafiltration recovered liquid ha with extra nutrients n p and k to meet the guideline of liquid fertilizers xu et al 2017 the adjustment of the nutrients content can be accomplished by simple addition of external nutrients however the toxicity of the ha towards plants and soil microbial population should be determined as discussed previously the leachate recovered ha have a higher carbon content than the commercial counterpart this is highly desirable for application as a soil stabilizer in regions where soil erosion is dominant however the toxicity to soil microbiota still needs careful investigation 4 conclusions this study has presented a successful integration of fo and ha recovery with fenton s oxidation to treat landfill leachate with notable benefits of reduced chemical reagents and decreased sludge production some specific conclusions are as follows fo treatment has decreased the volume of leachate and also reduced its alkalinity attributed to the concentration gradient driven movement of the alkalinity causing species resulting in the decreased h2so4 requirement from 4 87 ml g 1 to 2 61 ml g 1 during the subsequent ha recovery at ph 2 ha recovery increased from 1 86 to 2 45 g l 1 at ph 2 after fo treatment of raw leachate likely because of the replacement of o in the weak acidity zones of ha by other elements i e cl na k with higher molecular weight the incorporation of ha recovery prior to fenton s oxidation has improved the removal of cod toc uv absorbance and nh3 n benefited from the removal of humic substances during ha recovery with both fo and ha recovery the overall reagents requirement by fenton s oxidation has decreased by 25 2 for h2so4 34 6 for naoh 35 for feso4 7h2o and h2o2 at dod 0 5 sludge volume decreased significantly by 29 mainly because of the lower reagent dose for lower organics concentrations a smaller sludge generation will reduce the requirement for handling of ferric based sludge declaration of interests the authors declare that

corresponding author trace organic contaminants trocs often pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants cas wwtps and are discharged into surface waters where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health largely due to the hormone disrupting effects of certain trocs the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process is a cost effective means of upgrading cas wwtps by adding free floating carrier media which promotes biofilm formation in the well mixed suspended growth reactors providing a potential niche for slow growing microorganisms although ifas upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal limited bench and pilot scale data indicate that troc removal may also be improved however only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full scale ifas wwtps have been published to date and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full scale ifas wwtps in this study six full scale ifas wwtps were surveyed to quantify troc and estrogenic activity removal twenty four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent pre disinfection were analyzed for total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp estrogenic activity and 98 trocs the biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase i e mixed liquor and ifas media was also assessed all ifas wwtps performed well in terms of tss cod and ammonia removal tn removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2 5 to 7 6 g with 40 60 attached to media trocs with no detection 17 and those with high median removal 23 90 average removal were observed other trocs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies qualitative comparison with cas literature shows potentially higher ifas removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench or pilot scale studies atenolol diclofenac gemfibrozil deet 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol as well as the chlorinated flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp effluent estrogenic activity was found to be similar to that reported for full scale cas wwtps these results provide the first survey of multiple full scale ifas wwtps employing mobile plastic carrier media in terms of

pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disrupting compounds trace organic contaminants estrogenic activity municipal wastewater integrated fixed film activated sludge 1 introduction the incomplete removal of a variety of trace organic contaminants trocs during the treatment of domestic wastewater is an issue of growing concern these contaminants which include pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones industrial chemicals and pesticides are known to pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants cas wwtps resulting in their discharge to surface waters where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health by mimicking natural hormones e g estrogen and disrupting the endocrine systems of exposed individuals eggen et al 2014 in addition to estrogenicity the potential for complex mixtures of trocs in wastewater to exert toxicity through a number of modes of action has been demonstrated using a wide range of in vitro bioassays escher et al 2014 kusk et al 2011 in vitro bioassays which can be used to measure the mixture effects of many trocs and their unknown metabolites in wastewater samples are an important compliment to targeted chemical analysis removal of trocs in cas wwtps occurs through biological transformation adsorption volatilization and abiotic degradation with biological transformation generally considered to be the dominant mechanism margot et al 2013b petrie et al 2014 overall removal is governed by both the physical chemical properties of the compound and wwtp operational conditions falås et al 2016 tadkaew et al 2011 for instance it has been observed that solids retention time srt is positively correlated with the removal of certain trocs up to a critical value of 10 15 days beyond which increasing the srt has a lesser effect clara et al 2005 falås et al 2016 enhanced troc removal at higher srts is thought to be due to the enrichment of a more diverse microbial community e g enriching slow growing microbes petrie et al 2014 the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process has been gaining popularity in the u s and europe in recent decades as a cost effective means of retrofitting cas wwtps to increase overall treatment capacity enhance nitrogen removal improve process stability reduce sludge production and enhance sludge settleability rosso et al 2011 state of the art ifas upgrades involve the addition of free floating plastic carrier media to a cas wwtp which promotes biofilm formation in the well mixed suspended growth reactors the retention of carrier media in treatment basins effectively decouples the srt of the biofilm microbes from that of the suspended microbes and allows for the establishment of distinct microbial populations in each compartment for example nitrifying bacteria which prefer longer srts 15 d can be enriched in the biofilm while the srt of suspended biomass is kept low to accommodate polyphosphate accumulating organisms preferring shorter srts onnis hayden et al 2011 likewise microbes contributing to enhanced troc removal at long srts could be preferentially retained in the biofilm in addition to the aforementioned benefits of ifas systems there is limited bench and pilot scale data suggesting that troc removal may be enhanced in these systems falås et al 2013 2012 jewell et al 2016 kim et al 2009 murray et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 in bench scale studies enhanced removal of several pharmaceuticals has been demonstrated to occur in biofilms or systems with a biofilm component when compared to suspended biomass alone compounds exhibiting differential removal at the bench scale include atenolol clofibric acid diclofenac gemfibrozil ketoprofen mefenamic acid and trimethoprim with diclofenac being the compound for which differential removal is most commonly identified falås et al 2013 2012 jewell et al 2016 murray et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 pilot scale assessments have also demonstrated improved removal of several trocs e g bisphenol a deet diclofenac triclosan octylphenol nonylphenol estriol 17α ethynylestradiol and others and enhanced removal of estrogenic activity by an ifas treatment train as compared to a cas treatment train operated in parallel de la torre et al 2015 kim et al 2009 mousaab et al 2015 however joss et al 2005 observed no difference in the removal of selected pharmaceuticals and fragrances between a full scale cas treatment train and a system with a biofilm component biostyr fixed bed treatment train despite the implications that troc removal may be improved in ifas systems no comprehensive survey of troc removal or the removal of estrogenic activity in full scale ifas wwtps has been published to date and there are only a few limited reports on the removal of trocs in full scale systems typically targeting a small number of compounds in one or two ifas wwtps falås et al 2013 jewell et al 2016 in this study six full scale ifas wwtps were surveyed to quantify the removal of 98 trocs and estrogenic activity troc removals were compared to the cas literature and compounds with potentially enhanced removal in ifas wwtps were identified the broad scope of this study in terms of the number of wwtps sampled and the number of compounds targeted is intended to elucidate the behavior of trocs in full scale ifas wwtps and provide a basis for future work focusing on compounds identified to have potentially enhanced removal in full scale ifas vs cas wwtps given the widespread use of cas wwtps in the u s and europe increasingly stringent effluent nitrogen limits and the ubiquitous discharge of trocs from these facilities into surface waters it is important to better understand the potential to simultaneously enhance troc and nitrogen removal through ifas upgrades to existing treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of wastewater treatment plants six municipal ifas wwtps with design capacities of 0 15 50 million gallons per day mgd were selected for this survey selected wwtps are located in the eastern united states ct ny pa ri and va for their relative proximity to the principle investigator s laboratory the pennsylvania state university university park pa all wwtps in this survey contain free floating ifas media in at least one basin of their secondary treatment train though the overall secondary treatment configuration and type of media varies for each ifas wwtp table 1 table 2 at the request of several municipalities all ifas wwtps will remain anonymous and will be referred to using a generic id wwtp a f ordered by plant size 2 2 sample collection each ifas wwtp was sampled during a separate 24 h period in september october 2015 treatment plants were sampled mid week during typical flow conditions composite samples of influent to the secondary treatment system hereafter influent and secondary effluent prior to disinfection hereafter effluent were split from routinely collected samples when possible when the total volume of the routine sample was insufficient or when samples were not routinely collected at the location required for this study e g pre disinfection portable composite samplers were deployed for each wwtp composite samples of influent and effluent were collected simultaneously during the same 24 h period and samplers were either refrigerated 4 c or packed with ice portable samplers composite samples were field preserved in secondary containers immediately following the collection period in most cases and always within 8 h held at 4 c for troc analysis 40 ml of composite sample was transferred into amber glass vials containing 5 mg ascorbic acid and 2 56 mg sodium omadine as preservatives vanderford et al 2012 vials with preservative were provided by eurofins eaton analytical inc which was contracted to analyze the samples for trocs for in house analyses additional sample was decanted into traceclean 1 l amber glass boston round bottles vwr usa or equivalent already containing preservative for standard endpoints chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen ammonia and total phosphorus each 1 l bottle contained 2 ml of sulfuric acid to yield a final ph 2 according to standard methods clesceri et al 1998 acid preserved sample was also used for the determination of total suspended solids for the analysis of estrogenic activity each 1 l bottle contained 1 g of ascorbic acid as preservative ihara et al 2015 field preserved influent effluent samples were immediately placed on ice and transported to the laboratory within 12 h following the 24 h composite period grab samples of suspended biomass i e mixed liquor ml and ifas carrier media cm were collected from select locations within the secondary treatment system table 1 a large ladle was used to retrieve both ml and cm from approximately 0 5 m below the surface of the well mixed basins ml was decanted from the ladle into a sterile 1 l wide mouth polypropylene bottle leaving cm behind the cm was then transferred to a separate sterile 1 l wide mouth polypropylene bottle and rinsed en masse using approximately 300 ml of sterile distilled de ionized ddi water rinsing was repeated twice to ensure that only adherent biofilm remained on cm for later biomass quantification two biological replicates were collected from different locations within the same basin with an approximate 5 min delay between sampling all biological samples were immediately placed on ice and transported back to the laboratory all ml cm and field preserved influent effluent samples were stored at 4 c until they could be processed as described in section 2 3 2 3 sample preparation and analysis 2 3 1 standard chemical endpoints chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss ammonia and total phosphorus tp were measured according to standard methods 5220 d for cod 2540 d for tss 4500 nh3 d for ammonia 4500 p e for tp clesceri et al 1998 samples were not filtered prior to determining cod ammonia and tp total nitrogen tn was determined after filtering 0 45 μm using a shimadzu toc vcsh csn analyzer shimadzu columbia md nitrate was quantified by each wwtp using disinfected effluent collected during a nearly identical compositing interval as the pre disinfection effluent sample collected for this study except wwtp c which used the pre disinfection sample 2 3 2 solids inventory ml samples were analyzed for suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss according to standard methods 2540 d for mlss 2540 e for mlvss clesceri et al 1998 cm attached solids hereafter biofilm solids were quantified by drying cm n 10 to a constant weight at 105 c then soaking in 5 m sulfuric acid for 48 h after which each piece was thoroughly brushed clean rinsed and dried to a constant mass the mass of biofilm solids was determined as the difference in mass between the biofilm colonized media and acid cleaned media and was normalized on the basis of carrier media surface area measured values for suspended and biofilm solids were converted to a per liter of reactor contents basis accounting for displacement of ml by cm so that the contribution of each type of solids to the total solids in the reactor could be calculated see supplemental information for more details 2 3 3 trace organic contaminants trocs field preserved influent effluent samples were shipped overnight on ice to eurofins eaton analytical inc monrovia ca usa where they were analyzed for 98 trocs including various pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones industrial chemicals and pesticides table s1 quantification of liquid phase troc concentrations was carried out according to the methods described in oppenheimer et al 2011 which include the use of an automated online solid phase extraction high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry spe hplc ms ms system equipped with electrospray ionization esi both esi positive and esi negative modes were used to cover the broad range of target compounds censored data points reported by eurofins eaton analytical as not detected nd were carefully scrutinized and substituted with numerical data to facilitate the calculation of removal efficiencies measurements for which there was no instrument response and concentrations reported as negative were assigned a value of zero while concentrations reported as a positive value between zero and the method reporting limit mrl were assigned a value of one half of the mrl all other data points were used as reported by eurofins eaton analytical dilution corrected mrls for each targeted compound in each sample as well as esi mode and cas number for each compound analyzed are provided as supplementary information table s1 physical chemical properties of all detected trocs are detailed in table s2 removal efficiency was calculated as follows 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y t r o c x i n f t r o c x e f f t r o c x i n f x 100 where trocx inf and trocx eff are the concentration of an individual trace organic contaminant in the influent and effluent respectively the quartile based coefficient of variation qcv was calculated as

solvent acetone or methanol meoh one liter of field preserved sample section 2 2 was filtered fractionally through ap 40 glass fiber filters 0 7 μm emd millipore billerica ma usa previously cleaned with 5 ml of meoh and 5 ml of ddi water filtered sample was loaded onto preconditioned 5 ml meoh followed by 5 ml ddi water oasis hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridges waters milford ma usa using a visiprep spe vacuum manifold supelco bellefonte pa usa at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min 1 following sample loading cartridges were rinsed with 10 ml of 5 meoh in ddi water and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas for 1 1 5 h dried cartridges were eluted with 10 ml of meoh resulting in a 100x concentrated extract extracts in meoh were stored at 20 c until estrogenic activity assays could be carried out 2 3 5 estrogenic activity analysis estrogenic activity against the human estrogen receptors erα and erβ was determined using the commercially available human nuclear receptor assay kits nr3a1 and nr3a2 respectively indigo biosciences state college pa usa the assays use non human mammalian cells which have been modified to possess a luciferase reporter gene functionally linked to an estrogen receptor responsive promoter assay sensitivity and extract toxicity were evaluated during screening trials wherein test dilutions were selected a priori and the toxicity toward reporter cells was monitored using the live cell multiplex assay lcm assay product lcm 01 indigo biosciences state college pa usa in addition to its use in the initial screening the lcm assay was incorporated into all subsequent assay runs in order to provide an additional quality control metric for reporter cell vitality for erβ high reporter cell sensitivity allowed for the wastewater extracts to be diluted to concentrations below the toxicity threshold of the reporter cells yet still above the maximal effective concentration emax therefore full dose response curves triplicate for each sample could be generated for erβ for erα sample extracts were toxic to reporter cells at dilutions near emax preventing the analysis of full dose response curves as an alternative replicate n 3 measurements of luciferase response at four selected extract concentrations total n 12 were used to back calculate the 17β estradiol equivalents eeq for samples based on the fitted dose response curve for the reference agonist on the same plate see supplemental information for more details all assays were performed in 96 well plates using 17β estradiol as the reference agonist in triplicate assays were performed according to the technical manuals except for the modified plate configurations mentioned above and the following 1 sample extracts and reference agonist were prepared and serially diluted in plate using meoh and the meoh was allowed to evaporate overnight in a laminar flow hood prior to re suspending the compounds in the provided compound screening medium 2 cell recovery medium containing the reporter cells was added to the wells following the addition of compounds screening medium sigmoidal dose response curve regressions were carried out using graphpad prism 6 07 for windows graphpad software san diego california usa for erα replicates were excluded when cytotoxicity was apparent based on lcm assay or if the relative induction of luciferase response was too low and calculated eeq values within each group of 12 replicates were considered outliers and excluded if they fell outside of the interquartile range iqr by more than 1 5 iqr see supplemental information

ties are present in the input data 3 results 3 1 standard chemical analysis all six ifas wwtps performed well in terms of the removal of tss 91 99 cod 86 96 and ammonia 98 table 3 tn removal was found to be highly variable 48 7 94 4 as a result of variable denitrification with wwtps a b and d performing worst nitrate levels were 24 of the influent nitrogen as n in the poorest performing plant wwtp b as expected the only plant with anoxic ifas media wwtp e had the lowest effluent nitrate and highest tn removal 94 4 suggesting that the anoxic biofilm may have enhanced denitrification however this plant was also the only plant configured for post denitrification with meoh added as a supplementary carbon source total phosphorus removals also varied widely 30 96 wwtp d which was the only plant configured specifically for phosphorus removal a2 o configuration was outperformed by two other systems which were primarily designed to remove nitrogen wwtps a c bardenpho in all the six wwtps were performing well at the time of sampling indicating that the troc data presented here are representative of normal operation for these plants 3 2 solids inventory biofilm solids ranged from 4 15 to 21 5 g m 2 on a dry mass basis apparently correlating with biofilm thickness and cm coverage fig 1 these values are in line with values reported in the literature for a full scale demonstration plant treating domestic wastewater 2 4 12 6 g m 2 regmi et al 2011 mlss concentrations were within expected values but varied significantly between wwtps 1430 3560 mg l 1 with the volatile fraction ranging from 0 7 to 0 86 fig 2 total solids per liter of reactor contents ranged from 2 5 to 7 6 g on a dry mass basis across all ifas wwtps the fraction of total solids associated with the biofilm ranged from 40 to 60 fig 3 in other words the presence of ifas media roughly doubled the amount of solids biomass in each reactor 3 3 trace organic contaminants trocs the individual concentrations of detected trocs across all six wwtps spanned nearly six orders of magnitude in the influent 5 670 000 ng l 1 and five orders of magnitude in the effluent 6 68 000 ng l 1 of the 98 trocs targeted in this study 46 were frequently detected n 3 in influent wastewater at concentrations above the mrl table 4 and will be the focus of the results and discussion unless otherwise noted twenty three of the frequently detected trocs exhibited high median removal efficiencies across the six ifas wwtps 90 while 14 were moderately removed 50 90 six were poorly removed 0 50 and three compounds exhibited negative median removal efficiencies effluent only detection occurred in at least one ifas wwtp for 33 of the target trocs preventing the calculation of percent removals in those cases negative removal efficiencies were also observed in at least one instance for 11 of the targeted trocs seventeen trocs were not detected in any sample and included various antibiotics and pesticides along with several non antibiotic pharmaceuticals table s3 of the trocs that were infrequently detected in ifas wwtp primary effluent table s4 most were observed at concentrations near or below the mrl with several notable exceptions 1 the steroid hormones 17α ethynylestradiol 17β estradiol andorostenedione and progesterone were each detected above the mrl in the influent of one to two ifas wwtps concentrations ranging from 0 016 to 0 34 μg l 1 2 the pharmaceutical salicylic acid was detected at a high influent concentration 57 5 μg l 1 in wwtp b and only in the effluent of wwtps cf at concentrations ranging from 0 34 to 11 μg l 1 see section 4 1 1 for discussion of negative removal efficiencies and effluent only detection 3 the flame retardant tcep occurred at elevated levels in the influent of wwtp a 3 9 μg l 1 and 4 the antibiotics chloramphenicol and erythromycin were each detected in the influent of two ifas wwtps at concentrations ranging from 0 045 μg l 1 to 0 54 μg l 1 3 4 estrogenic activity among the six ifas wwtps surveyed in this study influent 17β estradiol equivalents eeqs ranged from 22 1 to 81 7 ng l 1 and 56 2 160 4 ng l 1 for erα and erβ respectively effluent eeqs ranged from not detected to 10 9 ng l 1 and from 1 94 to 19 42 ng l 1 for erα and erβ respectively removal efficiencies ranged from 51 2 to 100 and 78 9 98 8 for erα and erβ respectively fig 4 in three of the six ifas wwtps erα removal efficiency was equal to that of erβ for the remaining three wwtps notable differences between erα and erβ removal efficiencies were observed 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence and removal of trocs in ifas wwtps the range of influent troc concentrations in this study was consistent with data from the literature luo et al 2014 verlicchi et al 2012 trocs with the highest median influent concentrations were mostly over the counter and unregulated drugs drug metabolites and food additives as has been previously reported jones et al 2017 luo et al 2014 for example three of the compounds with median influent concentrations exceeding 1 μg l 1 were the over the counter pain relievers acetaminophen 32 5 μg l 1 ibuprofen 6 4 μg l 1 and naproxen 4 8 μg l 1 caffeine and its metabolite 1 7 dimethylxanthine as well as a metabolite of nicotine cotinine were also observed at high median influent concentrations 44 μg l 1 1 7 μg l 1 and 1 35 μg l 1 respectively food additives constituents found at high median influent concentrations included the non nutritive sweeteners sucralose 24 5 μg l 1 and acesulfame 19 μg l 1 as well as theobromine 1 75 μg l 1 which is found in cacao and tea leaves the prescription drugs present in the influent at the highest median concentrations included the antibiotics amoxicillin 10 5 μg l 1 and azithromycin 1 68 μg l 1 the beta blocker atenolol 1 65 μg l 1 and the x ray contrast media iohexol 3 3 μg l 1 median effluent concentrations remained above 1 μg l 1 for sucralose 28 5 μg l 1 iohexol 3 3 μg l 1 and amoxicillin 1 6 μg l 1 based on median removal efficiencies highly removed trocs 90 included caffeine antimicrobials parabens triclocarban triclosan steroid hormones estrone and estriol non flame retardant industrial chemicals alkylphenols and bisphenol a drug metabolites 1 7 dimethylxanthine cotinine theobromine and most analgesics except diclofenac which had a 86 5 median removal efficiency most antibiotics contrast agents and flame retardants were moderately or poorly removed notably the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diltiazem and fluoxetine were very poorly removed median removal efficiencies 14 3 35 6 carbamazepine is among the most recalcitrant of trocs and has previously been identified to be poorly removed with biofilm carriers as well as with activated sludge falås et al 2013 the compounds primidone sucralose and sulfamethoxazole had negative median removal efficiencies of 1 2 16 3 and 44 3 respectively while data regarding troc removal in full scale ifas wwtps is scarce one recent study measured the removal efficiency of several compounds that were also investigated here they found removal efficiencies for atenolol 25 carbamazepine 0 diclofenac 20 and trimethoprim 0 which were less than the median removal efficiencies for the same compounds in this study 87 4 14 3 86 5 and 52 8 falås et al 2013 another study investigated the removal of diclofenac in a full scale ifas wwtp and found similar removal efficiency to the median found in this study 88 over a 10 day monitoring campaign vs 86 5 in this study most highly removed and moderately removed compounds showed consistent removal efficiencies across ifas wwtps i e low qcv with the exception of 4 nonylphenol 4 tert octylphenol cyanazine azithromycin metroprolol and trimethoprim for which at least one negative removal efficiency was observed the poorly removed pharamaceuticals carbamazepine diltiazem and fluoxetine had highly variable removal efficiencies qcv 1 68 1 98 indicating that wwtp operating parameters microbial community composition or other factors which vary from one ifas wwtp to another may play a more important role in the removal of these compounds compounds with negative median removal efficiencies also showed high variability the contrast agents iopromide and iohexol and the flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp had consistently moderate to poor removal efficiency across ifas wwtps qcv 0 5 0 7 in general the widest range of median removal efficiencies was observed between compounds in the pharmaceutical class reflective of the wide array of chemical structures present in this broad end use category chemical structure has previously been identified as a key factor in determining the fate of trocs in wastewater treatment specifically hydrophobicity and the presence of electron donating groups edgs are thought to be positively correlated with compound removal efficiency while the presence of electron withdrawing groups ewgs is thought to negatively impact removal efficiencies tadkaew et al 2011 in the present study several compounds appeared to conform to these expectations including carbamazepine and primidone which both contain strong ewgs and were poorly removed however diclofenac and deet which also contain strong ewgs were rather well removed here in contrast to the study by tadkaew et al 2011 gemfibrozil ibuprofen and atenolol edgs present were well removed in the present study though sulfamethoxazole was not despite the presence of an edg and in contrast to the results of tadkaew et al 2011 compounds may also contain both ewg and edg e g trimethoprim further complicating this method of structure based classification in general the presence of ewgs and edgs did not clearly correlate with removal efficiencies for this data set in terms of hydrophobicity kendall rank correlation showed no significant relationship between log dow at ph 7 table s2 and the median removal efficiency of frequently detected compounds τ 0 072 p value 0 49 recognizing that the test could be affected by the right censored removal efficiencies i e maximum 100 data were reassessed after excluding pairs for which median removal was equal to 100 this resulted in increased significance ρ 0 21 p value 0 08 indicating a slight positive correlation between log dow and median removal efficiencies for frequently detected compounds which were not completely removed similar to previous reports the compounds with the highest log dow e g 3 5 were all highly removed i e 90 however this is restricted to a small number of compounds in the present study 4 nonylphenol 4 tert octylphenol bisphenol a estrone triclocarban triclosan compounds with log dow of 0 2 exhibited the widest range of median removal efficiencies and those compounds with negative median removal efficiencies had log dow of 1 to 1 fig s1 4 1 1 limitations of calculated removal efficiencies as a measure of treatment while removal efficiencies are a convenient measure of the level of treatment of various compounds in wwtps caution must be used in interpreting these values for instance a compound which is present in the influent at very high levels e g 4 nonylphenol in wwtp a 29 μg l 1 could exhibit a high removal efficiency e g 95 8 yet a considerable concentration could remain in the effluent e g 1 2 μg l 1 in other cases left censoring data i e replacement with 0 5 mrl can result in observed removal efficiencies which appear to be lower than they actually are finally monitoring the removal of targeted trocs does not account for incomplete degradation and the possible accumulation of metabolites though this can be partially addressed through the use of in vitro bioassays and other measures of overall toxicity of the treated effluent negative removal efficiencies and effluent only detection are commonly reported in the literature for several compounds and are likely due to the microbially mediated reversion of influent human metabolites back to parent compounds or day to day fluctuations in influent concentration luo et al 2014 the former is likely to be true for pharmaceuticals including sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine diltiazem and fluoxetine which showed negative removal in more than one instance in this study and salicylic acid which was detected in the effluent but not the influent in 5 out of 6 ifas wwtps salicylic acid is a metabolite of aspirin which is further metabolized to form gluconoride conjugates allowing for possible deconjugation within the wwtp and subsequent increases in concentration as has been reported for other compounds verlicchi et al 2012 human metabolites of sucralose are not expected to be present in the influent in large quantities as it is only 3 metabolized in the human body roberts et al 2000 however negative removals of 13 3 to 27 8 were detected in four of six ifas wwtps this may be due to day to day fluctuations in influent concentrations not captured by 24 h composite samples or another unknown mechanism 4 2 measured removal of trocs in ifas wwtps vs literature values for cas wwtps the efficiency of troc removal in cas wwtps has been widely reviewed in recent years and several authors clearly present aggregated data luo et al 2014 margot et al 2015 rojas et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 these aggregated data include values from cas wwtps with varying secondary configurations solids retention times srts and other operating parameters e g seasonal temperature fluctuations limiting the ability to make quantitative comparisons between cas literature data and the removal efficiencies measured in the ifas wwtps in this study nevertheless they are a valuable resource given the large volume of individual studies documenting troc removal efficiencies as such these aggregated data have been used as the primary source to draw general comparisons between troc removal efficiencies in cas wwtps and the ifas wwtps investigated in this study literature referenced here for conventional activated sludge wwtps includes those employing enhanced biological nutrient removal bnr with various solids retention times but excludes membrane bioreactors mbrs and systems with a biofilm component to minimize the impact of outlying values median removal efficiencies are preferentially included here where available table 5 lists the median removal efficiencies measured in this study as well as the median or average removal efficiency for cas wwtps based on aggregated data when available in other cases ranges or estimates i e 50 were more appropriate due to limited data for those compounds with published median or average cas removals a first approximation of the relative removals in these ifas wwtps can be made by comparison however comparisons with published median or average values from the cas literature should be interpreted with caution the sample of ifas wwtps is small and by necessity it is skewed toward newer upgraded wwtps which all perform nitrification at moderately high srts whereas the literature values include both nitrifying and non nitrifying cas wwtps with a range of srts referring to table 5 the median removal efficiency within ifas wwtps compared favorably to the median or average removals reported for cas wwtps for most trocs ifas wwtp removals were greater by more than ten percentage points for atenolol diclofenac azithromycin gemfibrozil metoprolol deet naproxen 4 nonylphenol 4 tert octylphenol and bisphenol a compounds for which ifas removal efficiencies were zero to ten percentage points greater than cas removal efficiencies include acetaminophen caffeine estriol estrone ibuprofen triclosan and trimethoprim ifas removal efficiencies were less than those reported for cas wwtps for the compounds sulfamethoxazole fluoxetine diltiazem and carbamazepine for the remaining frequently detected trocs robust estimates of median or average removal efficiencies for cas wwtps were not readily available however some were generally indicated to be highly removed in cas wwtps 90 and significantly higher ifas removals are not expected 1 7 dimethylxanthine parabens cotinine theobromine theophylline and triclocarban other compounds have extremely variable reported removal efficiencies for cas wwtps making comparison difficult acesulfame amoxicillin cimetidine iohexol and iopromide interestingly castronovo et al 2017 surveyed 13 activated sludge wastewater treatment plants for the removal of acesulfame one of which was an ifas wwtp in their study the acesulfame was readily removed by most cas wwtps but the ifas wwtp showed the lowest removal efficiency average 57 though it also had the lowest srt of the wwtps studied in contrast past reports of acesulfame removal in cas wwtps have typically shown very low removal efficiencies acesulfame was well removed in the present study median 94 3 there was sparse data in the literature regarding cas wwtp removal efficiencies for several trocs however some general comparisons can be drawn for the flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp nearly all reported removal efficiencies are near zero or negative in this study the median removals of these two compounds are clearly above zero at 46 5 n 6 and 47 8 n 3 respectively indicating potentially enhanced removal of these flame retardants in ifas wwtps removal efficiencies for sucralose in cas wwtps are generally reported to be very low in fact sucralose has been proposed as an indicator of wastewater loading to surface waters due to its recalcitrance in wwtps oppenheimer et al 2011 sucralose removal efficiencies were low here as well suggesting no improvement in these ifas wwtps the median removal efficiency of primidone in these ifas wwtps median 1 was below the reported range of 16 50 in cas wwtps whereas removal efficiencies for the analgesic lidocaine and the pesticide 2 4 d were similar in ifas wwtps and cas wwtps only a single data point was found in the literature for the removal of butalbital and meprobamate in cas wwtps and median removals compared favorably 80 vs 65 and 68 vs 34 respectively finally no literature data could be found for cas removal of cyanazine or warfarin to the authors best knowledge this is the first report of removal efficiencies for cyanazine and warfarin in activated sludge based treatment of municipal wastewater of those compounds that showed the highest deviation from published median or average removals in cas wwtps atenolol diclofenac gemfibrozil deet 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol have been previously indicated to be better removed in hybrid biofilm suspended growth systems falås et al 2013 2012 kim et al 2009 murray et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 however the removal efficiencies of atenolol and deet in cas wwtps are notably variable with high removal efficiencies 90 occasionally reported tran and gin 2017 diclofenac is among the most commonly studied wastewater troc and is commonly cited to have differential removal in systems with and without biofilm carrier media jewell et al 2016 investigated the transformation of diclofenac in bench scale batch experiments using carrier media and activated sludge from full scale wwtps from the observed transformation products they inferred that hydroxylation decarboxylation oxidation amide formation ring opening and reductive dechlorination were possible degradation pathways diclofenac was removed via similar reaction pathways but more rapidly when in contact with carrier media than with activated sludge alone while reductive dechlorination was a minor contributor to the overall removal of diclofenac it was only observed to occur in contact with carrier media this effect could be due to dissolved oxygen gradients present in the biofilm interestingly the chlorinated flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp appear to be better removed in ifas wwtps in this study than has been reported for cas wwtps the results of jewell et al 2016 suggest that reductive dechlorination associated with the ifas biofilms could be a mechanism for differential removal in ifas and cas systems however other chlorinated trocs in this study cyanazine 2 4 d triclosan and triclocarban showed similar removal efficiencies to the cas literature and sucralose showed negative median removal in ifas wwtps 4 3 occurrence and removal of estrogenic activity effluent eeqs observed in this study nd to 10 9 ng l 1 and 1 9 19 4 ng l 1 for erα and erβ respectively are similar to values reported in the literature for european cas wwtps 0 5 ng l 1 to 17 9 ng l 1 loos et al 2013 however it is not possible to make direct comparisons of activities determined using different bioassays in part because the assays may target different estrogen receptors endocrine disrupting trocs have been documented to interact differently with erα and erβ estrogen receptors for example metabolites of the pesticide methoxychlor can act as agonists against erα and antagonists against erβ as a result the importance of characterizing the activity of environmental contaminants against both of these receptors has been noted in the literature gaido et al 2000 1999 however most studies of estrogenic activity in wwtps fail to differentiate between erα and erβ activity though some methods capture the combined activity against both receptors e g t47d kbluc wilson et al 2004 furthermore while some studies have investigated the reduction of estrogenic activity by cas wwtps drewes et al 2005 and in a pilot scale ifas treatment train kim et al 2009 there are no reports of estrogenic activity removals in full scale ifas wwtps of the trocs detected in this study 17β estradiol estrone estriol 17α ethynylestradiol bisphenol a 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylyphenol are well documented to possess estrogenic activity campbell et al 2006 the relative potency of these compounds in relation to the natural hormone 17β estradiol has been reported in the literature however equivalency factors vary by assay and receptor and are not available for the assay used in this study making it difficult to compare observed chemical concentrations with bioassay results in general estrone and estriol are 10 100x less potent than 17β estradiol while 17α ethynylestradiol is 2 5x more potent bisphenol a 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol exhibit much weaker estrogenic activity with equivalency factors 4 5 orders of magnitude less than that of 17β estradiol campbell et al 2006 sun et al 2013 while various other potentially estrogenic industrial chemicals e g phthalates pesticides parabens and phytoestrogens may in combination contribute significantly to the overall estrogenic activity of wastewater the majority of this activity is thought to be contributed by natural and synthetic estrogens aerni et al 2004 nakada et al 2004 in this study estrone was the most frequently detected hormone in ifas wwtp influent n 6 and while it was well removed 92 4 median removal efficiency detectable amounts remained in five of the six ifas wwtps estriol was detected in four of six influents but in only one effluent the more potent 17β estradiol and 17α ethynylestradiol were detected sporadically table s4 the highest estrogenic activity against both erα and erβ receptors was found for wwtp a 81 7 ng l 1 and 160 4 ng l 1 eeq respectively which also had the least preliminary primary treatment and the highest influent concentrations of 17α ethynylestradiol estriol and estrone estrone was the only estrogen quantified in the effluent at a concentration above the mrl 20 ng l 1 wwtp f and this effluent showed the highest estrogenic activity against both estrogen receptors reasons for the differential removal of erα and erβ activity in wwtps c e and f are unclear however it is logical to assume this is due to the differential removal of compounds which act more strongly against one receptor than the other 4 4 ifas operating conditions and overall plant performance in order to assess the overall performance of the ifas wwtps in this study a meta analysis was conducted wherein the number of compounds falling into various removal ranges were counted for each wwtp fig 5 compounds for which removal efficiencies could not be calculated see table 4 were excluded the number of compounds included for each wwtp ranged from 43 to 47 the fraction of compounds with high removal efficiencies 80 100 ranged from 0 5 in wwtp d to 0 8 in wwtp c wwtp operational conditions including secondary configuration i e sequence and proportion of aerobic and anoxic treatment zones solids retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and operational temperature are known to influence the removal of trocs luo et al 2014 while there are no clear correlations between these operating parameters and the meta analysis outcomes across all ifas wwtps in this study it is notable that wwtp c with the greatest fraction of highly removed compounds was operating at the highest aerobic srt and temperature 9 7 d 23 c whereas wwtp d with the lowest fraction of highly removed compounds was operating at the lowest aerobic srt and temperature 4 3 d 17 5 c the removal of estrogenic activity can be considered an alternate measure of overall plant performance correlations between the removal of estrogenic activity and overall srt aerobic srt aerobic hrt and temperature were assessed using kendall rank correlation test while no parameter was found to have a statistically significant correlation for the removal of erα or erβ estrogenic activity at a significance level of α 0 05 the correlation between aerobic srt and the removal of erα estrogenic activity was most significant τ 0 733 p value 0 06 a recent study investigated the reduction of various forms of toxicity in several full scale wwtps and found no correlation between the removal of estrogenic activity and process configuration or srt valitalo et al 2017 biofilm thickness has also been shown to influence the diffusion sorption and biodegradation of trocs for example torresi et al 2016 investigated the effect of biofilm thickness in bench scale reactors and found that thicker biofilms had a greater porosity and larger amount of accessible internal surface area leading to greater degree of sorption than thin biofilms which tended to be more compact and diffusion limited in a subsequent study thick biofilms were observed to have the highest specific biotransformation rates for the largest number of trocs but thin biofilms showed the highest biotransformation rates for several of the more recalcitrant compounds e g diclofenac sulfamethoxazole torresi et al 2017 torresi et al suggest that the increased biotransformation rates for many compounds in thick biofilms are a result of increased microbial diversity specifically greater community evenness whereas the enhanced transformation of several recalcitrant compounds in thin biofilms could be attributed to the higher nitrification rate and greater abundance of the ammonia monooxygenase amoa gene in these biofilms in the present study biofilm thickness did appear to vary widely between wwtps fig 1 thickness observed visually but not measured quantitatively however there appears to be no clear correlation between biofilm thickness and overall reduction in troc concentration or the removal of estrogenic activity this could be due to overall differences in the microbial community composition of biofilms between full scale ifas wwtps outweighing any subtle differences in diversity driven by biofilm thickness a forthcoming manuscript will examine the bacterial archaeal and fungal microbial communities within these six ifas wwtps 5 conclusions the most frequently detected trocs in the surveyed ifas wwtps were removed as well or better than what has been reported in the literature for cas wwtps measured troc removal efficiencies in these ifas wwtps provide additional evidence of improved removal for a number of compounds which have been previously identified to be better removed at the bench or pilot scale atenolol diclofenac gemfibrozil deet 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol azithromycin bisphenol a metoprolol and naproxen also show potentially improved removal in these ifas wwtps when compared to the cas literature potentially enhanced removal of chlorinated flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp was observed erβ activity was higher than erα activity in all influent and effluent wastewater and differential removal was shown to occur the

corresponding author trace organic contaminants trocs often pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants cas wwtps and are discharged into surface waters where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health largely due to the hormone disrupting effects of certain trocs the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process is a cost effective means of upgrading cas wwtps by adding free floating carrier media which promotes biofilm formation in the well mixed suspended growth reactors providing a potential niche for slow growing microorganisms although ifas upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal limited bench and pilot scale data indicate that troc removal may also be improved however only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full scale ifas wwtps have been published to date and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full scale ifas wwtps in this study six full scale ifas wwtps were surveyed to quantify troc and estrogenic activity removal twenty four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent pre disinfection were analyzed for total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp estrogenic activity and 98 trocs the biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase i e mixed liquor and ifas media was also assessed all ifas wwtps performed well in terms of tss cod and ammonia removal tn removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2 5 to 7 6 g with 40 60 attached to media trocs with no detection 17 and those with high median removal 23 90 average removal were observed other trocs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies qualitative comparison with cas literature shows potentially higher ifas removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench or pilot scale studies atenolol diclofenac gemfibrozil deet 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol as well as the chlorinated flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp effluent estrogenic activity was found to be similar to that reported for full scale cas wwtps these results provide the first survey of multiple full scale ifas wwtps employing mobile plastic carrier media in terms of basic chemical endpoints removal of ammonia tn tp and cod the distribution of solids within the systems and the removal of trocs and estrogenic activity graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disrupting compounds trace organic contaminants estrogenic activity municipal wastewater integrated fixed film activated sludge 1 introduction the incomplete removal of a variety of trace organic contaminants trocs during the treatment of domestic wastewater is an issue of growing concern these contaminants which include pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones industrial chemicals and pesticides are known to pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants cas wwtps resulting in their discharge to surface waters where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health by mimicking natural hormones e g estrogen and disrupting the endocrine systems of exposed individuals eggen et al 2014 in addition to estrogenicity the potential for complex mixtures of trocs in wastewater to exert toxicity through a number of modes of action has been demonstrated using a wide range of in vitro bioassays escher et al 2014 kusk et al 2011 in vitro bioassays which can be used to measure the mixture effects of many trocs and their unknown metabolites in wastewater samples are an important compliment to targeted chemical analysis removal of trocs in cas wwtps occurs through biological transformation adsorption volatilization and abiotic degradation with biological transformation generally considered to be the dominant mechanism margot et al 2013b petrie et al 2014 overall removal is governed by both the physical chemical properties of the compound and wwtp operational conditions falås et al 2016 tadkaew et al 2011 for instance it has been observed that solids retention time srt is positively correlated with the removal of certain trocs up to a critical value of 10 15 days beyond which increasing the srt has a lesser effect clara et al 2005 falås et al 2016 enhanced troc removal at higher srts is thought to be due to the enrichment of a more diverse microbial community e g enriching slow growing microbes petrie et al 2014 the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process has been gaining popularity in the u s and europe in recent decades as a cost effective means of retrofitting cas wwtps to increase overall treatment capacity enhance nitrogen removal improve process stability reduce sludge production and enhance sludge settleability rosso et al 2011 state of the art ifas upgrades involve the addition of free floating plastic carrier media to a cas wwtp which promotes biofilm formation in the well mixed suspended growth reactors the retention of carrier media in treatment basins effectively decouples the srt of the biofilm microbes from that of the suspended microbes and allows for the establishment of distinct microbial populations in each compartment for example nitrifying bacteria which prefer longer srts 15 d can be enriched in the biofilm while the srt of suspended biomass is kept low to accommodate polyphosphate accumulating organisms preferring shorter srts onnis hayden et al 2011 likewise microbes contributing to enhanced troc removal at long srts could be preferentially retained in the biofilm in addition to the aforementioned benefits of ifas systems there is limited bench and pilot scale data suggesting that troc removal may be enhanced in these systems falås et al 2013 2012 jewell et al 2016 kim et al 2009 murray et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 in bench scale studies enhanced removal of several pharmaceuticals has been demonstrated to occur in biofilms or systems with a biofilm component when compared to suspended biomass alone compounds exhibiting differential removal at the bench scale include atenolol clofibric acid diclofenac gemfibrozil ketoprofen mefenamic acid and trimethoprim with diclofenac being the compound for which differential removal is most commonly identified falås et al 2013 2012 jewell et al 2016 murray et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 pilot scale assessments have also demonstrated improved removal of several trocs e g bisphenol a deet diclofenac triclosan octylphenol nonylphenol estriol 17α ethynylestradiol and others and enhanced removal of estrogenic activity by an ifas treatment train as compared to a cas treatment train operated in parallel de la torre et al 2015 kim et al 2009 mousaab et al 2015 however joss et al 2005 observed no difference in the removal of selected pharmaceuticals and fragrances between a full scale cas treatment train and a system with a biofilm component biostyr fixed bed treatment train despite the implications that troc removal may be improved in ifas systems no comprehensive survey of troc removal or the removal of estrogenic activity in full scale ifas wwtps has been published to date and there are only a few limited reports on the removal of trocs in full scale systems typically targeting a small number of compounds in one or two ifas wwtps falås et al 2013 jewell et al 2016 in this study six full scale ifas wwtps were surveyed to quantify the removal of 98 trocs and estrogenic activity troc removals were compared to the cas literature and compounds with potentially enhanced removal in ifas wwtps were identified the broad scope of this study in terms of the number of wwtps sampled and the number of compounds targeted is intended to elucidate the behavior of trocs in full scale ifas wwtps and provide a basis for future work focusing on compounds identified to have potentially enhanced removal in full scale ifas vs cas wwtps given the widespread use of cas wwtps in the u s and europe increasingly stringent effluent nitrogen limits and the ubiquitous discharge of trocs from these facilities into surface waters it is important to better understand the potential to simultaneously enhance troc and nitrogen removal through ifas upgrades to existing treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of wastewater treatment plants six municipal ifas wwtps with design capacities of 0 15 50 million gallons per day mgd were selected for this survey selected wwtps are located in the eastern united states ct ny pa ri and va for their relative proximity to the principle investigator s laboratory the pennsylvania state university university park pa all wwtps in this survey contain free floating ifas media in at least one basin of their secondary treatment train though the overall secondary treatment configuration and type of media varies for each ifas wwtp table 1 table 2 at the request of several municipalities all ifas wwtps will remain anonymous and will be referred to using a generic id wwtp a f ordered by plant size 2 2 sample collection each ifas wwtp was sampled during a separate 24 h period in september october 2015 treatment plants were sampled mid week during typical flow conditions composite samples of influent to the secondary treatment system hereafter influent and secondary effluent prior to disinfection hereafter effluent were split from routinely collected samples when possible when the total volume of the routine sample was insufficient or when samples were not routinely collected at the location required for this study e g pre disinfection portable composite samplers were deployed for each wwtp composite samples of influent and effluent were collected simultaneously during the same 24 h period and samplers were either refrigerated 4 c or packed with ice portable samplers composite samples were field preserved in secondary containers immediately following the collection period in most cases and always within 8 h held at 4 c for troc analysis 40 ml of composite sample was transferred into amber glass vials containing 5 mg ascorbic acid and 2 56 mg sodium omadine as preservatives vanderford et al 2012 vials with preservative were provided by eurofins eaton analytical inc which was contracted to analyze the samples for trocs for in house analyses additional sample was decanted into traceclean 1 l amber glass boston round bottles vwr usa or equivalent already containing preservative for standard endpoints chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen ammonia and total phosphorus each 1 l bottle contained 2 ml of sulfuric acid to yield a final ph 2 according to standard methods clesceri et al 1998 acid preserved sample was also used for the determination of total suspended solids for the analysis of estrogenic activity each 1 l bottle contained 1 g of ascorbic acid as preservative ihara et al 2015 field preserved influent effluent samples were immediately placed on ice and transported to the laboratory within 12 h following the 24 h composite period grab samples of suspended biomass i e mixed liquor ml and ifas carrier media cm were collected from select locations within the secondary treatment system table 1 a large ladle was used to retrieve both ml and cm from approximately 0 5 m below the surface of the well mixed basins ml was decanted from the ladle into a sterile 1 l wide mouth polypropylene bottle leaving cm behind the cm was then transferred to a separate sterile 1 l wide mouth polypropylene bottle and rinsed en masse using approximately 300 ml of sterile distilled de ionized ddi water rinsing was repeated twice to ensure that only adherent biofilm remained on cm for later biomass quantification two biological replicates were collected from different locations within the same basin with an approximate 5 min delay between sampling all biological samples were immediately placed on ice and transported back to the laboratory all ml cm and field preserved influent effluent samples were stored at 4 c until they could be processed as described in section 2 3 2 3 sample preparation and analysis 2 3 1 standard chemical endpoints chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss ammonia and total phosphorus tp were measured according to standard methods 5220 d for cod 2540 d for tss 4500 nh3 d for ammonia 4500 p e for tp clesceri et al 1998 samples were not filtered prior to determining cod ammonia and tp total nitrogen tn was determined after filtering 0 45 μm using a shimadzu toc vcsh csn analyzer shimadzu columbia md nitrate was quantified by each wwtp using disinfected effluent collected during a nearly identical compositing interval as the pre disinfection effluent sample collected for this study except wwtp c which used the pre disinfection sample 2 3 2 solids inventory ml samples were analyzed for suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss according to standard methods 2540 d for mlss 2540 e for mlvss clesceri et al 1998 cm attached solids hereafter biofilm solids were quantified by drying cm n 10 to a constant weight at 105 c then soaking in 5 m sulfuric acid for 48 h after which each piece was thoroughly brushed clean rinsed and dried to a constant mass the mass of biofilm solids was determined as the difference in mass between the biofilm colonized media and acid cleaned media and was normalized on the basis of carrier media surface area measured values for suspended and biofilm solids were converted to a per liter of reactor contents basis accounting for displacement of ml by cm so that the contribution of each type of solids to the total solids in the reactor could be calculated see supplemental information for more details 2 3 3 trace organic contaminants trocs field preserved influent effluent samples were shipped overnight on ice to eurofins eaton analytical inc monrovia ca usa where they were analyzed for 98 trocs including various pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones industrial chemicals and pesticides table s1 quantification of liquid phase troc concentrations was carried out according to the methods described in oppenheimer et al 2011 which include the use of an automated online solid phase extraction high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry spe hplc ms ms system equipped with electrospray ionization esi both esi positive and esi negative modes were used to cover the broad range of target compounds censored data points reported by eurofins eaton analytical as not detected nd were carefully scrutinized and substituted with numerical data to facilitate the calculation of removal efficiencies measurements for which there was no instrument response and concentrations reported as negative were assigned a value of zero while concentrations reported as a positive value between zero and the method reporting limit mrl were assigned a value of one half of the mrl all other data points were used as reported by eurofins eaton analytical dilution corrected mrls for each targeted compound in each sample as well as esi mode and cas number for each compound analyzed are provided as supplementary information table s1 physical chemical properties of all detected trocs are detailed in table s2 removal efficiency was calculated as follows 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y t r o c x i n f t r o c x e f f t r o c x i n f x 100 where trocx inf and trocx eff are the concentration of an individual trace organic contaminant in the influent and effluent respectively the quartile based coefficient of variation qcv was calculated as

a visiprep spe vacuum manifold supelco bellefonte pa usa at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min 1 following sample loading cartridges were rinsed with 10 ml of 5 meoh in ddi water and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas for 1 1 5 h dried cartridges were eluted with 10 ml of meoh resulting in a 100x concentrated extract extracts in meoh were stored at 20 c until estrogenic activity assays could be carried out 2 3 5 estrogenic activity analysis estrogenic activity against the human estrogen receptors erα and erβ was determined using the commercially available human nuclear receptor assay kits nr3a1 and nr3a2 respectively indigo biosciences state college pa usa the assays use non human mammalian cells which have been modified to possess a luciferase reporter gene functionally linked to an estrogen receptor responsive promoter assay sensitivity and extract toxicity were evaluated during screening trials wherein test dilutions were selected a priori and the toxicity toward reporter cells was monitored using the live cell multiplex assay lcm assay product lcm 01 indigo biosciences state college pa usa in addition to its use in the initial screening the lcm assay was incorporated into all subsequent assay runs in order to provide an additional quality control metric for reporter cell vitality for erβ high reporter cell sensitivity allowed for the wastewater extracts to be diluted to concentrations below the toxicity threshold of the reporter cells yet still above the maximal effective concentration emax therefore full dose response curves triplicate for each sample could be generated for erβ for erα sample extracts were toxic to reporter cells at dilutions near emax preventing the analysis of full dose response curves as an alternative replicate n 3 measurements of luciferase response at four selected extract concentrations total n 12 were used to back calculate the 17β estradiol equivalents eeq for samples based on the fitted dose response curve for the reference agonist on the same plate see supplemental information for more details all assays were performed in 96 well plates using 17β estradiol as the reference agonist in triplicate assays were performed according to the technical manuals except for the modified plate configurations mentioned above and the following 1 sample extracts and reference agonist were prepared and serially diluted in plate using meoh and the meoh was allowed to evaporate overnight in a laminar flow hood prior to re suspending the compounds in the provided compound screening medium 2 cell recovery medium containing the reporter cells was added to the wells following the addition of compounds screening medium sigmoidal dose response curve regressions were carried out using graphpad prism 6 07 for windows graphpad software san diego california usa for erα replicates were excluded when cytotoxicity was apparent based on lcm assay or if the relative induction of luciferase response was too low and calculated eeq values within each group of 12 replicates were considered outliers and excluded if they fell outside of the interquartile range iqr by more than 1 5 iqr see supplemental information

ties are present in the input data 3 results 3 1 standard chemical analysis all six ifas wwtps performed well in terms of the removal of tss 91 99 cod 86 96 and ammonia 98 table 3 tn removal was found to be highly variable 48 7 94 4 as a result of variable denitrification with wwtps a b and d performing worst nitrate levels were 24 of the influent nitrogen as n in the poorest performing plant wwtp b as expected the only plant with anoxic ifas media wwtp e had the lowest effluent nitrate and highest tn removal 94 4 suggesting that the anoxic biofilm may have enhanced denitrification however this plant was also the only plant configured for post denitrification with meoh added as a supplementary carbon source total phosphorus removals also varied widely 30 96 wwtp d which was the only plant configured specifically for phosphorus removal a2 o configuration was outperformed by two other systems which were primarily designed to remove nitrogen wwtps a c bardenpho in all the six wwtps were performing well at the time of sampling indicating that the troc data presented here are representative of normal operation for these plants 3 2 solids inventory biofilm solids ranged from 4 15 to 21 5 g m 2 on a dry mass basis apparently correlating with biofilm thickness and cm coverage fig 1 these values are in line with values reported in the literature for a full scale demonstration plant treating domestic wastewater 2 4 12 6 g m 2 regmi et al 2011 mlss concentrations were within expected values but varied significantly between wwtps 1430 3560 mg l 1 with the volatile fraction ranging from 0 7 to 0 86 fig 2 total solids per liter of reactor contents ranged from 2 5 to 7 6 g on a dry mass basis across all ifas wwtps the fraction of total solids associated with the biofilm ranged from 40 to 60 fig 3 in other words the presence of ifas media roughly doubled the amount of solids biomass in each reactor 3 3 trace organic contaminants trocs the individual concentrations of detected trocs across all six wwtps spanned nearly six orders of magnitude in the influent 5 670 000 ng l 1 and five orders of magnitude in the effluent 6 68 000 ng l 1 of the 98 trocs targeted in this study 46 were frequently detected n 3 in influent wastewater at concentrations above the mrl table 4 and will be the focus of the results and discussion unless otherwise noted twenty three of the frequently detected trocs exhibited high median removal efficiencies across the six ifas wwtps 90 while 14 were moderately removed 50 90 six were poorly removed 0 50 and three compounds exhibited negative median removal efficiencies effluent only detection occurred in at least one ifas wwtp for 33 of the target trocs preventing the calculation of percent removals in those cases negative removal efficiencies were also observed in at least one instance for 11 of the targeted trocs seventeen trocs were not detected in any sample and included various antibiotics and pesticides along with several non antibiotic pharmaceuticals table s3 of the trocs that were infrequently detected in ifas wwtp primary effluent table s4 most were observed at concentrations near or below the mrl with several notable exceptions 1 the steroid hormones 17α ethynylestradiol 17β estradiol andorostenedione and progesterone were each detected above the mrl in the influent of one to two ifas wwtps concentrations ranging from 0 016 to 0 34 μg l 1 2 the pharmaceutical salicylic acid was detected at a high influent concentration 57 5 μg l 1 in wwtp b and only in the effluent of wwtps cf at concentrations ranging from 0 34 to 11 μg l 1 see section 4 1 1 for discussion of negative removal efficiencies and effluent only detection 3 the flame retardant tcep occurred at elevated levels in the influent of wwtp a 3 9 μg l 1 and 4 the antibiotics chloramphenicol and erythromycin were each detected in the influent of two ifas wwtps at concentrations ranging from 0 045 μg l 1 to 0 54 μg l 1 3 4 estrogenic activity among the six ifas wwtps surveyed in this study influent 17β estradiol equivalents eeqs ranged from 22 1 to 81 7 ng l 1 and 56 2 160 4 ng l 1 for erα and erβ respectively effluent eeqs ranged from not detected to 10 9 ng l 1 and from 1 94 to 19 42 ng l 1 for erα and erβ respectively removal efficiencies ranged from 51 2 to 100 and 78 9 98 8 for erα and erβ respectively fig 4 in three of the six ifas wwtps erα removal efficiency was equal to that of erβ for the remaining three wwtps notable differences between erα and erβ removal efficiencies were observed 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence and removal of trocs in ifas wwtps the range of influent troc concentrations in this study was consistent with data from the literature luo et al 2014 verlicchi et al 2012 trocs with the highest median influent concentrations were mostly over the counter and unregulated drugs drug metabolites and food additives as has been previously reported jones et al 2017 luo et al 2014 for example three of the compounds with median influent concentrations exceeding 1 μg l 1 were the over the counter pain relievers acetaminophen 32 5 μg l 1 ibuprofen 6 4 μg l 1 and naproxen 4 8 μg l 1 caffeine and its metabolite 1 7 dimethylxanthine as well as a metabolite of nicotine cotinine were also observed at high median influent concentrations 44 μg l 1 1 7 μg l 1 and 1 35 μg l 1 respectively food additives constituents found at high median influent concentrations included the non nutritive sweeteners sucralose 24 5 μg l 1 and acesulfame 19 μg l 1 as well as theobromine 1 75 μg l 1 which is found in cacao and tea leaves the prescription drugs present in the influent at the highest median concentrations included the antibiotics amoxicillin 10 5 μg l 1 and azithromycin 1 68 μg l 1 the beta blocker atenolol 1 65 μg l 1 and the x ray contrast media iohexol 3 3 μg l 1 median effluent concentrations remained above 1 μg l 1 for sucralose 28 5 μg l 1 iohexol 3 3 μg l 1 and amoxicillin 1 6 μg l 1 based on median removal efficiencies highly removed trocs 90 included caffeine antimicrobials parabens triclocarban triclosan steroid hormones estrone and estriol non flame retardant industrial chemicals alkylphenols and bisphenol a drug metabolites 1 7 dimethylxanthine cotinine theobromine and most analgesics except diclofenac which had a 86 5 median removal efficiency most antibiotics contrast agents and flame retardants were moderately or poorly removed notably the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diltiazem and fluoxetine were very poorly removed median removal efficiencies 14 3 35 6 carbamazepine is among the most recalcitrant of trocs and has previously been identified to be poorly removed with biofilm carriers as well as with activated sludge falås et al 2013 the compounds primidone sucralose and sulfamethoxazole had negative median removal efficiencies of 1 2 16 3 and 44 3 respectively while data regarding troc removal in full scale ifas wwtps is scarce one recent study measured the removal efficiency of several compounds that were also investigated here they found removal efficiencies for atenolol 25 carbamazepine 0 diclofenac 20 and trimethoprim 0 which were less than the median removal efficiencies for the same compounds in this study 87 4 14 3 86 5 and 52 8 falås et al 2013 another study investigated the removal of diclofenac in a full scale ifas wwtp and found similar removal efficiency to the median found in this study 88 over a 10 day monitoring campaign vs 86 5 in this study most highly removed and moderately removed compounds showed consistent removal efficiencies across ifas wwtps i e low qcv with the exception of 4 nonylphenol 4 tert octylphenol cyanazine azithromycin metroprolol and trimethoprim for which at least one negative removal efficiency was observed the poorly removed pharamaceuticals carbamazepine diltiazem and fluoxetine had highly variable removal efficiencies qcv 1 68 1 98 indicating that wwtp operating parameters microbial community composition or other factors which vary from one ifas wwtp to another may play a more important role in the removal of these compounds compounds with negative median removal efficiencies also showed high variability the contrast agents iopromide and iohexol and the flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp had consistently moderate to poor removal efficiency across ifas wwtps qcv 0 5 0 7 in general the widest range of median removal efficiencies was observed between compounds in the pharmaceutical class reflective of the wide array of chemical structures present in this broad end use category chemical structure has previously been identified as a key factor in determining the fate of trocs in wastewater treatment specifically hydrophobicity and the presence of electron donating groups edgs are thought to be positively correlated with compound removal efficiency while the presence of electron withdrawing groups ewgs is thought to negatively impact removal efficiencies tadkaew et al 2011 in the present study several compounds appeared to conform to these expectations including carbamazepine and primidone which both contain strong ewgs and were poorly removed however diclofenac and deet which also contain strong ewgs were rather well removed here in contrast to the study by tadkaew et al 2011 gemfibrozil ibuprofen and atenolol edgs present were well removed in the present study though sulfamethoxazole was not despite the presence of an edg and in contrast to the results of tadkaew et al 2011 compounds may also contain both ewg and edg e g trimethoprim further complicating this method of structure based classification in general the presence of ewgs and edgs did not clearly correlate with removal efficiencies for this data set in terms of hydrophobicity kendall rank correlation showed no significant relationship between log dow at ph 7 table s2 and the median removal efficiency of frequently detected compounds τ 0 072 p value 0 49 recognizing that the test could be affected by the right censored removal efficiencies i e maximum 100 data were reassessed after excluding pairs for which median removal was equal to 100 this resulted in increased significance ρ 0 21 p value 0 08 indicating a slight positive correlation between log dow and median removal efficiencies for frequently detected compounds which were not completely removed similar to previous reports the compounds with the highest log dow e g 3 5 were all highly removed i e 90 however this is restricted to a small number of compounds in the present study 4 nonylphenol 4 tert octylphenol bisphenol a estrone triclocarban triclosan compounds with log dow of 0 2 exhibited the widest range of median removal efficiencies and those compounds with negative median removal efficiencies had log dow of 1 to 1 fig s1 4 1 1 limitations of calculated removal efficiencies as a measure of treatment while removal efficiencies are a convenient measure of the level of treatment of various compounds in wwtps caution must be used in interpreting these values for instance a compound which is present in the influent at very high levels e g 4 nonylphenol in wwtp a 29 μg l 1 could exhibit a high removal efficiency e g 95 8 yet a considerable concentration could remain in the effluent e g 1 2 μg l 1 in other cases left censoring data i e replacement with 0 5 mrl can result in observed removal efficiencies which appear to be lower than they actually are finally monitoring the removal of targeted trocs does not account for incomplete degradation and the possible accumulation of metabolites though this can be partially addressed through the use of in vitro bioassays and other measures of overall toxicity of the treated effluent negative removal efficiencies and effluent only detection are commonly reported in the literature for several compounds and are likely due to the microbially mediated reversion of influent human metabolites back to parent compounds or day to day fluctuations in influent concentration luo et al 2014 the former is likely to be true for pharmaceuticals including sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine diltiazem and fluoxetine which showed negative removal in more than one instance in this study and salicylic acid which was detected in the effluent but not the influent in 5 out of 6 ifas wwtps salicylic acid is a metabolite of aspirin which is further metabolized to form gluconoride conjugates allowing for possible deconjugation within the wwtp and subsequent increases in concentration as has been reported for other compounds verlicchi et al 2012 human metabolites of sucralose are not expected to be present in the influent in large quantities as it is only 3 metabolized in the human body roberts et al 2000 however negative removals of 13 3 to 27 8 were detected in four of six ifas wwtps this may be due to day to day fluctuations in influent concentrations not captured by 24 h composite samples or another unknown mechanism 4 2 measured removal of trocs in ifas wwtps vs literature values for cas wwtps the efficiency of troc removal in cas wwtps has been widely reviewed in recent years and several authors clearly present aggregated data luo et al 2014 margot et al 2015 rojas et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 these aggregated data include values from cas wwtps with varying secondary configurations solids retention times srts and other operating parameters e g seasonal temperature fluctuations limiting the ability to make quantitative comparisons between cas literature data and the removal efficiencies measured in the ifas wwtps in this study nevertheless they are a valuable resource given the large volume of individual studies documenting troc removal efficiencies as such these aggregated data have been used as the primary source to draw general comparisons between troc removal efficiencies in cas wwtps and the ifas wwtps investigated in this study literature referenced here for conventional activated sludge wwtps includes those employing enhanced biological nutrient removal bnr with various solids retention times but excludes membrane bioreactors mbrs and systems with a biofilm component to minimize the impact of outlying values median removal efficiencies are preferentially included here where available table 5 lists the median removal efficiencies measured in this study as well as the median or average removal efficiency for cas wwtps based on aggregated data when available in other cases ranges or estimates i e 50 were more appropriate due to limited data for those compounds with published median or average cas removals a first approximation of the relative removals in these ifas wwtps can be made by comparison however comparisons with published median or average values from the cas literature should be interpreted with caution the sample of ifas wwtps is small and by necessity it is skewed toward newer upgraded wwtps which all perform nitrification at moderately high srts whereas the literature values include both nitrifying and non nitrifying cas wwtps with a range of srts referring to table 5 the median removal efficiency within ifas wwtps compared favorably to the median or average removals reported for cas wwtps for most trocs ifas wwtp removals were greater by more than ten percentage points for atenolol diclofenac azithromycin gemfibrozil metoprolol deet naproxen 4 nonylphenol 4 tert octylphenol and bisphenol a compounds for which ifas removal efficiencies were zero to ten percentage points greater than cas removal efficiencies include acetaminophen caffeine estriol estrone ibuprofen triclosan and trimethoprim ifas removal efficiencies were less than those reported for cas wwtps for the compounds sulfamethoxazole fluoxetine diltiazem and carbamazepine for the remaining frequently detected trocs robust estimates of median or average removal efficiencies for cas wwtps were not readily available however some were generally indicated to be highly removed in cas wwtps 90 and significantly higher ifas removals are not expected 1 7 dimethylxanthine parabens cotinine theobromine theophylline and triclocarban other compounds have extremely variable reported removal efficiencies for cas wwtps making comparison difficult acesulfame amoxicillin cimetidine iohexol and iopromide interestingly castronovo et al 2017 surveyed 13 activated sludge wastewater treatment plants for the removal of acesulfame one of which was an ifas wwtp in their study the acesulfame was readily removed by most cas wwtps but the ifas wwtp showed the lowest removal efficiency average 57 though it also had the lowest srt of the wwtps studied in contrast past reports of acesulfame removal in cas wwtps have typically shown very low removal efficiencies acesulfame was well removed in the present study median 94 3 there was sparse data in the literature regarding cas wwtp removal efficiencies for several trocs however some general comparisons can be drawn for the flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp nearly all reported removal efficiencies are near zero or negative in this study the median removals of these two compounds are clearly above zero at 46 5 n 6 and 47 8 n 3 respectively indicating potentially enhanced removal of these flame retardants in ifas wwtps removal efficiencies for sucralose in cas wwtps are generally reported to be very low in fact sucralose has been proposed as an indicator of wastewater loading to surface waters due to its recalcitrance in wwtps oppenheimer et al 2011 sucralose removal efficiencies were low here as well suggesting no improvement in these ifas wwtps the median removal efficiency of primidone in these ifas wwtps median 1 was below the reported range of 16 50 in cas wwtps whereas removal efficiencies for the analgesic lidocaine and the pesticide 2 4 d were similar in ifas wwtps and cas wwtps only a single data point was found in the literature for the removal of butalbital and meprobamate in cas wwtps and median removals compared favorably 80 vs 65 and 68 vs 34 respectively finally no literature data could be found for cas removal of cyanazine or warfarin to the authors best knowledge this is the first report of removal efficiencies for cyanazine and warfarin in activated sludge based treatment of municipal wastewater of those compounds that showed the highest deviation from published median or average removals in cas wwtps atenolol diclofenac gemfibrozil deet 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol have been previously indicated to be better removed in hybrid biofilm suspended growth systems falås et al 2013 2012 kim et al 2009 murray et al 2017 zupanc et al 2013 however the removal efficiencies of atenolol and deet in cas wwtps are notably variable with high removal efficiencies 90 occasionally reported tran and gin 2017 diclofenac is among the most commonly studied wastewater troc and is commonly cited to have differential removal in systems with and without biofilm carrier media jewell et al 2016 investigated the transformation of diclofenac in bench scale batch experiments using carrier media and activated sludge from full scale wwtps from the observed transformation products they inferred that hydroxylation decarboxylation oxidation amide formation ring opening and reductive dechlorination were possible degradation pathways diclofenac was removed via similar reaction pathways but more rapidly when in contact with carrier media than with activated sludge alone while reductive dechlorination was a minor contributor to the overall removal of diclofenac it was only observed to occur in contact with carrier media this effect could be due to dissolved oxygen gradients present in the biofilm interestingly the chlorinated flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp appear to be better removed in ifas wwtps in this study than has been reported for cas wwtps the results of jewell et al 2016 suggest that reductive dechlorination associated with the ifas biofilms could be a mechanism for differential removal in ifas and cas systems however other chlorinated trocs in this study cyanazine 2 4 d triclosan and triclocarban showed similar removal efficiencies to the cas literature and sucralose showed negative median removal in ifas wwtps 4 3 occurrence and removal of estrogenic activity effluent eeqs observed in this study nd to 10 9 ng l 1 and 1 9 19 4 ng l 1 for erα and erβ respectively are similar to values reported in the literature for european cas wwtps 0 5 ng l 1 to 17 9 ng l 1 loos et al 2013 however it is not possible to make direct comparisons of activities determined using different bioassays in part because the assays may target different estrogen receptors endocrine disrupting trocs have been documented to interact differently with erα and erβ estrogen receptors for example metabolites of the pesticide methoxychlor can act as agonists against erα and antagonists against erβ as a result the importance of characterizing the activity of environmental contaminants against both of these receptors has been noted in the literature gaido et al 2000 1999 however most studies of estrogenic activity in wwtps fail to differentiate between erα and erβ activity though some methods capture the combined activity against both receptors e g t47d kbluc wilson et al 2004 furthermore while some studies have investigated the reduction of estrogenic activity by cas wwtps drewes et al 2005 and in a pilot scale ifas treatment train kim et al 2009 there are no reports of estrogenic activity removals in full scale ifas wwtps of the trocs detected in this study 17β estradiol estrone estriol 17α ethynylestradiol bisphenol a 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylyphenol are well documented to possess estrogenic activity campbell et al 2006 the relative potency of these compounds in relation to the natural hormone 17β estradiol has been reported in the literature however equivalency factors vary by assay and receptor and are not available for the assay used in this study making it difficult to compare observed chemical concentrations with bioassay results in general estrone and estriol are 10 100x less potent than 17β estradiol while 17α ethynylestradiol is 2 5x more potent bisphenol a 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol exhibit much weaker estrogenic activity with equivalency factors 4 5 orders of magnitude less than that of 17β estradiol campbell et al 2006 sun et al 2013 while various other potentially estrogenic industrial chemicals e g phthalates pesticides parabens and phytoestrogens may in combination contribute significantly to the overall estrogenic activity of wastewater the majority of this activity is thought to be contributed by natural and synthetic estrogens aerni et al 2004 nakada et al 2004 in this study estrone was the most frequently detected hormone in ifas wwtp influent n 6 and while it was well removed 92 4 median removal efficiency detectable amounts remained in five of the six ifas wwtps estriol was detected in four of six influents but in only one effluent the more potent 17β estradiol and 17α ethynylestradiol were detected sporadically table s4 the highest estrogenic activity against both erα and erβ receptors was found for wwtp a 81 7 ng l 1 and 160 4 ng l 1 eeq respectively which also had the least preliminary primary treatment and the highest influent concentrations of 17α ethynylestradiol estriol and estrone estrone was the only estrogen quantified in the effluent at a concentration above the mrl 20 ng l 1 wwtp f and this effluent showed the highest estrogenic activity against both estrogen receptors reasons for the differential removal of erα and erβ activity in wwtps c e and f are unclear however it is logical to assume this is due to the differential removal of compounds which act more strongly against one receptor than the other 4 4 ifas operating conditions and overall plant performance in order to assess the overall performance of the ifas wwtps in this study a meta analysis was conducted wherein the number of compounds falling into various removal ranges were counted for each wwtp fig 5 compounds for which removal efficiencies could not be calculated see table 4 were excluded the number of compounds included for each wwtp ranged from 43 to 47 the fraction of compounds with high removal efficiencies 80 100 ranged from 0 5 in wwtp d to 0 8 in wwtp c wwtp operational conditions including secondary configuration i e sequence and proportion of aerobic and anoxic treatment zones solids retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and operational temperature are known to influence the removal of trocs luo et al 2014 while there are no clear correlations between these operating parameters and the meta analysis outcomes across all ifas wwtps in this study it is notable that wwtp c with the greatest fraction of highly removed compounds was operating at the highest aerobic srt and temperature 9 7 d 23 c whereas wwtp d with the lowest fraction of highly removed compounds was operating at the lowest aerobic srt and temperature 4 3 d 17 5 c the removal of estrogenic activity can be considered an alternate measure of overall plant performance correlations between the removal of estrogenic activity and overall srt aerobic srt aerobic hrt and temperature were assessed using kendall rank correlation test while no parameter was found to have a statistically significant correlation for the removal of erα or erβ estrogenic activity at a significance level of α 0 05 the correlation between aerobic srt and the removal of erα estrogenic activity was most significant τ 0 733 p value 0 06 a recent study investigated the reduction of various forms of toxicity in several full scale wwtps and found no correlation between the removal of estrogenic activity and process configuration or srt valitalo et al 2017 biofilm thickness has also been shown to influence the diffusion sorption and biodegradation of trocs for example torresi et al 2016 investigated the effect of biofilm thickness in bench scale reactors and found that thicker biofilms had a greater porosity and larger amount of accessible internal surface area leading to greater degree of sorption than thin biofilms which tended to be more compact and diffusion limited in a subsequent study thick biofilms were observed to have the highest specific biotransformation rates for the largest number of trocs but thin biofilms showed the highest biotransformation rates for several of the more recalcitrant compounds e g diclofenac sulfamethoxazole torresi et al 2017 torresi et al suggest that the increased biotransformation rates for many compounds in thick biofilms are a result of increased microbial diversity specifically greater community evenness whereas the enhanced transformation of several recalcitrant compounds in thin biofilms could be attributed to the higher nitrification rate and greater abundance of the ammonia monooxygenase amoa gene in these biofilms in the present study biofilm thickness did appear to vary widely between wwtps fig 1 thickness observed visually but not measured quantitatively however there appears to be no clear correlation between biofilm thickness and overall reduction in troc concentration or the removal of estrogenic activity this could be due to overall differences in the microbial community composition of biofilms between full scale ifas wwtps outweighing any subtle differences in diversity driven by biofilm thickness a forthcoming manuscript will examine the bacterial archaeal and fungal microbial communities within these six ifas wwtps 5 conclusions the most frequently detected trocs in the surveyed ifas wwtps were removed as well or better than what has been reported in the literature for cas wwtps measured troc removal efficiencies in these ifas wwtps provide additional evidence of improved removal for a number of compounds which have been previously identified to be better removed at the bench or pilot scale atenolol diclofenac gemfibrozil deet 4 nonylphenol and 4 tert octylphenol azithromycin bisphenol a metoprolol and naproxen also show potentially improved removal in these ifas wwtps when compared to the cas literature potentially enhanced removal of chlorinated flame retardants tcipp and tdcipp was observed erβ activity was higher than erα activity in all influent and effluent wastewater and differential removal was shown to occur the

19074,the two phase continuous centrifugation process for olive oil extraction generates high amounts of olive oil mill wastewater omw characterized by containing large concentrations of numerous contaminant compounds for the environment an integral process based on physico chemical flocculation photolysis and microfiltration and microalgal growth stages was proposed for its treatment chemical oxygen demand cod removal percentages were 57 5 88 8 and 20 5 for flocculation photolysis and microfiltration respectively the global removal percentages of organic load in the primary treatment were 96 2 for cod 80 3 for total organic carbon toc and 96 6 for total phenolic compounds tpcs in secondary treatment different experiments using the microalgae chlorella pyrenoidosa were performed on a laboratory scale in stirred batch tank reactors the omw concentrations in each culture medium were 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 v v the common experimental conditions were ph 7 temperature 25 c agitation

the culture with 50 of omw v v the final biomass obtained had a high percentage of carbohydrates whose content ranged from 30 3 to 89 2 and the highest lipid content 34 2 was determined in the culture with 25 of omw v v the final treated water is suitable for its use in irrigation discharge to receiving waters or for being reused in the same process graphical abstract image 1 keywords olive oil mill wastewater flocculation photolysis biomass growth chlorella pyrenoidosa treatment 1 introduction microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that are characterized by its easy culture and high growth and productivity rates these microorganisms produce biomass with high added value products as pharmaceutical compounds fatty acids carotenoids dyes and fine chemicals all these compounds can be used for human animal and aquatic feed hodaifa et al 2013 mata et al 2010 nor et al 2016 rawat et al 2011 suganya et al 2016 on the other hand they are able to grow in harsh conditions requiring water inorganic salts co2 and sunlight mata et al 2010 in this sense microalgae have numerous environmental applications such as co2 mitigation and wastewater treatment suganya et al 2016 furthermore certain species have the capacity to degrade a large variety of compounds such as xenobiotic polyaromatic hydrocarbons phenolic compounds pesticides etc for all these reasons the dual application of microalgae for wastewater treatment and biomass production is an attractive alternative with great industrial and economic potential hodaifa et al 2012 rawat et al 2011 different wastewaters such as municipal agricultural and piggery have been used as microalgae culture media for nutrient removal and biomass production abou shanab et al 2013 ji et al 2014 mata et al 2010 rawat et al 2011 many works have shown the ability of microalgae to degrade and remove excess nutrients mainly persistent and hazardous organic pollutants in wastewaters the capacity of chlorella ankistrodesmus and scenedesmus species to remove contaminants from olive oil mill and paper industry wastewaters has already been demonstrated hodaifa et al 2012 2013 kouhia et al 2015 in general wastewaters have a complex physicochemical composition for this reason the nutrient availability and the presence of growth inhibitors could influence microalgal growth guldhe et al 2017 hodaifa et al 2012 olive oil industry is an important sector within the agro food industries in the mediterranean countries hodaifa et al 2012 as well as in non traditional producing countries as australia new zealand and south america due to the growing interest in olive oil consumption and production olive oil is obtained from olive fruit by mechanical procedures throughout pressing discontinuous and centrifugation systems continuous the last systems can be carried out by using a decanter with two or three exits dermeche et al 2013 in spain the main olive oil producer worldwide the centrifugation process using a decanter with two exits for olive oil and pomace production is currently used tsagaraki et al 2007 olive oil mill wastewater omw from two exits is characterized by containing a high concentration of organic matter which includes polysaccharides sugars phenolic compounds polyalcohol nitrogenous compounds organic acids tannins pectin lignin oil and high levels of suspended solids dermeche et al 2013 mantzavinos and kalogerakis 2005 in this sense omw produced by decanter with two exits have less organic load cod 4 16 g o2 l in comparison with the wastewaters generated using a decanter with three exits or the pressing process cod 40 220 g o2 l agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 in this work a new process for real omw treatment based on physico chemical operations as primary treatment followed by microalgae culture as secondary treatment was proposed first operations included flocculation sedimentation photolysis and microfiltration units connected with chlorella pyrenoidosa culture in this sense physico chemical characteristics of the real crude olive oil mill wastewater were studied flocculation sedimentation and photolysis operations were established and optimized then different dilutions of primary treated omw 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 v v were used as culture media kinetic growth biomass production and biochemical composition of c pyrenoidosa were evaluated treated water and bioremediation of the wastewater during the integral process were determined 2 experimental 2 1 microorganism and photobioreactor the microorganism used was the freshwater green algae chlorella pyrenoidosa chich 8h emerson experiments were performed in sterile conditions on a laboratory scale in stirred batch tank reactors with work capacity 1 l diameter 10 cm and height 16 cm all bioreactors had continuous illumination on one side 2 2 procedure omw was obtained from an olive oil extraction plant in the province of seville spain the flocculation sedimentation was carried out during 90 min in imhoff funnel using a commercial flocculant flocudex cs 51 based on a previous study hodaifa et al 2015 an optimal flocculant concentration of 1 g l was selected the obtained supernatant was subjected to photolysis in a batch stirred photoreactor with total capacity equal to 750 cm3 work volume 600 cm3 a commercial medium pressure uv immersion lamp model tq 150 brand hng germany g4 150 no 5600 1725 standard was used during the proposed process the reduction of organic matter was determined culture media were prepared by mixing omw and ultrapure water to obtain the following final concentrations 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 v v omw sterilization was performed by filtration through a membrane with pore size equal to 0 2 μm the ph was adjusted and maintained at a value of 7 0 over the course of the culture through the addition of 0 1 mol naoh l 1 or 0 1 mol hcl l 1 solution the common culture conditions were temperature 25 c aeration rate 0 5 l min ph value 7 magnetic agitation speed 200 rpm and continuous light with illumination intensity equal to 359 μe m 2 s 1 in all the experiments the precultures of c pyrenoidosa were grown for 7 day at room temperature in solidified rodríguez lópez medium rodríguez lópez 1964 with agar at 2 w w under continuous illumination the liquid inoculum 0 0141 0 00791 g l for each experiment consisted of a suspension of cells in sterile rodríguez lópez culture medium 2 2 1 microalgae growth the biomass concentration x g l 1 was measured indirectly by the absorbance of the cell suspension in ultrapure water at 600 nm camacho et al 1989 after two centrifugation stages in which biomass was washed with ultrapure water results obtained allowed the representation of growth curves and the determination of the growth kinetic velocities the specific growth rate μ 1 x dx dt in the exponential phase and the biomass productivity pb dx dt in the linear phase were determined 2 2 2 biochemical composition of the biomass in all experiments the total pigments total chlorophylls and total carotenoids were determined during the course of the cultures at the end of each experiment algal biomass was separated and total lipids proteins and fatty acids contents were determined total lipids were obtained by using a micro soxhlet extractor with n hexane as solvent fatty acid profile was determined and identified directly from dried algal biomass by gas chromatography using a hewlett packard model 5890 series ii equipped by a fid detector lepage and roy 1984 the crude protein content was performed from the nitrogen percentage determination crude proteins tn 6 25 becker 1994 using a total carbon and nitrogen analyser provided by skalar company mod formacsht and formacstn the total carbohydrate content was obtained by considering that algal biomass is formed by proteins carbohydrates lipids pigments and genetic material for carbohydrate content calculation genetic material was considered approximately about 1 becker 1994 2 3 analytical methods in the characterization of wastewater and treated water crude and after each treatment the following parameters were determined ph

sodium ortho phosphate and ammonium ph electric conductivity ec and turbidity values were directly measured by using a ph meter crison mod glp 22c conductimeter crison mod glp31 and turbidimeter hanna mod hi93703 respectively the determination of tpcs was carried out by making it react with a derivative thiazol giving a purple azo dye which was determined photometrically at 475 nm according to the standard methods iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 cod was determined photometrically at 620 nm according to german standard methods din 38409 h41 toc tc ic and tn contents were determined using a total carbon

sulphates and ortho phosphates were determined photometrically at 420 nm and 690 nm respectively according to the standard methods iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 sodium ammonium potassium and calcium contents were determined directly by using selective ion electrodes for each one crison mod glp 22c finally carbohydrate content total reducing sugars could be determined by using the dns dinitrosalicylic acid method as described by miller 1959 in this method 3 ml of dns reagent is mixed with 2 ml of sample then the sample is immersed in a water bath at 80 85 c for 5 min after cooling to room temperature the sample is measured photometrically at 540 nm in addition a calibration line using glucose as reference reagent is needed 2 4 calculation methods and reproducibility in this work experiments were made at least in duplicate and analytical methods were applied at least in triplicate models calculation and statistical methods used were available in the originpro 8 0 program 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw omw used wastewater must contain a suitable nutrient profile for its use as culture medium for microalgae with carbon nitrogen and phosphorous sources as the most essential elements required for algal biomass growth table 1 shows the composition of raw and treated industrial olive oil wastewater used in this work it is necessary to highlight the high presence of high organic matter determined in terms of turbidity 714 ftu cod 5839 mg o2 l tpcs 322 mg l toc 646 mg l and tn 58 9 mg l the high tn concentration registered can be explained by the presence of proteins and other nitrogenated compounds in the omw composition which come from the olive fruit crushing and olive oil washing agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 high concentrations of phenols tpcs 322 mg l were also found these latter compounds have a similar structure to that of lignin which makes them difficult to be biodegraded they are also characterized by a high specific chemical oxygen demand phytotoxicity and antibacterial activity being the major contributors to the omw toxicity and microalgal growth inhibition azabou et al 2007 d antuono et al 2014 fountoulakis et al 2002 a high inorganic salts portion was also detected 318 mg l as well as phosphorus in the form of inorganic salts ortho phosphate 43 1 mg l which play an important role in microalgae cell growth and metabolism through phosphorylation reactions on the other hand it must be also indicated the high cod toc ratio value equal to 9 registered for raw omw in comparison with domestic wastewater in which this value is around 2 to 3 huang et al 2010 similarly high cod toc values have been registered in several industrial wastewater studies güneş et al 2019 described industrial container and drum cleaning wastewater sample 3 with cod toc 6 21 agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 determined for crude wastewater from washing olives wow a cod toc ratio 8 12 buthiyappan and abdul raman 2019 indicated cod toc ratio values from 9 41 to 11 2 for textile wastewaters and dhanke et al 2018 established cod toc ratio 24 3 for fish processing industry wastewaters this fact can be explained by the high heterogeneity of industrial wastewaters physicochemical characteristics which is mainly determined by the wastewater origin raper et al 2018 the low iron content can be explained by the use of drinking water in food industries for washing raw materials high iron concentration is not desired since it is a microalgae growth inhibitor fazal et al 2018 3 2 bioprocess for olive oil mill wastewater treatment the proposed new real omw treatment process was performed according to fig 1 the process undertaken consisted of four phases of which the first three phases correspond to the primary treatment and the last stage to the secondary treatment i flocculation sedimentation it was performed in two steps without ph modification in the first to complete mixing of flocculant and effluent a high agitation speed 700 rpm was applied for 1 min in the second to achieve flocs formation a low agitation speed 350 rpm for 30 min was employed the aim of this stage was to separate and remove the solid fraction of omw which consisted of a sludge that can be used subsequently for composting for this purpose flocculated omw was left to settle during 30 min ii photolysis it consisted on the exposition of the obtained supernatant after removal of the solid fraction to uv light for 30 min the objective of this stage was the elimination of a part of the organic matter present in omw especially organic compounds as phenols which are considered as microbial growth inhibitors sample settling during 30 min was performed to allow the sedimentation and subsequent separation of the remaining solid fraction iii microfiltration it was used for omw microbial sterilization and organic load reduction iv chlorella pyrenoidosa culture for the bioremediation of omw and the obtaining of microalgal biomass with added value mainly energetic compounds which could be used for biofuels and biogas production or directly used in boilers for biomass combustion 3 2 1 primary treatment table 1 shows the variation of the treated water composition during the primary treatment in general all parameters were decreased throughout the primary treatment flocculation stage allowed a high total phenolic compounds removal percentage of up to 78 table 1 theoretically after the use of flocculant in omw treatment an increase in tpcs is expected due to the presence of phenolic compounds in the flocculant composition the commercial flocudex cs51 used is a solid cationic polyelectrolyte with high molecular weight and high capacity to eliminate suspended solids turbidity and compounds responsible for colour apparition in this sense it is important to indicate that commercial flocculants usually incorporate a lignosulfonate guaiacol methoxy phenol or protocatechuic acid in the synthesis process of acrylamide copolymers he et al 2015 after the photolysis operation the tpcs concentration was decreased to 38 5 mg l tpcs removal 45 7 due to the degradation process of lignin and phenols by the uv light el hajjouji et al 2007 machado et al 2000 lignin polymer which is largely present in olives pulp is a natural polymer whose main structural units are phenolic compounds tanaka et al 1999 from the environmental point of view the organic load can be determined by cod and toc parameters during the flocculation photolysis and microfiltration the removal percentages 57 5 88 8 and 20 5 for cod and 18 0 71 9 and 14 6 for toc were determined respectively as a result of the flocculation process the toc tn ratio increased from 11 0 crude omw to 19 1 flocculated omw indicating a strong fall in nitrogen content due to the efficient protein removal component with high molecular weight by the flocculant after that the ratio decreased to 6 66 this showed that during flocculation a high percentage of proteins were removed and during photolysis higher levels of organic matter oxidation were achieved in general the variation in the different determined ratios after flocculation does not follow a fixed pattern in this sense cod toc ratio was decreased from 9 04 to 4 69 through flocculation this separation depends on the aggregation mechanism applied charge neutralization entrapment mainly by van der waals forces adsorption forces complexation with coagulant metal flocculent ions into insoluble particulate aggregates matilainen et al 2010 therefore the separation mechanism through flocculation is a non selective separation during microfiltration the toc tn ratio registered a slightly increase 7 4 indicating higher carbon compounds removal in comparison with the elimination of nitrogenated compounds in view of the results achieved it can be confirmed that photolysis was the most effective operation for organic load reduction von sonntag 2008 showed the effectiveness of uv light for organic matter photodegradation in comparison with natural oxidation photolysis is a photochemical operation in which organic compounds are partially decomposed because of the absorption of this high energy irradiation agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 studied the uv light effect in the degradation of omw organic matter in photoreactors they observed that photodegradation occurs in one step by an instantaneous reaction in the first minutes 4 min afterwards no significant degradation was observed in addition catalá et al 2015 when using a 150 w medium pressure mercury lamp the same uv lamp used in this work in natural fluvial waters containing illicit drugs achieved high toc removal level equal to 79 this high elimination percentage obtained after photolysis is due to the special characteristics of uv lamp used wide emission range and high potency in this case a commercial medium pressure uv immersion lamp model tq 150 brand hng germany g4 150 w no 5600 1725 standard was used in general medium pressure mercury lamps are available in different potency from 100 to 1000w the emission profile of these lamps consists on a wide range of wavelengths from 200 to 700 nm uv and visible light and the peak of 254 nm is strongly diminished the emission intensity of these lamps is at least 10 fold higher than that of low pressure arcs but happens on a much smaller surface this uv lamp type in contrast to other develops a considerable amount of heat which cooling is required but this problem can be resolved by running tap water to maintain the temperature around 20 c albini and germani 2010 in addition this fact is not important when working at pilot or industrial plant since the reactor volume itself is enough to remove the heat generated by the uv lamp other authors have shown that artificial uv light oxidation allows the rapid decomposition of toxic compounds such as nitrosodimetylamine ndma hydrazine 1 4 dioxane and methylthrethylbutaneethyl mtbe mccurry et al 2016 radjenovic et al 2012 tawabini et al 2013 sulphate ions were efficiently removed during the primary treatment table 1 high sulphate ions removal percentages 73 7 and 34 5 were registered after flocculation and microfiltration respectively sulphate ions elimination from water and wastewater is complex due to the high solubility and stability of these anions in aqueous solutions the main methods used for its treatment are 1 biological degradation 2 membrane filtration primarily reverse osmosis 3 adsorption ion exchange in resins and 4 chemical precipitation amaral filho et al 2016 3 3 secondary treatment microalgal treatment 3 3 1 chlorella pyrenoidosa growth fig 2a shows a sample of the growth curves of c pyrenoidosa when the microalgae was grown in a 10 omw v v culture in general a short duration 18 h lag or adaptation phase was detected in all experiments this phase was followed by an exponential growth phase whose duration ranged from 20 to 32 h in the cultures with omw 75 v v only in the case of 100 omw v v the duration of this phase was 61 5 h then a deceleration growth phase with linear behaviour was observed the duration of the linear growth was increased with the augment of omw in the culture medium from 25 to 144 h this appears to indicate that this phase is determined by the limitation of one or more nutrients a stationary phase of growth at the end of the culture was observed in all experiments in this sense similar growth curves were obtained by hodaifa et al 2008 2009 2012 using omw from two and three phase systems as culture media for scenedesmus obliquus the determination of the maximum specific growth rate and biomass productivity of c pyrenoidosa were determined according equations 1 and 2 respectively fig 2 a 1 l n x x o μ m t a where μm is the slope of the line and corresponds to the maximum specific growth rate and a is the intercept 2 x p b t b where pb is the slope of line and corresponds to the volumetric biomass productivity and b is the intercept it can be observed in fig 3 the variation of the maximum specific growth rates μm and the biomass productivities pb when initial omw concentrations were increased in the culture medium in both cases μm and pb values were increased with the rise in omw in the culture medium until 50 of omw v v then these parameters were rapidly decreased especially in the case of μm indicating inhibition or toxic effect in the culture media the highest experimental values of μm 0 07 h 1 and pb 1 25 mg l h were registered in the culture with 50 of omw v v after this concentration these parameters were decreased to 0 0165 h 1 and 0 408 mg l h in the culture with 100 of omw v v in which the lowest values were achieved this result was expected due to the presence of fat matter organics acids pesticide residues and phenolic compounds in the composition of omw which are known to harm and inhibit microalgal growth hodaifa et al 2012 kobayashi and rittmann 1982 after studying various inhibition and toxicity growth models by substrate the one that best reproduced the experimental variation observed in μm with omw concentrations was the polynomial model type of moser 1985 eq 3 3 μ m μ m m a x α o α 1 o m w α 2 o m w 2 where μm max 0 068 h 1 is the maximum value of the maximum specific growth rate obtained in the different cultures performed and the constant values of αo α1 and α2 are equal to 0 0588 0 0367 and 3 52 10 4 respectively the parameters of the goodness of the fit were r2 0 978 and residual sum squares rss 5 51 10 5 in this sense it is interesting to indicate that the maximum value for μm obtained by the mathematical model is similar to that achieved experimentally 0 07 h 1 the volumetric biomass productivity was determined by the fit of the x t data during the deceleration growth phase as mentioned before the start of this phase is associated with limited availability of co2 goldman et al 1981 light evers 1990 or both and these two components of the culture were provided at a constant rate co2 was supplied through aeration of the culture medium at 0 5 v v min and the incident intensity of illumination was also constant in all experiments and equal to 359 μe m 2 s 1 however due to the colouration of the medium the attenuation of the light was greater in culture media containing a higher percentage of omw this explains the decrease in pb with the increase of omw concentration in the culture medium just as with μm pb increases with the rise in omw in the culture medium until 50 of omw v v when the maximum biomass productivity equal to 1 25 mg l h was achieved the model that justifies the variation of pb with the percentage of omw is the modified monod model in which the presence of toxic agents or a substance at high enough concentrations were considered fig 3b this model includes a term of ki omw2 to describe the inhibitory or toxic effect of a nutrient at high concentrations and it is defined by eq 4 4 p b p b m a x o m w k s o m w k i o m w 2 where pb max 0 002041 g l h is the apparent maximum value of volumetric biomass productivity without inhibition effect though the value of pb max is higher the constant values of ks 13 8 and ki 1 42 10 7 are consistent with the data obtained experimentally the parameters of the goodness of the fit were r2 0 961 and residual sum squares rss 3 22 10 8 pb values were similar to that registered by sánchez et al 2001 in that work c pyrenoidosa was cultivated in omw obtained from a continuous olive oil extraction system using decanter with three exits this omw is known as 3 phase system or alpechín in spain however lower μm values 0 011 0 045 h 1 were obtained due to the higher organic matter concentration in omw from three phase extraction system dqo 40 220 g o2 l in comparison with omw from two phase extraction system dqo 4 16 g o2 l agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 3 3 2 biochemical composition of c pyrenoidosa biomass at the end of the experiments the harvested biomass of c pyrenoidosa was analysed for proteins carbohydrates and lipids contents determination these are the microalgae cells main components the variation on the biomass composition of c pyrenoidosa for all omw dilutions is shown in fig 4 microalgal cells require nitrogen for the synthesis of protein nucleic acid and phospholipids and thus the growth of microalgae is believed to be essential for nitrogen removal wang et al 2015 protein content of the microalgae biomass was increased with the increment of omw concentration in the culture media fig 4 and ranged from 0 99 initial tnculture medium 0 948 mg l and tnfinal biomass 0 155 in 5 omw v v culture media to 51 5 initial tnculture medium 17 3 mg l and tnfinal biomass 8 25 in 100 omw culture medium it could therefore be concluded that protein content of the microalgae cells was sensitive to changes in nutrient levels the initial nitrogen content in the low concentration omw culture medium was not enough for the synthesis of proteins causing the decrease of the protein content in the biomass at the end of the culture and in the microalgae growth subsequently proteins are essential for microalgae growth nutrient deficiency could inhibit protein synthesis and microalgae growth subsequently zhang et al 2017 demonstrated the rapid biomass accumulation of c pyrenoidosa when the microalgae was grown in straw hydrolysate medium and the effectiveness of nitrogen regulation in biomass composition in heterotrophic condition hodaifa et al 2008 obtained similar results with the same omw and scenedesmus obliquus in this study the percentage of protein varied between 6 2 and 30 8 corresponding to 5 and 50 omw v v culture media the biomass protein content of s obliquus reached a value of up to 43 8 hodaifa et al 2013 when the microalgae was cultured in a medium without n deficiency as the rodríguez lópez 1964 synthetic medium becker 1994 carbohydrates content in biomass under low omw percentages increased because of nutrient deficiency mainly nitrogen under nitrogen stress condition microalgae store carbohydrates as molecular reserves that can be used as alternative energy sources this is consistent with previous findings showing that carbohydrate accumulation in microalgae is triggered by nitrogen depletion on the other hand cultures with 5 omw are virtually transparent after primary treatment which favoured autotrophic culture in this sense through photosynthesis microalgae can convert atmospheric co2 along with water and light into organic matter being carbohydrates the major products the excess of fixed carbon is commonly stored into carbohydrates and in stressful conditions these molecular reserves can be used as alternative energy sources for the production of cell structures wang et al 2015 in terms of lipids content in c pyrenoidosa biomass it ranged from 8 71 5 omw v v to 34 21 25 omw v v in all experiments carried out the total nitrogen in omw after primary treatment were varied from 0 489 mg l 5 omw v v to 17 3 mg l 100 omw v v nevertheless the initial tn availability in control synthetic medium of rodríguez lópez was 140 mg l ródriguez lópez 1964 this fact indicated that all experiments in this work were performed under nitrogen stress condition on the other hand these results are consistent with those obtained in previous studies in which microalgae were cultivated under stress conditions such as high omw concentration nitrogen and phosphate limitation or high salinity in stress conditions lipids formation are preferred storage compounds due to its high reduced state and were packed in cells for the microalgae survival he et al 2015 wang et al 2015 yao et al 2015 table 2 shows the identified fatty acids in the algal biomass lipid fraction harvested from the different culture media fatty acids were grouped into saturated sfa monounsaturated mufa and polyunsaturated pufa in general higher sfa percentages 85 2 95 1 were registered moreover a slightly increase in the sfa percentages was appreciated with the augment of omw more darkness caused by colour effect in the culture media the attenuation of light by the gradual change in cultures colour was greater with higher omw fact that allowed the change of culture behaviour from mixotrophic to heterotrophic in this sense hodaifa et al 2009 observed for s obliquus biomass that sfa content was higher in the absence of light heterotrophic growth than in the presence of light mixotrophic light limited cultures mixotrophic with high light inhibition and heterotrophic cultures behaved similarly and the content of sfa approached and even exceeded the heterotrophic value regardless of the aeration supplied on the other hand mufa and pufa contents showed the opposite trend as contents were greater in mixotrophic low omw than in heterotrophic high omw cultures hodaifa et al 2009 it is necessary to indicate that the higher percentage of sfa in 5 omw v v culture is due to the few fatty acids identified in the lipid fraction of the biomass this fact could be explained considering the small amount of algal biomass obtained 0 980 mg l at the end of the culture the main fatty acids found were palmitic acid 16 0 oleic acid 18 1n9 and stearic acid 18 0 palmitic acid has been registered the highest percentages 65 7 74 7 on the contrary palmitoleic acid 16 1 was only detected in experiments with 50 v v of omw the only polyunsaturated acid identified was 18 2n6 and it was detected in the biomass obtained from all experiments higher percentages of linoleic acid 18 2n6 were found in the biomass obtained from low omw concentration cultures 5 omw v v but no linolenic 18 3n3 epa 20 5n3 or dha were found in any of the experiments obtaining a high lipid fraction 34 2 in the culture with 25 omw v v in the final biomass gives rise to the possibility of using this fraction for biodiesel production in this sense special attention must be paid to the linolenic acid 18 3 and other polyunsaturated fatty acids 4 double bonds content of the biomass since the european standard ec 2008 specifies maximum limits of 12 0 and 1 respectively for a good biodiesel quality production all lipid fractions obtained in the experiments are close to that specified by the european standard ec 2008 it is necessary to indicate that higher percentages of saturated fatty acids in the lipid fraction give more stability to the produced biodiesel since these fatty acids are not prone to oxidation in any case the final biomass obtained 0 098143 mg l 0 143 mg l could be used in combination with other substrates for biofuels production or maybe as supplementary substrate in the anaerobic digester for biogas production in addition as a last option it could be used for domestic commercial or industrial boilers and as a fuel for generators to produce electricity 3 3 3 omw degradation by microalgae and final treated water quality microalgae have the ability to consume organic and inorganic nutrients for cell generation in this work the biological treatment proposed was based on c pyrenoidosa growth fig 2b shows total carbon species and total nitrogen variation in the global algal culture omw microalgal biomass a decline in the total organic carbon during the first stages of the culture corresponding with the exponential growth of c pyrenoidosa is due to the organic compounds removal from the culture medium and its conversion into biomass structures once the exponential and linear growth phases were finished the concentration of tc and toc showed a slight rise explained by the assimilation of smaller quantities of organic compounds due to the cessation of growth and the microalgae death and cell ruptures fig 2c shows the variation of all carbon species concentration with time in the treated omw culture medium without microalgal biomass it can be observed a rapid decrease in the starting period particularly in the first 50 h corresponding this descent with the exponential growth phase of the microalgae this result pointed out that total organic matter removal efficiency was dramatically increased during the exponential phase and indicated that the microalgae was able to assimilate organic compounds as a carbon source through mixotrophic metabolism when both organic carbon and light are present an increase of the toc and tc at later stages of cultivation is associated with cell death and ruptures which leads to an increase in the content of organic compounds in the medium in all experiments ic concentrations in treated omw and global culture were decreased with time fig 2b and c the reduction of the ic levels during the first 50 h of the culture in parallel with tc and toc concentrations can be explained by the ability of c pyrenoidosa to grow mixotrophically assimilating organic compounds as carbon sources while using inorganic compounds as electron donors chojnacka and marquez rocha 2004 after exponential growth when all the assimilated organic compounds mainly sugars were removed the reduction of ic levels during the last hours of the culture treated omw fig 2c can be explained by the assimilation of inorganic carbon and light by microalgae table 1 shows the treated water characteristics after microalgae growth in general for all experiments and characterization parameters higher removal percentages were registered in cultures in which larger omw dilutions were used in this sense the removal values of tc toc ic and tn were 74 0 75 5 71 3 and 87 6 respectively in the culture medium formed by 25 of omw v v these values were decreased to 23 3 15 5 63 1 and 67 3 respectively in the experiment in which undiluted omw was used this cod and toc reduction was observed in the six different culture media indicating that the microalga was able to use organic carbon and light throughout mixotrophic metabolism all parameters were decreased throughout the secondary omw treatment process with the exception of turbidity and toc in the culture without omw dilution which showed an increase after c pyrenoidosa culture due to the presence of cell debris in the final treated water in this sense it is interesting to indicate that after carrying out multiple centrifugations of the supernatant obtained after the first separation by centrifugation of the cell suspension of microalgae a drop of approximately 30 in the parameters of cod and toc data not shown was observed the behaviour of removal percentages registered for characterization parameters is consistent with the variation of the maximum specific growth rates and biomass productivities values fig 3 to determine the effectiveness of the secondary treatment for phenols degradation their content in the omw was determined after algal growth in general tpcs were decreased through the course of the culture furthermore a steeper decrease can be observed during the exponential phase of growth fig 5 a tpcs removal percentages increased with the augment of omw v v in the culture medium these values were increased from 58 6 to 67 1 in the cultures with 5 and 50 omw v v respectively and showed a decrease to 36 4 in the culture constituted by undiluted omw fig 5b this behaviour is consistent with the observed variation of the μm and pb values with omw in the culture media in addition it is interesting to indicate that c pyrenoidosa biomass was able to degrade the majority of the tcps final tpcs 1 mg l present in the culture medium when the initial concentration was below 5 4 mg l the highest algal concentration was achieved when initial tpcs content in the culture medium was lower or equal to this value fig 5b shows the variation of the final tpcs removal registered in the different culture media in this sense many authors have demonstrated the ability of c pyrenoidosa to eliminate high concentrations of phenols and other polluting compounds dayana and bakthavatsalam 2016 2017 investigated the degradation effect of c pyrenoidosa kx686118 on the phenolic effluent of a coal gasification plant in these previous works final concentrations of phenols of up to 1 1 g l were achieved after microalgae growth registering removal percentages higher than 90 in addition wang et al 2015 studied triclosan removal and biodegradation in water by using the same microalgae when c pyrenoidosa was exposed to a series of triclosan concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 ng ml more than 50 of triclosan was eliminated by algal uptake from the culture medium during the first 1 h of exposure reaching the equilibrium after 6 h treatment in biodegradation experiments a removal percentage of 77 2 was obtained after the c pyrenoidosa culture in the presence of 800 ng ml triclosan for 96 h in addition lika and papadakis 2009 demonstrated that biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microalgae occurs in a shorter time interval during the first stages of cultivation when all nutrients required by the microalgae are present in the culture medium when algal cells are grown under constant light intensity and in the presence of organic compounds as carbon source mainly carbohydrates there is a substantial increase in the growth resulting in higher biomass this exponential growth phase corresponds with the stage when the bioremoval of the phenolic compounds by the microalgae is performed in this context it is important to indicate that carbohydrates and phenolic compounds uptake is performed by microalgae in this sense di caprio et al 2018 when studying biodegradation of omw sugars by the green microalga scenedesmus sp indicated that phenol removal took place immediately after the stop in the consumption of omw sugars at the end of the process a high quality treated water was obtained and did not present any toxicity considering that it comes from a combined process where ultraviolet light is applied which has a disinfecting effect and microalgae are grown parameters registered in table 1 indicate that treated water could be used for irrigation and discharges to surface water and groundwater or for drinking water spanish environmental standards for treated omw intended to be used as irrigation water established that treated water must comply the following parameters ph 6 9 suspended solids 500 mg kg and cod 1000 mg o2 l resolution of guadalquivir river basin president 2006 in addition the treated water at the exit of the process comply with european directive 91 271 eec where cod 125 mg o2 l and tn 10 mg l for treated water discharge into receiving waters european commission directive 1991 on the other hand the consolidated text of the drinking water directive with its latest amendments including commission directive eu 2015 1787 of 6 october 2015 define that drinking water is all water used in any food production process undertaking for the manufacture processing preservation or marketing of products or substances intended for human consumption unless the competent national authorities are satisfied that the quality of the water cannot affect the wholesomeness of the foodstuff in its finished form this directive established chemical parameters and indicator parameters which determined the drinking water quality these are electric conductivity 2500 μs cm turbidity acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change toc no abnormal change iron 0 2 mg l sulphate 250 mg l sodium 200 mg l and ammonium 0 5 mg l the values obtained for treated omw from crude omw concentration 25 v v have values next to that request by drinking water standards in any case if some parameter needs to be adjusted some other units such as ion exchange unit or other membrane technology units could be added 4 conclusion omw have a complex composition which hampers its treatment the combined process based on physico chemical and biological treatments is essential for its efficient treatment the primary treatment flocculation photolysis and microfiltration allowed the elimination of a large part of omw organic load 96 2 of cod 80 3 of toc and 96 6 of tpcs secondary treatment eliminated the rest of omw organic load and the final treated water is suitable to be used for irrigation discharge to receiving waters or for its reuse in the process itself allowing the closing of water cycle in the factory the low percentage of sludge generation mainly during flocculation can be recirculated to the head of the treatment process or be directly used in composting after the primary treatment higher growth rates for c pyrenoidosa μm 0 07 h 1 and pb 1 25 mg l h were registered final biomass obtained may be used in direct combustion methane production or in

mill wastewater flocculation photolysis biomass growth chlorella pyrenoidosa treatment 1 introduction microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that are characterized by its easy culture and high growth and productivity rates these microorganisms produce biomass with high added value products as pharmaceutical compounds fatty acids carotenoids dyes and fine chemicals all these compounds can be used for human animal and aquatic feed hodaifa et al 2013 mata et al 2010 nor et al 2016 rawat et al 2011 suganya et al 2016 on the other hand they are able to grow in harsh conditions requiring water inorganic salts co2 and sunlight mata et al 2010 in this sense microalgae have numerous environmental applications such as co2 mitigation and wastewater treatment suganya et al 2016 furthermore certain species have the capacity to degrade a large variety of compounds such as xenobiotic polyaromatic hydrocarbons phenolic compounds pesticides etc for all these reasons the dual application of microalgae for wastewater treatment and biomass production is an attractive alternative with great industrial and economic potential hodaifa et al 2012 rawat et al 2011 different wastewaters such as municipal agricultural and piggery have been used as microalgae culture media for nutrient removal and biomass production abou shanab et al 2013 ji et al 2014 mata et al 2010 rawat et al 2011 many works have shown the ability of microalgae to degrade and remove excess nutrients mainly persistent and hazardous organic pollutants in wastewaters the capacity of chlorella ankistrodesmus and scenedesmus species to remove contaminants from olive oil mill and paper industry wastewaters has already been demonstrated hodaifa et al 2012 2013 kouhia et al 2015 in general wastewaters have a complex physicochemical composition for this reason the nutrient availability and the presence of growth inhibitors could influence microalgal growth guldhe et al 2017 hodaifa et al 2012 olive oil industry is an important sector within the agro food industries in the mediterranean countries hodaifa et al 2012 as well as in non traditional producing countries as australia new zealand and south america due to the growing interest in olive oil consumption and production olive oil is obtained from olive fruit by mechanical procedures throughout pressing discontinuous and centrifugation systems continuous the last systems can be carried out by using a decanter with two or three exits dermeche et al 2013 in spain the main olive oil producer worldwide the centrifugation process using a decanter with two exits for olive oil and pomace production is currently used tsagaraki et al 2007 olive oil mill wastewater omw from two exits is characterized by containing a high concentration of organic matter which includes polysaccharides sugars phenolic compounds polyalcohol nitrogenous compounds organic acids tannins pectin lignin oil and high levels of suspended solids dermeche et al 2013 mantzavinos and kalogerakis 2005 in this sense omw produced by decanter with two exits have less organic load cod 4 16 g o2 l in comparison with the wastewaters generated using a decanter with three exits or the pressing process cod 40 220 g o2 l agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 in this work a new process for real omw treatment based on physico chemical operations as primary treatment followed by microalgae culture as secondary treatment was proposed first operations included flocculation sedimentation photolysis and microfiltration units connected with chlorella pyrenoidosa culture in this sense physico chemical characteristics of the real crude olive oil mill wastewater were studied flocculation sedimentation and photolysis operations were established and optimized then different dilutions of primary treated omw 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 v v were used as culture media kinetic growth biomass production and biochemical composition of c pyrenoidosa were evaluated treated water and bioremediation of the wastewater during the integral process were determined 2 experimental 2 1 microorganism and photobioreactor the microorganism used was the freshwater green algae chlorella

bioreactors had continuous illumination on one side 2 2 procedure omw was obtained from an olive oil extraction plant in the province of seville spain the flocculation sedimentation was carried out during 90 min in imhoff funnel using a commercial flocculant flocudex cs 51 based on a previous study hodaifa et al 2015 an optimal flocculant concentration of 1 g l was selected the obtained

germany g4 150 no 5600 1725 standard was used during the proposed process the reduction of organic matter was determined culture media were prepared by mixing omw and ultrapure water to obtain the following final concentrations 5 10 25 50 75 and 100 v v omw sterilization was performed by filtration through a membrane with pore size equal to 0 2 μm the ph was adjusted and maintained at a value

suspension of cells in sterile rodríguez lópez culture medium 2 2 1 microalgae growth the biomass concentration x g l 1 was measured indirectly by the absorbance of the cell suspension in ultrapure water at 600 nm camacho et al 1989 after two centrifugation stages in which biomass was washed with ultrapure water results obtained allowed the representation of growth curves and the determination of the growth kinetic velocities the specific growth rate μ 1 x dx dt in the exponential phase and the biomass productivity pb dx dt in the linear phase were determined 2 2 2 biochemical composition of the biomass in all experiments the total pigments total chlorophylls and total carotenoids were determined during the course of the cultures at the end of each experiment algal biomass was separated and total lipids proteins and fatty acids contents were determined total lipids were obtained by using a micro soxhlet extractor with n hexane as solvent fatty acid profile was determined and identified directly from dried algal biomass by gas chromatography using a hewlett packard model 5890 series ii equipped by a fid detector lepage and roy 1984 the crude protein content was performed from the nitrogen percentage determination crude proteins tn 6 25 becker 1994 using a total carbon and nitrogen analyser provided by skalar company mod formacsht and formacstn the total carbohydrate content was obtained by considering that algal biomass is formed by proteins carbohydrates lipids pigments and genetic material for carbohydrate content calculation genetic material was considered approximately about 1 becker 1994 2 3 analytical methods in the characterization of wastewater and treated water crude and after each treatment the following parameters were determined ph value electric conductivity turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod total phenolic compounds tpcs total organic carbon toc total carbon tc inorganic carbon ic total nitrogen tn total iron sulphates sodium ortho phosphate and ammonium ph electric conductivity ec and turbidity values were directly measured by using a ph meter crison mod glp 22c conductimeter crison mod glp31 and turbidimeter hanna mod hi93703 respectively the determination of tpcs was carried out by making it react with a derivative thiazol giving a purple azo dye which was determined photometrically at 475 nm according to the standard methods iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 cod was determined photometrically at 620 nm according to german standard methods din 38409 h41 toc tc ic and tn contents were determined using a total carbon and nitrogen analyser provided by skalar company mod formacsht and formacstn total iron ions determination was performed through the reduction of all iron ions to iron ii ions in a thioglycolate medium with a derivative of triazine this reaction results in a reddish purple complex that was determined photometrically at 565 nm according to the standard methods iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 sulphates and ortho phosphates were determined photometrically at 420 nm and 690 nm respectively according to the standard methods iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 sodium ammonium potassium and calcium contents were determined directly by using selective ion electrodes for each one crison mod glp 22c finally carbohydrate content total reducing sugars could be determined by using the dns dinitrosalicylic acid method as described by miller 1959 in this method 3 ml of dns reagent is mixed with 2 ml of sample then the sample is immersed in a water bath at 80 85 c for 5 min after cooling to room temperature the sample is measured photometrically at 540 nm in addition a calibration line using glucose as reference reagent is needed 2 4 calculation methods and reproducibility in this work experiments were made at least in duplicate and analytical methods were applied at least in triplicate models calculation and statistical methods used were available in the originpro 8 0 program 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw omw used wastewater must contain a suitable nutrient profile for its use as culture medium for microalgae with carbon nitrogen and phosphorous sources as the most essential elements required for algal biomass growth table 1 shows the composition of raw and treated industrial olive oil wastewater used in this work it is necessary to highlight the high presence of high organic matter determined in terms of turbidity 714 ftu cod 5839 mg o2 l tpcs 322 mg l toc 646 mg l and tn 58 9 mg l the high tn concentration registered can be explained by the presence of proteins and other nitrogenated compounds in the omw composition which come from the olive fruit crushing and olive oil washing agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 high concentrations of phenols tpcs 322 mg l were also found these latter compounds have a similar structure to that of lignin which makes them difficult to be biodegraded they are also characterized by a high specific chemical oxygen demand phytotoxicity and antibacterial activity being the major contributors to the omw toxicity and microalgal growth inhibition azabou et al 2007 d antuono et al 2014 fountoulakis et al 2002 a high inorganic salts portion was also detected 318 mg l as well as phosphorus in the form of inorganic salts ortho phosphate 43 1 mg l which play an important role in microalgae cell growth and metabolism through phosphorylation reactions on the other hand it must be also indicated the high cod toc ratio value equal to 9 registered for raw omw in comparison with domestic wastewater in which this value is around 2 to 3 huang et al 2010 similarly high cod toc values have been registered in several industrial wastewater studies güneş et al 2019 described industrial container and drum cleaning wastewater sample 3 with cod toc 6 21 agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 determined for crude wastewater from washing olives wow a cod toc ratio 8 12 buthiyappan and abdul raman 2019 indicated cod toc ratio values from 9 41 to 11 2 for textile wastewaters and dhanke et al 2018 established cod toc ratio 24 3 for fish processing industry wastewaters this fact can be explained by the high heterogeneity of industrial wastewaters physicochemical characteristics which is mainly determined by the wastewater origin raper et al 2018 the low iron content can be explained by the use of drinking water in food industries for washing raw materials high iron concentration is not desired since it is a microalgae growth inhibitor fazal et al 2018 3 2 bioprocess for olive oil mill wastewater treatment the proposed new real omw treatment process was performed according to fig 1 the process undertaken consisted of four phases of which the first three phases correspond to the primary treatment and the last stage to the secondary treatment i flocculation sedimentation it was performed in two steps without ph modification in the first to complete mixing of flocculant and effluent a high agitation speed 700 rpm was applied for 1 min in the second to achieve flocs formation a low agitation speed 350 rpm for 30 min was employed the aim of this stage was to separate and remove the solid fraction of omw which consisted of a sludge that can be used subsequently for composting for this purpose flocculated omw was left to settle during 30 min ii photolysis it consisted on the exposition of the obtained supernatant after removal of the solid fraction to uv light for 30 min the objective of this stage was the elimination of a part of the organic matter present in omw especially organic compounds as phenols which are considered as microbial growth inhibitors sample settling during 30 min was performed to allow the sedimentation and subsequent separation of the remaining solid fraction iii microfiltration it was used for omw microbial sterilization and organic load reduction iv chlorella pyrenoidosa culture for the bioremediation of omw and the obtaining of microalgal biomass with added value mainly energetic compounds which could be used for biofuels and biogas production or directly used in boilers for biomass combustion 3 2 1 primary treatment table 1 shows the variation of the treated water composition during the primary treatment in general all parameters were decreased throughout the primary treatment flocculation stage allowed a high total phenolic compounds removal percentage of up to 78 table 1 theoretically after the use of flocculant in omw treatment an increase in tpcs is expected due to the presence of phenolic compounds in the flocculant composition the commercial flocudex cs51 used is a solid cationic polyelectrolyte with high molecular weight and high capacity to eliminate suspended solids turbidity and compounds responsible for colour apparition in this sense it is important to indicate that commercial flocculants usually incorporate a lignosulfonate guaiacol methoxy phenol or protocatechuic acid in the synthesis process of acrylamide copolymers he et al 2015 after the photolysis operation the tpcs concentration was decreased to 38 5 mg l tpcs removal 45 7 due to the degradation process of lignin and phenols by the uv light el hajjouji et al 2007 machado et al 2000 lignin polymer which is largely present in olives pulp is a natural polymer whose main structural units are phenolic compounds tanaka et al 1999 from the environmental point of view the organic load can be determined by cod and toc parameters during the flocculation photolysis and microfiltration the removal percentages 57 5 88 8 and 20 5 for cod and 18 0 71 9 and 14 6 for toc were determined respectively as a result of the flocculation process the toc tn ratio increased from 11 0 crude omw to 19 1 flocculated omw indicating a strong fall in nitrogen content due to the efficient protein removal component with high molecular weight by the flocculant after that the ratio decreased to 6 66 this showed that during flocculation a high percentage of proteins were removed and during photolysis higher levels of organic matter oxidation were achieved in general the variation in the different determined ratios after flocculation does not follow a fixed pattern in this sense cod toc ratio was decreased from 9 04 to 4 69 through flocculation this separation depends on the aggregation mechanism applied charge neutralization entrapment mainly by van der waals forces adsorption forces complexation with coagulant metal flocculent ions into insoluble particulate aggregates matilainen et al 2010 therefore the separation mechanism through flocculation is a non selective separation during microfiltration the toc tn ratio registered a slightly increase 7 4 indicating higher carbon compounds removal in comparison with the elimination of nitrogenated compounds in view of the results achieved it can be confirmed that photolysis was the most effective operation for organic load reduction von sonntag 2008 showed the effectiveness of uv light for organic matter photodegradation in comparison with natural oxidation photolysis is a photochemical operation in which organic compounds are partially decomposed because of the absorption of this high energy irradiation agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 studied the uv light effect in the degradation of omw organic matter in photoreactors they observed that photodegradation occurs in one step by an instantaneous reaction in the first minutes 4 min afterwards no significant degradation was observed in addition catalá et al 2015 when using a 150 w medium pressure mercury lamp the same uv lamp used in this work in natural fluvial waters containing illicit drugs achieved high toc removal level equal to 79 this high elimination percentage obtained after photolysis is due to the special characteristics of uv lamp used wide emission range and high potency in this case a commercial medium pressure uv immersion lamp model tq 150 brand hng germany g4 150 w no 5600 1725 standard was used in general medium pressure mercury lamps are available in different potency from 100 to 1000w the emission profile of these lamps consists on a wide range of wavelengths from 200 to 700 nm uv and visible light and the peak of 254 nm is strongly diminished the emission intensity of these lamps is at least 10 fold higher than that of low pressure arcs but happens on a much smaller surface this uv lamp type in contrast to other develops a considerable amount of heat which cooling is required but this problem can be resolved by running tap water to maintain the temperature around 20 c albini and germani 2010 in addition this fact is not important when working at pilot or industrial plant since the reactor volume itself is enough to remove the heat generated by the uv lamp other authors have shown that artificial uv light oxidation allows the rapid decomposition of toxic compounds such as nitrosodimetylamine ndma hydrazine 1 4 dioxane and methylthrethylbutaneethyl mtbe mccurry et al 2016 radjenovic et al 2012 tawabini et al 2013 sulphate ions were efficiently removed during the primary treatment table 1 high sulphate ions removal percentages 73 7 and 34 5 were registered after flocculation and microfiltration respectively sulphate ions elimination from water and wastewater is complex due to the high solubility and stability of these anions in aqueous solutions the main methods used for its treatment are 1 biological degradation 2 membrane filtration primarily reverse osmosis 3 adsorption ion exchange in resins and 4 chemical precipitation amaral filho et al 2016 3 3 secondary treatment microalgal treatment 3 3 1 chlorella pyrenoidosa growth fig 2a shows a sample of the growth curves of c pyrenoidosa when the microalgae was grown in a 10 omw v v culture in general a short duration 18 h lag or adaptation phase was detected in all experiments this phase was followed by an exponential growth phase whose duration ranged from 20 to 32 h in the cultures with omw 75 v v only in the case of 100 omw v v the duration of this phase was 61 5 h then a deceleration growth phase with linear behaviour was observed the duration of the linear growth was increased with the augment of omw in the culture medium from 25 to 144 h this appears to indicate that this phase is determined by the limitation of one or more nutrients a stationary phase of growth at the end of the culture was observed in all experiments in this sense similar growth curves were obtained by hodaifa et al 2008 2009 2012 using omw from two and three phase systems as culture media for scenedesmus obliquus the determination of the maximum specific growth rate and biomass productivity of c pyrenoidosa were determined according equations 1 and 2 respectively fig 2 a 1 l n x x o μ m t a where μm is the slope of the line and corresponds to the maximum specific growth rate and a is the intercept 2 x p b t b where pb is the slope of line and corresponds to the volumetric biomass productivity and b is the intercept it can be observed in fig 3 the variation of the maximum specific growth rates μm and the biomass productivities pb when initial omw concentrations were increased in the culture medium in both cases μm and pb values were increased with the rise in omw in the culture medium until 50 of omw v v then these parameters were rapidly decreased especially in the case of μm indicating inhibition or toxic effect in the culture media the highest experimental values of μm 0 07 h 1 and pb 1 25 mg l h were registered in the culture with 50 of omw v v after this concentration these parameters were decreased to 0 0165 h 1 and 0 408 mg l h in the culture with 100 of omw v v in which the lowest values were achieved this result was expected due to the presence of fat matter organics acids pesticide residues and phenolic compounds in the composition of omw which are known to harm and inhibit microalgal growth hodaifa et al 2012 kobayashi and rittmann 1982 after studying various inhibition and toxicity growth models by substrate the one that best reproduced the experimental variation observed in μm with omw concentrations was the polynomial model type of moser 1985 eq 3 3 μ m μ m m a x α o α 1 o m w α 2 o m w 2 where μm max 0 068 h 1 is the maximum value of the maximum specific growth rate obtained in the different cultures performed and the constant values of αo α1 and α2 are equal to 0 0588 0 0367 and 3 52 10 4 respectively the parameters of the goodness of the fit were r2 0 978 and residual sum squares rss 5 51 10 5 in this sense it is interesting to indicate that the maximum value for μm obtained by the mathematical model is similar to that achieved experimentally 0 07 h 1 the volumetric biomass productivity was determined by the fit of the x t data during the deceleration growth phase as mentioned before the start of this phase is associated with limited availability of co2 goldman et al 1981 light evers 1990 or both and these two components of the culture were provided at a constant rate co2 was supplied through aeration of the culture medium at 0 5 v v min and the incident intensity of illumination was also constant in all experiments and equal to 359 μe m 2 s 1 however due to the colouration of the medium the attenuation of the light was greater in culture media containing a higher percentage of omw this explains the decrease in pb with the increase of omw concentration in the culture medium just as with μm pb increases with the rise in omw in the culture medium until 50 of omw v v when the maximum biomass productivity equal to 1 25 mg l h was achieved the model that justifies the variation of pb with the percentage of omw is the modified monod model in which the presence of toxic agents or a substance at high enough concentrations were considered fig 3b this model includes a term of ki omw2 to describe the inhibitory or toxic effect of a nutrient at high concentrations and it is defined by eq 4 4 p b p b m a x o m w k s o m w k i o m w 2 where pb max 0 002041 g l h is the apparent maximum value of volumetric biomass productivity without inhibition effect though the value of pb max is higher the constant values of ks 13 8 and ki 1 42 10 7 are consistent with the data obtained experimentally the parameters of the goodness of the fit were r2 0 961 and residual sum squares rss 3 22 10 8 pb values were similar to that registered by sánchez et al 2001 in that work c pyrenoidosa was cultivated in omw obtained from a continuous olive oil extraction system using decanter with three exits this omw is known as 3 phase system or alpechín in spain however lower μm values 0 011 0 045 h 1 were obtained due to the higher organic matter concentration in omw from three phase extraction system dqo 40 220 g o2 l in comparison with omw from two phase extraction system dqo 4 16 g o2 l agabo garcía and hodaifa 2017 3 3 2 biochemical composition of c pyrenoidosa biomass at the end of the experiments the harvested biomass of c pyrenoidosa was analysed for proteins carbohydrates and lipids contents determination these are the microalgae cells main components the variation on the biomass composition of c pyrenoidosa for all omw dilutions is shown in fig 4 microalgal cells require nitrogen for the synthesis of protein nucleic acid and phospholipids and thus the growth of microalgae is believed to be essential for nitrogen removal wang et al 2015 protein content of the microalgae biomass was increased with the increment of omw concentration in the culture media fig 4 and ranged from 0 99 initial tnculture medium 0 948 mg l and tnfinal biomass 0 155 in 5 omw v v culture media to 51 5 initial tnculture medium 17 3 mg l and tnfinal biomass 8 25 in 100 omw culture medium it could therefore be concluded that protein content of the microalgae cells was sensitive to changes in nutrient levels the initial nitrogen content in the low concentration omw culture medium was not enough for the synthesis of proteins causing the decrease of the protein content in the biomass at the end of the culture and in the microalgae growth subsequently proteins are essential for microalgae growth nutrient deficiency could inhibit protein synthesis and microalgae growth subsequently zhang et al 2017 demonstrated the rapid biomass accumulation of c pyrenoidosa when the microalgae was grown in straw hydrolysate medium and the effectiveness of nitrogen regulation in biomass composition in heterotrophic condition hodaifa et al 2008 obtained similar results with the same omw and scenedesmus obliquus in this study the percentage of protein varied between 6 2 and 30 8 corresponding to 5 and 50 omw v v culture media the biomass protein content of s obliquus reached a value of up to 43 8 hodaifa et al 2013 when the microalgae was cultured in a medium without n deficiency as the rodríguez lópez 1964 synthetic medium becker 1994 carbohydrates content in biomass under low omw percentages increased because of nutrient deficiency mainly nitrogen under nitrogen stress condition microalgae store carbohydrates as molecular reserves that can be used as alternative energy sources this is consistent with previous findings showing that carbohydrate accumulation in microalgae is triggered by nitrogen depletion on the other hand cultures with 5 omw are virtually transparent after primary treatment which favoured autotrophic culture in this sense through photosynthesis microalgae can convert atmospheric co2 along with water and light into organic matter being carbohydrates the major products the excess of fixed carbon is commonly stored into carbohydrates and in stressful conditions these molecular reserves can be used as alternative energy sources for the production of cell structures wang et al 2015 in terms of lipids content in c pyrenoidosa biomass it ranged from 8 71 5 omw v v to 34 21 25 omw v v in all experiments carried out the total nitrogen in omw after primary treatment were varied from 0 489 mg l 5 omw v v to 17 3 mg l 100 omw v v nevertheless the initial tn availability in control synthetic medium of rodríguez lópez was 140 mg l ródriguez lópez 1964 this fact indicated that all experiments in this work were performed under nitrogen stress condition on the other hand these results are consistent with those obtained in previous studies in which microalgae were cultivated under stress conditions such as high omw concentration nitrogen and phosphate limitation or high salinity in stress conditions lipids formation are preferred storage compounds due to its high reduced state and were packed in cells for the microalgae survival he et al 2015 wang et al 2015 yao et al 2015 table 2 shows the identified fatty acids in the algal biomass lipid fraction harvested from the different culture media fatty acids were grouped into saturated sfa monounsaturated mufa and polyunsaturated pufa in general higher sfa percentages 85 2 95 1 were registered moreover a slightly increase in the sfa percentages was appreciated with the augment of omw more darkness caused by colour effect in the culture media the attenuation of light by the gradual change in cultures colour was greater with higher omw fact that allowed the change of culture behaviour from mixotrophic to heterotrophic in this sense hodaifa et al 2009 observed for s obliquus biomass that sfa content was higher in the absence of light heterotrophic growth than in the presence of light mixotrophic light limited cultures mixotrophic with high light inhibition and heterotrophic cultures behaved similarly and the content of sfa approached and even exceeded the heterotrophic value regardless of the aeration supplied on the other hand mufa and pufa contents showed the opposite trend as contents were greater in mixotrophic low omw than in heterotrophic high omw cultures hodaifa et al 2009 it is necessary to indicate that the higher percentage of sfa in 5 omw v v culture is due to the few fatty acids identified in the lipid fraction of the biomass this fact could be explained considering the small amount of algal biomass obtained 0 980 mg l at the end of the culture the main fatty acids found were palmitic acid 16 0 oleic acid 18 1n9 and stearic acid 18 0 palmitic acid has been registered the highest percentages 65 7 74 7 on the contrary palmitoleic acid 16 1 was only detected in experiments with 50 v v of omw the only polyunsaturated acid identified was 18 2n6 and it was detected in the biomass obtained from all experiments higher percentages of linoleic acid 18 2n6 were found in the biomass obtained from low omw concentration cultures 5 omw v v but no linolenic 18 3n3 epa 20 5n3 or dha were found in any of the experiments obtaining a high lipid fraction 34 2 in the culture with 25 omw v v in the final biomass gives rise to the possibility of using this fraction for biodiesel production in this sense special attention must be paid to the linolenic acid 18 3 and other polyunsaturated fatty acids 4 double bonds content of the biomass since the european standard ec 2008 specifies maximum limits of 12 0 and 1 respectively for a good biodiesel quality production all lipid fractions obtained in the experiments are close to that specified by the european standard ec 2008 it is necessary to indicate that higher percentages of saturated fatty acids in the lipid fraction give more stability to the produced biodiesel since these fatty acids are not prone to oxidation in any case the final biomass obtained 0 098143 mg l 0 143 mg l could be used in combination with other substrates for biofuels production or maybe as supplementary substrate in the anaerobic digester for biogas production in addition as a last option it could be used for domestic commercial or industrial boilers and as a fuel for generators to produce electricity 3 3 3 omw degradation by microalgae and final treated water quality microalgae have the ability to consume organic and inorganic nutrients for cell generation in this work the biological treatment proposed was based on c pyrenoidosa growth fig 2b shows total carbon species and total nitrogen variation in the global algal culture omw microalgal biomass a decline in the total organic carbon during the first stages of the culture corresponding with the exponential growth of c pyrenoidosa is due to the organic compounds removal from the culture medium and its conversion into biomass structures once the exponential and linear growth phases were finished the concentration of tc and toc showed a slight rise explained by the assimilation of smaller quantities of organic compounds due to the cessation of growth and the microalgae death and cell ruptures fig 2c shows the variation of all carbon species concentration with time in the treated omw culture medium without microalgal biomass it can be observed a rapid decrease in the starting period particularly in the first 50 h corresponding this descent with the exponential growth phase of the microalgae this result pointed out that total organic matter removal efficiency was dramatically increased during the exponential phase and indicated that the microalgae was able to assimilate organic compounds as a carbon source through mixotrophic metabolism when both organic carbon and light are present an increase of the toc and tc at later stages of cultivation is associated with cell death and ruptures which leads to an increase in the content of organic compounds in the medium in all experiments ic concentrations in treated omw and global culture were decreased with time fig 2b and c the reduction of the ic levels during the first 50 h of the culture in parallel with tc and toc concentrations can be explained by the ability of c pyrenoidosa to grow mixotrophically assimilating organic compounds as carbon sources while using inorganic compounds as electron donors chojnacka and marquez rocha 2004 after exponential growth when all the assimilated organic compounds mainly sugars were removed the reduction of ic levels during the last hours of the culture treated omw fig 2c can be explained by the assimilation of inorganic carbon and light by microalgae table 1 shows the treated water characteristics after microalgae growth in general for all experiments and characterization parameters higher removal percentages were registered in cultures in which larger omw dilutions were used in this sense the removal values of tc toc ic and tn were 74 0 75 5 71 3 and 87 6 respectively in the culture medium formed by 25 of omw v v these values were decreased to 23 3 15 5 63 1 and 67 3 respectively in the experiment in which undiluted omw was used this cod and toc reduction was observed in the six different culture media indicating that the microalga was able to use organic carbon and light throughout mixotrophic metabolism all parameters were decreased throughout the secondary omw treatment process with the exception of turbidity and toc in the culture without omw dilution which showed an increase after c pyrenoidosa culture due to the presence of cell debris in the final treated water in this sense it is interesting to indicate that after carrying out multiple centrifugations of the supernatant obtained after the first separation by centrifugation of the cell suspension of microalgae a drop of approximately 30 in the parameters of cod and toc data not shown was observed the behaviour of removal percentages registered for characterization parameters is consistent with the variation of the maximum specific growth rates and biomass productivities values fig 3 to determine the effectiveness of the secondary treatment for phenols degradation their content in the omw was determined after algal growth in general tpcs were decreased through the course of the culture furthermore a steeper decrease can be observed during the exponential phase of growth fig 5 a tpcs removal percentages increased with the augment of omw v v in the culture medium these values were increased from 58 6 to 67 1 in the cultures with 5 and 50 omw v v respectively and showed a decrease to 36 4 in the culture constituted by undiluted omw fig 5b this behaviour is consistent with the observed variation of the μm and pb values with omw in the culture media in addition it is interesting to indicate that c pyrenoidosa biomass was able to degrade the majority of the tcps final tpcs 1 mg l present in the culture medium when the initial concentration was below 5 4 mg l the highest algal concentration was achieved when initial tpcs content in the culture medium was lower or equal to this value fig 5b shows the variation of the final tpcs removal registered in the different culture media in this sense many authors have demonstrated the ability of c pyrenoidosa to eliminate high concentrations of phenols and other polluting compounds dayana and bakthavatsalam 2016 2017 investigated the degradation effect of c pyrenoidosa kx686118 on the phenolic effluent of a coal gasification plant in these previous works final concentrations of phenols of up to 1 1 g l were achieved after microalgae growth registering removal percentages higher than 90 in addition wang et al 2015 studied triclosan removal and biodegradation in water by using the same microalgae when c pyrenoidosa was exposed to a series of triclosan concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 ng ml more than 50 of triclosan was eliminated by algal uptake from the culture medium during the first 1 h of exposure reaching the equilibrium after 6 h treatment in biodegradation experiments a removal percentage of 77 2 was obtained after the c pyrenoidosa culture in the presence of 800 ng ml triclosan for 96 h in addition lika and papadakis 2009 demonstrated that biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microalgae occurs in a shorter time interval during the first stages of cultivation when all nutrients required by the microalgae are present in the culture medium when algal cells are grown under constant light intensity and in the presence of organic compounds as carbon source mainly carbohydrates there is a substantial increase in the growth resulting in higher biomass this exponential growth phase corresponds with the stage when the bioremoval of the phenolic compounds by the microalgae is performed in this context it is important to indicate that carbohydrates and phenolic compounds uptake is performed by microalgae in this sense di caprio et al 2018 when studying biodegradation of omw sugars by the green microalga scenedesmus sp indicated that phenol removal took place immediately after the stop in the consumption of omw sugars at the end of the process a high quality treated water was obtained and did not present any toxicity considering that it comes from a combined process where ultraviolet light is applied which has a disinfecting effect and microalgae are grown parameters registered in table 1 indicate that treated water could be used for irrigation and discharges to surface water and groundwater or for drinking water spanish environmental standards for treated omw intended to be used as irrigation water established that treated water must comply the following parameters ph 6 9 suspended solids 500 mg kg and cod 1000 mg o2 l resolution of guadalquivir river basin president 2006 in addition the treated water at the exit of the process comply with european directive 91 271 eec where cod 125 mg o2 l and tn 10 mg l for treated water discharge into receiving waters european commission directive 1991 on the other hand the consolidated text of the drinking water directive with its latest amendments including commission directive eu 2015 1787 of 6 october 2015 define that drinking water is all water used in any food production process undertaking for the manufacture processing preservation or marketing of products or substances intended for human consumption unless the competent national authorities are satisfied that the quality of the water cannot affect the wholesomeness of the foodstuff in its finished form this directive established chemical parameters and indicator parameters which determined the drinking water quality these are electric conductivity 2500 μs cm turbidity acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change toc no abnormal change iron 0 2 mg l sulphate 250 mg l sodium 200 mg l and ammonium 0 5 mg l the values obtained for treated omw from crude omw concentration 25 v v have values next to that request by drinking water standards in any case if some parameter needs to be adjusted some other units such as ion exchange unit or other membrane technology units could be added 4 conclusion omw have a complex composition which hampers its treatment the combined process based on physico chemical and biological treatments is essential for its efficient treatment the primary treatment flocculation photolysis and microfiltration allowed the elimination of a large part of omw organic load 96 2 of cod 80 3 of toc and 96 6 of tpcs secondary treatment eliminated the rest of omw organic load and the final treated water is suitable to be used for irrigation discharge to receiving waters or for its reuse in the process itself allowing the closing of water cycle in the factory the low percentage of sludge generation mainly during flocculation can be recirculated to the head of the treatment process or be directly used in composting after the primary treatment higher growth rates for c pyrenoidosa μm 0 07 h 1 and pb 1 25 mg l h were registered final biomass obtained may be used in direct combustion methane production or in
