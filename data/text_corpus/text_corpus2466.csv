the suitable reagent for desorption graphical abstract fx1 keywords lithium ion battery waste congo red cr hexavalent chromium cr vi manganese powder 1 introduction the dyeing effluent discharged from various industries such as paper and printing leathers cosmetics textiles etc pollute the water bodies blackburn 2004 the disposal of dyeing effluent into the water bodies may have significant environmental impacts causing damage to the ecosystem by mutagenic or carcinogenic effects crini 2006 about 50 of all known dyes are azo dyes that are the major group of colorings used in textile industries binupriya et al 2008 among the dyes congo red cr is a benzidine based azo dye that is expected to metabolize to benzidine prolonged use of this dye may cause tumor formation in humans leading to cancer chatterjee et al 2009a cr is resistant to biological degradation and contains recalcitrant organic molecules and therefore is difficult to remove sun and yang 2003 along with dyes elevated levels of certain metals such as cr vi are also found in the textile effluents as cr metals are widely used as mordents i e color fixing agents the toxicity of cr vi is mainly attributed to its strong oxidizing property that enables it to become a mutagen carcinogen and teratogen talreja et al 2014 natale et al 2015 permissible limit provisional guideline for cr vi is 0 05mg l who 1996 therefore it is very important to remove the dyes from wastewater before disposal into natural waters since the dyes are stable in presence of oxidizing agents and are found to be resistant to aerobic digestion therefore the treatment of effluent with synthetic dye is very challenging chatterjee et al 2009b hung yee and ming chin 2005 nowadays much effort is being given for developing a suitable

several nations the spent batteries are either incinerated or dumped in landfills instead of reused or recycled ferella et al 2010 recoverable mno2 from battery waste varies but is generally 30 40 recovery costs are offset by the advantages of recycling and reuse potential which produces new materials which not only help in reducing wastes and but also conserve raw materials in the interest of sustainable development thus in the present study aims to understand the mechanism of simultaneous removal of congo red and hexavalent chromium from spent battery waste 2 materials and methods 2 1

five folds with distilled water for analysis of congo red and 100µl aliquot was used for the diphenylcarbazide method 1 for measuring of cr vi by uv vis spectrophotometry 8453 uv vis agilent santa clara ca usa for optimizing the conditions batch tests to determine the effect of ph 3 5 8 and10 dosage of synthesized manganese 0 1 0 5 1 and 2g l and various initial concentrations of cr and cr vi on contaminant removal was done the manganese powder 0 1g was added to 250ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 400mg congo red and 100mg cr vi in 100ml aqueous solution to study their simultaneous removal the flasks were agitated at 200rpm at room temperature the adsorption of congo red and cr vi was described using kinetic and isotherm models two kinetic models were proposed for congo red and cr vi adsorption capacity into the manganese powder manganese powder 0 1g was placed in contact with the metals solution 100ml with orbital stirring at room temperature samples 1 5ml were removed at different time intervals 0 3 5 10 30 60 and 180min the pseudo first order rate equation is generally represented as 1 d q t d t k 1 q e q t where q t q e and k 1 are the amount of congo red and cr vi adsorbed at time t mg g the amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g and the pseudofirst order rate constant 1 min respectively the pseudo second order rate equation is expressed as 2 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 is the pseudosecond order rate constant g mg min the adsorption isotherm describes the relation between the mass of congo red and cr vi adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent and aqueous phase congo red and cr vi concentration at equilibrium and constant temperature tests were run for 6h till the equilibrium was reached manganese powder 0 1g was added into the solution 100ml with different initial congo red concentrations 30 50 100 150 200 and 300mg l and hexavalent chromium concentration 10 30 50 100 and 150mg l respectively the langmuir model is most frequently employed for adsorption of congo red and cr vi 3 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where q max c e andk l are the maximum adsorption capacity mg g concentration of congo red and cr vi in solution at equilibrium mg l and the langmuir adsorption constant l mg respectively the freundlich isotherm often used to describe the adsorption of a broad range of adsorbates is expressed as 4 q e k f c e 1 n where k f is the freundlich adsorption constant l mg and 1 n is the adsorption intensity adsorption capacity at equilibrium is calculated as 5 q e c 0 c e m v where c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cr and cr vi respectively m g is the mass of adsorbent and v l is solution volume at the end of the experiment solutions were examined for color change using a light microscope 2 5 desorption study for experiments of desorption study 0 1g of congo red and cr vi was added to the synthesized zero manganese at optimum conditions 0 1g of loaded manganese powder was kept at shaking condition with 50ml of different desorbing agents distilled water different concentration of hcl and naoh for 3h and then centrifuged at 3500rpm for 20min the centrifuged liquid was analyzed for the congo red and cr vi the desorption percentage was calculated as 6 desorption mass of contaminant desorbed mass of contaminant adsorbed 100 the most promising desorbing agent was confirmed by desorption study 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of manganese particles the synthesized manganese powder composition was analyzed by xrf table 1 the result showed mno 62 721 as the major component in the mixture followed by so3 31 691 and na2o 2 544 etc the mineralogy was detected by xrd patterns shown in fig 7 the xrd spectrum for non treated sample shows characteristic peaks of mnox bonds this mno x spectrum contains diffraction lines or peaks relative to the mixture of mno2 and mn2o3 oxides sharp bands in the non treated sample at 2θ equals to 18 and 28 correspond to mno2 similarly in the same sample 2 θ equals to 25 and 34 correspond to mn2o3 there were no other significant peaks except for a faint peak at 2θ value of 39 for treated congo red sample two broad peaks at 2 θ value of 18 and 36 for treated cr vi sample and two small peaks around 2 θ value of 19 and 36 for simultaneous treated congo red and cr vi sample this may be due to cr and cr vi was impregnated on the surface of the amorphous manganese oxides table 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a highly sensitive technique for identifying organic and inorganic groups present at low proportions jayandran et al 2015 the ftir spectrum of manganese powder extracted from battery waste is shown in fig 6 the spectrum was recorded in the range of 500 4000cm 1 all of the samples have characteristic peaks in the range of 500 700cm 1 that are attributed to mn oxides the two distinguished peaks at 730cm 1 and 901cm 1 in the treated and non treated samples corresponding to the typical o mn o stretching bonds denoting the presence of mno2 the broad peak obtained around 3495cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of oh groups the distinguished peaks from 12 00 14 00cm 1 characteristic to cr in case of treated cr confirms the anchoring of the contaminant to the zero mn powder surface cr vi disrupts the charge balance and to maintain the electroneutrality mn concentration increases thereby producing sharp mn oxide bands also a blue shift in peak ranging in the 500 700cm 1 is observed in case of cr vi treated and simultaneous treatment with cr and cr vi as a result of disturbance of cation oxygen bonds by the two cations field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem micrograph of the manganese oxides is shown in fig 8 the fesem images show the change in surface morphology of the synthesized zero manganese and the treated samples the untreated mnox has a completely different morphology with polymorphic particle like structures while the treated samples lack such structures and rather are slightly agglomerated forming clumps 3 2 removal of congo red and hexavalant chromium the congo red was more efficiently removed compared to hexavalent chromium fig 1 from solution of100 mg l concentration congo red were completely removed in 30min moreover congo red the 200mg l and 300mg l concentration were removed to 92 and 76 respectively however the removal of hexavalent chromium was not as high as compared to congo red removal the 30mg l of hexavalent chromium was removed to around 73 1 while the 50mg l and 100mg l of initial concentrations of cr vi were removed to 58 7 and 31 5 respectively from the plot it can be clearly seen that the removal of the different initial concentration of congo red and hexavalent chromium reached the equilibrium state after 60min however most of the reaction in case of all the different initial concentrations of congo red and hexavalent chromium had occurred during the initial 3min to optimize the removal conditions batch tests to know the effect of different ph dosage of synthesized manganese powder and various concentrations of congo red and cr vi were performed among the ph range chosen 3 5 8 and 10 congo red showed the highest adsorption up to around 170 mg g at ph 8 while for cr vi the highest adsorption was 35mg g at the same ph fig 2 the ph decreased after the treatment to around 7 4 from 8 the concentration of 0 1g l of the synthesized zero manganese showed the maximum adsorption of around 240mg g for congo red while it showed around 65mg g adsorption for cr vi at the same manganese concentration fig 3 the adsorption was observed to decrease on increasing the synthesized manganese powder concentration at 2g l concentration the adsorption was found to be 110mg g for cr and 35mg g for cr vi for different concentrations of the contaminants 400mg l and 100mg l showed the highest adsorption i e around 475mg g and 125mg g for cr and cr vi respectively fig 4 3 3 simultaneous removal of contaminants the synthesized manganese powder was able to remove cr and cr vi simultaneously in this experiment as well cr was more efficiently removed than cr vi in case of simultaneous removal neither cr nor cr vi was removed completely from 450mg l concentration cr was removed to 250mg l and cr vi was removed from 125mg l to around 74mg l concentration in optimum conditions fig 5 3 4 desorption study the desorption study was done using different reagents viz distilled water 0 1m hcl 0 1m naoh 0 3m naoh and 0 5m naoh fig 9 distilled water showed negligible desorption capacity for both cr and cr vi on the other hand 0 1m hcl showed the highest desorption percentage 45 for cr and 0 1 naoh showed the highest desorption percentage 60 for cr vi 0 3m naoh also showed significant desorption 40 for congo red 4 conclusion manganese powder was synthesized from spent battery waste and was characterized and tested for congo red and hexavalent chromium removal xrf ftir and xrd results confirmed the presence of mn oxides in the synthesized powder also fesem results showed the change in surface morphology before and after the treatments the synthesized manganese powder was successfully able to simultaneously remove congo red and cr vi with a greater efficiency of removal of congo red different reagents were tested for desorption study of the treated zero manganese powder and 0 1m hcl and 0 1m naoh which are easily available commercial reagents showed the greatest desorption capacity for cr and cr vi respectively both cong red and cr vi have significant environmental impacts causing damage to the ecosystem by mutagenic or carcinogenic effects they are resistant to biological degradation and difficult to remove so this study is not only going provide the understanding about its removal mechanism after removal recycling and reuse can produce new materials which not only help in reducing wastes and but also conserve raw materials

negligible desorption capacity for both cr and cr vi on the other hand 0 1m hcl showed the highest desorption percentage 45 for cr and 0 1 naoh showed the highest desorption percentage 60 for cr vi 0 3m naoh also showed significant desorption 40 for congo red 4 conclusion manganese powder was synthesized from spent battery waste and was characterized and tested for congo red and hexavalent chromium removal xrf ftir and xrd results confirmed the presence of mn oxides in the synthesized powder also fesem results showed the change in surface morphology before and after the treatments the synthesized manganese powder was successfully able to simultaneously remove congo red and cr vi with a greater efficiency of removal of congo red different reagents were tested for desorption study of the treated zero manganese powder and 0 1m hcl and 0 1m naoh which are easily available commercial reagents showed the greatest desorption capacity for cr and cr vi respectively both cong red and cr vi have significant environmental impacts causing damage to the ecosystem by mutagenic or carcinogenic effects they are resistant to biological degradation and difficult to remove so this study is not only going provide the understanding about its removal mechanism after removal recycling and reuse can produce new materials which not only help in reducing wastes and but also conserve raw materials

revealed in general both pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp mix approximately 1 5 108 cfu ml showed significant growth p 0 05 at low concentrations of glyphosate and degrade effectively the mix of equal proportions of pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp approximately 1 5 108 cfu ml has shown best performance over the other treatments in terms of their growth at all concentrations of glyphosate fig 3 1 fig 3 2 and fig 3 3 the highest microbial growth and activity was observed in the 50 mg ml of glyphosate which was the lowest tested glyphosate concentration however increasing glyphosate concentration results inhibition of the microbial population growth in each type of the microbes used in different treatments fig 3 1 fig 3 2 and fig 3 3 control was used as a reference and all the tested glyphosate concentrations it was shown the minimum optical density at 660 nm wavelength suggested that the residue formed in glyphosate might be the reason of turbidity the findings of the present study agreed with the results of the research done by kryuchkova et al 2014 enterobacter cloacae k7 utilize glyphosate as a source of p and enterobacter cloacae growth was correlated with a decline in herbicide content in the culture medium 40 of the initial 5 mm content with no glyphosate accumulating inside the cells monke et al 2010 reported that the higher growth of the isolates pseudomonas fluorescens and acetobacter sp was observed at lower concentrations 7 2 25 mg ml of glyphosate further indicated that the isolated bacteria can tolerate up to 250 mg ml of glyphosate with the subsequent decrease in growth of both isolates as the concentration of glyphosate increased moneke et al 2010 similar pattern of growth also exhibited by bacillus subtilis bs 15 in which microbial growth on glyphosate medium was inversely proportional to the concentration of glyphosate in the medium above 60 mg ml of glyphosate yu et al 2015 conversely amoros et al 2007 observed stimulation of growth of aeromonas sp following increase glyphosate concentration in the environment 3 2 effects of different concentrations of glyphosate on soil glyphosate biodegradation by test isolates results of the soil glyphosate degradation by different test isolates revealed that the significantly high p 0 05 degrading rate was shown approximately in 1 5 108 cfu ml pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp mixed culture considering all added glyphosate concentrations it was shown that pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp 1 5 108 cfu ml inoculated sterilized soil glyphosate degrading rate was increased up to 72 h and slowly decreased with time up to 120 h after two months of observation glyphosate degrading rate of all the treatments indicated very low rates glyphosate degrading rates of forest soil microbes were significantly lower than the other microbial cultures fig 3 4 some microbial groups are able to use glyphosate as a source of energy and nutrients whereas this herbicide may be toxic to some microorganisms araújo et al 2003 the findings of andriani et al 2017 revealed that the enterobacter cloacae enterobacter sp and pseudomonas fluorescens bacterial isolates potentially increase glyphosate degradation in the present study mixed bacterial isolates of with novel competences in glyphosate utilization were isolated and investigated for their glyphosate utilization capabilities these isolated microorganisms were shown a high potential in utilizing glyphosate as observed by their significant growth in the presence of glyphosate as a sole phosphorus source apart from these microorganisms there are still many potential organisms that can be used for cleaning up glyphosate contaminated environment which are yet to be exploited however the highest utilization patterns were shown by the mixed bacterial culture of pseudomonas sp and bacillus species 4 conclusion pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp mix of approximately 1 5 108 cfu ml which was isolated soil from glyphosate contaminated field is effective in growing and degrading glyphosate even at high concentrations 150 mg ml of glyphosate in the substrate however glyphosate negatively affect the population growth of native forest soil bacteria growth of the isolated microbial mix and the efficiency of their glyphosate biodegradation declines with the increasing concentrations of glyphosate in the contaminated soil as such microbial degradation was efficient in 50 mg ml of glyphosate concentration therefore the ability of withstand high concentrations and degradation of herbicide glyphosate by pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp together makes them a potential microbial culture for removing glyphosate from the contaminated soils and aquifers acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge for the financial

3 2 and fig 3 3 the highest microbial growth and activity was observed in the 50 mg ml of glyphosate which was the lowest tested glyphosate concentration however increasing glyphosate concentration results inhibition of the microbial population growth in each type of the microbes used in different treatments fig 3 1 fig 3 2 and fig 3 3 control was used as a reference and all the tested glyphosate concentrations it was shown the minimum optical density at 660 nm wavelength suggested that the residue formed in glyphosate might be the reason of turbidity the findings of the present study agreed with the results of the research done by kryuchkova et al 2014 enterobacter cloacae k7 utilize glyphosate as a source of p and enterobacter cloacae growth was correlated with a decline in herbicide content in the culture medium 40 of the initial 5 mm content with no glyphosate accumulating inside the cells monke et al 2010 reported that the higher growth of the isolates pseudomonas fluorescens and acetobacter sp was observed at lower concentrations 7 2 25 mg ml of glyphosate further indicated that the isolated bacteria can tolerate up to 250 mg ml of glyphosate with the subsequent decrease in growth of both isolates as the concentration of glyphosate increased moneke et al 2010 similar pattern of growth also exhibited by bacillus subtilis bs 15 in which microbial growth on glyphosate medium was inversely proportional to the concentration of glyphosate in the medium above 60 mg ml of glyphosate yu et al 2015 conversely amoros et al 2007 observed stimulation of growth of aeromonas sp following increase glyphosate concentration in the environment 3 2 effects of different concentrations of glyphosate on soil glyphosate biodegradation by test isolates results of the soil glyphosate degradation by different test isolates revealed that the significantly high p 0 05 degrading rate was shown approximately in 1 5 108 cfu ml pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp mixed culture considering all added glyphosate concentrations it was shown that pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp 1 5 108 cfu ml inoculated sterilized soil glyphosate degrading rate was increased up to 72 h and slowly decreased with time up to 120 h after two months of observation glyphosate degrading rate of all the treatments indicated very low rates glyphosate degrading rates of forest soil microbes were significantly lower than the other microbial cultures fig 3 4 some microbial groups are able to use glyphosate as a source of energy and nutrients whereas this herbicide may be toxic to some microorganisms araújo et al 2003 the findings of andriani et al 2017 revealed that the enterobacter cloacae enterobacter sp and pseudomonas fluorescens bacterial isolates potentially increase glyphosate degradation in the present study mixed bacterial isolates of with novel competences in glyphosate utilization were isolated and investigated for their glyphosate utilization capabilities these isolated microorganisms were shown a high potential in utilizing glyphosate as observed by their significant growth in the presence of glyphosate as a sole phosphorus source apart from these microorganisms there are still many potential organisms that can be used for cleaning up glyphosate contaminated environment which are yet to be exploited however the highest utilization patterns were shown by the mixed bacterial culture of pseudomonas sp and bacillus species 4 conclusion pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp mix of approximately 1 5 108 cfu ml which was isolated soil from glyphosate contaminated field is effective in growing and degrading glyphosate even at high concentrations 150 mg ml of glyphosate in the substrate however glyphosate negatively affect the population growth of native forest soil bacteria growth of the isolated microbial mix and the efficiency of their glyphosate biodegradation declines with the increasing concentrations of glyphosate in the contaminated soil as such microbial degradation was efficient in 50 mg ml of glyphosate concentration therefore the ability of withstand high concentrations and degradation of herbicide glyphosate by pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp together makes them a potential microbial culture for removing glyphosate from the contaminated soils and aquifers acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge for the financial

mohanty et al 2006 liu et al 2007 still the adsorption capacities of these sorbents need to be improved so as to overcome these problems it is urgent to develop a cost effective and environment friendly adsorbent with efficient sorption capacity and selectivity many researchers have tested the applicability of low cost adsorbents including agricultural waste and by products in batch and

sedlac et al 1997 in recent years nanozerovalent iron nzvi was found to be one of the most effective adsorbent for removing cr vi from water owing to its oxidizing property jia et al 2015 the advantage of nzvi over zerovalent iron zvi includes faster and higher reactivity larger reactive surface area and better application into aquifers comba et al 2011 however most synthetic nzvi methods exhibits major disadvantage i e agglomeration due to magnetic and van der waals forces finally decreasing the activity of nzvi therefore it is important to study whether the stabilization and or modification of nzvi in solid phases can lead to steady and efficient remediation ability aggregation process of nzvi was found to be significantly reduced when a supporting material such as clay minerals üzüm et al 2009 polymers kim et al 2008 nanostuctured carbons zhu et al 2009 and silica based materials is used that enhances the reduction of iron salt li et al 2006 particularly silica based materials are found to be interesting as host matrices for the loading of nzvi among the supporting materials as their nanoporous matrices may affect the sorption and catalytic properties of the hosted nanoparticles ponder et al 2000 found that zerovalent iron supported in polymeric resin exhibited faster removal as compared to unsupported iron and commercial iron material therefore it was assumed that the nanoparticles supported in a solid matrix may enhance the efficiency of iron nanoparticles at minimum dose and make the separation from effluent easier since corn cob is readily available renewable and biodegradable waste material the ccs was used for developing mccs thus owing to its cost effectiveness easy applicability and potential to overcome separation problem mccs can be advantageous over general iron based adsorbent and synthetic materials such as polymers keeping in mind these aspects the present study has been designed with the following objectives i synthesis

fecl3 6h2o 2mol l 0 25mol l hcl and 10ml na2so3 1mol l were mixed with 25 4ml nh4oh solution at room temperature reaction was conducted by bubbling up the protecting n2 gas for blowing air clearly in a 1l of 3 necked round bottom flask afterward synthesized nanoparticulate magnetite was collected by magnet the surfaces of nanoparticulate magnetite were coated with ccs according to stöber al 1968 and deng et al 2005 with a small modification in the present case ethyl alcohol was added to 0 04g of magnetite powder and was diffused by homogenizing in an ultrasonic water bath device under such condition 1ml of silica solution extracted from water aqueous ammonia and corncob ash was stirred for 20min after diffusion thus obtained substance was placed at dry atmosphere for 24h 2 3 analytical

investigated by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet avatar 360 scanning was done in the range of 4000 400cm 1 the morphology and size of nanoparticle was determined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem carl zeiss inc jena germany the surface morphologies and sizes of the as prepared samples were further characterized by a hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope tem 2 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption of cr vi using mccs was investigated in the batch scale stock solution 1000mgl 1 was diluted with distilled water to obtain the cr vi solution of desired concentration range 10 30 50 and 100mgl 1 a volume of the 100ml cr vi solution of different concentration was taken in a 250ml erlenmeyer flasks and ph was adjusted to 4 0 the adsorbent dosage equivalent to 0 1g was added in to each erlenmeyer flasks a volume of 100ml cr vi solution of different concentration was taken in a 250ml erlenmeyer flasks adjusted to ph 4 0 without adsorbent was taken as control then the flasks were placed in a rotary shaker and shaken for 6h by maintaining the agitation speed at 180rpm samples were collected at pre determined time intervals 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 60 and 120min and centrifuged at 10 000rpm for 10min and the supernatants were collected the cr vi concentration of supernatant was analyzed using uv visible spectrophotometer at 540nm agilent 8453 spectrophotometer agilent technologies germany by diphenyl carbazide method epa method 7196a the ph and temperature of the aqueous solution is important parameter controlling the adsorption process the effect of different initial ph 4 6 and 8 and temperature 15 25 and 35 c on the rate of adsorption process were observed the ph of the solution was adjusted using 0 1m naoh and 0 1m hcl to determine the effects on cr vi removal of ph variation ph values of solution and all the ph measurements were carried out using an seven easy ph meter 8603 mettler toledo switzerland 2 5 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic studies were carried out to determine the dynamic of cr vi adsorption by mccs the adsorption of cr vi using mccs was characterized by conducting kinetic study at ph 4 and temperature 25 c the adsorption kinetics of cr vi were performed by fitting pseudo first order 1 and second order 2 models by the following equations 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where q t mgg 1 is the amount of cr vi adsorbed on mccs at time min q e mgg 1 is the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium t min is the time k 1 1min 1 is the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant and k 2 1min 1 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant 2 6 desorption of hexavalent chromium in order to evaluate the desorption rate of cr vi from mccs using extract solutions a sequential extraction procedure was applied to the cr vi loaded mccs composite to determine cr vi availability following the general procedure reported elsewhere basta et al 2001 castaldi et al 2008 to extract readily available cr vi from ccs nzvi composite 1g containing 1 0mg cr vi was agitated with 25ml of nano pure water ph 6 8 conductivity 18 µω m toc 3 ppb barnstead waltham ma usa for 2h at room temperature the composite was then sequentially extracted with 25ml of 0 1m ca no3 2 ph 7 8 to remove exchangeable cr vi followed by 25ml of 0 01m edta ph 8 0 to remove the more tightly bound cr vi or chromium hydroxide complexes precipitated on active sites that were not readily bioavailable basta et al 2001 castaldi et al 2008 after the extractions the composite was dried over night at 105 c and digested with 0 1m hno3 to remove other non exchangeable cr vi after each extraction the composites were centrifuged 6000rpm for 10min and filtered to separate the solution and solid phases castaldi et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 product characterization the successful synthesis of mccs sio2 coated fe was confirmed by the surface morphology and size of the nzvi ccs particles fig 1a analyzed through fe sem the microscopic image indicated the globular shape of the nanocomposite with a maximum size of 0 27µm which were randomly distributed and immobilized on the nzvi surface as shown in fig 1b sem eds result shows the presence of fe and si elements the surface morphology of mccs was further analyzed using tem analysis fig 1c and the diameter of mccs was found uniform and consistent with the sem image the powder xrd analysis of the samples was carried out to determine structural properties of ccs nzvi and mccs fig 2 the xrd spectra showed broad peaks at the 2θ values of around 20 45 the broad peak at 30 fig 2 a is attributed to the amorphous silica which was in accordance with a previous report quang et al 2011 the diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 34 and 44 6 corresponding to 311 511 fig 2b and c implied that sio2 successfully coated on the surface of nzvi it is reported that coating of si on the surface of fe can protect internal fe specimen effectively from oxidation when it is exposed to the air and thus can contribute to its efficiency tang et al 2014 ftir spectrum is useful for studies of chemical structures and functional groups on the surface of specimens thus ftir measurements were carried out to identify possible interactions between nzvi nanoparticles and ccs fig 3 showed ftir spectra of nzvi nanocrystals before and after silica coating spectra of specimens prepared for bare and nzvi loaded ccs was compared fig 3b and c the main bands in ir spectrum of silica could be seen as follows the strong band centered at 1105cm 1was attributed to asymmetric stretching frequency of si o si the band centered at 799cm 1was due to symmetric stretching of si o si jiemvarangkul et al 2011 those two bands 578 and 472cm 1 is the characteristics of fe2o3fe bond vibration sugimoto et al 1998 it could be observed in fig 3b si o si stretching vibration after silica coating the broad band appeared relatively at the center of 1105cm 1 phalippou et al 1982 3 2 adsorption studies as shown in fig 4a cr vi adsorption by mccs composite was higher than ccs if used in equal proportion i e 0 1g similar removal trends have been observed using bentonite nzvi based ccs lv et al 2012 however in the present study the surface of nzvi coated with ccs was found to have the advantage in adjusting the size homogeneity of mccs and thus enhanced cr vi removal efficiency influence of different initial cr vi concentration on the adsorption of cr vi by mccs was investigated fig 4b it was found that the cr vi removal efficiency reached 97 4 53 5 39 5 and 24 6 within 180min for initial cr vi concentration at 11 39 33 77 56 51 and 114 71mgl 1 respectively such result imply that adsorption of cr vi onto mccs is highly dependent on initial cr vi concentration it may be attributed to the fact that for a fixed adsorbate dose the total available adsorption sites remain limited leading to a decrease in percentage removal of adsorbate with its gradual increase in the concentration the biocomposite mccs exhibited better adsorption capacity 11 1mgg 1 as compared to other iron based adsornents ajouyed et al 2010 chowdhury and yanful 2010 fig 5a showed the influence of initial ph on the removal of cr vi it was confirmed that percentage of cr vi removal decreases with increase in initial ph from 4 to 8 on the other hand the effect of temperature on cr vi removal using mccs complex was found to be relatively less but positive i e 44 9 removal at 15 c and 51 4 removal at 35 c fig 5b these results suggested that the cr vi adsorption increases slightly with the increase in temperature therefore it may be summarized that temperature and initial ph are important factors that affect the adsorption the maximum removal was observed at acidic ph ph 4 and it gradually decreased with increasing ph fig 5a the mechanism of high cr vi adsorption at low ph can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent surface and the adsorbate species at low ph the predominant cr vi species are cro4 2 cr2o7 2 and hcro4 singh et al 2014 at acidic ph the adsorbent surface turns protonated and attracts anionic cr vi species as ph increased above the phzpc of the adsorbent there is gradual reduction in electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent surface and cr vi species with subsequent decrease in percent removal 3 3 kinetic studies to investigate the mechanisms controlling the adsorption processes such as chemical reaction or mass transfer kinetic models are useful to get insight into the rate and type of adsorption in aqueous phase sorption process the kinetic study is generally performed to identify the sorption kinetics between the adsorbate and adsorbent and to determine the time required to attain maximum adsorption to determine the adsorption kinetics of mccs composite for cr vi adsorption the sorption data were plotted in fig 6 the calculated model parameters for adsorption of cr vi on mccs were shown in table 1 the calculated q e values 8 16mgg 1 using pseudo first order kinetics equation showed 18 4 deviation from the experimental q e values table 1 it was observed that the calculated q e values 10 13mgg 1 using pseudo second order kinetics equation is better than the pseudo first order kinetics compared to the experimental q e values 1 3 deviation for second order kinetics and 18 4 deviation for first order kinetics parameters fig 6 and table 1 indicated a highly significant regression and the data were well fitted to the pseudo second order rate equation the adsorption kinetic results suggest that coefficient determination values of pseudo second order model of cr vi adsorption by mccs was more fitted than that of pseudo first order model indicating the cr vi adsorption mechanism to be a type of chemisorption or ion exchange xiao et al 2010 thus in the present study the pseudo second order model assumes that the chemical sorption between the adsorbent and adsorbate is the rate limiting step 3 4 desorption studies to evaluate the desorption of cr vi from adsorbate cr vi loaded mccs compounds were mixed in the different extracting solutions sequentially i e starting with h2o 0 1mca no3 2 0 1m hno3 and finally with 0 01m edta removal percentage were then sequentially measured to observe the effectiveness of cr vi association with the nzvi mccs compounds result has been summarized and presented in table 2 it was found that among the extracted cr vi the water soluble part was less than 1 3 it may be attributed to the fact that the exchangeable part possible to decant as ca no3 2 and can have interchangeable forms of cr vi the overall extracted density was 4 7 of the initial cr vi removed by mcss compounds the amount of cr vi extracted from water was less as compared to the amount that was extracted from ca no3 2 these results showed cr vi removed by mccs compounds have low tendency to be desorbed into the environment this reaffirm the fact that adsorption of cr vi onto the external surface of the complex is electrostatic in nature gupta et al 2011 on the other hand 0 01m edta extracted portion of cr vi is very less likely to be re released into the environment and thus will be the least significant from the health point of view basta et al 2001 bordoloi et al 2017 goswami et al 2016 gupta et al 2011 and showed 13 7 of absorbed cr vi it is expected that the remaining elements won t be eluted in the state of nature and showed 14 8 containing compounds many parts extracted by edta are composed of a little stronger combination nowack and sigg 1996 and cause m hydroxide compounds at active sites in mccs structure edta has been known to have a high efficiency in the extraction of heavy metals from the mccs and cr edta compounds have a high stability at ph 8 manning et al 2007 edta extraction was done at ph 8 at which a large part of cr vi gets removed by mccs probably due to the interior of the substrate complex because of this structural specificity of mccs it is isolated from cr vi and assumed to be reduced slowly to cr most of the adsorbed metals are essentially insoluble and thus not exchangeable most of the cr vi remained in residual fraction solution 69 2 which indicate that residual fraction are tightly bound and would not be expected to be released under natural condition from mccs these results suggest that mccs has a high level of safety during adsorption 4 conclusions in this study mccs nanocomposite was successfully synthesized from ccs and nzvi characterized and tested for cr vi removal results show that surface conjugated mccs nanoparticles are excellent adsorbents for fast removal of cr vi from aqueous solutions the conjugation with the silica matrices prevented aggregation of the nzvi and thus increasing the surface area allowing efficient sorption of the cr vi species to the nzvi surface the adsorption data showed that the goodness of fit is better in the pseudo second order kinetics as compared to the pseudo first order kinetics model since corncob silica is a cost effective material ccs nzvi composite could be an efficient and promising remediation material to remove cr vi moreover owing to its magnetic property this material has the potential to overcome the separation problems related with adsorption based treatment techniques with its advantages of environment friendly high efficiency and high capacity thus mccs can also be applied for removal of other toxic elements from wastewater further studies to certify the efficiency of mccs with respect to the removal of cr vi in a larger scale may be of worth in developing efficient remediation strategies for metal contaminated areas acknowledgment the preparation of this manuscript was

minerals üzüm et al 2009 polymers kim et al 2008 nanostuctured carbons zhu et al 2009 and silica based materials is used that enhances the reduction of iron salt li et al 2006 particularly silica based materials are found to be interesting as host matrices for the loading of nzvi among the supporting materials as their nanoporous matrices may affect the sorption and catalytic properties of the hosted nanoparticles ponder et al 2000 found that zerovalent iron supported in polymeric resin exhibited faster removal as compared to unsupported iron and commercial iron material therefore it was assumed that the nanoparticles supported in a solid matrix may enhance the efficiency of iron nanoparticles at minimum dose and make the separation from effluent easier since corn cob is readily available renewable and biodegradable waste material the ccs was used for developing mccs thus owing to its cost effectiveness easy applicability and potential to overcome separation problem mccs can be advantageous over general iron based adsorbent and synthetic materials such as polymers keeping in mind these aspects the present study has been designed with the following objectives i synthesis of corn cob silica supported nanoscale zero valent iron magnetite corn cob silica mccs by a facile technique followed by the efficacy evaluation of synthesized mccs for the removal of cr vi ions from aqueous solution ii to understand the removal mechanism through various characterization techniques like x ray diffraction pattern surface area pore volume functional group and size iii to study the sorption kinetics 2 experimental 2 1 materials corn cob silica ccs nanoparticles were prepared by sol gel process from corn cob ash shim et al 2014 ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o anhydrous

provided by daejung chemical reagent factory all used reagents were of analytical grade and thus used without any additional purifying process in all tests ultrapure water millipore was used 2 2 synthesis of magnetic corn cob silica spherical nanoparticulate magnetite synthesis was carried out according to zhou et al 1993 and qu et al 1999 with some modification in the present study 15ml of fecl3 6h2o 2mol l 0 25mol l hcl and 10ml na2so3 1mol l were mixed with 25 4ml nh4oh solution at room temperature reaction was conducted by bubbling up the protecting n2 gas for blowing air clearly in a 1l of 3 necked round bottom flask afterward synthesized nanoparticulate magnetite was collected by magnet the surfaces of nanoparticulate magnetite were coated with ccs according to stöber al 1968 and deng et al 2005 with a small modification in the present case ethyl alcohol was added to 0 04g of magnetite powder and was diffused by homogenizing in an ultrasonic water bath device under such condition 1ml of silica solution extracted from water aqueous ammonia and corncob ash was stirred for 20min after diffusion thus obtained substance was placed at dry atmosphere for 24h 2 3 analytical methods structural properties and diffraction patterns of nanoparticle were studied by x ray diffractometer xrd pananalytical inc almelo netherlands using cu kα radiation wavelength λ 1 514178 in the 2θ range 30 70 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of nanoparticle were determined using belsorp mini bel japan inc osaka japan the functional groups on the surface of nanoparticle were investigated by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet avatar 360 scanning was done in the range of 4000 400cm 1 the morphology and size of nanoparticle was determined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem carl zeiss inc jena germany the surface morphologies and sizes of the as prepared samples were further characterized by a hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope tem 2 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption of cr vi using mccs was investigated in the batch scale stock solution 1000mgl 1 was diluted with distilled water to obtain the cr vi solution of desired concentration range 10 30 50 and 100mgl 1 a volume of the 100ml cr vi solution of different concentration was taken in a 250ml erlenmeyer flasks and ph was adjusted to 4 0 the adsorbent dosage equivalent to 0 1g was added in to each erlenmeyer flasks a volume of 100ml cr vi solution of different concentration was taken in a 250ml erlenmeyer flasks adjusted to ph 4 0 without adsorbent was taken as control then the flasks were placed in a rotary shaker and shaken for 6h by maintaining the agitation speed at 180rpm samples were collected at pre determined time intervals 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 60 and 120min and centrifuged at 10 000rpm for 10min and the supernatants were collected the cr vi concentration of supernatant was analyzed using uv visible spectrophotometer at 540nm agilent 8453 spectrophotometer agilent technologies germany by diphenyl carbazide method epa method 7196a the ph and temperature of the aqueous solution is important parameter controlling the adsorption process the effect of different initial ph 4 6 and 8 and temperature 15 25 and 35 c on the rate of adsorption process were observed the ph of the solution was adjusted using 0 1m naoh and 0 1m hcl to determine the effects on cr vi removal of ph variation ph values of solution and all the ph measurements were carried out using an seven easy ph meter 8603 mettler toledo switzerland 2 5 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic studies were carried out to determine the dynamic of cr vi adsorption by mccs the adsorption of cr vi using mccs was characterized by conducting kinetic study at ph 4 and temperature 25 c the adsorption kinetics of cr vi were performed by fitting pseudo first order 1 and second order 2 models by the following equations 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where q t mgg 1 is the amount of cr vi adsorbed on mccs at time min q e mgg 1 is the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium t min is the time k 1 1min 1 is the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant and k 2 1min 1 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant 2 6 desorption of hexavalent chromium in order to evaluate the desorption rate of cr vi from mccs using extract solutions a sequential extraction procedure was applied to the cr vi loaded mccs composite to determine cr vi availability following the general procedure reported elsewhere basta et al 2001 castaldi et al 2008 to extract readily available cr vi from ccs nzvi composite 1g containing 1 0mg cr vi was agitated with 25ml of nano pure water ph 6 8 conductivity 18 µω m toc 3 ppb barnstead waltham ma usa for 2h at room temperature the composite was then sequentially extracted with 25ml of 0 1m ca no3 2 ph 7 8 to remove exchangeable cr vi followed by 25ml of 0 01m edta ph 8 0 to remove the more tightly bound cr vi or chromium hydroxide complexes precipitated on active sites that were not readily bioavailable basta et al 2001 castaldi et al 2008 after the extractions the composite was dried over night at 105 c and digested with 0 1m hno3 to remove other non exchangeable cr vi after each extraction the composites were centrifuged 6000rpm for 10min and filtered to separate the solution and solid phases castaldi et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 product characterization the successful synthesis of mccs sio2 coated fe was confirmed by the surface morphology and size of the nzvi ccs particles fig 1a analyzed through fe sem the microscopic image indicated the globular shape of the nanocomposite with a maximum size of 0 27µm which were randomly distributed and immobilized on the nzvi surface as shown in fig 1b sem eds result shows the presence of fe and si elements the surface morphology of mccs was further analyzed using tem analysis fig 1c and the diameter of mccs was found uniform and consistent with the sem image the powder xrd analysis of the samples was carried out to determine structural properties of ccs nzvi and mccs fig 2 the xrd spectra showed broad peaks at the 2θ values of around 20 45 the broad peak at 30 fig 2 a is attributed to the amorphous silica which was in accordance with a previous report quang et al 2011 the diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 34 and 44 6 corresponding to 311 511 fig 2b and c implied that sio2 successfully coated on the surface of nzvi it is reported that coating of si on the surface of fe can protect internal fe specimen effectively from oxidation when it is exposed to the air and thus can contribute to its efficiency tang et al 2014 ftir spectrum is useful for studies of chemical structures and functional groups on the surface of specimens thus ftir measurements were carried out to identify possible interactions between nzvi nanoparticles and ccs fig 3 showed ftir spectra of nzvi nanocrystals before and after silica coating spectra of specimens prepared for bare and nzvi loaded ccs was compared fig 3b and c the main bands in ir spectrum of silica could be seen as follows the strong band centered at 1105cm 1was attributed to asymmetric stretching frequency of si o si the band centered at 799cm 1was due to symmetric stretching of si o si jiemvarangkul et al 2011 those two bands 578 and 472cm 1 is the characteristics of fe2o3fe bond vibration sugimoto et al 1998 it could be observed in fig 3b si o si stretching vibration after silica coating the broad band appeared relatively at the center of 1105cm 1 phalippou et al 1982 3 2 adsorption studies as shown in fig 4a cr vi adsorption by mccs composite was higher than ccs if used in equal proportion i e 0 1g similar removal trends have been observed using bentonite nzvi based ccs lv et al 2012 however in the present study the surface of nzvi coated with ccs was found to have the advantage in adjusting the size homogeneity of mccs and thus enhanced cr vi removal efficiency influence of different initial cr vi concentration on the adsorption of cr vi by mccs was investigated fig 4b it was found that the cr vi removal efficiency reached 97 4 53 5 39 5 and 24 6 within 180min for initial cr vi concentration at 11 39 33 77 56 51 and 114 71mgl 1 respectively such result imply that adsorption of cr vi onto mccs is highly dependent on initial cr vi concentration it may be attributed to the fact that for a fixed adsorbate dose the total available adsorption sites remain limited leading to a decrease in percentage removal of adsorbate with its gradual increase in the concentration the biocomposite mccs exhibited better adsorption capacity 11 1mgg 1 as compared to other iron based adsornents ajouyed et al 2010 chowdhury and yanful 2010 fig 5a showed the influence of initial ph on the removal of cr vi it was confirmed that percentage of cr vi removal decreases with increase in initial ph from 4 to 8 on the other hand the effect of temperature on cr vi removal using mccs complex was found to be relatively less but positive i e 44 9 removal at 15 c and 51 4 removal at 35 c fig 5b these results suggested that the cr vi adsorption increases slightly with the increase in temperature therefore it may be summarized that temperature and initial ph are important factors that affect the adsorption the maximum removal was observed at acidic ph ph 4 and it gradually decreased with increasing ph fig 5a the mechanism of high cr vi adsorption at low ph can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent surface and the adsorbate species at low ph the predominant cr vi species are cro4 2 cr2o7 2 and hcro4 singh et al 2014 at acidic ph the adsorbent surface turns protonated and attracts anionic cr vi species as ph increased above the phzpc of the adsorbent there is gradual reduction in electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent surface and cr vi species with subsequent decrease in percent removal 3 3 kinetic studies to investigate the mechanisms controlling the adsorption processes such as chemical reaction or mass transfer kinetic models are useful to get insight into the rate and type of adsorption in aqueous phase sorption process the kinetic study is generally performed to identify the sorption kinetics between the adsorbate and adsorbent and to determine the time required to attain maximum adsorption to determine the adsorption kinetics of mccs composite for cr vi adsorption the sorption data were plotted in fig 6 the calculated model parameters for adsorption of cr vi on mccs were shown in table 1 the calculated q e values 8 16mgg 1 using pseudo first order kinetics equation showed 18 4 deviation from the experimental q e values table 1 it was observed that the calculated q e values 10 13mgg 1 using pseudo second order kinetics equation is better than the pseudo first order kinetics compared to the experimental q e values 1 3 deviation for second order kinetics and 18 4 deviation for first order kinetics parameters fig 6 and table 1 indicated a highly significant regression and the data were well fitted to the pseudo second order rate equation the adsorption kinetic results suggest that coefficient determination values of pseudo second order model of cr vi adsorption by mccs was more fitted than that of pseudo first order model indicating the cr vi adsorption mechanism to be a type of chemisorption or ion exchange xiao et al 2010 thus in the present study the pseudo second order model assumes that the chemical sorption between the adsorbent and adsorbate is the rate limiting step 3 4 desorption studies to evaluate the desorption of cr vi from adsorbate cr vi loaded mccs compounds were mixed in the different extracting solutions sequentially i e starting with h2o 0 1mca no3 2 0 1m hno3 and finally with 0 01m edta removal percentage were then sequentially measured to observe the effectiveness of cr vi association with the nzvi mccs compounds result has been summarized and presented in table 2 it was found that among the extracted cr vi the water soluble part was less than 1 3 it may be attributed to the fact that the exchangeable part possible to decant as ca no3 2 and can have interchangeable forms of cr vi the overall extracted density was 4 7 of the initial cr vi removed by mcss compounds the amount of cr vi extracted from water was less as compared to the amount that was extracted from ca no3 2 these results showed cr vi removed by mccs compounds have low tendency to be desorbed into the environment this reaffirm the fact that adsorption of cr vi onto the external surface of the complex is electrostatic in nature gupta et al 2011 on the other hand 0 01m edta extracted portion of cr vi is very less likely to be re released into the environment and thus will be the least significant from the health point of view basta et al 2001 bordoloi et al 2017 goswami et al 2016 gupta et al 2011 and showed 13 7 of absorbed cr vi it is expected that the remaining elements won t be eluted in the state of nature and showed 14 8 containing compounds many parts extracted by edta are composed of a little stronger combination nowack and sigg 1996 and cause m hydroxide compounds at active sites in mccs structure edta has been known to have a high efficiency in the extraction of heavy metals from the mccs and cr edta compounds have a high stability at ph 8 manning et al 2007 edta extraction was done at ph 8 at which a large part of cr vi gets removed by mccs probably due to the interior of the substrate complex because of this structural specificity of mccs it is isolated from cr vi and assumed to be reduced slowly to cr most of the adsorbed metals are essentially insoluble and thus not exchangeable most of the cr vi remained in residual fraction solution 69 2 which indicate that residual fraction are tightly bound and would not be expected to be released under natural condition from mccs these results suggest that mccs has a high level of safety during adsorption 4 conclusions in this study mccs nanocomposite was successfully synthesized from ccs and nzvi characterized and tested for cr vi removal results show that surface conjugated mccs nanoparticles are excellent adsorbents for fast removal of cr vi from aqueous solutions the conjugation with the silica matrices prevented aggregation of the nzvi and thus increasing the surface area allowing efficient sorption of the cr vi species to the nzvi surface the adsorption data showed that the goodness of fit is better in the pseudo second order kinetics as compared to the pseudo first order kinetics model since corncob silica is a cost effective material ccs nzvi composite could be an efficient and promising remediation material to remove cr vi moreover owing to its magnetic property this material has the potential to overcome the separation problems related with adsorption based treatment techniques with its advantages of environment friendly high efficiency and high capacity thus mccs can also be applied for removal of other toxic elements from wastewater further studies to certify the efficiency of mccs with respect to the removal of cr vi in a larger scale may be of worth in developing efficient remediation strategies for metal contaminated areas acknowledgment the preparation of this manuscript was

and effective methods are needed to remove those contaminants from soil and water arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf are specific rhizospheric microorganisms that have beneficial effects on plant growth arbuscular mycorrhizae share a mutualistic symbiosis with the roots of eichhornia crassipes mart solms water hyacinth which is capable of absorbing cadmium cd from contaminated water making it an effective phytoremediating aquatic plant the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of amf on the phytoremediation potential of water hyacinth in cadmium uptake and to examine the growth of water hyacinth plants in different cadmium concentrations a pot experiment was carried out using water hyacinth inoculated with and without amf with the addition of different cd levels 0 5 10 20 50 ppm for a period of 52 days water soil root and shoot were analyzed for cd using an atomic absorption spectrophotometry the highest amf colonization 74 98 cd concentration in shoot 0 22 ppm and root 0

were shown the reduced cd concentration in both soil and water for each cd addition a positive correlation was observed amf colonization and relative growth rates of plants and amf colonization and cd concentrations of plant roots and shoots the research findings have proved that amf was capable to augment the phytoremediation potential of eichhornia crassipes from cadmium contaminated soil water

the effect of amf on phytoremediation potential of plants the results are controversial in different studies therefore this study aimed to assess the effect of amf on the phytoremediation potential of water hyacinth plants on cadmium uptake and also to examine the growth of water hyacinth plants with different cadmium concentrations in soil water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 trap culture establishment preparation of the native arbuscular mycorrhizae inoculum in order to prepare the inoculums with sufficient indigenous amf population trap cultures were established according to chaurasia et al 2005 the upper layer of the healthy soil 0 10 cm depth holds most of the fine root fragments with native arbuscular mycorrhizae composite soil samples with fine root fragments were collected from the upper layer 0 10 cm of the undisturbed wetland in dryzone environment were used as indigenous amf inoculum such soil with root fragments was thoroughly homogenized with autoclaved sand grain size 0 7 1 2 mm in a ratio of 1 4 v v and added into 1000 ml plastic pots for trap culture establishment the procedure described by walker and vestberg 1994 was followed before sowing seeds of maize zea mays l were surface disinfected by immersing them in a 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution for 15 min these seeds were washed with distilled water and they were sown at 2 cm depth in each pot and covered with autoclaved sand approximately 50 60 seeds of maize were sown per pot and were kept in the greenhouse for two months pots were watered daily as needed and no fertilizer was added as such trap cultures were established two times during the period of treatment application to produce amf inoculum colonized maize root fragments mycelium and a sand soil mixture containing spores were used as an arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum 2 2 collection of soil and water hyacinth plants a composite wet soil sample was collected from a depth of about 0 15 cm along the banks of mihintale tank soil was air dried and then it was sieved using 2 mm sieve prior to potting water hyacinth plants of uniform length and weight were collected from the mihintale tank collected plants were washed first with tap water then 1 v v sodium hypochlorite solution and finally with deionized water 2 3 pot experiment pot experiment was conducted at the greenhouse at rajarata university of sri lanka mihintale sri lanka there were five cd levels 0 5 10 20 50 ppm with the amf inoculums and without the amf inoculums in a randomized design with four replicates per treatment for a total of 40 experimental pots the growth medium in the pots consisted of 1 25 kg of wet soil for non mycorrhizal treatments and 1 kg wet soil and 250 g of mycorrhizal inoculum for mycorrhizae inoculated treatments the wet soil without the mycorrhizal inoculum was treated as control cadmium supplied as cdcl2 2 5h2o solution and the pots were filled with 5 6 l constant volume of tank water young water hyacinth plant was then grown in the pot for 60 days 2 4 analytical methods the sampling from aqueous solution amended with different cadmium concentrations had been carried out at an interval of 1st 3rd 14th and 52th days ten milliliters of aliquots were withdrawn from each experimental pot in above time periods for the analysis of cadmium concentration shoots and roots were separated at harvest some of the roots were kept for determination of percentage mycorrhizal colonization roots and shoots were washed with de ionized water twice and rinsed with distilled water dried at 60 c approximately for 72 h weighed and ground for chemical analysis dry weights of roots and shoots relative growth rate of plants cd concentrations in soil roots and shoots of the plants were determined also percentage amf colonization in plant roots was determined after staining with trypan blue adopting the procedure described by phillips and hayman 1970 and following the modified grid transect method of amf quantification mcgonigle et al 1990 samples of soil dried root and shoots were digested with 15 ml of concentrated hno3 and 5 ml of 70 hclo4 acid acid digestion was carried out on digester at 60 200 c until yellow fumes of hno3 and white fumes of hclo4 were evolved zasoski and burau 1977 the digestion process was continued until a clear solution remains after volatilization of acids the digestion was stopped when the residue in the flask was clear and white the digested sample was dissolved in distilled water filtered for the removal of impurities and made up to 50 ml the samples were analyzed for cd by atomic absorption spectrophotometry shimadzu aa 6701g 2 5 data analysis tukey s method and 95 0 confidence was used to test for differences among treatment means at a significance level of p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using minitab software package version 16 2 1 pearson s correlation co efficient was used to test for correlations among treatment means at a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 percentage arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization in roots of eichhornia crassipes the results of the present study revealed that amf inoculated plants were shown significantly high p 0 05 percentage of amf colonization than non amf inoculated plants fig 3 1 further amf colonization of amf inoculated plants with different added cd concentrations such as 0 ppm 74 98 5 ppm 72 29 and 10 ppm 70 55 were significantly different from the higher levels of cd addition treatments 20 ppm and 50 ppm at the 0 05 probability level anova percentage mycorrhizal colonization of inoculated roots was ranged between 60 and 75 the non amf inoculated plants were shown lower colonization at each cd level was non significant at the 0 05 probability level percentage mycorrhizal colonization was depending on the success of inoculation and amf persistence in soil including amf species compatibility with the target environment azcon et al 2009 if those conditions are met amf inoculation shown high colonization rates with abundantly formed arbuscules and hyphal structures previous studies have also indicated that the cd addition in the soil water environment not inhibited the formation of external hyphae and mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots in a certain cd level chen et al 2004 bhaduri and fulekar 2012 according to chen et al 2004 funneliformis mosseae colonized in zea mays roots was not affected with the soil cd contaminations of 0 100 μg g 1 soil however higher cd additions 50 ppm in the present study significantly reduced root mycorrhizal colonization fig 3 1 in accord with the findings of kanwal et al 2015 3 2 cadmium analysis in water statistical analyses revealed that the 1st day after cd addition to the water 50 ppm added cd shown significantly higher p 0 05 concentrations fig 3 2 further it was shown that even the water cd analysis of 7th and 14th days after cd amendment the treatments with 50 ppm cd added water had higher cd concentrations figs 3 3 and 3 4 however it was evidenced that with the increase time of exposure to water hyacinth the water cd concentrations were decreased irrespective of the level of cd amendment and amf inoculation figs 3 2 3 4 some other studies also reported that the metal concentrations in the residual solution decrease with the increasing plant exposure time maine et al 2001 water hyacinth effectively removes appreciable quantity of heavy metals cd co cr cu mn ni pb and zn from fresh water especially at low concentrations lu et al 2004 soltan and rashed 2003 swain et al 2014 it was also noticed that this depletion of cd in water was higher in amf inoculated treatments than non inoculated comparing same level of cd amendment 3 3 cadmium analysis in water hyacinth roots and shoots results of the present study revealed that the concentrations of cadmium present in roots and shoots of eichhornia crassipes of both amf inoculated and non inoculated plant roots at 20 ppm and 50 ppm cd additions were significantly higher p 0 05 than the other cd amendment levels fig 3 5 cadmium concentrations were significantly higher in roots of higher levels of cadmium additions with amf suggested that water hyacinth being a hyperaccumulator of cadmium muramoto and oki 1983 and more effective with amf it was revealed that the roots of water hyacinth accumulated the higher concentrations of cd compared to shoots in all cd amended levels in both amf inoculated and non inoculated treatments fig 3 5 however this difference was significantly different p 0 05 in amf inoculated water hyacinth in low cd amended levels 5 ppm and 10 ppm some studies reported that amf could immobilize heavy metals in the roots and the mycorhizosphere of the plant and inhibit their translocation to the shoots joner and leyval 1997 bissonnette et al 2010 chen et al 2004 garg and chandel 2012 liu et al 2015 this reduced shoot cd concentration compared to roots in amf inoculated water hyacinth may be amf hyphae can compartmentalized cd in roots by adsorbing and binding cd meharg and cairney 2000 meier et al 2012 according to nielsen and jensen 1983 may be dilution effects which explained an increased plant biomass and decreased cd allocation to shoots 3 4 cadmium analysis in soil the present study revealed that significantly higher p 0 05 soil cd accumulation was shown at 50 ppm cd amendment of soil and water fig 3 6 in each level of cd addition amf inoculation enhanced cd absorption by eichhornia crassipes roots resulted reduced cd levels in soil fig 3 6 3 5 relative growth rate statistical analysis revealed that relative growth rate was significantly higher p 0 05 in zero and 5 ppm cadmium additions compared to the higher addition levels fig 3 7 in higher cd additions 20 ppm and 50 ppm it was shown that relative growth rate of eichhornia crassipes was significantly higher in amf inoculated plants than non amf inoculated plants fig 3 7 xiaomei et al 2004 reported that relative growth of water hyacinth increased with lower concentrations of cd 0 5 and 1 0 mg l but decreased with higher cd concentrations 2 0 and 4 0 mg l however at higher

water hyacinth in high cd concentrations dykema et al 1999 3 7 correlation analysis amf stimulate plant growth through a range of mechanisms such as improved nutrition uptake water uptake tolerance to toxic metals etc aggarwal et al 2011 so there was a positive correlation between amf colonization percentage and relative growth rate of plants also percentage amf colonization was proportional to the cd concentration in roots and shoots of the eichhornia crassipes therefore it was evident that a negative correlation observed between percentage amf colonization and soil cadmium concentration table 3 1 4 conclusions eichhornia crassipes has potential to tolerate the cadmium concentrations in soil water environment under applied experimental conditions absorbing and accumulating cadmium in shoots

12333,contamination of water with heavy metals is a rising concern for human health and the environment removal of heavy metal contaminants in soil water environment is challenging therefore feasible and effective methods are needed to remove those contaminants from soil and water arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf are specific rhizospheric microorganisms that have beneficial effects on plant growth arbuscular mycorrhizae share a mutualistic symbiosis with the roots of eichhornia crassipes mart solms water hyacinth which is capable of absorbing cadmium cd from contaminated water making it an effective phytoremediating aquatic plant the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of amf on the phytoremediation potential of water hyacinth in cadmium uptake and to examine the growth of water hyacinth plants in different cadmium concentrations a pot experiment was carried out using water hyacinth inoculated with and without amf with the addition of different cd levels 0 5 10 20 50 ppm for a period of 52 days water soil root and shoot were analyzed for cd using an atomic absorption spectrophotometry the highest amf colonization 74 98 cd concentration in shoot 0 22 ppm and root 0

of plant roots can reduce translocation of heavy metals to shoots by binding the heavy metals to the cell walls of the fungal hyphae in roots hu et al 2013 the cell wall of fungi contains free amino acids hydroxyl carboxyl and other groups that represent binding sites for the adsorption of certain trace elements meier et al 2012 therefore they can act as a filtration barrier against the transfer

water hyacinth plants on cadmium uptake and also to examine the growth of water hyacinth plants with different cadmium concentrations in soil water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 trap culture establishment preparation of the native arbuscular mycorrhizae inoculum in order to prepare the inoculums with sufficient indigenous amf population trap cultures were established according to chaurasia et al 2005 the upper layer of the healthy soil 0 10 cm depth holds most of the fine root fragments with native arbuscular mycorrhizae composite soil samples with fine root fragments were collected from the upper layer 0 10 cm of the undisturbed wetland in dryzone environment were used as indigenous amf inoculum such soil with root fragments was thoroughly homogenized with autoclaved sand grain size 0 7 1 2 mm in a ratio of 1 4 v v and added into 1000 ml plastic pots for trap culture establishment the procedure described by walker and vestberg 1994 was followed before sowing seeds of maize zea mays l were surface disinfected by immersing them in a 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution for 15 min these seeds were washed with distilled water and they were sown at 2 cm depth in each pot and covered with autoclaved sand approximately 50 60 seeds of maize were sown per pot and were kept in the greenhouse for two months pots were watered daily as needed and no fertilizer was added as such trap cultures were established two times during the period of treatment application to produce amf inoculum colonized maize root fragments mycelium and a sand soil mixture containing spores were used as an arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum 2 2 collection of soil and water hyacinth plants a composite wet soil sample was collected from a depth of about 0 15 cm along the banks of mihintale tank soil was air dried and then it was sieved using 2 mm sieve prior to potting water hyacinth plants of uniform length and weight were collected from the mihintale tank collected plants were washed first with tap water then 1 v v sodium hypochlorite solution and finally with deionized water 2 3 pot experiment pot experiment was conducted at the greenhouse at rajarata university of sri lanka mihintale sri lanka there were five cd levels 0 5 10 20 50 ppm with the amf inoculums and without the amf inoculums in a randomized design with four replicates per treatment for a total of 40 experimental pots the growth medium in the pots consisted of 1 25 kg of wet soil for non mycorrhizal treatments and 1 kg wet soil and 250 g of mycorrhizal inoculum for mycorrhizae inoculated treatments the wet soil without the mycorrhizal inoculum was treated as control cadmium supplied as cdcl2 2 5h2o solution and the pots were filled with 5 6 l constant volume of tank water young water hyacinth plant was then grown in the pot for 60 days 2 4 analytical methods the sampling from aqueous solution amended with different cadmium concentrations had been carried out at an interval of 1st 3rd 14th and 52th days ten milliliters of aliquots were withdrawn from each experimental pot in above time periods for the analysis of cadmium concentration shoots and roots were separated at harvest some of the roots were kept for determination of percentage mycorrhizal colonization roots and shoots were washed with de ionized water twice and rinsed with distilled water dried at 60 c approximately for 72 h weighed and ground for chemical analysis dry weights of roots and shoots relative growth rate of plants cd concentrations in soil roots and shoots of the plants were determined also percentage amf colonization in plant roots was determined after staining with trypan blue adopting the procedure described by phillips and hayman 1970 and following the modified grid transect method of amf quantification mcgonigle et al 1990 samples of soil dried root and shoots were digested with 15 ml of concentrated hno3 and 5 ml of 70 hclo4 acid acid digestion was carried out on digester at 60 200 c until yellow fumes of hno3 and white fumes of hclo4 were evolved zasoski and burau 1977 the digestion process was continued until a clear solution remains after volatilization of acids the digestion was stopped when the residue in the flask was clear and white the digested sample was dissolved in distilled water filtered for the removal of impurities and made up to 50 ml the samples were analyzed for cd by atomic absorption spectrophotometry shimadzu aa 6701g 2 5 data analysis tukey s method and 95 0 confidence was used to test for differences among treatment means at a

that amf inoculated plants were shown significantly high p 0 05 percentage of amf colonization than non amf inoculated plants fig 3 1 further amf colonization of amf inoculated plants with different added cd concentrations such as 0 ppm 74 98 5 ppm 72 29 and 10 ppm 70 55 were significantly different from the higher levels of cd addition treatments 20 ppm and 50 ppm at the 0 05 probability level anova percentage mycorrhizal colonization of inoculated roots was ranged between 60 and 75 the non amf inoculated plants were shown lower colonization at each cd level was non significant at the 0 05 probability level percentage mycorrhizal colonization was depending on the success of inoculation and amf persistence in soil including amf species compatibility with the target environment azcon et al 2009 if those conditions are met amf inoculation shown high colonization rates with abundantly formed arbuscules and hyphal structures previous studies have also indicated that the cd addition in the soil water environment not inhibited the formation of external hyphae and mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots in a certain cd level chen et al 2004 bhaduri and fulekar 2012 according to chen et al 2004 funneliformis mosseae colonized in zea mays roots was not affected with the soil cd contaminations of 0 100 μg g 1 soil however higher cd additions 50 ppm in the present study significantly reduced root mycorrhizal colonization fig 3 1 in accord with the findings of kanwal et al 2015 3 2 cadmium analysis in water statistical analyses revealed that the 1st day after cd addition to the water 50 ppm added cd shown significantly higher p 0 05 concentrations fig 3 2 further it was shown that even the water cd analysis of 7th and 14th days after cd amendment the treatments with 50 ppm cd added water had higher cd concentrations figs 3 3 and 3 4 however it was evidenced that with the increase time of exposure to water hyacinth the water cd concentrations were decreased irrespective of the level of cd amendment and amf inoculation figs 3 2 3 4 some other studies also reported that the metal concentrations in the residual solution decrease with the increasing plant exposure time maine et al 2001 water hyacinth effectively removes appreciable quantity of heavy metals cd co cr cu mn ni pb and zn from fresh water especially at low concentrations lu et al 2004 soltan and rashed 2003 swain et al 2014 it was also noticed that this depletion of cd in water was higher in amf inoculated treatments than non inoculated comparing same level of cd amendment 3 3 cadmium analysis in water hyacinth roots and shoots results of the present study revealed that the concentrations of cadmium present in roots and shoots of eichhornia crassipes of both amf inoculated and non inoculated plant roots at 20 ppm and 50 ppm cd additions were significantly higher p 0 05 than the other cd amendment levels fig 3 5 cadmium concentrations were significantly higher in roots of higher levels of cadmium additions with amf suggested that water hyacinth being a hyperaccumulator of cadmium muramoto and oki 1983 and more effective with amf it was revealed that the roots of water hyacinth accumulated the higher concentrations of cd compared to shoots in all cd amended levels in both amf inoculated and non inoculated treatments fig 3 5 however this difference was significantly different p 0 05 in amf inoculated water hyacinth in low cd amended levels 5 ppm and 10 ppm some studies reported that amf could immobilize heavy metals in the roots and the mycorhizosphere of the plant and inhibit their translocation to the shoots joner and leyval 1997 bissonnette et al 2010 chen et al 2004 garg and chandel 2012 liu et al 2015 this reduced shoot cd concentration compared to roots in amf inoculated water hyacinth may be amf hyphae can compartmentalized cd in roots by adsorbing and binding cd meharg and cairney 2000 meier et al 2012 according to nielsen and jensen 1983 may be dilution effects which explained an increased plant biomass and decreased cd allocation to shoots 3 4 cadmium analysis in soil the present study revealed that significantly higher p 0 05 soil cd accumulation was shown at 50 ppm cd amendment of soil and water fig 3 6 in each level of cd addition amf inoculation enhanced cd absorption by eichhornia crassipes roots resulted reduced cd levels in soil fig 3 6 3 5 relative growth rate statistical analysis revealed that relative growth rate was significantly higher p 0 05 in zero and 5 ppm cadmium additions compared to the higher addition levels fig 3 7 in higher cd additions 20 ppm and 50 ppm it was shown that relative growth rate of eichhornia crassipes was significantly higher in amf inoculated plants than non amf inoculated plants fig 3 7 xiaomei et al 2004 reported that relative growth of water hyacinth increased with lower concentrations of cd 0 5 and 1 0 mg l but decreased with higher cd concentrations 2 0 and 4 0 mg l however at higher concentrations of heavy metals plant growth was inhibited mohamad et al 2010 liu et al 2011 kanwal et al 2015 was shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal wheat plants exhibited higher growth than non amf wheat plants however the overall mechanisms by which amf alleviate heavy metal phytotoxicity still have not completely understood arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may influence the growth of plants by increasing nutrient uptake specially phosphorus chen et al 2005 protect plants from heavy metal toxicity shen et al 2006 shahabivand et al 2012 garg and chandel 2012 fulekar 2016 and reducing the heavy metal absorption in phytotoxic levels through secreting glycoprotein glomalin and chelate ions of heavy metals chen et al 2004 vodnik et al 2008 3 6 dry biomass analysis root and shoot dry biomass was significantly decreased with the cd addition to the tank water further amf inoculated eichhornia crassipes plants were shown higher shoot and dry biomass in each cd added treatments fig 3 8 according to statistical analyses amf inoculated water hyacinth grown without cd addition t2 and 5 ppm t7 addition were shown significantly high p 0 05 root and shoot dry biomass fig 3 8 whereas cd can be toxic and when present in excess in soil water environment interferes with the uptake of essential ions biosynthesis of chlorophyll and nucleic acids lipid metabolism may affect the growth of water hyacinth in high cd concentrations dykema et al 1999 3 7 correlation analysis amf stimulate plant growth through a range of mechanisms such as improved nutrition uptake water uptake tolerance to toxic metals etc aggarwal et al 2011 so there was a positive correlation between amf colonization percentage and relative growth rate of plants also percentage amf colonization was proportional to the cd concentration in roots and shoots of the eichhornia crassipes therefore it was evident that a negative correlation observed between percentage amf colonization and soil cadmium concentration table 3 1 4 conclusions eichhornia crassipes has potential to tolerate the cadmium concentrations in soil water environment under applied experimental conditions absorbing and accumulating cadmium in shoots and roots exhibited the potential of eichhornia crassipes to be used as an efficient phytoremediator for cadmium eichhornia crassipes colonized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improves phytoremediation potential in cadmium contaminated soil therefore inoculating eichhornia crassipes hyper accumulator for cadmium with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi most appropriate for cleanup cadmium

surface of membrane which is clearly designated by fig 2 the above characteristic of membrane is indicated that the mixing of organic and inorganic materials was done very cautiously and uniformly so it indicated that the used pvc polymer has much excellent binding property with tta inorganic material khan and rafiuddin 2013a 2013b fig 3 illustrated the ft ir spectrum of pvc based tta material which indicated the presence of different groups at different ranges the broad peaks near the range from 1401 to 1626cm 1 and at about 3430cm 1 are assigned to oh bending and stretching vibrations respectively while 2926cm 1 is indicated the presence of nh2 group of used ammonia gas the absorption peaks at about 475 45cm 1 and 571 92cm 1 are attributed to metallic tungstate and arsenate groups accordingly the sharp peak at around 841cm 1 is assigned to the c h aliphatic bond of pvc polymer the peak at about 1200 1400cm 1 is attributed to the bending bond of c h near cl the c c stretch bond

intense peaks are found at 25 35 value in 2θ range and many other small intense peaks are also found at different 2θ values these more and less intense peaks correspond to various planes at different ranges which indicated that the composite material has somewhat crystalline or semi crystalline nature astm d543 95 1998 tga graphical representation is present in fig 5 which confirmed the weight loss of pvc based tta composite material at different temperature ranges the graphical representation shows two times weight loss from the range of 0 600 c through which the first and second weight loss have been taken from 0 to 400 c of 41 516 nearly 1 845mg and at 400 600 c of 7 165 nearly 0 733mg respectively on the reference of tga there is also dta curve which shows by fig 6 are indicated only one time temperature deduction at 104 28 144 21 c of 1 50j so it is concluded that the composite material shows more than one times weight loss at different temperature ranges therefore it is clear that the material has high hydrophilic nature which could absorb moisture from the surrounding atmosphere by dta graphical analysis it is clear that the sample of composite membrane has endothermic nature which means that the increasing of temperature leads to weight loss of material zhang et al 2009 4 theories the electrochemical properties of membrane have been studied by the help

inorganic material the mixing of both the materials was done very cautiously and homogenously with the help of pestle and mortar until it gets totally mixed with each other to show good mechanical stability it has been observed that the applicable ratio of organic and inorganic materials should be 1 1 after the homogenous mixing the composite material was then transferred into a special die of

characterization the images taken at different magnifications are indicated that the examined membrane has very porous nature and there are no any deviations breakages or cracks are found on the surface of membrane which is clearly designated by fig 2 the above characteristic of membrane is indicated that the mixing of organic and inorganic materials was done very cautiously and uniformly so it indicated that the used pvc polymer has much excellent binding property with tta inorganic material khan and rafiuddin 2013a 2013b fig 3 illustrated the ft ir spectrum of pvc based tta material which indicated the presence of different groups at different ranges the broad peaks near the range from 1401 to 1626cm 1 and at about 3430cm 1 are assigned to oh bending and stretching vibrations respectively while 2926cm 1 is indicated the presence of nh2 group of used ammonia gas the absorption peaks at about 475 45cm 1 and 571 92cm 1 are attributed to metallic tungstate and arsenate groups accordingly the sharp peak at around 841cm 1 is assigned to the c h aliphatic bond of pvc polymer the peak at about 1200 1400cm 1 is attributed to the bending bond of c h near cl the c c stretch bond

intense peaks are found at 25 35 value in 2θ range and many other small intense peaks are also found at different 2θ values these more and less intense peaks correspond to various planes at different ranges which indicated that the composite material has somewhat crystalline or semi crystalline nature astm d543 95 1998 tga graphical representation is present in fig 5 which confirmed the weight loss of pvc based tta composite material at different temperature ranges the graphical representation shows two times weight loss from the range of 0 600 c through which the first and second weight loss have been taken from 0 to 400 c of 41 516 nearly 1 845mg and at 400 600 c of 7 165 nearly 0 733mg respectively on the reference of tga there is also dta curve which shows by fig 6 are indicated only one time temperature deduction at 104 28 144 21 c of 1 50j so it is concluded that the composite material shows more than one times weight loss at different temperature ranges therefore it is
