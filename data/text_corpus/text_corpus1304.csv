6520,sources of water used by plants in rock dominated environments are far less clear than those in relatively homogeneous soils largely because plants in rocky environments normally expose to more complex substrate conditions and their potential water sources are hard to locate and sample in the current study potential water sources for plants growing on cliff face a typical kind of rock dominated environment were roughly separated into two water pools based on their hydrological differences a variable pool that is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by precipitation and depletion by transpiration and a constant pool that is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and depleted by transpiration of deep rooted species this study was conducted in a typical karst catchment of northwest guangxi southwest china stem water samples for the most common dominant tree species of cliff faces and rainwater for each rain event were consecutively collected throughout the growing season a co occurring shrub species which was identified to have a shallow root system was further selected as a reference species the reliance on different water pools was qualitatively identified based on the deviation of stem water isotope values between current and last sampling times as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall between these two sampling times our results showed that the shrub species continuously relied on water from the variable water pool which was consistent with its shallow root system while the dominant tree species shifted from the constant pool during the early wet season to the variable pool during the mid wet season then back to the constant pool during the early dry season moreover the divergent reliance on different water pools by the two species was further supported by the species specific dynamics in the efficiency in water use by various plants reflected by leaf carbon isotope ratio our results provide new insights into the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools which would be helpful in understanding the hydrological importance of different plant species keywords rainfall response water pools stable isotope shallow soil rock fractures southwest china 1 introduction plants are the main conduit for returning terrestrial water to the atmosphere thereby exerting a strong effect on hydrologic fluxes of the terrestrial atmospheric system asbjornsen et al 2011 to predict the magnitude of this flux and the potential for water limitations in an ecosystem the ecosystem s water source pools and their accessibility by plant roots must be known barlage and zeng 2004 one way root distributions have been examined is by direct observation of roots in trenches and soil cores but this approach is extremely time consuming and still allows only limited conclusions because water uptake depends largely on a dynamic and adaptive fine root system smithwick et al 2014 moreover in rock dominated environments where roots penetrate into rock layers through connected fractures and crevices schwinning 2013 excavation and coring soil is simply not possible stable isotope analysis has been extensively used and proven to be a powerful tool for locating plant water sources dawson et al 2002 sprenger et al 2016 this methodology is based on the expectation that most terrestrial plants do not fractionate hydrogen and oxygen isotopes during water uptake but see ellsworth and williams 2007 zhao et al 2016 thus xylem sap is an unbiased volume weighted mixture of all water sources used by a plant the relative use of different water sources can be inferred by comparing the isotope ratios in water extracted from xylem sap to all sampled potential water sources ehleringer and dawson 1992 compared with other existing methods the stable isotope approach is more effective with less requirements for operation reviewed by rothfuss and javaux 2017 nie et al 2017 once samples of all potential water sources are obtained and water within the plant s xylem sap is extracted one can assess which sources of water are being used in the most basic methodology several locations around an individual plant are selected as replicates soil samples are collected from different depths by using a soil auger or trench excavator with the possibility of simultaneous groundwater sample collection from nearby well s groundwater together with soil water extracted from each soil sample is treated as a potential water source for the plant barbeta pe√±uelas 2017 theoretically only in ecosystems such as in relatively homogeneous soils where large vertical rather than lateral differences among soil water isotopes can be expected results generated based on the above mentioned approach can provide precise information about sources of plant water uptake ding et al 2018 while in rock dominated environments precipitation infiltration is not a gradual top down process but is more heavily influenced by the unpredictable structures especially at fine scales of soil rock complexes dasgupta et al 2006 yang et al 2016b under these circumstances different cells at the same depth are disproportionately recharged by the same rain event tokumoto et al 2014 and are expected to have different isotopic footprints as a consequence even if extensive excavation could be used to collect samples from various depths of the soil rock complex it is far from guaranteed that they would accurately represent the corresponding depths or that reliable results about the source of plant water uptake could be achieved recently goldsmith et al 2019 provided substantial evidence that even in normal soil conditions studies using water isotopes to infer plant water sources can be misled by lateral variations in soil water isotopes actually plants in many ecosystems usually have access to few conceptually two distinct water sources ryel et al 2008 2010 leffler ryel 2012 yang et al 2017 one variable pool which is normally located in the upper layers is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by most precipitation events and preferentially consumed by all kinds of species the other constant pool which is normally located in the lower layers is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and probably depleted by the transpiration of deep rooted species seyfried et al 2005 for example in winter wet regions the constant pool could be tantamount to water that infiltrated to greater soil depths during times of high precipitation and low evaporative demand ryel et al 2010 schwinning et al 2002 alternatively it could also be composed of shallow groundwater recharged by watershed processes jones et al 2000 along with the hydrological differences in the different water pools one can expect correlated differences in isotopic ratios the frequently recharged variable pool should be isotopically dynamic through the fluctuating isotope ratios of precipitation inputs while the constant pool should be isotopically buffered through selective recharge or watershed processes ding et al 2018 as a consequence of the defined isotopic differences between the two water pools if the plant water source is dominated by water from the constant pool within a certain time frame the stem water isotope ratio can be relatively steady despite variations in the isotope ratios of the precipitation inputs however as water in the variable pool cannot be expected to be completely mixed after a precipitation event or to employ a consistent isotope ratio identifying if the plant water source is dominated by water from the variable pool based on stem water isotope ratios at a single sampling time would be difficult on the other hand if one can clearly show that the isotope ratios of stem water are correlated with the precipitation received prior to the plant sampling the plant can be qualitatively identified to rely on water from the variable pool the complexity of soil rock complexes nie et al 2012 and the recent evidence regarding the effects of lateral heterogeneity on plant water source tracing goldsmith et al 2019 indicates that linking the water sources used by a plant to the two above mentioned water pools is worth doing in rock dominated environments moreover it is thought that the variable pool is responsible for primary production while the constant pool is mostly responsible for ensuring survival through drought periods ryel et al 2008 yang et al 2017 from this point of view for many applications in community ecology and hydrology such as predicting vegetation dynamics under future rainfall distribution patterns germino and reinhardt 2014 and forecasting the hydrological consequences wilcox et al 2017 partitioning plant water sources into hydrologically different water pools is ecologically relevant cliffs vertical exposed rocky outcrops are one of the most ubiquitous landscape features that known as rock dominated environments on earth larson et al 2000 they normally maintain plant communities that are different from surrounding areas graham and knight 2004 but are much less studied than level ground vegetation as cliffs are fully exposed to air currents and soil is only present in small pockets of organic matter dust and other rocky debris in crevices and cracks water availability in cliff habitats is generally believed to be scarce for plants graham and knight 2004 mathaux et al 2016 on the other hand some studies also suggest that vertical surfaces on cliffs have abundant below surface moisture and the effect of rainfall on plants vanishes as plants became larger larson et al 2000 matthes sears and larson 2006 however few studies provide substantial information on the source of water used by cliff adapted species which limits the estimation of hydrological importance of cliff vegetation and its dynamics the aim of this study is to identify sources of water used by the most common and dominant tree species platycarya longipes wu in cliff communities of a typical karst region in south china which contains approximately 500 000 km2 of exposed carbonate rock in order to simplify the process a co occurring shrub tirpitzia ovoidea chun et how ex sha which based on field excavation was identified as having a shallow root system was selected as a reference species accordingly we hypothesize that 1 stem water isotope ratios of the shallow rooted shrub for each sampling time responds sensitively to that of the most recent rainfall and relies on water from the variable pool 2 stem water isotope ratios of the tree deviated from that of the shrub and relied on the constant pool at least during dry periods 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in a small catchment fig 1 a and b with an area of 1 14 km2 in the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems under the chinese academy of sciences which is located in guangxi province southwest china 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e the catchment is characterized by a flat depression about 0 06 km2 surrounded by mountain ranges except on the northeast side the mouth of the catchment elevation ranges from 272 0 m to 647 2 m hill slopes are characterized by steep slopes 62 are larger than 25 about 60 of the hill slopes are dominated by shallow soil 10 30 cm on average underlain by weathered or consolidated bedrock and loose rocky soil usually a thin layer of coarse gravel underlain by a thick layer of soil and rock fragments habitats expansion of these soil habitats is interrupted by the appearance of rocky outcrops fig 1b a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate dominates the study area with a mean annual rainfall of 1389 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 18 5 c chen et al 2011 the wet season normally lasts from late april until the end of september plants experience a pronounced dry season in winter and spring normally from october to the next early april during which only 20 30 of the total annual rainfall is received several persistent seeps i e springs that are found at the bottom of hill slopes normally maintain seepage from may to october additionally because of the decreased fracture rate seepage water is normally accepted as perched water at the bottom of an epikarst zone that is largely disconnected from the conduits that fill water tables guo et al 2015 schwartz et al 2013 the area experienced severe deforestation from 1958 to the mid 1980 s and has been under natural restoration for almost 30 years chen et al 2011 the main vegetation community types are tussock shrub and secondary forest almost 70 of the hill slopes are dominated by tussocks and shrubs with a scattered distribution of common tree species forest like vegetation is only found on fractured rocky outcrops or at the foot of hill slopes where soil is relatively deep nie et al 2012 moreover cliff faces at the top of hill slopes are normally dominated by a karst endemic tree species platycarya longipes wu du et al 2017 2 2 characteristics of the sampling site and target species the study was conducted in a rock outcrop habitat on a steep cliff face near the top of a southeast facing hill slope fig 1c soils in this habitat were scarce found only in some flat microhabitats or around the base of individual plants soils were thin approximately 15 cm in depth and sandy sandy loam according to usda classification which resulted in a relatively low water storage capacity vegetation on the cliff face is sparse and only one tree species the karst endemic p longipes was found in there the shrub layer is dominated by two small shrub species tirpitzia ovoidea chun et how ex sha and leptodermis ovata h winkl while grass and sedge were scarce based on field investigation within and around the catchment we found that the above mentioned two shrub species were common to cliff faces near mountaintops since t ovoidea was initially identified to employ shallow root systems in different habitats this species was chosen as a reference for the target tree species p longipes specific characteristics of the two species are listed in table 1 2 3 sampling rainwater samples were collected for each rain event precipitation intervals were considered separate if they were at least 12 h apart schwinning 2008 rainwater collection equipment was homemade based on the global network of isotopes in precipitation monthly rainfall sampling device iaea 2002 which guarantees no significant variation of stable isotope content within ten days rainwater samples were placed in capped vials wrapped in parafilm and stored in a freezer temporal distribution of rainfall data and other meteorological data were collected at a meteorological station located in the middle of the same small catchment plant sampling was conducted during the growing season june october of 2012 roughly two times per month within an area of about 400 m2 about 50 m parallel to contour line and 80 m along the slope on the cliff face the specific sampling days all clear days were randomly selected based on two principles the study area received at least one rainfall event since last sampling time in order to detect the response of plant water source to rainfall pulse or no rainfall was received within half a month to determine if the probable effect of evaporative enrichment could be detected ten plant samples were collected on june 21 and 30 july 9 and 20 august 4 17 and 29 september 28 october 12 and 30 on each sampling day suberized twig four to six replications per species samples were cut from the sunny side of the slope to avoid contamination of xylem water by isotopically enriched water all leaves and green stem tissues were removed schwinning 2008 clipped twigs were immediately placed in a capped vial wrapped in parafilm and placed in a cooler with ice for transportation to the laboratory in the laboratory samples were stored 30 c as leaf Œ¥13c is related to time integrated plant intrinsic water use efficiency wuei defined as the ratio of leaf area based rate of co2 assimilation a to stomatal conductance for water vapor gs farquhar et al 1982 leaf Œ¥13c has long been used as a proxy for wuei of c3 plants due to the roughly positive correlation between Œ¥13c value and wuei marshall and zhang 1994 on june 21 july 9 august 29 september 28 and october 30 mature leaves from the same twigs obtained for water samples were collected for stable carbon isotope analysis 2 4 lab analysis stem water was extracted by the cryogenic vacuum method described by ehleringer et al 2000 stem water and rainwater samples were measured by using isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the key laboratory for agro ecological processes in subtropical region chinese academy of sciences isotope ratios are reported in delta notation in units of per mil 1 Œ¥ d or Œ¥ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where Œ¥d and Œ¥18o refer to the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values for the sample respectively rsample and rstandard are the absolute isotopic ratio d h or 18o 16o for the sample and the standard vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water respectively although both Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values were simultaneously measured for each stem water and rainwater samples only Œ¥d values were used in the current study for two reasons firstly there are evidences that oxygen in water can exchange with the oxygen in the calcium carbonate of clay materials that are usually lodged at karst rock fractures mei√üner et al 2014 newberry et al 2017 oerter et al 2014 which may change the Œ¥18o values of rainwater stored in cliff fractures secondly the range of Œ¥18o values for all samples were much smaller than that of Œ¥d values which prohibits detecting small change of isotope values leaf samples were oven dried at 75 c for 48 h frozen in liquid n2 and ground to a powder passed through an 80 mesh screen for carbon isotope analysis stable carbon isotope composition was measured in the same laboratory by using irms the Œ¥13c value was calculated as 2 Œ¥ 13 c r sample r standard 1 1000 where Œ¥13c refers to the stable carbon isotope value of the leaf sample rsample and rstandard are the 13c 12c ratios in the sample and in the conventional pee dee belemnite standard coplen 2011 respectively 2 5 data analysis the response of plant water source to rainfall was analyzed based on the deviation of stem water isotope values of the current sampling time cstem from that of the last sampling time lstem as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall received between the two sampling times this approach was designed based on the assumption that isotopic effects of all rainfall received before last sampling time on stem water were embodied in samples of last stem water thus only rainfall received between the two sampling times is taken into consideration the current approach is different from traditional stable isotope methods which normally treat each sampling time separately and is considered an integrated stable isotope analysis in practice isotope values of rainfall received between consecutive plant sampling dates were plotted vertically based on time with the most recent rainfall located at the uppermost position fig 2 lstem and cstem were plotted on the same graph theoretically cstem has three relative positions s1 s2 and s3 in relationship to lstem for s1 the similarity between cstem and lstem indicates that plant water sources have no response to rainfall when cstem is plotted on the right side of lstem s2 plants substantially utilize rainwater rain 3 and 4 which is plotted on the right side of the blue auxiliary line only in this case does the mixture of lstem and the two most recent rains or one of the two rains combine for cstem similarly for s3 plants are expected to utilize the two antecedent rains rain 1 and 2 notably isotope values of rainwater were plotted like a soil profile with the most recent rainfall located at the uppermost position this design follows the concept that plant available water in the upper layers is more easily exhausted and is thus dominated by more recent rainfall especially in arid semi arid regions ryel et al 2008 or in regions where the water storage capacity of the substrate is extremely low such as karst regions yang et al 2019 as the current approach is more attached to the signal of each rain event whether or not isotope ratios of stem water shift towards that of recent rainfall the isotope values of rainfall were not amount weighted as previous studies suggest water stored in rock fractures are frequently not influenced by evaporation ding et al 2018 querejeta et al 2006 the effect of evaporative enrichment on rainwater was also ignored in the current approach following the above approach responses of the reference shrub species to recent rainfall throughout the study period were identified based on each two consecutive sampling times for each sampling time stem water isotope values of the target tree and the reference shrub species were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova to determine the significant differences between species once significant differences were detected stem water isotope ratios of the tree were further analyzed together with that of the former and later sampling times respectively based on the same approach 3 results 3 1 precipitation distribution fluctuations in rainfall and stem water isotope values approximately 900 mm of rainfall was received during the study period june october 2012 however the distribution of rainfall was temporally uneven fig 3 ranging between 35 mm in october and approximately 500 mm in june per month moreover rainless periods lasting more than 9 continuous days occurred 4 times during the study period two occurred during june and july and the longest period lasted 26 days from september 24 to october 19 in accordance with the uneven distribution of precipitation rainwater isotope values varied widely between and within months rainwater samples exhibited relatively lower isotope values in july and august late wet season average day temperature was 27 1 and 26 5 respectively than in the other months especially september and october early dry season average day temperature was 23 4 and 21 7 respectively fig 3 within month isotope values associated with greater amounts of rainfall were lower than those associated with lighter amounts fig 3 on the contrary the fluctuations in stem water isotope values Œ¥d values ranged between 74 5 and 51 9 for the tree and ranged between 74 8 and 43 5 for the shrub were much less pronounced than that of rainfall fig 3 moreover the two species exhibited significant differences the second sampling time f 17 9 p 0 03 the third sampling time f 89 4 p 0 001 the ninth sampling time f 8 9 p 0 018 in stem water isotope values in three out of the ten sampling times fig 3 3 2 water source determination based on integrated stable isotope analyses as shown in fig 4 a despite plentiful rainfall with a wide range of isotope values during the first time phase from the first to the second sampling time there was no significant difference between cstem the second sampling time and lstem the first sampling time for the tree theoretically the mix of rainfall events that were plotted on both sides of the supporting line could converge at the current stem water isotope value this case requires an accurate partitioning of recent and antecedent rainwater by the tree while a more likely possibility is that the tree relied on a constant water source and exhibited no response to rainfall this speculation was supported by the fact that there was no significant difference between cstem the third sampling time and lstem the second sampling time during the following the second time phase fig 4c for the tree moreover the Œ¥d value of the constant water source can be estimated to be approximately the same value as the tree stem water about 53 compared with the tree the shrub exhibited significant differences the first time phase f 49 5 p 0 001 the second time phase f 7 0 p 0 038 between cstem and lstem for the first and second time phases respectively fig 4b and d moreover for these two time phases lstem could only shift to cstem based on mixing with rainwater which plotted on the right side of cstem this speculation can be strengthened by the fact that isotope values of stem water became more positive and moved further away from 53 the estimated isotope value of the constant water pool throughout the two time phrases fig 4b and d in other words the shrub relied on the variable pool and responded well to recent rainfall during this period consequently the reliance on different water pools by the tree and shrub species was the reason for their differences in stem water isotope ratios at the second and third sampling times during each of the following five time phases from the third to the eighth sampling time the shrub species responded actively to the rainfall mostly the most recent rainfall received within the specific time phase fig s1 s3 thus relying on the variable water pool as no significant difference was detected between stem isotope values of the tree and the shrub during this period fig 3 the tree species was estimated to also rely on the variable water pool during the last two time phases from the eighth to the tenth sampling time there were significant differences the eight time phase f 18 2 p 0 005 the ninth time phase f 30 9 p 0 001 between cstem and lstem fig 5 b and d for the shrub indicating the reliance on the variable rather than the constant water pool specifically the significantly more positive cstem than lstem as well as the estimated isotope values of the constant water pool during the last time phase fig 5d indicated the utilization of rainwater received within this time phase however as there was no rainfall received within the second to last time phase fig 3 the shift of lstem to the more negative cstem fig 5b needs further exploration unlike the shrub there was no significant difference between cstem and lstem fig 5a and c for the tree moreover stem water isotope values of the tree plotted near the estimated isotope values 53 of the constant water pool indicating the reliance on the constant water pool on the other hand as cstem of the last time phase exhibited a relatively large standard deviation and plotted near the value of the most recent rainfall tree individuals might also be extracting some proportions of recent rainwater 3 3 fluctuations of leaf Œ¥13c values throughout the growing season as shown in fig 6 the fluctuations of leaf Œ¥13c values for the tree and shrub which were on the same cliff face exhibited different patterns for the first three sampling times both the tree and the shrub exhibited similar leaf Œ¥13c values between 29 and 28 after that leaf Œ¥13c values of the shrub increased gradually and became more positive than 28 while the values for the tree decreased gradually and became more negative than 29 4 discussion in order to gain insight into the sources of water used by plants growing in rock dominated environments like cliff faces in the karst region of subtropical china potential water sources were roughly distinguished into two hydrologically different water pools the reliance on water for each one was qualitatively identified based on the difference between the stem water isotope values between two consecutive sampling times as well as the relationship of the stem water isotope values to the isotope values of rainfall for the same sampling times which was illustrated in fig 2 the current approach was devised in the light of previous studies reviewed by nie et al 2017 conducted in rock dominated especially karst ecosystems for instance schwinning 2008 was the first to use isotope values of plant stem water and pulsed rainwater to identify sources of water used by tree species in a typical karst region both schwinning s method and the current approach relied on integrated stem water isotope information for two consecutively sampling times which was different from traditional stable isotope methods that treat each sampling time separately dawson et al 2002 as no samples were collected from the substrate the utilization of different water sources prior to the two sampling times was assumed to be isotopically embodied in the stem water isotope value of the first sampling time isotope values of rainfall received between these two sampling times were then directly used for further analysis as a consequence one limitation of these approaches was that probable effects of evaporative enrichment on rainwater both when it passes through the canopy allen et al 2015 and in the substrate benettin et al 2018 were ignored which inevitably brings bias into the results in future studies isotope values of throughfall and an evaporative enrichment model should be properly integrated into the analysis in the light of the concept of two water pools which was first commented on by ryel et al 2008 plant water sources were qualitatively identified to be dominated by water from one of them based on the current approach moreover Œ¥d values of water in the constant pool was estimated around 53 at the sampling site which was similar to that of seepage water collected at the bottom of hillslopes normally fluctuates between 50 and 40 ding et al 2018 as soil depth in the studied catchment increases from 10 cm to more than 100 cm down slope the more positive isotope values of seepage water at the bottom of a hillslope might result from the mixing of enriched soil water guo et al 2015 schwartz et al 2013 although seepage water also the constant water pool is normally accepted as perched water at the bottom of an epikarst zone rather than groundwater it is usually treated as a relatively stable water source similar to groundwater in studies of plant water sources reviewed by barbeta pe√±uelas 2017 as groundwater available to plants is deemed to be an important symbol of hydrologic refugia buffered from climate change mclaughlin et al 2017 relating sources of water used by plants to the two water pools based on the current approach would be helpful in understanding and estimating the response of plants to precipitation changes based on sensitive responses of stem water isotope values to rainfall the reference shrub species was clearly identified to rely on water from the variable pool throughout the study period as shallow subsurface layers frequently recharged by rainfall events because of the rapid hydrological processes through connected rock fractures the reliance on the variable water pool by the shrub agreed with its shallow root system no deeper than 40 cm table 1 this result was further supported by the dynamics the of leaf Œ¥13c values as rainfall became scarce during september and october fig 3 the increase in leaf Œ¥13c values at the last two sampling times for the evergreen shrub species fig 6 was also in agreement with a reliance on water from the variable pool no rainfall was received during the second to last phase however cstem was significantly lower than lstem fig 5b this result is contrary to the traditional view that isotope values of stem water normally become more positive after days without rainfall as both sources of water especially the shallow ones benettin et al 2018 and stem water itself mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2017 can be affected by evaporative enrichment since the exact value of shrub cstem was about 60 which is more negative than that of the tree about 53 and there was no other tree or big shrub species near the sampling site fig 1 hydraulic lift was not likely the cause of the relatively negative cstem of the shrub neumann and cardon 2012 previous studies demonstrated that isotope values of soil water in upper soil layers could become more negative because of water condensation on clear nights saha et al 2009 takahashi 1998 a similar phenomenon has also been observed both in karst regions with seasonally dry forest estrada medina et al 2013 and subtropical climates yang et al 2016a specifically the days within 1 week prior to the second to last sampling time october 12 were clear relative humidity was high above 80 fig 3 daily temperature difference was approximately 10 and wind seep was low data not shown which met the requirements for condensation saha et al 2009 from this aspect the relatively negative cstem of the second to last time phase was likely caused by water condensation on upper subsurface layers which corresponds with a reliance on variable water sources for the shrub compared with the shrub species the tree species exhibited continuous shifts of main water sources throughout the growing season from the constant pool during the first two time phases fig 4a and c to the variable pool during the middle five time phases fig s1 s3 then back to the constant pool during the last two time phases fig 5a and c as the variable pool is generally located above the constant pool and more easily accessible by all plants ryel et al 2008 it was reasonable for the selected tree species to rely on the constant pool during the last two time phases when rainfall became less frequent and smaller fig 3 a similar shift of main water source between the variable pool and the constant pool has been widely documented ryel et al 2010 and references therein although the study area unexpectedly received about 300 mm of rainfall during the first two time phases the tree species maintained relatively stable stem water isotope values and did not respond to the availability of the variable pool fig 3 presumably this delayed utilization of the variable pool can be linked to the specific characteristics of the environment and the phenology of the tree species soil on the cliff face is extremely scarce and rock fractures in the subsurface layers are also weakly developed largely because of the approximately vertical angle of the substrate that limits the residential time of water especially in the shallow subsurface layers larson et al 2000 matthes sears and larson 1995 in this circumstance the magnitude of water in the variable pool is usually limited because of its low storage capacity rather than the amount of precipitation received additionally the target tree species experienced two cycles of peak bud formation one is prior to the rainy season and the other is in the middle of the rainy season table 1 a similar phenomenon was also observed by other researchers in the karst region of southwest china tang and yu 2009 during the first cycle of bud formation when rainfall is rare a tree extracts water from the constant pool to meet its requirements although the study area received more rainfall during the early rainy season around june it was estimated that the occasional short term droughts fig 3 delayed the shift of main water source from the constant pool to the variable pool for the tree whether this is the main reason for the delayed response to rainfall needs further exploration the dynamics of leaf Œ¥13c values of the tree were generally in agreement with the shifts of main water source newly formed mature leaves are usually collected for carbon isotope analysis taking into account the preferential defoliation of older leaves samples collected at earlier sampling times such as the former three sampling times should be dominated by leaves that started growing prior to the rainy season while more leaves that started growing during the rainy season should be sampled in the latter growing season such as the last two sampling times it is easy to understand that leaves formed during the rainy season exhibited relatively negative Œ¥13c values low wuei largely because of the easy accessibility of available water sources such as the variable pool more importantly for deciduous species the maintenance of relatively low wuei which maximized photosynthetic carbon assimilation is critical to their short leaf lifespans escudero et al 2008 while for leaves that started growing prior to the rainy season the relatively positive leaf Œ¥13c values high wuei seem to contradict the reliance on water in the constant pool however based on theoretical analysis and direct evidence ryel et al 2008 2010 claimed that compared with the rapid use of shallow water sources low wuei plant species have evolved to use deep water pools only for maintenance functions high wuei even when plenty of deep water is available in accordance with this view yang et al 2017 provided further evidence that deep water extraction helps in drought avoidance but shallow water uptake during a dry season determines how well a tree grows moreover previous studies found that the reliance on deep water sources for species growing in rocky environments usually correlated with relatively high wuei hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2014b largely because of the cost of extracting water from depth schwinning 2010 accordingly the shift of main water sources for the tree species corresponds to the fluctuation of its leaf Œ¥13c values 5 conclusions sources of water used by plants growing in rock dominated environments like cliff faces have rarely been identified largely because of complicated substrate conditions and the associated challenges of acquiring representative samples of all potential water sources in the current study potential water sources were roughly separated into two different water pools a variable and a constant pool based on their contrast hydrologic sensitivity and the related isotopic variability the reliance on water from different pools was qualitatively identified largely based on the response or no response of isotope ratios of stem water to that of rainfall our results revealed that compared with the continued reliance on water from the variable pool by the reference shrub species throughout the growing season main water source of the dominant tree species shifted between the two water pools although these results are not as detailed as those achieved in soil dominated environments where specific depths of water sources can be identified the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools were built up with the growing interest in evaluating and understanding the responses of vegetation to climate changes especially to the change in precipitation and their hydrological consequences results about plant water source that associate with hydrologically different water pools will be more relevant to

6520,sources of water used by plants in rock dominated environments are far less clear than those in relatively homogeneous soils largely because plants in rocky environments normally expose to more complex substrate conditions and their potential water sources are hard to locate and sample in the current study potential water sources for plants growing on cliff face a typical kind of rock dominated environment were roughly separated into two water pools based on their hydrological differences a variable pool that is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by precipitation and depletion by transpiration and a constant pool that is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and depleted by transpiration of deep rooted species this study was conducted in a typical karst catchment of northwest guangxi southwest china stem water samples for the most common dominant tree species of cliff faces and rainwater for each rain event were consecutively collected throughout the growing season a co occurring shrub species which was identified to have a shallow root system was further selected as a reference species the reliance on different water pools was qualitatively identified based on the deviation of stem water isotope values between current and last sampling times as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall between these two sampling times our results showed that the shrub species continuously relied on water from the variable water pool which was consistent with its shallow root system while the dominant tree species shifted from the constant pool during the early wet season to the variable pool during the mid wet season then back to the constant pool during the early dry season moreover the divergent reliance on different water pools by the two species was further supported by the species specific dynamics in the efficiency in water use by various plants reflected by leaf carbon isotope ratio our results provide new insights into the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools which would be helpful in understanding the hydrological importance of different plant species keywords rainfall response water pools stable isotope shallow soil rock fractures southwest china 1 introduction plants are the main conduit for returning terrestrial water to the atmosphere thereby exerting a strong effect on hydrologic fluxes of the terrestrial atmospheric system asbjornsen et al 2011 to predict the magnitude of this flux and the potential for water limitations in an ecosystem the ecosystem s water source pools and their accessibility by plant roots must be known barlage and zeng 2004 one way root distributions have been examined is by direct observation of roots in trenches and soil cores but this approach is extremely time consuming and still allows only limited conclusions because water uptake depends largely on a dynamic and adaptive fine root system smithwick et al 2014 moreover in rock dominated environments where roots penetrate into rock layers through connected fractures and crevices schwinning 2013 excavation and coring soil is simply not possible stable isotope analysis has been extensively used and proven to be a powerful tool for locating plant water sources dawson et al 2002 sprenger et al 2016 this methodology is based on the expectation that most terrestrial plants do not fractionate hydrogen and oxygen isotopes during water uptake but see ellsworth and williams 2007 zhao et al 2016 thus xylem sap is an unbiased volume weighted mixture of all water sources used by a plant the relative use of different water sources can be inferred by comparing the isotope ratios in water extracted from xylem sap to all sampled potential water sources ehleringer and dawson 1992 compared with other existing methods the stable isotope approach is more effective with less requirements for operation reviewed by rothfuss and javaux 2017 nie et al 2017 once samples of all potential water sources are obtained and water within the plant s xylem sap is extracted one can assess which sources of water are being used in the most basic methodology several locations around an individual plant are selected as replicates soil samples are collected from different depths by using a soil auger or trench excavator with the possibility of simultaneous groundwater sample collection from nearby well s groundwater together with soil water extracted from each soil sample is treated as a potential water source for the plant barbeta pe√±uelas 2017 theoretically only in ecosystems such as in relatively homogeneous soils where large vertical rather than lateral differences among soil water isotopes can be expected results generated based on the above mentioned approach can provide precise information about sources of plant water uptake ding et al 2018 while in rock dominated environments precipitation infiltration is not a gradual top down process but is more heavily influenced by the unpredictable structures especially at fine scales of soil rock complexes dasgupta et al 2006 yang et al 2016b under these circumstances different cells at the same depth are disproportionately recharged by the same rain event tokumoto et al 2014 and are expected to have different isotopic footprints as a consequence even if extensive excavation could be used to collect samples from various depths of the soil rock complex it is far from guaranteed that they would accurately represent the corresponding depths or that reliable results about the source of plant water uptake could be achieved recently goldsmith et al 2019 provided substantial evidence that even in normal soil conditions studies using water isotopes to infer plant water sources can be misled by lateral variations in soil water isotopes actually plants in many ecosystems usually have access to few conceptually two distinct water sources ryel et al 2008 2010 leffler ryel 2012 yang et al 2017 one variable pool which is normally located in the upper layers is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by most precipitation events and preferentially consumed by all kinds of species the other constant pool which is normally located in the lower layers is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and probably depleted by the transpiration of deep rooted species seyfried et al 2005 for example in winter wet regions the constant pool could be tantamount to water that infiltrated to greater soil depths during times of high precipitation and low evaporative demand ryel et al 2010 schwinning et al 2002 alternatively it could also be composed of shallow groundwater recharged by watershed processes jones et al 2000 along with the hydrological differences in the different water pools one can expect correlated differences in isotopic ratios the frequently recharged variable pool should be isotopically dynamic through the fluctuating isotope ratios of precipitation inputs while the constant pool should be isotopically buffered through selective recharge or watershed processes ding et al 2018 as a consequence of the defined isotopic differences between the two water pools if the plant water source is dominated by water from the constant pool within a certain time frame the stem water isotope ratio can be relatively steady despite variations in the isotope ratios of the precipitation inputs however as water in the variable pool cannot be expected to be completely mixed after a precipitation event or to employ a consistent isotope ratio identifying if the plant water source is dominated by water from the variable pool based on stem water isotope ratios at a single sampling time would be difficult on the other hand if one can clearly show that the isotope ratios of stem water are correlated with the precipitation received prior to the plant sampling the plant can be qualitatively identified to rely on water from the variable pool the complexity of soil rock complexes nie et al 2012 and the recent evidence regarding the effects of lateral heterogeneity on plant water source tracing goldsmith et al 2019 indicates that linking the water sources used by a plant to the two above mentioned water pools is worth doing in rock dominated environments moreover it is thought that the variable pool is responsible for primary production while the constant pool is mostly responsible for ensuring survival through drought periods ryel et al 2008 yang et al 2017 from this point of view for many applications in community ecology and hydrology such as predicting vegetation dynamics under future rainfall distribution patterns germino and reinhardt 2014 and forecasting the hydrological consequences wilcox et al 2017 partitioning plant water sources into hydrologically different water pools is ecologically relevant cliffs vertical exposed rocky outcrops are one of the most ubiquitous landscape features that known as rock dominated environments on earth larson et al 2000 they normally maintain plant communities that are different from surrounding areas graham and knight 2004 but are much less studied than level ground vegetation as cliffs are fully exposed to air currents and soil is only present in small pockets of organic matter dust and other rocky debris in crevices and cracks water availability in cliff habitats is generally believed to be scarce for plants graham and knight 2004 mathaux et al 2016 on the other hand some studies also suggest that vertical surfaces on cliffs have abundant below surface moisture and the effect of rainfall on plants vanishes as plants became larger larson et al 2000 matthes sears and larson 2006 however few studies provide substantial information on the source of water used by cliff adapted species which limits the estimation of hydrological importance of cliff vegetation and its dynamics the aim of this study is to identify sources of water used by the most common and dominant tree species platycarya longipes wu in cliff communities of a typical karst region in south china which contains approximately 500 000 km2 of exposed carbonate rock in order to simplify the process a co occurring shrub tirpitzia ovoidea chun et how ex sha which based on field excavation was identified as having a shallow root system was selected as a reference species accordingly we hypothesize that 1 stem water isotope ratios of the shallow rooted shrub for each sampling time responds sensitively to that of the most recent rainfall and relies on water from the variable pool 2 stem water isotope ratios of the tree deviated from that of the shrub and relied on the constant pool at least during dry periods 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in a small catchment fig 1 a and b with an area of 1 14 km2 in the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems under the chinese academy of sciences which is located in guangxi province southwest china 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e the catchment is characterized by a flat depression about 0 06 km2 surrounded by mountain ranges except on the northeast side the mouth of the catchment elevation ranges from 272 0 m to 647 2 m hill slopes are characterized by steep slopes 62 are larger than 25 about 60 of the hill slopes are dominated by shallow soil 10 30 cm on average underlain by weathered or consolidated bedrock and loose rocky soil usually a thin layer of coarse gravel underlain by a thick layer of soil and rock fragments habitats expansion of these soil habitats is interrupted by the appearance of rocky outcrops fig 1b a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate dominates the study area with a mean annual rainfall of 1389 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 18 5 c chen et al 2011 the wet season normally lasts from late april until the end of september plants experience a pronounced dry season in winter and spring normally from october to the next early april during which only 20 30 of the total annual rainfall is received several persistent seeps i e springs that are found at the bottom of hill slopes normally maintain seepage from may to october additionally because of the decreased fracture rate seepage water is normally accepted as perched water at the bottom of an epikarst zone that is largely disconnected from the conduits that fill water tables guo et al 2015 schwartz et al 2013 the area experienced severe deforestation from 1958 to the mid 1980 s and has been under natural restoration for almost 30 years chen et al 2011 the main vegetation community types are tussock shrub and secondary forest almost 70 of the hill slopes are dominated by tussocks and shrubs with a scattered distribution of common tree species forest like vegetation is only found on fractured rocky outcrops or at the foot of hill slopes where soil is relatively deep nie et al 2012 moreover cliff faces at the top of hill slopes are normally dominated by a karst endemic tree species platycarya longipes wu du et al 2017 2 2 characteristics of the sampling site and target species the study was conducted in a rock outcrop habitat on a steep cliff face near the top of a southeast facing hill slope fig 1c soils in this habitat were scarce found only in some flat microhabitats or around the base of individual plants soils were thin approximately 15 cm in depth and sandy sandy loam according to usda classification which resulted in a relatively low water storage capacity vegetation on the cliff face is sparse and only one tree species the karst endemic p longipes was found in there the shrub layer is dominated by two small shrub species tirpitzia ovoidea chun et how ex sha and leptodermis ovata h winkl while grass and sedge were scarce based on field investigation within and around the catchment we found that the above mentioned two shrub species were common to cliff faces near mountaintops since t ovoidea was initially identified to employ shallow root systems in different habitats this species was chosen as a reference for the target tree species p longipes specific characteristics of the two species are listed in table 1 2 3 sampling rainwater samples were collected for each rain event precipitation intervals were considered separate if they were at least 12 h apart schwinning 2008 rainwater collection equipment was homemade based on the global network of isotopes in precipitation monthly rainfall sampling device iaea 2002 which guarantees no significant variation of stable isotope content within ten days rainwater samples were placed in capped vials wrapped in parafilm and stored in a freezer temporal distribution of rainfall data and other meteorological data were collected at a meteorological station located in the middle of the same small catchment plant sampling was conducted during the growing season june october of 2012 roughly two times per month within an area of about 400 m2 about 50 m parallel to contour line and 80 m along the slope on the cliff face the specific sampling days all clear days were randomly selected based on two principles the study area received at least one rainfall event since last sampling time in order to detect the response of plant water source to rainfall pulse or no rainfall was received within half a month to determine if the probable effect of evaporative enrichment could be detected ten plant samples were collected on june 21 and 30 july 9 and 20 august 4 17 and 29 september 28 october 12 and 30 on each sampling day suberized twig four to six replications per species samples were cut from the sunny side of the slope to avoid contamination of xylem water by isotopically enriched water all leaves and green stem tissues were removed schwinning 2008 clipped twigs were immediately placed in a capped vial wrapped in parafilm and placed in a cooler with ice for transportation to the laboratory in the laboratory samples were stored 30 c as leaf Œ¥13c is related to time integrated plant intrinsic water use efficiency wuei defined as the ratio of leaf area based rate of co2 assimilation a to stomatal conductance for water vapor gs farquhar et al 1982 leaf Œ¥13c has long been used as a proxy for wuei of c3 plants due to the roughly positive correlation between Œ¥13c value and wuei marshall and zhang 1994 on june 21 july 9 august 29 september 28 and october 30 mature leaves from the same twigs obtained for water samples were collected for stable carbon isotope analysis 2 4 lab analysis stem water was extracted by the cryogenic vacuum method described by ehleringer et al 2000 stem water and rainwater samples were measured by using isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the key laboratory for agro ecological processes in subtropical region chinese academy of sciences isotope ratios are reported in delta notation in units of per mil 1 Œ¥ d or Œ¥ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where Œ¥d and Œ¥18o refer to the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values for the sample respectively rsample and rstandard are the absolute isotopic ratio d h or 18o 16o for the sample and the standard vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water respectively although both Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values were simultaneously measured for each stem water and rainwater samples only Œ¥d values were used in the current study for two reasons firstly there are evidences that oxygen in water can exchange with the oxygen in the calcium carbonate of clay materials that are usually lodged at karst rock fractures mei√üner et al 2014 newberry et al 2017 oerter et al 2014 which may change the Œ¥18o values of rainwater stored in cliff fractures secondly the range of Œ¥18o values for all samples were much smaller than that of Œ¥d values which prohibits detecting small change of isotope values leaf samples were oven dried at 75 c for 48 h frozen in liquid n2 and ground to a powder passed through an 80 mesh screen for carbon isotope analysis stable carbon isotope composition was measured in the same laboratory by using irms the Œ¥13c value was calculated as 2 Œ¥ 13 c r sample r standard 1 1000 where Œ¥13c refers to the stable carbon isotope value of the leaf sample rsample and rstandard are the 13c 12c ratios in the sample and in the conventional pee dee belemnite standard coplen 2011 respectively 2 5 data analysis the response of plant water source to rainfall was analyzed based on the deviation of stem water isotope values of the current sampling time cstem from that of the last sampling time lstem as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall received between the two sampling times this approach was designed based on the assumption that isotopic effects of all rainfall received before last sampling time on stem water were embodied in samples of last stem water thus only rainfall received between the two sampling times is taken into consideration the current approach is different from traditional stable isotope methods which normally treat each sampling time separately and is considered an integrated stable isotope analysis in practice isotope values of rainfall received between consecutive plant sampling dates were plotted vertically based on time with the most recent rainfall located at the uppermost position fig 2 lstem and cstem were plotted on the same graph theoretically cstem has three relative positions s1 s2 and s3 in relationship to lstem for s1 the similarity between cstem and lstem indicates that plant water sources have no response to rainfall when cstem is plotted on the right side of lstem s2 plants substantially utilize rainwater rain 3 and 4 which is plotted on the right side of the blue auxiliary line only in this case does the mixture of lstem and the two most recent rains or one of the two rains combine for cstem similarly for s3 plants are expected to utilize the two antecedent rains rain 1 and 2 notably isotope values of rainwater were plotted like a soil profile with the most recent rainfall located at the uppermost position this design follows the concept that plant available water in the upper layers is more easily exhausted and is thus dominated by more recent rainfall especially in arid semi arid regions ryel et al 2008 or in regions where the water storage capacity of the substrate is extremely low such as karst regions yang et al 2019 as the current approach is more attached to the signal of each rain event whether or not isotope ratios of stem water shift towards that of recent rainfall the isotope values of rainfall were not amount weighted as previous studies suggest water stored in rock fractures are frequently not influenced by evaporation ding et al 2018 querejeta et al 2006 the effect of evaporative enrichment on rainwater was also ignored in the current approach following the above approach responses of the reference shrub species to recent rainfall throughout the study period were identified based on each two consecutive sampling times for each sampling time stem water isotope values of the target tree and the reference shrub species were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova to determine the significant differences between species once significant differences were detected stem water isotope ratios of the tree were further analyzed together with that of the former and later sampling times respectively based on the same approach 3 results 3 1 precipitation distribution fluctuations in rainfall and stem water isotope values approximately 900 mm of rainfall was received during the study period june october 2012 however the distribution of rainfall was temporally uneven fig 3 ranging between 35 mm in october and approximately 500 mm in june per month moreover rainless periods lasting more than 9 continuous days occurred 4 times during the study period two occurred during june and july and the longest period lasted 26 days from september 24 to october 19 in accordance with the uneven distribution of precipitation rainwater isotope values varied widely between and within months rainwater samples exhibited relatively lower isotope values in july and august late wet season average day temperature was 27 1 and 26 5 respectively than in the other months especially september and october early dry season average day temperature was 23 4 and 21 7 respectively fig 3 within month isotope values associated with greater amounts of rainfall were lower than those associated with lighter amounts fig 3 on the contrary the fluctuations in stem water isotope values Œ¥d values ranged between 74 5 and 51 9 for the tree and ranged between 74 8 and 43 5 for the shrub were much less pronounced than that of rainfall fig 3 moreover the two species exhibited significant differences the second sampling time f 17 9 p 0 03 the third sampling time f 89 4 p 0 001 the ninth sampling time f 8 9 p 0 018 in stem water isotope values in three out of the ten sampling times fig 3 3 2 water source determination based on integrated stable isotope analyses as shown in fig 4 a despite plentiful rainfall with a wide range of isotope values during the first time phase from the first to the second sampling time there was no significant difference between cstem the second sampling time and lstem the first sampling time for the tree theoretically the mix of rainfall events that were plotted on both sides of the supporting line could converge at the current stem water isotope value this case requires an accurate partitioning of recent and antecedent rainwater by the tree while a more likely possibility is that the tree relied on a constant water source and exhibited no response to rainfall this speculation was supported by the fact that there was no significant difference between cstem the third sampling time and lstem the second sampling time during the following the second time phase fig 4c for the tree moreover the Œ¥d value of the constant water source can be estimated to be approximately the same value as the tree stem water about 53 compared with the tree the shrub exhibited significant differences the first time phase f 49 5 p 0 001 the second time phase f 7 0 p 0 038 between cstem and lstem for the first and second time phases respectively fig 4b and d moreover for these two time phases lstem could only shift to cstem based on mixing with rainwater which plotted on the right side of cstem this speculation can be strengthened by the fact that isotope values of stem water became more positive and moved further away from 53 the estimated isotope value of the constant water pool throughout the two time phrases fig 4b and d in other words the shrub relied on the variable pool and responded well to recent rainfall during this period consequently the reliance on different water pools by the tree and shrub species was the reason for their differences in stem water isotope ratios at the second and third sampling times during each of the following five time phases from the third to the eighth sampling time the shrub species responded actively to the rainfall mostly the most recent rainfall received within the specific time phase fig s1 s3 thus relying on the variable water pool as no significant difference was detected between stem isotope values of the tree and the shrub during this period fig 3 the tree species was estimated to also rely on the variable water pool during the last two time phases from the eighth to the tenth sampling time there were significant differences the eight time phase f 18 2 p 0 005 the ninth time phase f 30 9 p 0 001 between cstem and lstem fig 5 b and d for the shrub indicating the reliance on the variable rather than the constant water pool specifically the significantly more positive cstem than lstem as well as the estimated isotope values of the constant water pool during the last time phase fig 5d indicated the utilization of rainwater received within this time phase however as there was no rainfall received within the second to last time phase fig 3 the shift of lstem to the more negative cstem fig 5b needs further exploration unlike the shrub there was no significant difference between cstem and lstem fig 5a and c for the tree moreover stem water isotope values of the tree plotted near the estimated isotope values 53 of the constant water pool indicating the reliance on the constant water pool on the other hand as cstem of the last time phase exhibited a relatively large standard deviation and plotted near the value of the most recent rainfall tree individuals might also be extracting some proportions of recent rainwater 3 3 fluctuations of leaf Œ¥13c values throughout the growing season as shown in fig 6 the fluctuations of leaf Œ¥13c values for the tree and shrub which were on the same cliff face exhibited different patterns for the first three sampling times both the tree and the shrub exhibited similar leaf Œ¥13c values between 29 and 28 after that leaf Œ¥13c values of the shrub increased gradually and became more positive than 28 while the values for the tree decreased gradually and became more negative than 29 4 discussion in order to gain insight into the sources of water used by plants growing in rock dominated environments like cliff faces in the karst region of subtropical china potential water sources were roughly distinguished into two hydrologically different water pools the reliance on water for each one was qualitatively identified based on the difference between the stem water isotope values between two consecutive sampling times as well as the relationship of the stem water isotope values to the isotope values of rainfall for the same sampling times which was illustrated in fig 2 the current approach was devised in the light of previous studies reviewed by nie et al 2017 conducted in rock dominated especially karst ecosystems for instance schwinning 2008 was the first to use isotope values of plant stem water and pulsed rainwater to identify sources of water used by tree species in a typical karst region both schwinning s method and the current approach relied on integrated stem water isotope information for two consecutively sampling times which was different from traditional stable isotope methods that treat each sampling time separately dawson et al 2002 as no samples were collected from the substrate the utilization of different water sources prior to the two sampling times was assumed to be isotopically embodied in the stem water isotope value of the first sampling time isotope values of rainfall received between these two sampling times were then directly used for further analysis as a consequence one limitation of these approaches was that probable effects of evaporative enrichment on rainwater both when it passes through the canopy allen et al 2015 and in the substrate benettin et al 2018 were ignored which inevitably brings bias into the results in future studies isotope values of throughfall and an evaporative enrichment model should be properly integrated into the analysis in the light of the concept of two water pools which was first commented on by ryel et al 2008 plant water sources were qualitatively identified to be dominated by water from one of them based on the current approach moreover Œ¥d values of water in the constant pool was estimated around 53 at the sampling site which was similar to that of seepage water collected at the bottom of hillslopes normally fluctuates between 50 and 40 ding et al 2018 as soil depth in the studied catchment increases from 10 cm to more than 100 cm down slope the more positive isotope values of seepage water at the bottom of a hillslope might result from the mixing of enriched soil water guo et al 2015 schwartz et al 2013 although seepage water also the constant water pool is normally accepted as perched water at the bottom of an epikarst zone rather than groundwater it is usually treated as a relatively stable water source similar to groundwater in studies of plant water sources reviewed by barbeta pe√±uelas 2017 as groundwater available to plants is deemed to be an important symbol of hydrologic refugia buffered from climate change mclaughlin et al 2017 relating sources of water used by plants to the two water pools based on the current approach would be helpful in understanding and estimating the response of plants to precipitation changes based on sensitive responses of stem water isotope values to rainfall the reference shrub species was clearly identified to rely on water from the variable pool throughout the study period as shallow subsurface layers frequently recharged by rainfall events because of the rapid hydrological processes through connected rock fractures the reliance on the variable water pool by the shrub agreed with its shallow root system no deeper than 40 cm table 1 this result was further supported by the dynamics the of leaf Œ¥13c values as rainfall became scarce during september and october fig 3 the increase in leaf Œ¥13c values at the last two sampling times for the evergreen shrub species fig 6 was also in agreement with a reliance on water from the variable pool no rainfall was received during the second to last phase however cstem was significantly lower than lstem fig 5b this result is contrary to the traditional view that isotope values of stem water normally become more positive after days without rainfall as both sources of water especially the shallow ones benettin et al 2018 and stem water itself mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2017 can be affected by evaporative enrichment since the exact value of shrub cstem was about 60 which is more negative than that of the tree about 53 and there was no other tree or big shrub species near the sampling site fig 1 hydraulic lift was not likely the cause of the relatively negative cstem of the shrub neumann and cardon 2012 previous studies demonstrated that isotope values of soil water in upper soil layers could become more negative because of water condensation on clear nights saha et al 2009 takahashi 1998 a similar phenomenon has also been observed both in karst regions with seasonally dry forest estrada medina et al 2013 and subtropical climates yang et al 2016a specifically the days within 1 week prior to the second to last sampling time october 12 were clear relative humidity was high above 80 fig 3 daily temperature difference was approximately 10 and wind seep was low data not shown which met the requirements for condensation saha et al 2009 from this aspect the relatively negative cstem of the second to last time phase was likely caused by water condensation on upper subsurface layers which corresponds with a reliance on variable water sources for the shrub compared with the shrub species the tree species exhibited continuous shifts of main water sources throughout the growing season from the constant pool during the first two time phases fig 4a and c to the variable pool during the middle five time phases fig s1 s3 then back to the constant pool during the last two time phases fig 5a and c as the variable pool is generally located above the constant pool and more easily accessible by all plants ryel et al 2008 it was reasonable for the selected tree species to rely on the constant pool during the last two time phases when rainfall became less frequent and smaller fig 3 a similar shift of main water source between the variable pool and the constant pool has been widely documented ryel et al 2010 and references therein although the study area unexpectedly received about 300 mm of rainfall during the first two time phases the tree species maintained relatively stable stem water isotope values and did not respond to the availability of the variable pool fig 3 presumably this delayed utilization of the variable pool can be linked to the specific characteristics of the environment and the phenology of the tree species soil on the cliff face is extremely scarce and rock fractures in the subsurface layers are also weakly developed largely because of the approximately vertical angle of the substrate that limits the residential time of water especially in the shallow subsurface layers larson et al 2000 matthes sears and larson 1995 in this circumstance the magnitude of water in the variable pool is usually limited because of its low storage capacity rather than the amount of precipitation received additionally the target tree species experienced two cycles of peak bud formation one is prior to the rainy season and the other is in the middle of the rainy season table 1 a similar phenomenon was also observed by other researchers in the karst region of southwest china tang and yu 2009 during the first cycle of bud formation when rainfall is rare a tree extracts water from the constant pool to meet its requirements although the study area received more rainfall during the early rainy season around june it was estimated that the occasional short term droughts fig 3 delayed the shift of main water source from the constant pool to the variable pool for the tree whether this is the main reason for the delayed response to rainfall needs further exploration the dynamics of leaf Œ¥13c values of the tree were generally in agreement with the shifts of main water source newly formed mature leaves are usually collected for carbon isotope analysis taking into account the preferential defoliation of older leaves samples collected at earlier sampling times such as the former three sampling times should be dominated by leaves that started growing prior to the rainy season while more leaves that started growing during the rainy season should be sampled in the latter growing season such as the last two sampling times it is easy to understand that leaves formed during the rainy season exhibited relatively negative Œ¥13c values low wuei largely because of the easy accessibility of available water sources such as the variable pool more importantly for deciduous species the maintenance of relatively low wuei which maximized photosynthetic carbon assimilation is critical to their short leaf lifespans escudero et al 2008 while for leaves that started growing prior to the rainy season the relatively positive leaf Œ¥13c values high wuei seem to contradict the reliance on water in the constant pool however based on theoretical analysis and direct evidence ryel et al 2008 2010 claimed that compared with the rapid use of shallow water sources low wuei plant species have evolved to use deep water pools only for maintenance functions high wuei even when plenty of deep water is available in accordance with this view yang et al 2017 provided further evidence that deep water extraction helps in drought avoidance but shallow water uptake during a dry season determines how well a tree grows moreover previous studies found that the reliance on deep water sources for species growing in rocky environments usually correlated with relatively high wuei hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2014b largely because of the cost of extracting water from depth schwinning 2010 accordingly the shift of main water sources for the tree species corresponds to the fluctuation of its leaf Œ¥13c values 5 conclusions sources of water used by plants growing in rock dominated environments like cliff faces have rarely been identified largely because of complicated substrate conditions and the associated challenges of acquiring representative samples of all potential water sources in the current study potential water sources were roughly separated into two different water pools a variable and a constant pool based on their contrast hydrologic sensitivity and the related isotopic variability the reliance on water from different pools was qualitatively identified largely based on the response or no response of isotope ratios of stem water to that of rainfall our results revealed that compared with the continued reliance on water from the variable pool by the reference shrub species throughout the growing season main water source of the dominant tree species shifted between the two water pools although these results are not as detailed as those achieved in soil dominated environments where specific depths of water sources can be identified the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools were built up with the growing interest in evaluating and understanding the responses of vegetation to climate changes especially to the change in precipitation and their hydrological consequences results about plant water source that associate with hydrologically different water pools will be more relevant to

6521,a set of closed form series solutions that account for the transient and steady state responses of excess pore water pressure and total settlement to one dimensional consolidation in saturated soils exposed to various typical types of time dependent external loading with any desired excitation amplitude and period is symmetrically formulated based on the theory of poroelasticity the mathematical approach developed in the current study is quite general so that it can be straightforward extended to arbitrary waveform shapes of harmonic loading after they are simply represented in terms of fourier trigonometric series these solutions are numerically calculated to evaluate variations in excess pore water pressure and total settlement due to vertical consolidation in saturated soils with two very different magnitudes of intrinsic permeability soil a higher and soil b lower as representative examples using two illustrative periods per cycle our results show that within excitation frequencies we examined the excess pore water pressure exhibits greater cyclic swings in soil b than that in soil a as harmonic stress compression and relaxation are added but an inverse trend is observed for total settlement as compared to static external loading the excess pore water pressure persists longer with periodic fluctuation in the presence of cyclic loading but less total settlement is induced in soil b the discrepancy in the latter total settlement between the static and cyclic loading is most significant in soil b reflecting a physical implication that low permeability leads to a slower dissipation of excess pore water pressure thus causing less settlement with time keywords closed form solution time varying loading excess pore water pressure total settlement poroelasticity 1 introduction the cyclic and transient mechanical behaviors of granular materials particularly water saturated soils in response to time dependent stress compaction and relaxation have been a subject of great interest in engineering practices involving a variety of applications such as ground deformation due to infrastructure constructions lewis and schrefler 1998 embankment failure induced by earthquakes ansal and erken 1989 soil settlement arising from seasonal changes in groundwater level paul and sahu 2012 soil strength weakness affected by wave tides procter and khaffaf 1984 and etc as soil consolidation caused by external loads develops excess pore water pressure gradually decreases and the effective stress then increases in turn compacting soil skeleton and reducing pore spaces ultimately resulting in land subsidence regional land subsidence is a long standing critical problem faced in many coastal low plain areas over the world fabin and kumpel 2003 one of which is the safety concern on the high speed train tract madshus and kaynia 2000 therefore it remains a necessity to develop a rational systematic approach that has not only to comply with the fundamental physical principles as well as to satisfy realistic boundary conditions but also can provide an accurate description of soil consolidation phenomena under a wide spectrum of types of external loads generated by natural or human sources to date the theoretical models formulated by terzaghi 1925 1943 and biot 1941 have been widely applied to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of soil consolidation process in terzaghi s theory porous medium flow is uncoupled from solid deformation and the governing equation is derived to take a diffusion form with excess pores pressure as a primary dependent variable to illustrate the mechanical behavior of soil consolidation terzaghi proposed the pioneering conceptual notion of effective stress to quantify the vertical stress tending to compact the porous matrix in parallel to the work of terzaghi biot 1941 1956a b 1962 presented a more generalized theory now known as the theory of poroelasticity where the porous medium framework behaves elastically and accordingly undergoes small deformations while the flow of the interstitial fluid affected by solid deformation obeys darcy s law under the premise that the excitation frequency must be low enough biot 1956a b the physically based phenomenological model of biot 1941 provides a more rigorous mathematical treatment since the solid and fluid are strictly placed on an equal footing and consequently the displacement vector of solid together with excess pore water pressure are formulated as dependent variables for a pair of coupled equilibrium equations of motion since the inception of his seminal works many researchers have applied biot s theory both theoretically and numerically for a detailed analysis of the hydro mechanical behaviors of fluid flow in a deformable porous medium responding in either a dynamic or diffusive manner to static or cyclic loading lewis and schrefler 1998 wang 2000 uzuoka and borja 2012 lo and sposito 2013 lo et al 2014 2016 2017 cheng 2016 by contrast to static external loading time varying one a typical phenomenon often observed in hydrogeological problems such as that induced by ocean waves yamamoto et al 1978 and by traffics on railways schiffman 1958 would indeed give rise to distinct fluid flow and deformation patterns during soil consolidation the transient response of fluid permeated soils under cyclic loading is one of the crucial factors in evaluation of the structural safety on the ground despite the scientific attention that the study of the nature of variations in cumulative pore fluid pressure in unconsolidated sediments has attracted relatively limited attempts have made to focus on the hydromechanical response under cyclic loading conditions where the pressure may build up during loading while it dissipates during unloading in addition a better understanding on how loading rate affects the time dependent stress behavior of fluid containing soils is important for assessing the foundation stability perhaps schiffman 1958 was the first to investigate the cyclic behavior of saturated clayey soils under time dependent loading zienkiewicz et al 1980 pioneered to identify the importance of inertia in the theory of poroelasticity under drained and undrained conditions from a quantitative perspective and then characterized the corresponding applicable range to different formulations using two normalized physical parameters by employing an infinite sum of the trigonometric sine and cosine functions to represent harmonic loads conte and troncone 2006 developed an integral form solution using duhamel s theorem for quantifying the excess pore water pressure caused by vertical soil consolidation the effect of soil layering on uniaxial consolidation was discussed by miao et al 2010 using the ladder type multi level loading a theoretical poroelastic treatment of one dimensional consolidation in unsaturated soils under the action of time dependent loading was rigorously established by lo et al 2016 where closed form series solutions were derived for cosine wave excitation as an illustrative example ho and fatahi 2016 gave a detailed graphical illustration of the evolution of excess pore fluid pressures as well as total settlement for consolidation in unsaturated soil with changes in time using two proposed physical parameters permeability ratio and loading function a numerical study was conducted by ho et al 2016 to evaluate variations in this evolution due to the nonuniform distribution of initial excess pore fluid pressures in depth xu et al 2017 numerically examined the one dimensional consolidation of nonhomogeneous saturated soils exposed to different shapes of time dependent loading by allowing the coefficients of volume compressibility and permeability to be depth dependent despite these advances a mathematical framework that is general to provide a complete poroelasticity description of one dimensional consolidation for water bearing soils subject to arbitrary waveform shapes of cyclic loading is still lacking hence the present study is undertaken to formulate a series of analytical closed form solutions for examining excess pore water pressure and total settlement excited by three typical types of harmonic stress compression and relaxation i e cosine wave square wave and triangle wave shapes these solutions serve as the basis for a direct extension for any desired excitation frequency and period a comparative study to identify loading parameters e g excitation frequency waveform types that have an important influence on excess pore water pressure and induced total settlement as well as to quantify their influence is also conducted 2 model equations following the one dimensional consolidation

in terms of porosity œï and three measurable parameters k b k s and the bulk modulus of water k f 2 3 m k s 1 œï k b k s œï k s k f it is noted that the physical parameters c v and Œ≥ in eqs 1 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the unperturbed state prior to consolidation because we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations biot 1941 wang 2000 the central problem in the standard biot theory of poroelasticity thus the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration is equal to the value in the reference configuration plus the difference between the current and reference values it follows that in the small strain i e linear regime it is accurate to neglect the second order terms in eq 1 i e only the first order terms being retained we note in passing that with respect to the dynamic or so called hyperbolic problem i e the presence of inertia a state parameter the average displacement vector of a fluid relative to the solid phase has been considered as an extra dependent variable to close the problem completely e g zienkiewicz et al 1980 however for the quasi static problem i e parabolic type

fig 1 with the excitation frequency œâ 0 01 hz equation 7 is universally applicable for any excitation amplitude and frequency 3 initial and boundary conditions the complete solution of eq 1 for delineating the spatial and temporal distributions of excess pore sprees can be obtained after the given initial and boundary conditions are prescribed let us consider the undrained condition where water is not able to freely escape through saturated soils at the instant when external loading is applied this permitting us to write the expression lo et al 2014 8 p f z 0 Œ≥ p as far as the boundary condition is concerned the permeable boundary drainage ones are examined where the top z h and bottom z 0 surfaces of water bearing soils with the height of h are presumed to be entirely pervious with respect to water its conditions are depicted mathematically by 9 1 p f 0 t 0 9 2 p f h t 0 it is noted in passing that an extension of our complete solution developed in next section to the semipermeable drainage boundary conditions e g p f 0 t 0 and p f h t z 0 can be readily undertaken using the invariance of eq 1 under scaling transformationations and spatial translations as remarked in lo et al 2014 4 analytical closed form solutions 4 1 cosine wave extremal loading q 2 t in view of the boundary conditions in eq 9 one can write the solution of p f z t in the fourier sine

found that if the series defined in eq 10 is convergent the boundary conditions in eq 9 are satisfied guenther and lee 1988 likewise the source term q t t on the right side of eq 1 can be also presumed to take the form of fourier sine series 11 q 2 t t p œâ sin œâ t 2 n 1 g 2n t sin Œª n z substitution of eqs 10 and 11 into eq 1 results in 12 n 1 p n t c v Œª n 2 p n t sin Œª n z Œ≥ n 1 g

complementary solution p n c t and the particular solution p n p t the former satisfies the initial condition and accounts for the transient response whereas the latter describes the steady state

to the orthogonality property of the function of sin Œª n z eq 22 can be recast as 23 p n t c v Œª n 2 p n t m 1 y 3 n cos 2 m 1 œâ t thus after the application of laplace transformation the solution

complete closed form series solution in eqs 18 19 26 and 33 numerical calculations are carried out to determine the excess pore water pressure and total settlement in matlab by directly substituting hydraulic and elasticity parameters for water saturated soils exposed to the static q 1 t or time varying q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t loading with two very different textures as a function of elapsed time and excitation frequency œâ 0 1 and 0 01 hz tables 1 and 2 list the material and elasticity parameters of water containing soils necessary for numerical studies soil a is the one with comparatively higher permeability while soil b has a lower value we note in passing that zienkiewicz and coworkers 1980 proposed two dimensionless physical parameters œÄ 1 and œÄ 2 to characterize the applicable range for various formulations to examine if they can be accurately utilized in dynamic or quasi static regime provided that excitation frequency and permeability are prescribed the corresponding values of œÄ 1 and œÄ 2 to our study are calculated in table 3 the results indicate that those values are not covered within the zone modeled in zienkiewicz et al 1980 since we are dealing with slow phenomena where low permeable soils are excited by very low frequency pulse it is thus physically consistent to ignore both solid and fluid accelerations a scenario exactly analogues to zone i in zienkiewicz et al 1980 to verify the accuracy of our closed form analytical solution the excess pore water pressure obtained in eq 18 1 is compared to the result determined by razouki et al 2013 in their eq 12 in fact the latter that only contains the steady state solution since no initial condition is prescribed is a special case of the former as specialized to this simpler scenario the dimensionless excess pore water pressure p f p computed in our eq 18 1 is graphed in fig 2 for soil b subject to q 2 t as œâ 0 01 hz and z 0 5 m which also shows numerical values calculated from eq 12 in razouki et al 2013 it is apparent from fig 2 that our result obtained in this study eq 18 1 is in excellent agreement with that from eq 12 in razouki et al 2013 figs 3 and 4 present the graphic representation of the relationship between p f p and elapsed time t with a time step of 1 sec at z 0 5 m for water bearing soil a and soil b under the action of the time varying loading q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t as œâ 0 1 and 0 01 hz which fall within the lower band of frequencies in seismic data typically observed in the field ivanov 2015 and also locate in the range applied to evaluate soil

10 and 100 secs so that the complete phase of the response can be observed apparently figs 3 and 4 reveal that irrespective of excitation frequencies the responding amplitude of the dimensionless pore water pressure is greater in soil b than that in soil a since the loading efficiency Œ≥ takes the corresponding value of 0 990 and 0 998 for soil a and soil b the dimensionless excess pore water pressure is around unite at t 0 as the cosine wave and triangular wave types of loads are applied at t 1000 secs the dissipation of excess pore water pressure has almost accomplished in soil a but still remains significant cyclic response in soil b we note in figs 3 and 4 that although excess pores water pressure induced by cyclic loading at some instances may be enhanced up to the same

the total stress in eq 3 figs 5 and 6 graphically describe the impact of external loading types q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t on p f p for water permeated soil a and soil b with respect to the elapsed time at z 0 5 m due to the effect of œâ 0 1 and œâ 0 01 hz respectively it can be seen that at higher excitation frequency œâ 0 1 hz the square wave q 3 t type of external loading yields the greatest response for p f p in soil a whereas no matter of œâ 0 1 and œâ 0 01 hz p f p oscillates within the same interval of magnitude for q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t in soil b the dependency of the total settlement s t on the elapsed time t for water containing soil a and soil b in the presence of the time varying loading q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t as œâ 0 1 and 0 01 hz is illustrated in figs 7 and 8 respectively it is noted that an opposite trend to p f p is demonstrated indicating that the oscillation of s t is more considerable in soil a than in soil b a detailed examination on variations in s t caused by different waveform types of external loading q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t is carried out in figs 9 and 10 for water saturated soil a and soil b respectively the comparison between figs 9 and 10 suggests that although time dependent loading creates a cyclic response of total settlement its magnitude is less than that under static loading in soil b we noted that it is able to examine the nominal time required for the excess pore water pressure response to achieve the steady date status directly using the natural time scale for pore water pressure diffusion defined by lo et al 2014 as t v c v h 2 t the result is correspondingly demonstrated in figs 11 and 12 for water saturated soil a and soil b subject to four different waveforms of time varying external loading œâ 0 01 hz at z 0 5 m 6 conclusions the principal result of the current study is formally contained in eqs 18 19 26 and 33 which consist of the transient and steady state solutions to provide an exact analytical description of the excess pore water pressure and total settlement of saturated soils in response to numerous harmonically varying types of external loading for any desired excitation magnitude and period which covers a broad range of scientific and engineering practices the theoretical framework we developed here is quite general in that it presents a straightforward systematical way to which the formulation of our closed formed solutions can be directly extended for arbitrary waveform shapes of cyclic loading this can be achieved simply by representing its time differentiation in terms of fourier trigonometric series such as in eqs 11 21 1 and 27 one of the significant physical implication from our numerical studies is that the excess pores water pressure generated by time varying loading yields more profound response in soil b than in soil a irrespective of excitation frequencies leading to greater oscillation in amplitude thus deferring the dissipation of excess pore water pressure among three cyclic loads examined the square wave type creates the greatest excess pore water pressure in soil a as opposed to the excess pores water pressure a reverse trend is exhibited for total settlement whose magnitude oscillates more considerably in soil a than in soil b a comparative study indicates that as soil b exposes to harmonic loading less total settlement is induced than

6521,a set of closed form series solutions that account for the transient and steady state responses of excess pore water pressure and total settlement to one dimensional consolidation in saturated soils exposed to various typical types of time dependent external loading with any desired excitation amplitude and period is symmetrically formulated based on the theory of poroelasticity the mathematical approach developed in the current study is quite general so that it can be straightforward extended to arbitrary waveform shapes of harmonic loading after they are simply represented in terms of fourier trigonometric series these solutions are numerically calculated to evaluate variations in excess pore water pressure and total settlement due to vertical consolidation in saturated soils with two very different magnitudes of intrinsic permeability soil a higher and soil b lower as representative examples using two illustrative periods per cycle our results show that within excitation frequencies we examined the excess pore water pressure exhibits greater cyclic swings in soil b than that in soil a as harmonic stress compression and relaxation are added but an inverse trend is observed for total settlement as compared to static external loading the excess pore water pressure persists longer with periodic fluctuation in the presence of cyclic loading but less total settlement is induced in soil b the discrepancy in the latter total settlement between the static and cyclic loading is most significant in soil b reflecting a physical implication that low permeability leads to a slower dissipation of excess pore water pressure thus causing less settlement with time keywords closed form solution time varying loading excess pore water pressure total settlement poroelasticity 1 introduction the cyclic and transient mechanical behaviors of granular materials particularly water saturated soils in response to time dependent stress compaction and relaxation have been a subject of great interest in engineering practices involving a variety of applications such as ground deformation due to infrastructure constructions lewis and schrefler 1998 embankment failure induced by earthquakes ansal and erken 1989 soil settlement arising from seasonal changes in groundwater level paul and sahu 2012 soil strength weakness affected by wave tides procter and khaffaf 1984 and etc as soil consolidation caused by external loads develops excess pore water pressure gradually decreases and the effective stress then increases in turn compacting soil skeleton and reducing pore spaces ultimately resulting in land subsidence regional land subsidence is a long standing critical problem faced in many coastal low plain areas over the world fabin and kumpel 2003 one of which is the safety concern on the high speed train tract madshus and kaynia 2000 therefore it remains a necessity to develop a rational systematic approach that has not only to comply with the fundamental physical principles as well as to satisfy realistic boundary conditions but also can provide an accurate description of soil consolidation phenomena under a wide spectrum of types of external loads generated by natural or human sources to date the theoretical models formulated by terzaghi 1925 1943 and biot 1941 have been widely applied to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of soil consolidation process in terzaghi s theory porous medium flow is uncoupled from solid deformation and the governing equation is derived to take a diffusion form with excess pores pressure as a primary dependent variable to illustrate the mechanical behavior of soil consolidation terzaghi proposed the pioneering conceptual notion of effective stress to quantify the vertical stress tending to compact the porous matrix in parallel to the work of terzaghi biot 1941 1956a b 1962 presented a more generalized theory now known as the theory of poroelasticity where the porous medium framework behaves elastically and accordingly undergoes small deformations while the flow of the interstitial fluid affected by solid deformation obeys darcy s law under the premise that the excitation frequency must be low enough biot 1956a b the physically based phenomenological model of biot 1941 provides a more rigorous mathematical treatment since the solid and fluid are strictly placed on an equal footing and consequently the displacement vector of solid together with excess pore water pressure are formulated as dependent variables for a pair of coupled equilibrium equations of motion since the inception of his seminal works many researchers have applied biot s theory both theoretically and numerically for a detailed analysis of the hydro mechanical behaviors of fluid flow in a deformable porous medium responding in either a dynamic or diffusive manner to static or cyclic loading lewis and schrefler 1998 wang 2000 uzuoka and borja 2012 lo and sposito 2013 lo et al 2014 2016 2017 cheng 2016 by contrast to static external loading time varying one a typical phenomenon often observed in hydrogeological problems such as that induced by ocean waves yamamoto et al 1978 and by traffics on railways schiffman 1958 would indeed give rise to distinct fluid flow and deformation patterns during soil consolidation the transient response of fluid permeated soils under cyclic loading is one of the crucial factors in evaluation of the structural safety on the ground despite the scientific attention that the study of the nature of variations in cumulative pore fluid pressure in unconsolidated sediments has attracted relatively limited attempts have made to focus on the hydromechanical response under cyclic loading conditions where the pressure may build up during loading while it dissipates during unloading in addition a better understanding on how loading rate affects the time dependent stress behavior of fluid containing soils is important for assessing the foundation stability perhaps schiffman 1958 was the first to investigate the cyclic behavior of saturated clayey soils under time dependent loading zienkiewicz et al 1980 pioneered to identify the importance of inertia in the theory of poroelasticity under drained and undrained conditions from a quantitative perspective and then characterized the corresponding applicable range to different formulations using two normalized physical parameters by employing an infinite sum of the trigonometric sine and cosine functions to represent harmonic loads conte and troncone 2006 developed an integral form solution using duhamel s theorem for quantifying the excess pore water pressure caused by vertical soil consolidation the effect of soil layering on uniaxial consolidation was discussed by miao et al 2010 using the ladder type multi level loading a theoretical poroelastic treatment of one dimensional consolidation in unsaturated soils under the action of time dependent loading was rigorously established by lo et al 2016 where closed form series solutions were derived for cosine wave excitation as an illustrative example ho and fatahi 2016 gave a detailed graphical illustration of the evolution of excess pore fluid pressures as well as total settlement for consolidation in unsaturated soil with changes in time using two proposed physical parameters permeability ratio and loading function a numerical study was conducted by ho et al 2016 to evaluate variations in this evolution due to the nonuniform distribution of initial excess pore fluid pressures in depth xu et al 2017 numerically examined the one dimensional consolidation of nonhomogeneous saturated soils exposed to different shapes of time dependent loading by allowing the coefficients of volume compressibility and permeability to be depth dependent despite these advances a mathematical framework that is general to provide a complete poroelasticity description of one dimensional consolidation for water bearing soils subject to arbitrary waveform shapes of cyclic loading is still lacking hence the present study is undertaken to formulate a series of analytical closed form solutions for examining excess pore water pressure and total settlement excited by three typical types of harmonic stress compression and relaxation i e cosine wave square wave and triangle wave shapes these solutions serve as the basis for a direct extension for any desired excitation frequency and period a comparative study to identify loading parameters e g excitation frequency waveform types that have an important influence on excess pore water pressure and induced total settlement as well as to quantify their influence is also conducted 2 model equations following the one dimensional consolidation

evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the unperturbed state prior to consolidation because we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations biot 1941 wang 2000 the central problem in the standard biot theory of poroelasticity thus the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration is equal to the value in the reference configuration plus the difference between the current and reference values it follows that in the small strain i e linear regime it is accurate to neglect the second order terms in eq 1 i e only the first order terms being retained we note in passing that with respect to the dynamic or so called hyperbolic problem i e the presence of inertia a state parameter the average displacement vector of a

fig 1 with the excitation frequency œâ 0 01 hz equation 7 is universally applicable for any excitation amplitude and frequency 3 initial and boundary conditions the complete solution of eq 1 for delineating the spatial and temporal distributions of excess pore sprees can be obtained after the given initial and boundary conditions are prescribed let us consider the undrained condition where water is not able to freely escape through saturated soils at the instant when external loading is applied this permitting us to write the expression lo et al 2014 8 p f z 0 Œ≥ p as far as the

complete closed form series solution in eqs 18 19 26 and 33 numerical calculations are carried out to determine the excess pore water pressure and total settlement in matlab by directly substituting hydraulic and elasticity parameters for water saturated soils exposed to the static q 1 t or time varying q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t loading with two very different textures as a function of elapsed time and excitation frequency œâ 0 1 and 0 01 hz tables 1 and 2 list the material and elasticity parameters of water containing soils necessary for numerical studies soil a is the one with comparatively higher permeability while soil b has a lower value we note in passing that zienkiewicz and coworkers 1980 proposed two dimensionless physical parameters œÄ 1 and œÄ 2 to characterize the applicable range for various formulations to examine if they can be accurately utilized in dynamic or quasi static regime provided that excitation frequency and permeability are prescribed the corresponding values of œÄ 1 and œÄ 2 to our study are calculated in table 3 the results indicate that those values are not covered within the zone modeled in zienkiewicz et al 1980 since we are dealing with slow phenomena where low permeable soils are excited by very low frequency pulse it is thus physically consistent to ignore both solid and fluid accelerations a scenario exactly analogues to zone i in zienkiewicz et al 1980 to verify the accuracy of our closed form analytical solution the excess pore water pressure obtained in eq 18 1 is compared to the result determined by razouki et al 2013 in their eq 12 in fact the latter that only contains the steady state solution since no initial condition is prescribed is a special case of the former as specialized to this simpler scenario the dimensionless excess pore water pressure p f p computed in our eq 18 1 is graphed in fig 2 for soil b subject to q 2 t as œâ 0 01 hz and z 0 5 m which also shows numerical values calculated from eq 12 in razouki et al 2013 it is apparent from fig 2 that our result obtained in this study eq 18 1 is in excellent agreement with that from eq 12 in razouki et al 2013 figs 3 and 4 present the graphic representation of the relationship between p f p and elapsed time t with a time step of 1 sec at z 0 5 m for water bearing soil a and soil b under the action of the time varying loading q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t as œâ 0 1 and 0 01 hz which fall within the lower band of frequencies in seismic data typically observed in the field ivanov 2015 and also locate in the range applied to evaluate soil strength procter and khaffaf 1984 ansal and erken 1989 the time spams examined in figs 3 and 4 are set to be 100 and 1000 secs respectively which are equivalent to ten times the period per cycle 1 œâ 10 and 100 secs so that the complete phase of the response can be observed apparently figs 3 and 4 reveal that irrespective of excitation frequencies the responding amplitude of the dimensionless pore water pressure is greater in soil b than that in soil a since the loading efficiency Œ≥ takes the corresponding value of 0 990 and 0 998 for soil a and soil b the dimensionless excess pore water pressure is around unite at t 0 as the cosine wave and triangular wave types of loads are applied at t 1000 secs the dissipation of excess pore water pressure has almost accomplished in soil a but still remains significant cyclic response in soil b we note in figs 3 and 4 that although excess pores water pressure induced by cyclic loading at some instances may be enhanced up to the same magnitude as the applied stress i e p f p 1 liquefaction would not occur since the stress t s acted up on the solid phase still remains a negative value i e compaction according to the definition of the total stress in eq 3 figs 5 and 6 graphically describe the impact of external loading types q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t on p f p for water permeated soil a and soil b with respect to the elapsed time at z 0 5 m due to the effect of œâ 0 1 and œâ 0 01 hz respectively it can be seen that at higher excitation frequency œâ 0 1 hz the square wave q 3 t type of external loading yields the greatest response for p f p in soil a whereas no matter of œâ 0 1 and œâ 0 01 hz p f p oscillates within the same interval of magnitude for q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t in soil b the dependency of the total settlement s t on the elapsed time t for water containing soil a and soil b in the presence of the time varying loading q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t as œâ 0 1 and 0 01 hz is illustrated in figs 7 and 8 respectively it is noted that an opposite trend to p f p is demonstrated indicating that the oscillation of s t is more considerable in soil a than in soil b a detailed examination on variations in s t caused by different waveform types of external loading q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t and q 4 t is carried out in figs 9 and 10 for water saturated soil a and soil b respectively the comparison between figs 9 and 10 suggests that although time dependent loading creates a cyclic response of total settlement its magnitude is less than that under static loading in soil b we noted that it is able to examine the nominal time required for the excess pore water pressure response to achieve the steady date status directly using the natural time scale for pore water pressure diffusion defined by lo et al 2014 as t v c v h 2 t the result is correspondingly demonstrated in figs 11 and 12 for water saturated soil a and soil b subject to four different waveforms of time varying external loading œâ 0 01 hz at z 0 5 m 6 conclusions the principal result of the current study is formally contained in eqs 18 19 26 and 33 which consist of the transient and steady state solutions to provide an exact analytical description of the excess pore water pressure and total settlement of saturated soils in response to numerous harmonically varying types of external loading for any desired excitation magnitude and period which covers a broad range of scientific and engineering practices the theoretical framework we developed here is quite general in that it presents a straightforward systematical way to which the formulation of our closed formed solutions can be directly extended for arbitrary waveform shapes of cyclic loading this can be achieved simply by representing its time differentiation in terms of fourier trigonometric series such as in eqs 11 21 1 and 27 one of the significant physical implication from our numerical studies is that the excess pores water pressure generated by time varying loading yields more profound response in soil b than in soil a irrespective of excitation frequencies leading to greater oscillation in amplitude thus deferring the dissipation of excess pore water pressure among three cyclic loads examined the square wave type creates the greatest excess pore water pressure in soil a as opposed to the excess pores water pressure a reverse trend is exhibited for total settlement whose magnitude oscillates more considerably in soil a than in soil b a comparative study indicates that as soil b exposes to harmonic loading less total settlement is induced than

6522,realistic representation of surface states using the land surface model lsm is extremely challenging owing to human induced changes and uncertainty in forcing data in this study we focus on two crucial objectives pertaining to hydrology namely a to understand the ability of different soil moisture sm products to improve simulation of unmodeled irrigation processes through data assimilation process and b to learn the feasibility of these sm products to correct the spatial surface soil moisture artifacts caused due to error in precipitation forcing the utility of sm products evaluated in the present study are retrieved from different satellite sensors and algorithms such as the active satellite based the advanced scatterometer ascat merged sm from european space agency climate change initiative esa cci v4 2 and the latest passive microwave based smos inra cesbio smos ic sm product the results presented for three years 2010 2011 and 2012 suggest that assimilation of ascat and cci based products effectively captures the sm changes due to irrigation similarly it corrects the spatial artifacts caused due to precipitation errors however the single sensor based products have a limitation in spatial samples per day which is critical to capture dynamic sm products over a larger area hence blended products are more effective on a larger area to capture the dynamics in a more effective manner at daily temporal resolutions keywords land data assimilation soil moisture ascat smos ic esa cci 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a crucial surface state variable that plays a decisive role in the exchange of water and energy fluxes over the land and atmospheric continuum it has a prominent influence on various climate processes like precipitation koster et al 2004 crow et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2017 aghakouchak et al 2012 air temperature miralles et al 2014 stream flow and groundwater nair and indu 2018a ahmed et al 2016 this is mainly as sm dictates the partitioning of rainfall to infiltration and runoff botter et al 2007 orth and seneviratne 2013 salvucci 2001 and segregates incident energy to latent and sensible heat fluxes koster et al 2004 liu et al 2014 the persistent sm memory also has a huge effect on the forecast skill of droughts luo and wood 2007 floods parinussa et al 2016 heat waves miralles et al 2014 and thunderstorms mccoll et al 2017 an accurate assessment of prevailing sm condition remains critical in long range and seasonal numerical weather forecasts dirmeyer and halder 2016 koster et al 2004 in particular the root zone sm is extremely important for crop yield forecasting agricultural drought monitoring adegoke and carleton 2002 bolten et al 2010 han et al 2014 wang et al 2007 water resources management and climate studies chen et al 1996 liang et al 1994 sellers et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2005 past four decades have witnessed the evolution of microwave remote sensing as a promising source of global sm estimates nair and indu 2018b karthikeyan et al 2017a b these sm estimates rely on low frequency microwave observations owing to its high sensitivity to dielectric properties of the soil water medium and low attenuation from atmosphere vegetation some of the widely used satellite sm products are the advanced scatterometer ascat aboard meteorological operational metop satellites wagner et al 2013 multi frequency polarimetric microwave radiometer windsat aboard coriolis satellite gaiser et al 2004 advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 aboard aqua satellite advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 aboard the global change observation mission water gcom w satellite soil moisture ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2010 and the soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 the availability of these sm estimates have led to blended multi satellite sm products such as the soil moisture operational products system smops liu et al 2012 nair and indu 2016 and the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci there exist studies which have simulated sm vertical profiles at various depths using land surface models lsm and near surface atmospheric forcing data the modeling community and hydrologists greatly rely on lsms to recreate complex interactions between land and near surface atmosphere rodell et al 2004 which can estimate water and energy fluxes at high spatial resolution zaitchik et al 2010 though lsms estimate surface state variables at high spatiotemporal resolution they are subjected to uncertainties in forcing data improper parameterization and inadequate physical processes representations to facilitate regional scale studies efforts have been conducted to use data assimilation da techniques to improve lsm simulations using remote sensing data kumar et al 2014 lievens et al 2015a b nair and indu 2016 tian et al 2010 as well as on global scale liu and mishra 2017 reichle and koster 2005 rodell et al 2004 zhao et al 2016 most lsms are limited in their representation of human engineered unmodeled processes like irrigation kumar et al 2015 lawston et al 2017 brocca et al 2018 in order to overcome this studies have utilized data assimilation da technique to constrain lsm with remote sensing based sm observations de lannoy and reichle 2016 lievens et al 2015a b the study by kumar et al 2015 indicate remote sensing as a promising source to improve irrigation processes but bias correction technique is a major limiting factor to use remote sensing observations to correct for unmodeled processes on the other hand a recent study by blankenship et al 2018 indicated that assimilation of sm corrects the spatial artifacts caused due to uncertain precipitation which has motivated us to formulate two crucial and linked objectives which are a improving the simulation of unmodeled traditional irrigation processes over india and b correcting sm error caused due to the lsm forcing uncertainty related to precipitation spatial artifacts in this study we check the effect of da on three different sm products namely the active scatterometer based sm from ascat the passive radiometer based sm from smos ic and multi satellite blended sm from esa cci v4 2 these products are adopted for assimilation experiments in order to learn the ability of different sensor frequencies to furnish our objectives i e ascat sm is retrieved from c band sensors while smos ic relies on l band sensors similarly it will provide further insight into the impact of sensor footprint on sm assimilation as ascat has a higher footprint 25 km compared to coarser smos footprint 40 km further the third product esa cci is selected in order to verify the utility of blended sm product this is important as blended products have the highest temporal and spatial samples compared to single sensor sm products 2 model and data description 2 1 noah lsm the present study relies on version 3 6 of noah model mitchell 2004 to simulate land surface states over the indian subcontinent similar to nair and indu 2016 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 it relies on the modified penman monteith equation to estimate the diurnal variation of the atmospheric resistance coefficient chen et al 1996 mahrt and ek 1984 this model has a four layer configuration for sm and temperature extending to a total depth of 2 m from the surface to bottom the soil layer depths are set at 10 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 100 cm so as to capture the daily weekly and seasonal evolution of sm chen and dudhia 2001 as such surface layer estimates from model represents the sm from the first 10 cm which is deeper than the monitoring depth of satellite based sensors some of the previous studies have evaluated the effect of changing the noah first layer depth from 10 cm to 5 cm they have suggested that reducing the first layer depth has minimal impact on the sm estimation and that the difference between observed sm from remote sensing and simulated sm from lsm can be attributed to the lsm model structure rather than the difference in their depth shellito et al 2018 2016 however these studies pertain to surface layer depth sensitive to l band sensors such as smos and smap hence before assimilation we evaluate the variability in simulated sm after changing it to shallower depth 2 cm from default configuration of 10 cm it should be noted that this analysis is performed at 2 cm owing to its proximity to the sensitivity of c band sensor ascat the result from our analysis indicates a minor change less than 4 over the majority of regions as compared sm from 10 cm layer in sm when first layer depth is reduced to 2 cm a further detailed discussion of this analysis is provided in appendix a from our analysis and previous studies it can be inferred that the change in surface layer depth first layer of noah lsm has a nominal impact on soil moisture considering all these points and to maintain a uniform global land data assimilation system gldas model configuration for intercomparison of assimilation products the present study adopts the standard model setup first layer depth of 10 cm further we have adopted a model time step of 15 min for all simulations with output at every one hour this configuration is most suitable to assimilate different soil moisture products at their instantaneous overpasses the noah lsm for the present study is initialized by multi year spinup by repeated forcing from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2010 for seven times which is equivalent to 21 years simulation the forcing data for this study stems from gldas enhanced ncep s global data assimilation system gdas derber et al 1991 2 2 soil moisture dataset description the present study examines the feasibility of different sm products to improve model efficiency in terms of un modeled irrigation as well as correction for uncertainty in precipitation forcing a brief description of the sm products used in the present study is given below these products are selected with an aim to compare the assimilation skill of passive smos active ascat and merged sm esa cci products to improve lsm simulations 2 2 1 passive low frequency microwave based smos ic sm the soil moisture estimates from soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission are extracted from multi angular brightness temperatures at l band 1 4 ghz kerr et al 2010 the conventional operational smos level 2 and level 3 algorithms rely on auxiliary files to produce global soil retrieval maps they further account for correction in antenna pattern and smos viewing geometry such auxiliary files and processes add to the uncertainty in sm retrievals however in this study we use the latest smos product from inra institut national de la recherche agronomique and cesbio center d etudes spatiakes de la biosph e r e in this product the sub pixel heterogeneity is neglected in order to avoid uncertainties associated with auxiliary files fernandez moran et al 2017a b wigneron et al 2007 the smos ic product has a similar spatio temporal resolution as that of operational smos level 2 sm product 2 2 2 active microwave based ascat sm the ascat mission relies on three c band 5 2 ghz real aperture radars with vertical polarization configuration to monitor land surface processes the crucial objective of ascat is to monitor global wind direction however it has been efficiently used to monitor surface sm owing to its high sensitivity figa salda√±a et al 2002 the real aperture radar of ascat mission has a soil penetration depth of 1 3 cm depending on soil and atmospheric conditions it has an improved revisit time of fewer than 2 days and a spatial resolution of 25 km for the present study ascat data also stems from smops liu et al 2012 2 2 3 blended multi satellite esa cci sm to evaluate the assimilation skill of blended sm products the present study utilizes esa s cci v4 2 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 combined sm products they are obtained by merging different microwave products captured in the active e g scat ascat and passive systems e g smmr ssm i tmi amsr e smos windsat amsr2 smos lprm aquarius smap the merged products are available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 on the gldas v1 0 noah climatology the 4 2 version of cci sm adopts a more advanced and quality controlled data merging technique with additional information as compared to the older versions used by kumar et al 2015 3 da experimental methodology the lsm estimates of hydrometeorological variables are known to contain uncertainties due to forcing data and model components some of the previous studies have addressed this issue by calibrating the lsm parameters franks and beven 1999 franks et al 1997 crow 2003 corbari et al 2010 gutmann and small 2010 corbari and mancini 2014 mishra et al 2017 however such methods rely on one variable which has minimal impact on the overall simulation skill of lsm gupta et al 1999 moreover the uncertainty in observations used for calibration can result in unrealistic parameters by assimilating remote sensing observations within lsm the model prognostic variables e g sm get updated with respect to observations the improvement in the prognostic variables through assimilation will be propagated to other hydrometeorological variables through model physics the present study examines through da the performance of different sm products to improve the model simulation skills 3 1 assimilation setup and analysis tools the initialized noah lsm is simulated for a period of 3 years from 2010 to 2012 hereafter referred to as study period as described in section 2 1 the sm is estimated in 4 soil layers in order to improve the prediction skill of lsm first layer sm is involved directly in the da technique the daily sm products during the study period are assimilated to improve surface sm of noah lsm with 1 dimensional ensemble kalman filter enkf reichle et al 2002 reichle and koster 2004 in the present study nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 is used to set up the enkf assimilation framework the enkf algorithm is a sequential assimilation approach which alternates between model forecast stage and state update stage during the update stage model states are updated using sm observations based on the kalman gain factor reichle et al 2002 kumar et al 2009 2012 this depends on the model forecast error variances calculated from the model ensemble for this 30 ensembles of the model forecast are generated by imposing random gaussian parameters with zero mean and cross correlations in perturbation of precipitation and radiation field as shown in table 1 additive gaussian noise is added to model prognostic variables with vertical correlations for deeper layers these parameters are based on a study by nair and indu 2016 since this study adopts the one dimensional approach of enkf no spatial correlations are applied furthermore before assimilation all preliminary analysis indicated that no systematic bias is introduced into the model simulations owing to error parameter configuration in table 1 the da methods rely on the critical assumption of an unbiased model and observation states however owing to different approaches of observation sensor frequencies and retrieval algorithms the sm observations are biased with respect to model simulations hence in the present study all three soil moisture products are preprocessed for bias correction by using cdf matching technique the observation bias with respect to lsm simulation is removed using a lumped cdf pixel wise one cdf for entire year matching technique reichle and koster 2004 reichle et al 2007 kumar et al 2009 draper et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 nair and indu 2016 as indicated in the study by kumar et al 2015 a lumped cdf matching technique captures the irrigation signals at the cost of a dry bias condition in the non irrigation period this bias correction method is adopted over other techniques as over the majority of the indian states irrigation is carried out for most of the months further the low sampling frequency and high radio frequency interference rfi of smos observations add to the problem of computing monthly cdf for all pixels in the study region hence lumped cdf technique is the optimal approach for bias correction in this case the sm observations are not assimilated into lsm in the case of a snow cover or when the surface temperature is below freezing point b when the pixel is covered with dense vegetation c when no convergence is observed in combined sm product data quality flag further the sm observations are perturbed with random gaussian noise with parameters as given in table 2 in order to have effective assimilation it is verified that the distribution for normalized innovations follows a zero mean and unit standard deviation four different experimental setups are conducted to check the performance of sm assimilation the details of each are as follows a noda for this setup noah lsm is simulated for the study period with a standard setting without any assimilation b asc in this setup ascat based sm observations are assimilated into noah lsm for the study period c smos ic during this setup the smos ic sm retrievals are assimilated into noah lsm for the study period d cci in this setup esa cci v4 2 combined active passive sm observations are assimilated into noah lsm for the study period 3 2 evaluation of sm assimilation results triple collocation the first objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of different sm products to improve simulation of irrigation effects the results from this assimilation experiments are evaluated using triple collocation tc approach stoffelen 1998 in this approach three mutually independent measurements are used to compute unknown error standard deviations the main advantage of this approach is that it does not require any measurement as true the tc approach relies on a linear error model such that the error models are uncorrelated with each other this approach has been widely used in the field of oceanography stoffelen 1998 caires and sterl 2003 o carroll et al 2008 gentemann 2014 hydrology roebeling et al 2012 and particularly in sm studies nair and indu 2016 draper et al 2013 anderson et al 2012 scipal et al 2008 the tc furnish a reliable platform for comparison of da results independent of in situ soil moisture observations in order to have independent datasets and avoid correlated errors crucial assumptions in tc this study utilizes five sm products for tc analysis as summarized in table 3 the surface sm products used for analysis stems from merra land gldas clsm noda asc smos ic and cci here the last four soil moisture sources are simulated noah sm and assimilated sms respectively obtained from the present study for the analysis the first two soil moisture products are kept same while the third product is replaced with the noda and other three assimilated sm results this approach evaluates assimilation skill within the same reference frame detailed analysis of results from tc is provided in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the second focus of this study is to evaluate the utility of sm products to improve spatial artifacts caused due to precipitation uncertainty it is to be noted that the main objective of this analysis is to verify the efficiency of assimilation to improve sm state during missing rainfall events in forcing data rather than the bias in the intensity of rainfall as a preliminary step towards this we have validated gdas precipitation using imd data 3 3 validation of gdas precipitation the precipitation data from gdas are compared with gauge based precipitation provided by imd these are daily rainfall products available at 0 25 0 25 resolution over india which is prepared using the 6955 imd rain gauge stations distributed all over india pai et al 2014 during this analysis performance of gdas daily precipitation is compared with imd data using 2 2 contingency table as shown in table 4 this contingency table helps to capture the hits raining in both datasets misses raining in imd observation but not raining in gdas precipitation and false alarms no rain in imd but rain in gdas precipitation this is used to compute different skill scores including volumetric skill scores aghakouchak and mehran 2013 such as probability of detection pod volumetric false alarm ratio vfar and volumetric miss index vmi as summarized in table 5 here the bias is computed as the difference of gdas and imd precipitation when both the datasets detect rainfall i e during hit cases 4 results the main focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sm products to curb uncertainties from the model unmodeled irrigation process and forcing precipitation in order to evaluate this results are presented for different statistical indices utilizing auxiliary datasets different regions of india receive rainfall mainly during two monsoon seasons which are the summer monsoon where it rains in majority of indian states for four months june july august september and the second is during retreating monsoon october november december where the southern peninsula receives most rainfall krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 nair and indu 2017 hence detecting a single irrigation season for whole india is a challenging task as it rains in southern states when irrigation is performed in northern parts to overcome this issue we selected the winter cropping season october march fig 1 b represents the percentage of pixel area under irrigation between the study period 2010 2012 at a spatial resolution of 1km these datasets represent the modis based enhanced vegetation index evi for the winter crop season jain et al 2017 similarly fig 1 a represents irrigated pixels during the study period 2010 2012 from ambika and mishra 2016 which is obtained using modis ndvi at a spatial resolution of 250 m in order to detect irrigated pixels during the winter season both datasets are merged into 0 25 0 25 and pixels with evi and irrigation area more than 60 is assumed as irrigated 4 1 evaluation of soil moisture over the irrigated region the assimilation skill of different sm products are evaluated using kolmogorov smirnov k s distance d fig 1 c e represents kolmogorov smirnov k s distance d between noda and satellite soil moisture estimates the k s test chakravarti et al 1967 quantitatively compares the probability distribution of two data sets for example the simulated sm from noda and asc the k s d computes the distance between empirical distributions of two sample data sets the k s test relies on a null hypothesis that both samples originate from the same source distribution in order to evaluate the ability of the satellite sm products to capture irrigation signals the k s test is performed over sm samples during winter irrigation season the results indicate that all three sm products capture the winter irrigation signals with high k s d values over major irrigation regions as highlighted in fig 1 with a black solid boundary to further evaluate the influence of assimilation on sm simulation during winter cropping season k s test is performed between noda and assimilated result the sm estimated are evaluated at a spatial resolution of quarter degree model resolution for a duration of three years fig 2 a represents k s d for noda and asc assimilated sm similarly fig 2 b depicts k s d between noda and smos ic while fig 2 c shows k s d between noda and cci it should be noted that these results are depicted for only those locations where the null hypothesis for the k s test is rejected the smaller d close to zero values indicate no difference between the distribution of noda and assimilated sm products as this analysis is performed during the winter cropping season irrigation is the major factor responsible for the difference in sm after assimilation which is owing to the absence of precipitation factor as except for the southern peninsula no other region receives rainfall during this season hence the positive d values fig 2 indicate possible spatial artifacts caused due to the application of irrigation which matches the spatial pattern of irrigated pixels as shown in fig 1 a the point to be noted here is that application of irrigation is not the only reason for large d values it can occur owing to various factors such as due to change in sensitivity of satellite sm products uncertainty in retrieval algorithm and forcing data and model discrepancies uncertainty in auxiliary files however as we are comparing the sm estimates from the same model hence the contribution from the model and forcing uncertainties can be neglected in order to eliminate the impact due to the retreating monsoon in southern india only the northern part of india as highlighted with solid black boundary line in fig 1 b hereafter referred as irrigated regions is considered for further irrigation analysis further in order to confirm that the application of irrigation is responsible for higher k s d over the irrigated region we compare the time series plots for sm from remote sensing products and noda the first step in this analysis is to normalize all sm products using standard score approach for an equivalent comparison scale the normalized sm products are then averaged for irrigated pixels for three years as shown in fig 3 a the noise in satellite soil moisture products ascat and smos ic is reduced by applying a five day moving average the noda indicates a rapid drop in sm after monsoon season for all three years as shown in fig 3 a however the sm observations indicate a steady sm during the irrigation period particularly during november december for all three years fig 3 a indicates that all three sm products are wetter during irrigation season winter crop while it has a dry bias as compared to noda during monsoon season the dry bias in sm observations during monsoon season jjas will be discussed in the subsequent session from these results it appears that smos ic continuously shows a wet bias during the irrigation period as compared to ascat and esa cci sm to further evaluate the effect of sm assimilation on the noah lsm simulation trend a time series is plotted between the assimilated sm products and the noda results fig 3b during the winter cropping season 1 i e october 2010 march 2011 noda has higher sm from october till the first half of dec fig 3b as compared to the assimilated product however assimilated products indicate a dry sm condition for this period after december the assimilated sm increases as compared to noda this can be mainly attributed to the impact of irrigation while the initial wet condition in noda can be attributed to the high sm during the monsoon season which is analyzed in the subsequent section during winter cropping season 2 i e october 2011 march 2012 it is observed that noda sm estimates indicate a rapid decline in the sm after monsoon season while the assimilation products have a constant sm condition during irrigation period and declines after jan 2012 therefore fig 3 supports our claim that the assimilation improves the sm condition during the irrigation period as compared the improvement is particularly prominent over the dry year october december 2012 indicating the efficiency of assimilation to increase sm during the irrigation period fig 3 b the sm estimates from assimilation experiment is further analyzed using triple collocation tc technique as explained in section 3 2 for this analysis four different tc analysis are initialized using six different sm products as summarized in table 3 the tc analysis is performed on data during two winter crop seasons from 2010 to 2012 as the modeled sm estimates in the triplets gldas and merra do not include irrigation component the assimilated sm products will indicate a higher error and low correlation over irrigated regions in tc analysis kolassa et al 2017 this is evaluated by estimating fractional rmse frmse as proposed by draper et al 2013 fig 4 depicts the frmse values of sm products derived from tc analysis the noda sm product shows lowest frmse fig 4a in the irrigated regions during the winter cropping season while it increases after sm assimilation fig 4b d the increase in frmse is particularly prominent over the highly irrigated regions highlighted with black boundary the asc assimilation fig 4c performs better in term of the widest frmse spread throughout the irrigated region as compared to smos fig 4b and cci fig 4d this can be attributed to the lowest footprint size of ascat sensor as compared to all other products considered in this study these results are further compared with the squared correlation coefficient r2 mccoll et al 2017 kolassa et al 2017 the results of r2 fig 5 captures the impact of irrigation after assimilation the noda case fig 5a indicates high correlation with gldas and clsm sm over the irrigated region this is owing to the lack of irrigation component in all these products the assimilated results from asc fig 5b smos fig 5c cci fig 5d indicate the lowest correlation over the irrigated regions this shows the efficiency of the tc method to capture the impact of irrigation after assimilation with high error and low correlation as the sm during the initial period of winter cropping season is highly influenced by the preceding monsoon season an overestimation of precipitation forcing can indicate wet sm condition during the beginning of the winter cropping season as observed in fig 2 b hence the second objective of our study is crucial and highly linked to the first objective in order to evaluate this we compare the variation in gdas precipitation forcing and imd precipitation observation along with sm products from assimilation and noda 4 2 improvement in spatial artifacts due to precipitation uncertainty fig 6 indicates the time series of sm products noda asc smos ic and cci and bias in gdas precipitation over the irrigated region during the beginning of 2010 monsoon gdas has underestimated precipitation as compared to imd hence during this period assimilation increases the sm as compared to noda fig 6a while for the remaining monsoon season of 2010 gdas has a positive bias in precipitation hence the assimilation reduces the sm as compared to noda similar results can be observed for 2011 fig 6b during 2012 monsoon fig 6c the gdas precipitation has a negative bias for the majority of the days due to this assimilation of sm increases the moisture to compensate for the reduced moisture condition due to precipitation forcing further for a detailed analysis of gdas precipitation it is validated with imd data as described in section 3 3 fig 7 represents the values of indices over the study period it is observed that the gdas precipitation has higher vfar over india throughout the study period additionally it indicates high values of volumetric misses over the southern states and rajasthan the significant point to be noted here is that the gdas precipitation has an overall positive bias as indicated in fig 7a c i owing to this the assimilation of sm observations reduce the sm as compared to wetter noda estimates fig 3b further from fig 7 c g k it can be observed that gdas precipitation has high vfar in the central and southeastern coast of india in order to further quantify the improvement in sm assimilation with uncertainty in precipitation the tc approach is used to compute rmse during monsoon season fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the mean miss index and vmi for three years which signifies the missing rainfall events by gdas precipitation fig 9 shows the rmse in sm obtained from tc during the monsoon season of three years it can be observed that noda fig 9a has high rmse this pattern matches with the mean miss index as shown in fig 8 a after asc assimilation fig 9b the rmse is reduced considerably similarly assimilation of smos ic fig 9d reduces the rmse over pixels with high miss index however assimilation of cci indicates minimal improvement as it indicates high rmse fig 9 c this can be attributed to the retrieval approach used for cci sm where its cdf is matched with the noah gldas sm the present study evaluates the performance of sm assimilation to improve the uncertainty in sm owing to the incorrect precipitation artifacts for this evaluation the surface layer soil moisture is compared after one day of missing a rainfall event by gdas since the surface layer has a direct and quick response to rainfall the assimilation should increase sm than noda estimates although it has a complex hydrological process involving evapotranspiration and surface temperature we assume that the immediate impact of missing precipitation will be maximum on surface layer soil moisture fig 10 depicts the sm condition for the 3rd of june 2010 it is observed that gdas fig 10 b fails to capture rainfall over the state of maharashtra which is captured by the imd rain gauges fig 10 a this rainfall has resulted in high surface sm over regions of maharashtra as captured in ascat fig 10 c and cci fig 10 e however the smos ic swath fails to capture the high moisture fig 10 d therefore assimilation ascat fig 10 g and cci fig 10 i has increased sm over missed rainfall region as compared to noda case fig 10 f similarly during 15th june 2011 it is observed that gdas fig 11 b shows rainfall over the same region in maharashtra which is not present in imd rain gauges fig 11 a however ascat fig 11 c has no observation over the region while cci fig 11 e indicates a drier patch over the region the noda case fig 11 f shows wet condition over the entire maharashtra which is reduced after cci assimilation fig 11 i 5 summary the present study aims to evaluate the performance of three different soil moisture sm products to improve the land surface model lsm simulation skill the sm products used are namely active satellite based ascat passive satellite based smos ic and blended multi satellite product from esa cci v4 2 which are assimilated into the noah lsm the performance of assimilated products is assessed focusing on two crucial and linked objectives the first objective evaluates the performance of sm products to improve the irrigation effect in lsm and the second objective evaluates the improvement in sm assimilation during ambiguous precipitation forcing seasonal irrigation changes the sm distribution of the region the impact of irrigation is most prominent in the study region as it consists of the northwestern aquifer which indicates tremendous decline in groundwater due to irrigation the satellite sm products detect this irrigation features which can be assimilated into lsm that does not consider irrigation effect it should be noted that irrigation is not the only cause of high kolmogorov smirnov k s statistic d however the seasonal analysis of results indicate irrigation as the primary reason for the variation in sm this study verifies the effectiveness of sm products to capture irrigation features in assimilated products the results indicate a similar performance from all three soil moisture products ascat smos ic and cci though ascat and smos ic perform slightly better than cci in some analysis especially in rmse of sm during monsoon each of these products have its own advantages such as ascat has the smallest footprint size hence efficient in capturing smaller irrigated fields smos captures data with l band sensor highest sensitivity to the surface sm and esa cci has the highest temporal resolution suitable to capture highly dynamic events the second objective of this study evaluates the performance of sm products to improve spatial artifacts due to precipitation uncertainty for this the assimilated products are compared to standard lsm simulations from these results it can be concluded that ascat and smos ic assimilation skillfully corrects the uncertainty in sm caused due to an error in precipitation forcing in addition to these it can be concluded that the larger temporal samples in cci are more effective to capture uncertainty in precipitation over a larger area compared to other sm products this analysis is a qualitative analysis indicating areas showing prominent impact the future works are planned to quantitatively compare with in situ sm once data are available it is concluded from this study that ascat based active sm and smos ic sm products have the high ability to improve lsm simulations but they are affected by longer repeat cycles resulting in low spatial samples in temporal scales similarly blended cci sm also effectively captures irrigation and precipitation forcing uncertainty however the cdf matching of combined cci during final stages of sm generation affects the sm climatology hence it is proposed that new blended products should be generated without projecting it to any particular lsm climatology acknowledgments authors thank sujay v kumar and james geiger of nasa gsfc for initial setup of the lis framework over india

like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for constructive suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript this work was supported by the department of science and technology india under the early career project ecr 2016 001559 appendix a variability of noah soil moisture estimates with first layer depth the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of different sm products to improve the model and forcing uncertainties through assimilation these products stem from different sensor frequencies such as ascat c band smos ic l band and esa cci merged multi satellite product as different frequencies are sensitive to different depths it is crucial to find the first layer depth of noah land surface model lsm before assimilation as the previous study by shellito et al 2018 2016 indicated low sensitivity of layer depth in sm simulation but previous studies were conducted by changing depth to 5 cm which is sensitive depth of the smos sensor however ascat is sensitive to shallower depth 2 cm therefore here we evaluate the impact of layer depth on sm simulation by changing the first layer depth to 2 cm sensitive depth of ascat fig a1 a indicates a time series of sm for 2 cm and 10 cm first layer depth for a duration of three years from 2010 to 2011 this figure shows that both the layer depths follow the same pattern the only difference is observed during a dry down period where 2 cm layer has low sm compared to 10 cm layer however the bias is around 0 03 m3 m3 which is lesser than the accuracy of satellite sm products smos accuracy 0 04 m3 m3 fig a1 b indicates a spatial pattern of percentage bias in sm when changed to 2 cm from 10 cm it can be observed that the majority of the region have bias less than 5 except few areas in rajasthan having a bias of 9 and a few regions in central india at 7 furthermore fig a 1 c provides rmse between sm simulation at 2 cm depth and 10 cm depth it shows that maximum error is of around 0 04 similarly the 2 cm layer standard deviation fig a 1d and 10 cm layer standard deviation fig a 1e follows similar spatial patterns therefore from this study it can be concluded that changing the first layer depth to 2 cm has minimal impact on sm simulation of noah lsm this has motivated the authors to keep the first layer depth to a standard depth of 10 cm for all assimilation experiment 
6522,realistic representation of surface states using the land surface model lsm is extremely challenging owing to human induced changes and uncertainty in forcing data in this study we focus on two crucial objectives pertaining to hydrology namely a to understand the ability of different soil moisture sm products to improve simulation of unmodeled irrigation processes through data assimilation process and b to learn the feasibility of these sm products to correct the spatial surface soil moisture artifacts caused due to error in precipitation forcing the utility of sm products evaluated in the present study are retrieved from different satellite sensors and algorithms such as the active satellite based the advanced scatterometer ascat merged sm from european space agency climate change initiative esa cci v4 2 and the latest passive microwave based smos inra cesbio smos ic sm product the results presented for three years 2010 2011 and 2012 suggest that assimilation of ascat and cci based products effectively captures the sm changes due to irrigation similarly it corrects the spatial artifacts caused due to precipitation errors however the single sensor based products have a limitation in spatial samples per day which is critical to capture dynamic sm products over a larger area hence blended products are more effective on a larger area to capture the dynamics in a more effective manner at daily temporal resolutions keywords land data assimilation soil moisture ascat smos ic esa cci 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a crucial surface state variable that plays a decisive role in the exchange of water and energy fluxes over the land and atmospheric continuum it has a prominent influence on various climate processes like precipitation koster et al 2004 crow et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2017 aghakouchak et al 2012 air temperature miralles et al 2014 stream flow and groundwater nair and indu 2018a ahmed et al 2016 this is mainly as sm dictates the partitioning of rainfall to infiltration and runoff botter et al 2007 orth and seneviratne 2013 salvucci 2001 and segregates incident energy to latent and sensible heat fluxes koster et al 2004 liu et al 2014 the persistent sm memory also has a huge effect on the forecast skill of droughts luo and wood 2007 floods parinussa et al 2016 heat waves miralles et al 2014 and thunderstorms mccoll et al 2017 an accurate assessment of prevailing sm condition remains critical in long range and seasonal numerical weather forecasts dirmeyer and halder 2016 koster et al 2004 in particular the root zone sm is extremely important for crop yield forecasting agricultural drought monitoring adegoke and carleton 2002 bolten et al 2010 han et al 2014 wang et al 2007 water resources management and climate studies chen et al 1996 liang et al 1994 sellers et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2005 past four decades have witnessed the evolution of microwave remote sensing as a promising source of global sm estimates nair and indu 2018b karthikeyan et al 2017a b these sm estimates rely on low frequency microwave observations owing to its high sensitivity to dielectric properties of the soil water medium and low attenuation from atmosphere vegetation some of the widely used satellite sm products are the advanced scatterometer ascat aboard meteorological operational metop satellites wagner et al 2013 multi frequency polarimetric microwave radiometer windsat aboard coriolis satellite gaiser et al 2004 advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 aboard aqua satellite advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 aboard the global change observation mission water gcom w satellite soil moisture ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2010 and the soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 the availability of these sm estimates have led to blended multi satellite sm products such as the soil moisture operational products system smops liu et al 2012 nair and indu 2016 and the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci there exist studies which have simulated sm vertical profiles at various depths using land surface models lsm and near surface atmospheric forcing data the modeling community and hydrologists greatly rely on lsms to recreate complex interactions between land and near surface atmosphere rodell et al 2004 which can estimate water and energy fluxes at high spatial resolution zaitchik et al 2010 though lsms estimate surface state variables at high spatiotemporal resolution they are subjected to uncertainties in forcing data improper parameterization and inadequate physical processes representations to facilitate regional scale studies efforts have been conducted to use data assimilation da techniques to improve lsm simulations using remote sensing data kumar et al 2014 lievens et al 2015a b nair and indu 2016 tian et al 2010 as well as on global scale liu and mishra 2017 reichle and koster 2005 rodell et al 2004 zhao et al 2016 most lsms are limited in their representation of human engineered unmodeled processes like irrigation kumar et al 2015 lawston et al 2017 brocca et al 2018 in order to overcome this studies have utilized data assimilation da technique to constrain lsm with remote sensing based sm observations de lannoy and reichle 2016 lievens et al 2015a b the study by kumar et al 2015 indicate remote sensing as a promising source to improve irrigation processes but bias correction technique is a major limiting factor to use remote sensing observations to correct for unmodeled processes on the other hand a recent study by blankenship et al 2018 indicated that assimilation of sm corrects the spatial artifacts caused due to uncertain precipitation which has motivated us to formulate two crucial and linked objectives which are a improving the simulation of unmodeled traditional irrigation processes over india and b correcting sm error caused due to the lsm forcing uncertainty related to precipitation spatial artifacts in this study we check the effect of da on three different sm products namely the active scatterometer based sm from ascat the passive radiometer based sm from smos ic and multi satellite blended sm from esa cci v4 2 these products are adopted for assimilation experiments in order to learn the ability of different sensor frequencies to furnish our objectives i e ascat sm is retrieved from c band sensors while smos ic relies on l band sensors similarly it will provide further insight into the impact of sensor footprint on sm assimilation as ascat has a higher footprint 25 km compared to coarser smos footprint 40 km further the third product esa cci is selected in order to verify the utility of blended sm product this is important as blended products have the highest temporal and spatial samples compared to single sensor sm products 2 model and data description 2 1 noah lsm the present study relies on version 3 6 of noah model mitchell 2004 to simulate land surface states over the indian subcontinent similar to nair and indu 2016 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 it relies on the modified penman monteith equation to estimate the diurnal variation of the atmospheric resistance coefficient chen et al 1996 mahrt and ek 1984 this model has a four layer configuration for sm and temperature extending to a total depth of 2 m from the surface to bottom the soil layer depths are set at 10 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 100 cm so as to capture the daily weekly and seasonal evolution of sm chen and dudhia 2001 as such surface layer estimates from model represents the sm from the first 10 cm which is deeper than the monitoring depth of satellite based sensors some of the previous studies have evaluated the effect of changing the noah first layer depth from 10 cm to 5 cm they have suggested that reducing the first layer depth has minimal impact on the sm estimation and that the difference between observed sm from remote sensing and simulated sm from lsm can be attributed to the lsm model structure rather than the difference in their depth shellito et al 2018 2016 however these studies pertain to surface layer depth sensitive to l band sensors such as smos and smap hence before assimilation we evaluate the variability in simulated sm after changing it to shallower depth 2 cm from default configuration of 10 cm it should be noted that this analysis is performed at 2 cm owing to its proximity to the sensitivity of c band sensor ascat the result from our analysis indicates a minor change less than 4 over the majority of regions as compared sm from 10 cm layer in sm when first layer depth is reduced to 2 cm a further detailed discussion of this analysis is provided in appendix a from our analysis and previous studies it can be inferred that the change in surface layer depth first layer of noah lsm has a nominal impact on soil moisture considering all these points and to maintain a uniform global land data assimilation system gldas model configuration for intercomparison of assimilation products the present study adopts the standard model setup first layer depth of 10 cm further we have adopted a model time step of 15 min for all simulations with output at every one hour this configuration is most suitable to assimilate different soil moisture products at their instantaneous overpasses the noah lsm for the present study is initialized by multi year spinup by repeated forcing from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2010 for seven times which is equivalent to 21 years simulation the forcing data for this study stems from gldas enhanced ncep s global data assimilation system gdas derber et al 1991 2 2 soil moisture dataset description the present study examines the feasibility of different sm products to improve model efficiency in terms of un modeled irrigation as well as correction for uncertainty in precipitation forcing a brief description of the sm products used in the present study is given below these products are selected with an aim to compare the assimilation skill of passive smos active ascat and merged sm esa cci products to improve lsm simulations 2 2 1 passive low frequency microwave based smos ic sm the soil moisture estimates from soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission are extracted from multi angular brightness temperatures at l band 1 4 ghz kerr et al 2010 the conventional operational smos level 2 and level 3 algorithms rely on auxiliary files to produce global soil retrieval maps they further account for correction in antenna pattern and smos viewing geometry such auxiliary files and processes add to the uncertainty in sm retrievals however in this study we use the latest smos product from inra institut national de la recherche agronomique and cesbio center d etudes spatiakes de la biosph e r e in this product the sub pixel heterogeneity is neglected in order to avoid uncertainties associated with auxiliary files fernandez moran et al 2017a b wigneron et al 2007 the smos ic product has a similar spatio temporal resolution as that of operational smos level 2 sm product 2 2 2 active microwave based ascat sm the ascat mission relies on three c band 5 2 ghz real aperture radars with vertical polarization configuration to monitor land surface processes the crucial objective of ascat is to monitor global wind direction however it has been efficiently used to monitor surface sm owing to its high sensitivity figa salda√±a et al 2002 the real aperture radar of ascat mission has a soil penetration depth of 1 3 cm depending on soil and atmospheric conditions it has an improved revisit time of fewer than 2 days and a spatial resolution of 25 km for the present study ascat data also stems from smops liu et al 2012 2 2 3 blended multi satellite esa cci sm to evaluate the assimilation skill of blended sm products the present study utilizes esa s cci v4 2 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 combined sm products they are obtained by merging different microwave products captured in the active e g scat ascat and passive systems e g smmr ssm i tmi amsr e smos windsat amsr2 smos lprm aquarius smap the merged products are available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 on the gldas v1 0 noah climatology the 4 2 version of cci sm adopts a more advanced and quality controlled data merging technique with additional information as compared to the older versions used by kumar et al 2015 3 da experimental methodology the lsm estimates of hydrometeorological variables are known to contain uncertainties due to forcing data and model components some of the previous studies have addressed this issue by calibrating the lsm parameters franks and beven 1999 franks et al 1997 crow 2003 corbari et al 2010 gutmann and small 2010 corbari and mancini 2014 mishra et al 2017 however such methods rely on one variable which has minimal impact on the overall simulation skill of lsm gupta et al 1999 moreover the uncertainty in observations used for calibration can result in unrealistic parameters by assimilating remote sensing observations within lsm the model prognostic variables e g sm get updated with respect to observations the improvement in the prognostic variables through assimilation will be propagated to other hydrometeorological variables through model physics the present study examines through da the performance of different sm products to improve the model simulation skills 3 1 assimilation setup and analysis tools the initialized noah lsm is simulated for a period of 3 years from 2010 to 2012 hereafter referred to as study period as described in section 2 1 the sm is estimated in 4 soil layers in order to improve the prediction skill of lsm first layer sm is involved directly in the da technique the daily sm products during the study period are assimilated to improve surface sm of noah lsm with 1 dimensional ensemble kalman filter enkf reichle et al 2002 reichle and koster 2004 in the present study nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 is used to set up the enkf assimilation framework the enkf algorithm is a sequential assimilation approach which alternates between model forecast stage and state update stage during the update stage model states are updated using sm observations based on the kalman gain factor reichle et al 2002 kumar et al 2009 2012 this depends on the model forecast error variances calculated from the model ensemble for this 30 ensembles of the model forecast are generated by imposing random gaussian parameters with zero mean and cross correlations in perturbation of precipitation and radiation field as shown in table 1 additive gaussian noise is added to model prognostic variables with vertical correlations for deeper layers these parameters are based on a study by nair and indu 2016 since this study adopts the one dimensional approach of enkf no spatial correlations are applied furthermore before assimilation all preliminary analysis indicated that no systematic bias is introduced into the model simulations owing to error parameter configuration in table 1 the da methods rely on the critical assumption of an unbiased model and observation states however owing to different approaches of observation sensor frequencies and retrieval algorithms the sm observations are biased with respect to model simulations hence in the present study all three soil moisture products are preprocessed for bias correction by using cdf matching technique the observation bias with respect to lsm simulation is removed using a lumped cdf pixel wise one cdf for entire year matching technique reichle and koster 2004 reichle et al 2007 kumar et al 2009 draper et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 nair and indu 2016 as indicated in the study by kumar et al 2015 a lumped cdf matching technique captures the irrigation signals at the cost of a dry bias condition in the non irrigation period this bias correction method is adopted over other techniques as over the majority of the indian states irrigation is carried out for most of the months further the low sampling frequency and high radio frequency interference rfi of smos observations add to the problem of computing monthly cdf for all pixels in the study region hence lumped cdf technique is the optimal approach for bias correction in this case the sm observations are not assimilated into lsm in the case of a snow cover or when the surface temperature is below freezing point b when the pixel is covered with dense vegetation c when no convergence is observed in combined sm product data quality flag further the sm observations are perturbed with random gaussian noise with parameters as given in table 2 in order to have effective assimilation it is verified that the distribution for normalized innovations follows a zero mean and unit standard deviation four different experimental setups are conducted to check the performance of sm assimilation the details of each are as follows a noda for this setup noah lsm is simulated for the study period with a standard setting without any assimilation b asc in this setup ascat based sm observations are assimilated into noah lsm for the study period c smos ic during this setup the smos ic sm retrievals are assimilated into noah lsm for the study period d cci in this setup esa cci v4 2 combined active passive sm observations are assimilated into noah lsm for the study period 3 2 evaluation of sm assimilation results triple collocation the first objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of different sm products to improve simulation of irrigation effects the results from this assimilation experiments are evaluated using triple collocation tc approach stoffelen 1998 in this approach three mutually independent measurements are used to compute unknown error standard deviations the main advantage of this approach is that it does not require any measurement as true the tc approach relies on a linear error model such that the error models are uncorrelated with each other this approach has been widely used in the field of oceanography stoffelen 1998 caires and sterl 2003 o carroll et al 2008 gentemann 2014 hydrology roebeling et al 2012 and particularly in sm studies nair and indu 2016 draper et al 2013 anderson et al 2012 scipal et al 2008 the tc furnish a reliable platform for comparison of da results independent of in situ soil moisture observations in order to have independent datasets and avoid correlated errors crucial assumptions in tc this study utilizes five sm products for tc analysis as summarized in table 3 the surface sm products used for analysis stems from merra land gldas clsm noda asc smos ic and cci here the last four soil moisture sources are simulated noah sm and assimilated sms respectively obtained from the present study for the analysis the first two soil moisture products are kept same while the third product is replaced with the noda and other three assimilated sm results this approach evaluates assimilation skill within the same reference frame detailed analysis of results from tc is provided in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the second focus of this study is to evaluate the utility of sm products to improve spatial artifacts caused due to precipitation uncertainty it is to be noted that the main objective of this analysis is to verify the efficiency of assimilation to improve sm state during missing rainfall events in forcing data rather than the bias in the intensity of rainfall as a preliminary step towards this we have validated gdas precipitation using imd data 3 3 validation of gdas precipitation the precipitation data from gdas are compared with gauge based precipitation provided by imd these are daily rainfall products available at 0 25 0 25 resolution over india which is prepared using the 6955 imd rain gauge stations distributed all over india pai et al 2014 during this analysis performance of gdas daily precipitation is compared with imd data using 2 2 contingency table as shown in table 4 this contingency table helps to capture the hits raining in both datasets misses raining in imd observation but not raining in gdas precipitation and false alarms no rain in imd but rain in gdas precipitation this is used to compute different skill scores including volumetric skill scores aghakouchak and mehran 2013 such as probability of detection pod volumetric false alarm ratio vfar and volumetric miss index vmi as summarized in table 5 here the bias is computed as the difference of gdas and imd precipitation when both the datasets detect rainfall i e during hit cases 4 results the main focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sm products to curb uncertainties from the model unmodeled irrigation process and forcing precipitation in order to evaluate this results are presented for different statistical indices utilizing auxiliary datasets different regions of india receive rainfall mainly during two monsoon seasons which are the summer monsoon where it rains in majority of indian states for four months june july august september and the second is during retreating monsoon october november december where the southern peninsula receives most rainfall krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 nair and indu 2017 hence detecting a single irrigation season for whole india is a challenging task as it rains in southern states when irrigation is performed in northern parts to overcome this issue we selected the winter cropping season october march fig 1 b represents the percentage of pixel area under irrigation between the study period 2010 2012 at a spatial resolution of 1km these datasets represent the modis based enhanced vegetation index evi for the winter crop season jain et al 2017 similarly fig 1 a represents irrigated pixels during the study period 2010 2012 from ambika and mishra 2016 which is obtained using modis ndvi at a spatial resolution of 250 m in order to detect irrigated pixels during the winter season both datasets are merged into 0 25 0 25 and pixels with evi and irrigation area more than 60 is assumed as irrigated 4 1 evaluation of soil moisture over the irrigated region the assimilation skill of different sm products are evaluated using kolmogorov smirnov k s distance d fig 1 c e represents kolmogorov smirnov k s distance d between noda and satellite soil moisture estimates the k s test

distributions of two sample data sets the k s test relies on a null hypothesis that both samples originate from the same source distribution in order to evaluate the ability of the satellite sm products to capture irrigation signals the k s test is performed over sm samples during winter irrigation season the results indicate that all three sm products capture the winter irrigation signals with high k s d values over major irrigation regions as highlighted in fig 1 with a black solid boundary to further evaluate the influence of assimilation on sm simulation during winter cropping season k s test is performed between noda and assimilated result the sm estimated are evaluated at a spatial resolution of quarter degree model resolution for a duration of three years fig 2 a represents k s d for noda and asc assimilated sm similarly fig 2 b depicts k s d between noda and smos ic while fig 2 c shows k s d between noda and cci it should be noted that these results are depicted for only those locations where the null hypothesis for the k s test is rejected the smaller d close to zero values indicate no difference between the distribution of noda and assimilated sm products as this analysis is performed during the winter cropping season irrigation is the major factor responsible for the difference in sm after assimilation which is owing to the absence of precipitation factor as except for the southern peninsula no other region receives rainfall during this season hence the positive d values fig 2 indicate possible spatial artifacts caused due to the application of irrigation which matches the spatial pattern of irrigated pixels as shown in fig 1 a the point to be noted here is that application of irrigation is not the only reason for large d values it can occur owing to various factors such as due to change in sensitivity of satellite sm products uncertainty in retrieval algorithm and forcing data and model discrepancies uncertainty in auxiliary files however as we are comparing the sm estimates from the same model hence the contribution from the model and forcing uncertainties can be neglected in order to eliminate the impact due to the retreating monsoon in southern india only the northern part of india as highlighted with solid black boundary line in fig 1 b hereafter referred as irrigated regions is considered for further irrigation analysis further in order to confirm that the application of irrigation is responsible for higher k s d over the irrigated region we compare the time series plots for sm from remote sensing products and noda the first step in this analysis is to normalize all sm products using standard score approach for an equivalent comparison scale the normalized sm products are then averaged for irrigated pixels for three years as shown in fig 3 a the noise in satellite soil moisture products ascat and smos ic is reduced by applying a five day moving average the noda indicates a rapid drop in sm after monsoon season for all three years as shown in fig 3 a however the sm observations indicate a steady sm during the irrigation period particularly during november december for all three years fig 3 a indicates that all three sm products are wetter during irrigation season winter crop while it has a dry bias as compared to noda during monsoon season the dry bias in sm observations during monsoon season jjas will be discussed in the subsequent session from these results it appears that smos ic continuously shows a wet bias during the irrigation period as compared to ascat and esa cci sm to further evaluate the effect of sm assimilation on the noah lsm simulation trend a time series is plotted between the assimilated sm products and the noda results fig 3b during the winter cropping season 1 i e october 2010 march 2011 noda has higher sm from october till the first half of dec fig 3b as compared to the assimilated product however assimilated products indicate a dry sm condition for this period after december the assimilated sm increases as compared to noda this can be mainly attributed to the impact of irrigation while the initial wet condition in noda can be attributed to the high sm during the monsoon season which is analyzed in the subsequent section during winter cropping season 2 i e october 2011 march 2012 it is observed that noda sm estimates indicate a rapid decline in the sm after monsoon season while the assimilation products have a constant sm condition during irrigation period and declines after jan 2012 therefore fig 3 supports our claim that the assimilation improves the sm condition during the irrigation period as compared the improvement is particularly prominent over the dry year october december 2012 indicating the efficiency of assimilation to increase sm during the irrigation period fig 3 b the sm estimates from assimilation experiment is further analyzed using triple collocation tc technique as explained in section 3 2 for this analysis four different tc analysis are initialized using six different sm products as summarized in table 3 the tc analysis is performed on data during two winter crop seasons from 2010 to 2012 as the modeled sm estimates in the triplets gldas and merra do not include irrigation component the assimilated sm products will indicate a higher error and low correlation over irrigated regions in tc analysis kolassa et al 2017 this is evaluated by estimating fractional rmse frmse as proposed by draper et al 2013 fig 4 depicts the frmse values of sm products derived from tc analysis the noda sm product shows lowest frmse fig 4a in the irrigated regions during the winter cropping season while it increases after sm assimilation fig 4b d the increase in frmse is particularly prominent over the highly irrigated regions highlighted with black boundary the asc assimilation fig 4c performs better in term of the widest frmse spread throughout the irrigated region as compared to smos fig 4b and cci fig 4d this can be attributed to the lowest footprint size of ascat sensor as compared to all other products considered in this study these results are further compared with the squared correlation coefficient r2 mccoll et al 2017 kolassa et al 2017 the results of r2 fig 5 captures the impact of irrigation after assimilation the noda case fig 5a indicates high correlation with gldas and clsm sm over the irrigated region this is owing to the lack of irrigation component in all these products the assimilated results from asc fig 5b smos fig 5c cci fig 5d indicate the lowest correlation over the irrigated regions this shows the efficiency of the tc method to capture the impact of irrigation after assimilation with high error and low correlation as the sm during the initial period of winter cropping season is highly influenced by the preceding monsoon season an overestimation of precipitation forcing can indicate wet sm condition during the beginning of the winter cropping season as observed in fig 2 b hence the second objective of our study is crucial and highly linked to the first objective in order to evaluate this we compare the variation in gdas precipitation forcing and imd precipitation observation along with sm products from assimilation and noda 4 2 improvement in spatial artifacts due to precipitation uncertainty fig 6 indicates the time series of sm products noda asc smos ic and cci and bias in gdas precipitation over the irrigated region during the beginning of 2010 monsoon gdas has underestimated precipitation as compared to imd hence during this period assimilation increases the sm as compared to noda fig 6a while for the remaining monsoon season of 2010 gdas has a positive bias in precipitation hence the assimilation reduces the sm as compared to noda similar results can be observed for 2011 fig 6b during 2012 monsoon fig 6c the gdas precipitation has a negative bias for the majority of the days due to this assimilation of sm increases the moisture to compensate for the reduced moisture condition due to precipitation forcing further for a detailed analysis of gdas precipitation it is validated with imd data as described in section 3 3 fig 7 represents the values of indices over the study period it is observed that the gdas precipitation has higher vfar over india throughout the study period additionally it indicates high values of volumetric misses over the southern states and rajasthan the significant point to be noted here is that the gdas precipitation has an overall positive bias as indicated in fig 7a c i owing to this the assimilation of sm observations reduce the sm as compared to wetter noda estimates fig 3b further from fig 7 c g k it can be observed that gdas precipitation has high vfar in the central and southeastern coast of india in order to further quantify the improvement in sm assimilation with uncertainty in precipitation the tc approach is used to compute rmse during monsoon season fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the mean miss index and vmi for three years which signifies the missing rainfall events by gdas precipitation fig 9 shows the rmse in sm obtained from tc during the monsoon season of three years it can be observed that noda fig 9a has high rmse this pattern matches with the mean miss index as shown in fig 8 a after asc assimilation fig 9b the rmse is reduced considerably similarly assimilation of smos ic fig 9d reduces the rmse over pixels with high miss index however assimilation of cci indicates minimal improvement as it indicates high rmse fig 9 c this can be attributed to the retrieval approach used for cci sm where its cdf is matched with the noah gldas sm the present study evaluates the performance of sm assimilation to improve the uncertainty in sm owing to the incorrect precipitation artifacts for this evaluation the surface layer soil moisture is compared after one day of missing a rainfall event by gdas since the surface layer has a direct and quick response to rainfall the assimilation should increase sm than noda estimates although it has a complex hydrological process involving evapotranspiration and surface temperature we assume that the immediate impact of missing precipitation will be maximum on surface layer soil moisture fig 10 depicts the sm condition for the 3rd of june 2010 it is observed that gdas fig 10 b fails to capture rainfall over the state of maharashtra which is captured by the imd rain gauges fig 10 a this rainfall has resulted in high surface sm over regions of maharashtra as captured in ascat fig 10 c and cci fig 10 e however the smos ic swath fails to capture the high moisture fig 10 d therefore assimilation ascat fig 10 g and cci fig 10 i has increased sm over missed rainfall region as compared to noda case fig 10 f similarly during 15th june 2011 it is observed that gdas fig 11 b shows rainfall over the same region in maharashtra which is not present in imd rain gauges fig 11 a however ascat fig 11 c has no observation over the region while cci fig 11 e indicates a drier patch over the region the noda case fig 11 f shows wet condition over the entire maharashtra which is reduced after cci assimilation fig 11 i 5 summary the present study aims to evaluate the performance of three different soil moisture sm products to improve the land surface model lsm simulation skill the sm products used are namely active satellite based ascat passive satellite based smos ic and blended multi satellite product from esa cci v4 2 which are assimilated into the noah lsm the performance of assimilated products is assessed focusing on two crucial and linked objectives the first objective evaluates the performance of sm products to improve the irrigation effect in lsm and the second objective evaluates the improvement in sm assimilation during ambiguous precipitation forcing seasonal irrigation changes the sm distribution of the region the impact of irrigation is most prominent in the study region as it consists of the northwestern aquifer which indicates tremendous decline in groundwater due to irrigation the satellite sm products detect this irrigation features which can be assimilated into lsm that does not consider irrigation effect it should be noted that irrigation is not the only cause of high kolmogorov smirnov k s statistic d however the seasonal analysis of results indicate irrigation as the primary reason for the variation in sm this study verifies the effectiveness of sm products to capture irrigation features in assimilated products the results indicate a similar performance from all three soil moisture products ascat smos ic and cci though ascat and smos ic perform slightly better than cci in some analysis especially in rmse of sm during monsoon each of these products have its own advantages such as ascat has the smallest footprint size hence efficient in capturing smaller irrigated fields smos captures data with l band sensor highest sensitivity to the surface sm and esa cci has the highest temporal resolution suitable to capture highly dynamic events the second objective of this study evaluates the performance of sm products to improve spatial artifacts due to precipitation uncertainty for this the assimilated products are compared to standard lsm simulations from these results it can be concluded that ascat and smos ic assimilation skillfully corrects the uncertainty in sm caused due to an error in precipitation forcing in addition to these it can be concluded that the larger temporal samples in cci are more effective to capture uncertainty in precipitation over a larger area compared to other sm products this analysis is a qualitative analysis indicating areas showing prominent impact the future works are planned to quantitatively compare with in situ sm once data are available it is concluded from this study that ascat based active sm and smos ic sm products have the high ability to improve lsm simulations but they are affected by longer repeat cycles resulting in low spatial samples in temporal scales similarly blended cci sm also effectively captures irrigation and precipitation forcing uncertainty however the cdf matching of combined cci during final stages of sm generation affects the sm climatology hence it is proposed that new blended products should be generated without projecting it to any particular lsm climatology acknowledgments authors thank sujay v kumar and james geiger of nasa gsfc for initial setup of the lis framework over india authors acknowledge hiroko kato beaudoing of gldas team for processing gdas data the authors would like to thank pierre emmanuel kirstetter for an insightful discussion of results authors would also like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for constructive suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript this work was supported by the department of science and technology india under the early career project ecr 2016 001559 appendix a variability of noah soil moisture estimates with first layer depth the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of different sm products to improve the model and forcing uncertainties through assimilation these products stem from different sensor frequencies such as ascat c band smos ic l band and esa cci merged multi satellite product as different frequencies are sensitive to different depths it is crucial to find the first layer depth of noah land surface model lsm before assimilation as the previous study by shellito et al 2018 2016 indicated low sensitivity of layer depth in sm simulation but previous studies were conducted by changing depth to 5 cm which is sensitive depth of the smos sensor however ascat is sensitive to shallower depth 2 cm therefore here we evaluate the impact of layer depth on sm simulation by changing the first layer depth to 2 cm sensitive depth of ascat fig a1 a indicates a time series of sm for 2 cm and 10 cm first layer depth for a duration of three years from 2010 to 2011 this figure shows that both the layer depths follow the same pattern the only difference is observed during a dry down period where 2 cm layer has low sm compared to 10 cm layer however the bias is around 0 03 m3 m3 which is lesser than the accuracy of satellite sm products smos accuracy 0 04 m3 m3 fig a1 b indicates a spatial pattern of percentage bias in sm when changed to 2 cm from 10 cm it can be observed that the majority of the region have bias less than 5 except few areas in rajasthan having a bias of 9 and a few regions in central india at 7 furthermore fig a 1 c provides rmse between sm simulation at 2 cm depth and 10 cm depth it shows that maximum error is of around 0 04 similarly the 2 cm layer standard deviation fig a 1d and 10 cm layer standard deviation fig a 1e follows similar spatial patterns therefore from this study it can be concluded that changing the first layer depth to 2 cm has minimal impact on sm simulation of noah lsm this has motivated the authors to keep the first layer depth to a standard depth of 10 cm for all assimilation experiment 
6523,protecting karst aquifers from nitrate contamination is an issue of global concern due to the inherent vulnerability of karst aquifers to contamination and the negative health effects of elevated nitrate levels hydrological and transport models were developed to assess nitrate transport within a karstic aquifer located in an area with both semi arid and sub humid climate conditions groundwater flow through the aquifer matrix and conduits was simulated with cfpv2 an experimental version of the conduit flow process cfp version of the modular flow modflow groundwater model nitrate transport was simulated with the experimental conduit mass transport three dimensional model cmt3d the hydrologic calibration of the steady state model was successful based on a scaled root mean squared error rmse of 4 9 for hydraulic heads and percent errors of 3 0 and 6 6 for the two major springs in the area performance of the transient hydrologic model exceeded the performance of the existing equivalent porous media epm model with a scaled rmse of 2 2 and springflow errors of 1 5 and 2 8 for the major springs similarly nitrate calibration was successful with all percent bias pbias values between 25 additional calibration statistics including a two tailed t test indicated successful calibration the cmt3d model corroborates prior research findings that anthropogenic sources as well as biogenic wastes are important sources of nitrate to the aquifer the methodology used in this study represents an additional tool for watershed managers to address nitrate contamination within karst aquifers keywords karst hydrology conduit flow process conduit mass transport three dimensional groundwater transport modeling nitrate 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater is an international concern because of its prevalence in both urban and agricultural areas mobility in the environment and negative health effects sources of nitrogen include animal manure human wastewater fertilizers and atmospheric deposition this nitrogen typically enters waterways in the form of nitrate as evidenced by an assessment of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs in the united states and europe that found when anthropogenic nitrogen inputs exceed 1070 kg n km 2 yr 1 25 of the nitrogen will reach surface waters howarth et al 2012 discharges of nitrate to surface waters are of particular concern in regions with karst aquifers because surface waters can rapidly infiltrate the aquifer through karst features such as sinkholes leading to aquifer contamination with 25 of available groundwater stored in karst aquifers green et al 2006 the potential for nitrate contamination of karst aquifers is of global importance there have been numerous assessments of karst aquifer vulnerability to nitrate contamination throughout the world the chunnakam aquifer system in sri lanka was found to have a high vulnerability when using the drastic method vithanage et al 2014 an assessment of aquifer vulnerability in spain using the drastic method classified two karst aquifers as high vulnerability to nitrate contamination stigter et al 2005 interestingly however in this area groundwater tends to be recycled through extraction irrigation return flow and extraction again the rapid infiltration of surface waters to the karst aquifers limited this recycling effect and resulted in comparatively less nitrate contamination in the karst aquifers stigter et al 2005 finally an evaluation of the edwards aquifer in texas usa found the region dominated by areas of very high vulnerability to nitrate contamination sullivan and gao 2017 evaluations of nitrate sources within karst aquifers typically rely on isotopic and chemical analyses of nitrate samples one study in an agricultural watershed in illinois usa identified nitrogen fertilizer as the largest contributor of aquifer nitrate followed by atmospheric nitrogen and to a lesser extent animal waste panno et al 2001 in southwest china researchers also identified agricultural activities as the predominant source of aquifer nitrate but found the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen to be negligible yang et al 2013 diffuse agricultural sources were identified as the predominant cause of nitrate contamination in the barrow valley of southeast ireland minet et al 2017 isotopic signatures of nitrate in the kljuƒç aquifer of serbia identified nitrification of organic soil nitrogen and animal or human wastes as the major source of aquifer nitrate miljeviƒá et al 2012 an assessment of nitrogen loading in the upper floridan aquifer in florida usa identified the predominant source of aquifer nitrate levels in urban areas to be septic systems and fertilizer use while sources in agricultural areas were predominately animal waste and farm fertilizer use eller and katz 2017 high temporal resolution studies have assessed nitrate levels in karst aquifers in response to rainfall events a study in an agricultural area north of cork ireland found spring nitrate concentrations were influenced by hydrological conditions nitrate availability and karst feature development huebsch et al 2014 a study analyzed nitrate concentrations in wells of the edwards aquifer in texas usa and found nitrate concentrations increased in a rural well during recharge events while nitrate concentrations decreased in an urban well during recharge events opsahl et al 2017 one method to link aquifer vulnerability to nitrate source inputs is through groundwater contaminant transport modeling the first step in this process is to conduct hydrological modeling previous efforts at hydrological modeling in karst aquifers often relied on equivalent porous media epm models where karst features are modelled as high conductivity cells lindgren et al 2004 davis et al 2010 this approach was improved upon with the development of modflow cfp because it is able to simulate turbulent flow within discrete conduits as well as laminar flow through the matrix an early test of modflow cfp found it improved spring discharge estimates by 12 for a large spring and 40 for a small spring hill et al 2010 an epm model of the madison aquifer in south dakota usa was converted to modflow cfp with the modflow cfp model substantially improving estimates of hydraulic head saller et al 2013 in another study researchers found modflow cfp was more accurate than an epm at simulating peak spring flow and total discharge from springs in the woodville karst plain of florida usa gallegos et al 2013 despite the successful application of modflow cfp at simulating hydrological conditions it does not support contaminant transport modeling shoemaker et al 2008 this is one of the reasons comparatively few studies have assessed nitrate fate and transport within karst aquifers a water balance model for a karstic aquifer in okinawa japan simulated nitrate concentrations at the sub basin scale to assess the impact of dam construction yoshimoto et al 2011 modflow and the modular 3 dimentional transport multi species mt3dms contaminant transport model were used to assess nitrogen management strategies in the volusia blue spring area of the floridan aquifer in florida usa reed et al 2018 similarly modflow and mt3dms models were part of a hydro economic model assessing fertilizer standards in a portion of spain to lower nitrate values in the groundwater of the mancha oriental system pe√±a haro et al 2010 further study of the mancha oriental system involved using the output from a soil water assessment tool swat surface water model as input to modflow and mt3dms models to assess climate and land use change effects on groundwater quality pulido velazquez et al 2015 finally an experimental version of modflow conduit flow process version 2 cfpv2 coupled with three dimensional underground mine transport model umt3d spiessl et al 2007 was used to evaluate nitrate movement through the aquifer matrix as well as karst conduits in the woodville karst plain of northern florida usa xu et al 2015 while in some cases these studies evaluated different nitrate sources they were not linked to vulnerability assessments of the study areas furthermore the last study is the only one to directly model nitrate transport within karst conduits conceptualized as pipes rather than highly conductive cells this is due to the unique challenges of modelling contaminant transport in karst aquifers caused by the difficulty in identifying the location and size of karst features and the presence of turbulent flow within karst conduits ghasemizadeh et al 2012 the challenge in estimating conduit size was demonstrated through a process based model of a hypothetical karst system which showed that conduit volume estimates generated from traditional methods overestimated conduit size by up to a factor of 1 5 birk et al 2006 the current study assesses watershed nitrate inputs based on natural and anthropogenic source categories in a semi arid to sub humid karst area through the use of output from a swat model in conjunction with modflow cfpv2 and cmt3d the contribution of these sources to nitrate levels within the aquifer was assessed these results are compared with results from a previous vulnerability assessment and a previous analysis of Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o isotopic signatures to determine likely sources of nitrate within the study area the methodology used in this study is applicable to most karst aquifers and provides watershed managers with a means to identify contributors to nitrate contamination as part of efforts to reduce or prevent aquifer nitrate contamination 2 study area the karstic edwards aquifer is the primary source of water for agricultural industrial and drinking water for the approximately 2 4 million people living in the san antonio tx usa region u s census bureau 2013 the edwards is considered part of the edwards trinity aquifer complex as the two aquifers are known to be in hydrologic communication johnson et al 2010 karst development is evident in the north to south flowing sinking streams sinkholes and spring complexes located throughout the region the two most productive springs in the area are comal springs with an average discharge of 9 3 m3 s 1 and san marcos springs with an average discharge of 4 3 m3 s 1 lindgren et al 2004 an area of particular concern is the portion of the edwards aquifer overlain by the cibolo and dry comal creek watersheds fig 1 this consists of the upper and middle portions of the cibolo creek watershed 707 km2 and the entirety of the dry comal creek watershed 337 km2 predominant land classifications in the study area include forests 53 grasslands 19 agricultural 13 and urban 5 between 1998 and 2013 22 of 268 groundwater samples from public and commercial wells in the study area had elevated nitrate levels 5 mg n l 1 johnson and schindel 2014 during the same time period nitrate values in 250 samples from comal springs ranged from non detect to 4 37 mg n l 1 with an average value of 1 81 mg n l 1 johnson et al 2014 for hueco springs immediately east of the study area one sample of 144 was elevated for nitrate at 5 15 mg n l 1 while the average value was 1 27 mg n l 1 johnson et al 2014 an early isotopic assessment of nitrate within the edwards aquifer found no evidence of nitrate contamination from animal or human waste kreitler and browning 1983 a more recent assessment identified anthropogenic sources from urban land uses musgrove et al 2010 as well as wastewater as likely sources of increasing nitrate levels within the edwards aquifer musgrove et al 2016 recharge from the study area supplies discharge to comal springs william f guyton and associates 1979 and nitrate levels in comal springs have increased over the period of 1938 2006 mahler et al 2011 within the study area sullivan and gao 2016 identified the largest source of nitrate to streams was atmospheric deposition 56 3 of nitrate stream load followed by livestock manure 25 9 other important sources include human wastewater 8 4 wild animal manure 4 8 and fertilizer 4 0 sullivan and gao 2016 in a separate agricultural karst area nitrate concentrations were found to increase during rainfall events with the peak nitrate concentration occurring after the peak in springflow huebsch et al 2014 conversely two studies in the edwards aquifer noted that nitrate levels tend to decrease after heavy rainfall due to dilution jagucki et al 2011 musgrove et al 2010 a recent study within the edwards aquifer found this to be true in an urban portion of the aquifer but found nitrate levels increased after rainfall events in a rural portion of the aquifer opsahl et al 2017 the study area was chosen due to its documented elevated nitrate levels and the presence of comal springs due to the difficulty in hydrologically separating portions of a karst aquifer the entire san antonio segment of the aquifer was modelled with a focus on nitrate fate and transport within the study area 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater model modeling nitrate transport was accomplished by coupling the modflow cfpv2 hydraulic model to the cmt3d contaminant transport model modflow cfpv2 utilizes modflow subroutines to compute flow through the aquifer matrix while adding pipes to model flow through karst conduits cfpv2 transmits the computed flow field through two link files one for the matrix and one for the conduits for use by cmt3d to model contaminant transport additional details on these modeling packages are provided below 3 1 1 modflow cfpv2 cfpv2 is an updated version of modflow cfp both of which add the ability to model flow through discrete conduits to modflow s ability to simulate groundwater flow through the continuous aquifer matrix the base version of modflow is a 3 dimensional finite difference groundwater model developed by the u s geological survey usgs modflow is a block centered model designed to estimate the solution to the partial differential equation for groundwater flow harbaugh 2005 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z axes l t 1 h is groundwater head l w is volumetric flux accounting for sources and sinks t 1 ss is specific storage l 1 and t is time t this equation is transformed into an estimation of head variation with time harbaugh 2005 2 Œ¥ h i j k Œ¥ t h i j k m h i j k m 1 t m t m 1 where i j k are the three dimensional cell coordinates and m is the time step eq 2 is a backward difference equation where the solution is approximated for a time interval that extends back from time tm to time tm 1 shoemaker 2005 the advantage of the backward difference approach is that it is always numerically stable shoemaker 2005 eq 2 is solved in an iterative process until the variation in head between time steps is acceptably low or a defined number of iterations has occurred notably modflow is designed to solve darcy s law equation for laminar flow and is not designed for turbulent flow regimes often encountered in karst aquifers modflow cfp overcomes this limitation by utilizing a network of cylindrical pipes to simulate flow in conduits cfp mode 1 shoemaker et al 2008 in the cfp pipe flow is simulated with the darcy weisbach equation shoemaker et al 2008 3 Œ¥ h h l f Œ¥ l d v 2 2 g where Œ¥h and hl are head loss along pipe length Œ¥l l f is the friction factor dimensionless d is the pipe diameter l v is the mean velocity l t 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration constant l t 2 groundwater flux between the aquifer matrix and conduits is calculated as shoemaker et al 2008 4 q ex Œ± j i k h n h j i k where qex is the volumetric exchange flow rate l3t 1 Œ± j i k is the pipe conductance at cell j i k l2t 1 and hn is the head at conduit node n and hj i k is the head at cell j i k cfpv2 expands on the original version of cfp by including the ability to generate matrix and conduit link files for use by cmt3d to model contaminant transport when applying cfpv2 key information for model development includes conduit location geometry and hydraulic properties as well as the hydraulic properties of the matrix shoemaker et al 2008 these parameters present a challenge as the difficulty in obtaining detailed conduit characteristics had led to most local scale models of contaminant transport in karst systems being poor ghasemizadeh et al 2012 3 1 2 cmt3d much like cfpv2 adds the ability to simulate flow in conduits to modflow cmt3d adds the ability to simulate contaminant transport in conduits to mt3dms mt3dms uses modflow output to simulate contaminant fate and transport through advection dispersion diffusion and chemical reactions zheng and wang 1999 mt3dms solves the generalized partial differential equation for contaminant fate and transport zheng and wang 1999 5 Œ∏ c k t x i Œ∏ d ij c k x j x i Œ∏ v i c k q s c s k r n where

is the chemical reaction rate term m l 3 t 1 cmt3d overcomes mt3dms inability to model contaminant transport in discrete conduits by utilizing flow output from cfpv2 to model contaminant transport through the aquifer matrix and conduits reimann et al 2013 the cmt3d modeling software used here is an updated version of umt3d cfpv2 generates the link mt3dms file for matrix transport lmt6 and the link cmt3d file for conduit transport lct6 cmt3d uses these files to sequentially calculate transport through the matrix using mt3dms then calculating transport through conduits using an advective transport module spiessl et al 2002 flux between the matrix and conduits is calculated using eq 4 within cmt3d no source or sink terms are required in eq 4 because conduits are treated as a mixing cell model spiessl et al 2002 through the flux between the conduits and matrix the conduits are treated as contaminant sources and sinks for the aquifer matrix in mt3dms but unlike other sinks in mt3dms mass in a conduit may return to the matrix spiessl et al 2002 contaminant transport through conduits is determined by solving the one dimensional advection dispersion equation clark 2009 6 c t v c x d 2 c x 2 where d is the dispersion coefficients and the other variables are as previously defined 3 2 existing model previous edwards aquifer modeling efforts focused on assuring adequate quantities of water to the region rather than on water quality the groundwater availability model of the san antonio segment of the edwards aquifer utilizes an equivalent porous media epm modflow model lindgren et al 2004 conduits are simulated as single cell wide 402 3 m areas of very high hydraulic conductivity up to 91 440 m d 1 terminating at area springs lindgren et al 2004 trans formational flow from the trinity aquifer is simulated through a series of injection wells along the northern boundary of the model domain lindgren et al 2004 the colorado river marks the eastern model boundary which is represented with head dependent flux nodes lindgren et al 2004 no flow boundary conditions are imposed in the artesian portion of the western model boundary and the southern model boundary lindgren et al 2004 while this model provides acceptable hydrological modelling of the edwards aquifer it is not capable of simulating contaminant transport lindgren et al 2004 3 3 conversion of epm to cfpv2 the epm model provides a straightforward way to incorporate conduits into the model by locating them within the high conductivity cells this methodology was successfully utilized in the upper floridan aquifer usa to model discharge at wakulla springs using modflow cfp gallegos et al 2013 this study was later extended to model nitrate transport using cfpv2 and umt3d where the nitrate simulation results were found to be consistent with measured values xu et al 2015 the model development process is illustrated in fig 2 the model boundary conditions described above were retained in the cfpv2 model readers are referred to lindgren et al 2004 for a more thorough discussion of the model boundary conditions the steady state model was created by first changing the conceptualization of conduits high conductivity cells in the epm to the cfp conceptualization pipes the hydraulic conductivity values in the epm s high conductivity cells were lowered to the average hydraulic conductivity values for the surrounding matrix the epm conduits were then replaced with cfp pipes located in the same grid cells in the epm san antonio and san pedro springs were not located on simulated conduits high hydraulic conductivity cells therefore they were not conceptualized as being located on cfp pipes but were simulated using modflow s drain package as they were in the epm the steady state model uses a single one day time step and long term average recharge and pumping values after calibrating the cfp conduit parameters the transient model was created by updating the recharge and pumping data to cover years 2001 2010 month long stress periods with a one day time step were used selected model data are provided in table 1 additional changes to the existing epm were required to incorporate nitrate inputs from a swat model developed by sullivan and gao 2016 new recharge zones were created in modflow to represent swat sub basins overlying the edwards aquifer recharge zone these recharge zones are located in the study area shown in fig 1 diffuse recharge input from the swat model was used in the study area while recharge estimates from the usgs were used for the remaining watersheds previous studies also utilized swat models with modflow and mt3dms to model nitrate transport in aquifers this methodology was successfully employed in the co√´t dan watershed in france conan et al 2003 the yamuna river basin of the himalayas narula and gossain 2013 and the mancha oriental system in spain pulido velazquez et al 2015 recharge and nitrate from traditional septic systems and aerobic drip systems were modeled via injection wells nitrate input from streams was set equal to swat simulated nitrate concentrations finally diffuse nitrate infiltrating the aquifer was calculated from the nitrate that leaches through the bottom of the soil profile in the swat model outside of the study area nitrate concentrations of recharge were estimated as the average aquifer nitrate concentration for the entire aquifer for each stress period finally nitrate input through trans formational flow from the trinity aquifer was set at 2 11 mg n l 1 which represents the average value for the region twdb 2018 the nitrate model inputs are contained in the sink and source mixing ssm file of cmt3d 3 4 model calibration model calibration progressed sequentially beginning with hydrologic calibration of the steady state model recharge calibration of the transient model then progressing to calibration of nitrate transport calibration of the steady state model was accomplished through a combination of beopest schre√ºder 2011 which is the parallel version of parameter estimation pest doherty 2016 and manual calibration pest utilizes regularized inversion to solve the inverse problem with minimum error variance doherty 2016 singular value decomposition svd was used to ensure model numerical stability beopest was run on amazon web services elastic compute cloud using c5 2xlarge instances with 8 virtual cpus and 16 gb of memory cfp conduit parameters tortuosity diameter and the water transfer coefficient per unit length Œ± ex were calibrated in the steady state model during the initial phase of calibration Œ± ex and conduit diameters were calibrated in zones representing conduit segments supplying the four springs fed by cfp conduits comal hueco leona and san marcos initial conduit diameters were chosen based on the hydraulic conductivity of the associated model cell during the first phase of calibration conduit diameters were allowed to range as high as 15 2 m the Œ± ex values were allowed to vary between 3 0 10 6 and 1 8 m day 1 while tortuosity was allowed to vary between 1 and 2 relative roughness was set to 0 1 based on a prior study hovorka et al 1995 the large number of conduit parameters made it impractical to use beopest to calibrate model parameters individually attempts to use beopest to calibrate grouped conduit parameters i e larger segments of conduit failed to achieve acceptable results so manual calibration was utilized to complete the calibration of Œ± ex and conduit diameters details of the manual calibration process are in the supporting information calibration of recharge estimates was required for the transient model during development lindgren et al 2004 and subsequent updates liu et al 2017 to the epm modelers identified that recharge estimates generated using the historical method puente 1978 tend to overestimate recharge in wet years and underestimate recharge in dry years puente s method involves a water balance where recharge equals the difference between streamflow above and below the basin plus a portion of storm runoff within the basin puente 1978 the puente method also overestimates recharge for the cibolo dry comal creek watershed and underestimates recharge for the nueces west nueces and frio dry frio watersheds liu et al 2017 the edwards aquifer authority eaa applies adjustment factors to recharge estimates to develop calibrated recharge estimates for use in the epm the recharge estimates were calibrated using the manual method outlined in the supporting information calibration of the cmt3d model was completed using beopest for matrix transport via mt3dms the three parameters requiring calibration are the longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l ratio of the horizontal transverse dispersivity Œ± th to Œ± l and the molecular diffusion coefficient the molecular diffusion coefficient was also calibrated for contaminant transport in conduits the calibration range for dispersivity Œ± l was set from 6 1 to 18 3 m based on previous studies davis et al 2010 xu et al 2015 the ratio of Œ± l to Œ± th ranged from 0 05 to 0 1 with the upper bound set based on reported maximum expected values zheng and wang 1999 the value for the molecular diffusion coefficient for nitrate in water was allowed to vary between published values of 1 47 10 4 m2 day 1 kreft et al 2001 picioreanu et al 1997 to 1 64 10 4 m2 day 1 parkhurst and appelo 2013 3 4 1 calibration statistics hydraulic calibration performance for the steady state model was measured against long term average streamflow from comal leona san antonio san marcos and san pedro springs as well as head values from 144 edwards aquifer wells located throughout the model domain for the transient model spring flux values were compared against monthly fluxes for each spring while simulated head values were compared against observed head values for 28 wells the accuracy of the hydrologic calibration was assessed with two numerical calibration measures scaled root mean square error rmse for head values and percent error for springflow values scaled rmse is defined as 7 scaled r m s 1 n i 1 n h s h o 2 0 5 h max h min where n is the number of observations hs is the simulated head ho is the observed head hmax is the maximum observed head and hmin is the minimum observed head for springflow the percent error is defined as 8 percent e r r o r 1 f s f o 100 where fs and fo represent the simulated and observed springflows respectively for both statistics values less than 10 are considered acceptable lindgren et al 2004 when evaluating the success of nitrate calibration the primary statistic used was percent bias pbias 9 pbias i 1 n c i o c i s 100 i 1 n c i o where c i o is the observed concentration and c i s is the simulated concentration moriasi et al 2007 lower values of pbias represent more accurate model simulation with values between 70 and 70 considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 the accuracy of nitrate concentration prediction was further evaluated by the mean error me normalized mean error nme mean absolute error mae normalized mean absolute error nmae and a two tailed student s t test nme and nmae were obtained by dividing me and mae by cmax cmin respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 steady state model tortuosity was calibrated globally with a final value of 2 0 since the conduit locations within the edwards aquifer are inferred tortuosity cannot be measured directly however this result is within previously reported ranges for karst aquifers a simulation evaluating 9000 possible flowpaths identified tortuosity values ranging from 1 to 3 9 assari and mohammadi 2017 similarly worthington 2015 analyzed 55 flowpaths worldwide and found tortuosity ranged from 1 103 to 2 369 finally the tortuosity value is within the optimized range of tortuosity values reported for a karst aquifer in the zagros mountain region of iran mohammadi et al 2018 the calibrated tortuosity value also provides a means to assess the reasonableness of simulated groundwater velocities previous dye tests indicate apparent straight line groundwater velocities within the edwards aquifer range from less than 1 m day 1 to 5300 m day 1 johnson et al 2010 johnson et al 2012 johnson and schindel 2015 with a tortuosity value of two these values would range up to 10 600 m day 1 within the steady state model 77 of simulated groundwater velocities fall within this range indicating the simulated groundwater velocities are reasonable conduit diameter and transfer coefficient Œ± ex varied throughout the model domain calibrated values for conduit diameter ranged from 0 05 to 18 3 m diameter values below 3 m represent constrictions within conduits that were used to account for observed head values in the upland northern portion of the model higher values represent the main southwest to northeast running conduits that feed comal and san marcos springs while direct comparison to measured values is not possible the diameter of the conduit feeding comal springs is calibrated at 18 3 m which is within the most probable range of 5 30 m identified for that conduit based on tracer test data worthington 2003 finally calibrated values for Œ± ex varied from 0 to 6 1 m day 1 with higher values indicating increased flux between conduits and the surrounding matrix a scatter plot of observed versus simulated steady state head values is shown in fig 3a the cfpv2 model overestimated the highest observed head values and 9 head values have residuals above 20 m the larger residuals occurred because the observed head values were measured between calendar years 1939 1946 lindgren et al 2004 and are therefore not a synoptic representation of the aquifer at steady state however there are two index wells bexar and uvalde counties with sufficient data to represent the aquifer at steady state the residuals for the bexar and uvalde county index wells were 0 4 and 0 3 m respectively this coupled with the fact that 123 of 144 residuals are less than 1 m indicates acceptable simulation of hydraulic heads the calibration statistics for the steady state model are shown in table 2 the scaled rmse and percent error for springflow at the major springs comal and san marcos are lower than the target value of 10 indicating acceptable model performance for aquifer head values and streamflow to major springs the percent error values for leona san antonio and san pedro springs exceed the target value however the error for leona springs is comparable to the error in the epm lindgren et al 2004 and likely results from significant uncertainty of discharge estimates in leona springs green et al 2008 for san antonio and san pedro springs it is important to note that in the original epm these two springs are not located within high conductivity cells used to simulate conduits therefore in the cfpv2 model they were simulated with modflow s drain package rather than by conduits furthermore in the original epm the errors for san antonio and san pedro springs also exceeded the target values with a combined reported error of 47 lindgren et al 2004 this was attributed to a lack of available data to perform calibration on these springs lindgren et al 2004 the volumetric budget listed in table 3 show the percent error is well below 1 further indicating acceptable model performance based on the alignment of calibrated conduit parameters with published values and acceptable calibration statistics for head values and major springs the steady state model calibration was determined to be acceptable 4 2 transient model the calibrated recharge adjustment factors for the transient hydrologic model are similar to those used by the eaa liu et al 2017 with a few exceptions first the eaa increases recharge in the nueces west nueces basin by a factor of 1 048 for all stress periods in the cfpv2 model this factor is only applied in wet years 2002 2004 and 2007 annual recharge is greater than 1727 mm3 additionally in the cfpv2 recharge in the nueces west nueces basin is reduced by a factor of 1 2 in dry years 2006 2008 and 2009 second the eaa increases recharge in the frio dry frio basin by 1 011 in all stress periods this increase was not applied in the cfpv2 model in the blanco river basin recharge in the cfpv2 model was reduced by a factor of 1 2 in wet and normal years with the exception of 2007 and by a factor of 2 3 in dry years finally for the study area swat recharge estimates were used in lieu of usgs recharge estimates the scatter plot of observed versus simulated heads for the transient simulation fig 3b shows very good agreement with no apparent over or under estimation bias similarly the spring hydrographs for the major springs comal and san marcos show close agreement over the study period figs 4a and 4b further while the maximum absolute springflow errors for comal and san marcos springs are 4 1 m3 s 1 and 2 9 m3 s 1 respectively these values are below the maximum acceptable absolute springflow error of 4 25 m3 s 1 established by the eaa liu et al 2017 for hueco springs fig 4c the modeled discharge values have a slower recession and tend to underestimate discharge during periods of peak flow the delayed recession likely occurs from water moving from the matrix to the conduit in the model due to the model overestimating head values near the conduit the underestimation of springflow peaks is due to uncertainties in recharge estimates for the remaining minor springs san pedro springs show the closest agreement between observed and simulated values figs 4d 4f the model tends to underestimate discharge in wet years and overestimate discharge in dry years for minor springs performance statistics for the transient hydrologic model are shown in table 2 and the volumetric budget is shown in table 3 the data in table 2 demonstrate that the cfp model outperforms the original epm at predicting head values as well as springflows for comal and san marcos springs with the exception of san antonio springs percent error all statistics indicate acceptable model performance consistent with prior modeling efforts lindgren 2006 the cfpv2 model is more accurate at simulating flow at major springs than minor springs as discussed with the steady state model san antonio springs are not located on a conduit in the model and were not the focus of the calibration effort furthermore continuous flow data is not available for san antonio san pedro or leona springs for san antonio and san pedro springs periodic springflow measurements were available while the model output consists of average daily springflows over the course of the month long stress period in the case of leona springs the target values are a combination of measured springflow and estimated discharge to the leona gravel formation the lack of continuous springflow data for these springs represents a source of error in the target springflow values the model calibration was successful as indicated by the scaled rmse for matrix heads and the percent springflow error for major springs comal and san marco being below the target value of 10 a further indication of successful calibration is the volumetric budget error being well below 1 harbaugh 2005 4 3 cmt3d model the calibrated value for longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l of 18 3 m is higher than the reported value 10 m for a previous use of umt3d xu et al 2015 however it is within the range of high to intermediate reliability values reported in an analysis of multiple studies gelhar et al 1992 the calibrated ratio of Œ± l to Œ± th is 0 1 which equals the recommended maximum value zheng and wang 1999 the value of the molecular diffusion coefficient was 1 47 10 4 m2 day 1 plots of observed versus simulated nitrate values for the springs fig 5a c show reasonable agreement between observed and simulated values however the model is unable to simulate low nitrate values which result during extreme rain events this is because the model output represents monthly average nitrate values for a grid cell while the observed values represent point samples this model behavior is consistent with previous research efforts jiang and somers 2009 a comparison of the model nitrate output for hueco springs to the output for comal and san marcos springs shows higher variability and more rapid change in nitrate values for hueco springs this is expected because hueco springs recharge is limited to a small local area while comal and san marcos springs are regional springs the nitrate pbias values table 4 for the springs all indicate acceptable model performance and are classified as very good moriasi et al 2007 the nme values are comparable to those reported by zhang and hiscock 2016 and are indicative of acceptable model performance similarly the two tailed t tests indicate the difference between the means of observed and simulated nitrate values for the springs are not statistically significant p 0 05 simulated groundwater values were compared against nitrate samples from 40 wells within the study area this comparison was complicated by three factors first the wells were sampled sporadically for nitrate second the model only outputs nitrate results at the grid cell level and cannot simulate at smaller scales this limitation is illustrated when comparing wells 68301gv and 68301re which are located in the same grid cell during stress period 115 a nitrate observation from well 68301gv was 10 2 mg n l 1 while an observation for well 68301re was 3 2 mg n l 1 third most of the wells are located within the artesian zone of the aquifer where their nitrate values will be influenced by water flowing from outside the study area the impact of this was assessed by evaluating the accuracy of simulated groundwater nitrate values by distance from the portion of the recharge zone within the study area this is the portion of the model utilizing swat estimated nitrate recharge values the calibration statistics in table 5 indicate the model accurately predicts groundwater nitrate values in wells within 1000 m of the recharge zone in the study area while the me tends to fluctuate with distance from the recharge zone in the study area the mae tends to increase with distance indicating decreasing model accuracy this is corroborated by the two tailed t test indicating the difference between the means of observed and simulated nitrate values are statistically significant p 0 05 when evaluating groundwater nitrate values within 3000 m of recharge zone in the study area despite this limitation the model was able to accurately predict groundwater nitrate values in wells within 1000 m of recharge zone in the study area 4 4 sensitivity analysis two separate sensitivity analyses were conducted using pest one for the conduit parameters and one for the contaminant transport parameters in cmt3d pest calculates the composite sensitivity of each parameter where the composite sensitivity represents the parameter s sensitivity normalized by the number of observations doherty 2016 the pest sensitivity analysis for conduit parameters indicated the model is most sensitive to tortuosity followed by conduit diameter and conduit matrix transfer coefficient Œ± ex these results differ slightly from previous research where head and springflow values were most sensitive to conduit diameter followed by tortuosity and Œ± ex gallegos et al 2013 this difference is likely due to the previous study evaluating hydraulic head and springflow calibration target sensitivities separately while the current study conducted a single sensitivity analysis that included all calibration targets the pest sensitivity analysis for cmt3d parameters revealed the model has a low sensitivity to dispersivity but is most sensitive to Œ± th followed by Œ± l and is not sensitive to the molecular diffusion value these sensitivity results are consistent with those found in the woodville karst plain in the usa xu et al 2015 and the sherwood sandstone aquifer in great britain zhang and hiscock 2016 4 5 potential nitrate sources the previously developed swat model identified sources of nitrate input to the study area as well as nitrate yield to area streams from these sources these percentages were applied to the cmt3d model input to identify the percentage of total nitrate input within the study area from losing streams soil leaching and on site sewage facility ossf injection wells table 6 in typical years the majority of nitrate input comes from soil leaching followed by losing streams with ossf injection wells representing a small portion of the nitrate input this is consistent with the conceptualization of how the majority of nitrate enters the edwards aquifer musgrove et al 2010 as well as other karst aquifers peterson et al 2002 however in the dry years of 2006 and 2008 losing streams and ossf injection wells combined to contribute more nitrate to the aquifer than soil leaching due to reduced water infiltration through the soil matrix the estimated contribution from atmospheric deposition is comparable to the value of 25 reported for a karst aquifer in germany einsiedl and mayer 2006 table 6 also indicates that on average 59 of nitrate entering the aquifer arises from anthropogenic sources agriculture wastewater and urban this is consistent with an aquifer vulnerability and hazard intensity index hii study conducted on the edwards aquifer which indicated areas of highest hii were located near areas of human activity sullivan and gao 2017 previous assessments of nitrate in the edwards aquifer also identified human activity as a likely cause of elevated nitrate levels musgrove et al 2011 musgrove et al 2016 opsahl et al 2017 when looking at the entire edwards aquifer isotopic analysis indicated human and or animal waste might be the cause of increasing nitrate levels musgrove et al 2016 this assessment is consistent with results in the study area where 56 2 of nitrate input is estimated to come from human and animal waste farm fertilizer use was previously classified as unlikely to be a notable source of nitrate contamination musgrove et al 2016 within the study area farm fertilizer use did account for 8 5 of nitrate input however farm fertilizer use decreased significantly during the study period 2000 2010 sullivan and gao 2016 overall the identified nitrate sources are similar to nitrate estimates in a karst aquifer in the city of guiyang china liu et al 2006 as well as in an agricultural portion of the upper floridan aquifer eller and katz 2017 this similarity is likely due to all three watersheds containing mixtures of agricultural and urban land uses 5 conclusions nitrate fate and transport within the karstic edwards aquifer were successfully simulated using swat cfpv2 and cmt3d groundwater flow input for the cmt3d model was supplied by the cfpv2 model while nitrate concentration input for the study area was supplied by the swat model hydrologic calibration results demonstrate the cfpv2 model more accurately represents springflow at major springs and head values throughout the aquifer cmt3d model inputs indicate the predominant mechanism for nitrate to enter the edwards aquifer is soil leaching which is consistent with existing conceptual models results also show anthropogenic sources make up 59 of nitrate input with agricultural activities comprising the bulk of this input the cmt3d model developed for this study does suffer from two primary limitations first it is not able to model phenomena occurring at scales smaller than the size of the model grid while this limitation can be addressed by decreasing the grid size doing so would significantly increase the computational burden and model run times second simulated nitrate values are only calibrated for sample locations within 1000 m of the recharge zone in the study area this is because the swat model used to provide estimated recharge nitrate concentrations only covers one of the nine recharge basins in the san antonio segment of the edwards aquifer at distances farther than 1000 m from the study area swat model calibrated nitrate inputs from the study area mix with average nitrate inputs from the rest of the aquifer which limits the accuracy of the simulated nitrate concentrations future research efforts to model nitrate in adjacent watersheds should mitigate this limitation despite these factors the cmt3d model was successfully calibrated this study provides a tool for watershed managers to assess potential sources of elevated nitrate within karst aquifers identifying likely sources and mechanisms of nitrate infiltration allows watershed managers to target management practices aimed at lowering nitrate inputs to the identified nitrate sources in the case of high localized nitrate readings the results provide watershed managers with a starting point to assess the likelihood that one of the predominant sources identified is contributing to the elevated readings 6 declarations of

6523,protecting karst aquifers from nitrate contamination is an issue of global concern due to the inherent vulnerability of karst aquifers to contamination and the negative health effects of elevated nitrate levels hydrological and transport models were developed to assess nitrate transport within a karstic aquifer located in an area with both semi arid and sub humid climate conditions groundwater flow through the aquifer matrix and conduits was simulated with cfpv2 an experimental version of the conduit flow process cfp version of the modular flow modflow groundwater model nitrate transport was simulated with the experimental conduit mass transport three dimensional model cmt3d the hydrologic calibration of the steady state model was successful based on a scaled root mean squared error rmse of 4 9 for hydraulic heads and percent errors of 3 0 and 6 6 for the two major springs in the area performance of the transient hydrologic model exceeded the performance of the existing equivalent porous media epm model with a scaled rmse of 2 2 and springflow errors of 1 5 and 2 8 for the major springs similarly nitrate calibration was successful with all percent bias pbias values between 25 additional calibration statistics including a two tailed t test indicated successful calibration the cmt3d model corroborates prior research findings that anthropogenic sources as well as biogenic wastes are important sources of nitrate to the aquifer the methodology used in this study represents an additional tool for watershed managers to address nitrate contamination within karst aquifers keywords karst hydrology conduit flow process conduit mass transport three dimensional groundwater transport modeling nitrate 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater is an international concern because of its prevalence in both urban and agricultural areas mobility in the environment and negative health effects sources of nitrogen include animal manure human wastewater fertilizers and atmospheric deposition this nitrogen typically enters waterways in the form of nitrate as evidenced by an assessment of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs in the united states and europe that found when anthropogenic nitrogen inputs exceed 1070 kg n km 2 yr 1 25 of the nitrogen will reach surface waters howarth et al 2012 discharges of nitrate to surface waters are of particular concern in regions with karst aquifers because surface waters can rapidly infiltrate the aquifer through karst features such as sinkholes leading to aquifer contamination with 25 of available groundwater stored in karst aquifers green et al 2006 the potential for nitrate contamination of karst aquifers is of global importance there have been numerous assessments of karst aquifer vulnerability to nitrate contamination throughout the world the chunnakam aquifer system in sri lanka was found to have a high vulnerability when using the drastic method vithanage et al 2014 an assessment of aquifer vulnerability in spain using the drastic method classified two karst aquifers as high vulnerability to nitrate contamination stigter et al 2005 interestingly however in this area groundwater tends to be recycled through extraction irrigation return flow and extraction again the rapid infiltration of surface waters to the karst aquifers limited this recycling effect and resulted in comparatively less nitrate contamination in the karst aquifers stigter et al 2005 finally an evaluation of the edwards aquifer in texas usa found the region dominated by areas of very high vulnerability to nitrate contamination sullivan and gao 2017 evaluations of nitrate sources within karst aquifers typically rely on isotopic and chemical analyses of nitrate samples one study in an agricultural watershed in illinois usa identified nitrogen fertilizer as the largest contributor of aquifer nitrate followed by atmospheric nitrogen and to a lesser extent animal waste panno et al 2001 in southwest china researchers also identified agricultural activities as the predominant source of aquifer nitrate but found the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen to be negligible yang et al 2013 diffuse agricultural sources were identified as the predominant cause of nitrate contamination in the barrow valley of southeast ireland minet et al 2017 isotopic signatures of nitrate in the kljuƒç aquifer of serbia identified nitrification of organic soil nitrogen and animal or human wastes as the major source of aquifer nitrate miljeviƒá et al 2012 an assessment of nitrogen loading in the upper floridan aquifer in florida usa identified the predominant source of aquifer nitrate levels in urban areas to be septic systems and fertilizer use while sources in agricultural areas were predominately animal waste and farm fertilizer use eller and katz 2017 high temporal resolution studies have assessed nitrate levels in karst aquifers in response to rainfall events a study in an agricultural area north of cork ireland found spring nitrate concentrations were influenced by hydrological conditions nitrate availability and karst feature development huebsch et al 2014 a study analyzed nitrate concentrations in wells of the edwards aquifer in texas usa and found nitrate concentrations increased in a rural well during recharge events while nitrate concentrations decreased in an urban well during recharge events opsahl et al 2017 one method to link aquifer vulnerability to nitrate source inputs is through groundwater contaminant transport modeling the first step in this process is to conduct hydrological modeling previous efforts at hydrological modeling in karst aquifers often relied on equivalent porous media epm models where karst features are modelled as high conductivity cells lindgren et al 2004 davis et al 2010 this approach was improved upon with the development of modflow cfp because it is able to simulate turbulent flow within discrete conduits as well as laminar flow through the matrix an early test of modflow cfp found it improved spring discharge estimates by 12 for a large spring and 40 for a small spring hill et al 2010 an epm model of the madison aquifer in south dakota usa was converted to modflow cfp with the modflow cfp model substantially improving estimates of hydraulic head saller et al 2013 in another study researchers found modflow cfp was more accurate than an epm at simulating peak spring flow and total discharge from springs in the woodville karst plain of florida usa gallegos et al 2013 despite the successful application of modflow cfp at simulating hydrological conditions it does not support contaminant transport modeling shoemaker et al 2008 this is one of the reasons comparatively few studies have assessed nitrate fate and transport within karst aquifers a water balance model for a karstic aquifer in okinawa japan simulated nitrate concentrations at the sub basin scale to assess the impact of dam construction yoshimoto et al 2011 modflow and the modular 3 dimentional transport multi species mt3dms contaminant transport model were used to assess nitrogen management strategies in the volusia blue spring area of the floridan aquifer in florida usa reed et al 2018 similarly modflow and mt3dms models were part of a hydro economic model assessing fertilizer standards in a portion of spain to lower nitrate values in the groundwater of the mancha oriental system pe√±a haro et al 2010 further study of the mancha oriental system involved using the output from a soil water assessment tool swat surface water model as input to modflow and mt3dms models to assess climate and land use change effects on groundwater quality pulido velazquez et al 2015 finally an experimental version of modflow conduit flow process version 2 cfpv2 coupled with three dimensional underground mine transport model umt3d spiessl et al 2007 was used to evaluate nitrate movement through the aquifer matrix as well as karst conduits in the woodville karst plain of northern florida usa xu et al 2015 while in some cases these studies evaluated different nitrate sources they were not linked to vulnerability assessments of the study areas furthermore the last study is the only one to directly model nitrate transport within karst conduits conceptualized as pipes rather than highly conductive cells this is due to the unique challenges of modelling contaminant transport in karst aquifers caused by the difficulty in identifying the location and size of karst features and the presence of turbulent flow within karst conduits ghasemizadeh et al 2012 the challenge in estimating conduit size was demonstrated through a process based model of a hypothetical karst system which showed that conduit volume estimates generated from traditional methods overestimated conduit size by up to a factor of 1 5 birk et al 2006 the current study assesses watershed nitrate inputs based on natural and anthropogenic source categories in a semi arid to sub humid karst area through the use of output from a swat model in conjunction with modflow cfpv2 and cmt3d the contribution of these sources to nitrate levels within the aquifer was assessed these results are compared with results from a previous vulnerability assessment and a previous analysis of Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o isotopic signatures to determine likely sources of nitrate within the study area the methodology used in this study is applicable to most karst aquifers and provides watershed managers with a means to identify contributors to nitrate contamination as part of efforts to reduce or prevent aquifer nitrate contamination 2 study area the karstic edwards aquifer is the primary source of water for agricultural industrial and drinking water for the approximately 2 4 million people living in the san antonio tx usa region u s census bureau 2013 the edwards is considered part of the edwards trinity aquifer complex as the two aquifers are known to be in hydrologic communication johnson et al 2010 karst development is evident in the north to south flowing sinking streams sinkholes and spring complexes located throughout the region the two most productive springs in the area are comal springs with an average discharge of 9 3 m3 s 1 and san marcos springs with an average discharge of 4 3 m3 s 1 lindgren et al 2004 an area of particular concern is the portion of the edwards aquifer overlain by the cibolo and dry comal creek watersheds fig 1 this consists of the upper and middle portions of the cibolo creek watershed 707 km2 and the entirety of the dry comal creek watershed 337 km2 predominant land classifications in the study area include forests 53 grasslands 19 agricultural 13 and urban 5 between 1998 and 2013 22 of 268 groundwater samples from public and commercial wells in the study area had elevated nitrate levels 5 mg n l 1 johnson and schindel 2014 during the same time period nitrate values in 250 samples from comal springs ranged from non detect to 4 37 mg n l 1 with an average value of 1 81 mg n l 1 johnson et al 2014 for hueco springs immediately east of the study area one sample of 144 was elevated for nitrate at 5 15 mg n l 1 while the average value was 1 27 mg n l 1 johnson et al 2014 an early isotopic assessment of nitrate within the edwards aquifer found no evidence of nitrate contamination from animal or human waste kreitler and browning 1983 a more recent assessment identified anthropogenic sources from urban land uses musgrove et al 2010 as well as wastewater as likely sources of increasing nitrate levels within the edwards aquifer musgrove et al 2016 recharge from the study area supplies discharge to comal springs william f guyton and associates 1979 and nitrate levels in comal springs have increased over the period of 1938 2006 mahler et al 2011 within the study area sullivan and gao 2016 identified the largest source of nitrate to streams was atmospheric deposition 56 3 of nitrate stream load followed by livestock manure 25 9 other important sources include human wastewater 8 4 wild animal manure 4 8 and fertilizer 4 0 sullivan and gao 2016 in a separate agricultural karst area nitrate concentrations were found to increase during rainfall events with the peak nitrate concentration occurring after the peak in springflow huebsch et al 2014 conversely two studies in the edwards aquifer noted that nitrate levels tend to decrease after heavy rainfall due to dilution jagucki et al 2011 musgrove et al 2010 a recent study within the edwards aquifer found this to be true in an urban portion of the aquifer but found nitrate levels increased after rainfall events in a rural portion of the aquifer opsahl et al 2017 the study area was chosen due to its documented elevated nitrate levels and the presence of comal springs due to the difficulty in hydrologically separating portions of a karst aquifer the entire san antonio segment of the aquifer was modelled with a focus on nitrate fate and transport within the study area 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater model modeling nitrate transport was accomplished by coupling the modflow cfpv2 hydraulic model to the cmt3d contaminant transport model modflow cfpv2 utilizes modflow subroutines to compute flow through the aquifer matrix while adding pipes to model flow through karst conduits cfpv2 transmits the computed flow field through two link files one for the matrix and one for the conduits for use by cmt3d to model contaminant transport additional details on these modeling packages are provided below 3 1 1 modflow cfpv2 cfpv2 is an updated version of modflow cfp both of which add the ability to model flow through discrete conduits to modflow s ability to simulate groundwater flow through the continuous aquifer matrix the base version of modflow is a 3 dimensional finite difference groundwater model developed by the u s geological survey usgs modflow is a block centered model designed to estimate the solution to the partial differential equation for groundwater flow harbaugh 2005 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z axes l t 1 h is groundwater head l w is volumetric flux accounting for sources and sinks t 1 ss is specific storage l 1 and t is time t this equation is transformed into an estimation of head variation with time harbaugh 2005 2 Œ¥ h i j k Œ¥ t h i j k m h i j k m 1 t m t m 1 where i j k are the three dimensional cell coordinates and m is the time step eq 2 is a backward difference equation where the solution is approximated for a time interval that extends back from time tm to time tm 1 shoemaker 2005 the advantage of the backward difference approach is that it is always numerically stable shoemaker 2005 eq 2 is solved in an iterative process until the variation in head between time steps is acceptably low or a defined number of iterations has occurred notably modflow is designed to solve darcy s law equation for laminar flow and is not designed for turbulent flow regimes often encountered in karst aquifers modflow cfp overcomes this limitation by utilizing a network of cylindrical pipes to simulate flow in conduits cfp mode 1 shoemaker et al 2008 in the cfp pipe flow is simulated with the darcy weisbach equation shoemaker et al 2008 3 Œ¥ h h l f Œ¥ l d v 2 2 g where Œ¥h and hl are head loss along pipe length Œ¥l l f is the friction factor dimensionless d is the pipe diameter l v is the mean velocity l t 1 and g is the gravitational acceleration constant l t 2 groundwater flux between the aquifer matrix and conduits is calculated as shoemaker et al 2008 4 q ex Œ± j i k h n h j i k where qex is the volumetric exchange flow rate l3t 1 Œ± j i k is the pipe conductance at cell j i k l2t 1 and hn is the head at conduit node n and hj i k is the head at cell j i k cfpv2 expands on the original version of cfp by including the ability to generate matrix and conduit link files for use by cmt3d to model contaminant transport when applying cfpv2 key information for model development includes conduit location geometry and hydraulic properties as well as the hydraulic properties of the matrix shoemaker et al 2008 these parameters present a challenge as the difficulty in obtaining detailed conduit characteristics had led to most local scale models of contaminant transport in karst systems being poor ghasemizadeh et al 2012 3 1 2 cmt3d much like cfpv2 adds the ability to simulate flow in conduits to modflow cmt3d adds the ability to simulate contaminant transport in conduits to mt3dms mt3dms uses modflow output to simulate contaminant fate and transport through advection dispersion diffusion and chemical reactions zheng and wang 1999 mt3dms solves the generalized partial differential equation for contaminant fate and transport zheng and wang 1999 5 Œ∏ c k t x i Œ∏ d ij c k x j x i Œ∏ v i c k q s c s k r n where

is the chemical reaction rate term m l 3 t 1 cmt3d overcomes mt3dms inability to model contaminant transport in discrete conduits by utilizing flow output from cfpv2 to model contaminant transport through the aquifer matrix and conduits reimann et al 2013 the cmt3d modeling software used here is an updated version of umt3d cfpv2 generates the link mt3dms file for matrix transport lmt6 and the link cmt3d file for conduit transport lct6 cmt3d uses these files to sequentially calculate transport through the matrix using mt3dms then calculating transport through conduits using an advective transport module spiessl et al 2002 flux between the matrix and conduits is calculated using eq 4 within cmt3d no source or sink terms are required in eq 4 because conduits are treated as a mixing cell model spiessl et al 2002 through the flux between the conduits and matrix the conduits are treated as contaminant sources and sinks for the aquifer matrix in mt3dms but unlike other sinks in mt3dms mass in a conduit may return to the matrix spiessl et al 2002 contaminant transport through conduits is determined by solving the one dimensional advection dispersion equation clark 2009 6 c t v c x d 2 c x 2 where d is the dispersion coefficients and the other variables are as previously defined 3 2 existing model previous edwards aquifer modeling efforts focused on assuring adequate quantities of water to the region rather than on water quality the groundwater availability model of the san antonio segment of the edwards aquifer utilizes an equivalent porous media epm modflow model lindgren et al 2004 conduits are simulated as single cell wide 402 3 m areas of very high hydraulic conductivity up to 91 440 m d 1 terminating at area springs lindgren et al 2004 trans formational flow from the trinity aquifer is simulated through a series of injection wells along the northern boundary of the model domain lindgren et al 2004 the colorado river marks the eastern model boundary which is represented with head dependent flux nodes lindgren et al 2004 no flow boundary conditions are imposed in the artesian portion of the western model boundary and the southern model boundary lindgren et al 2004 while this model provides acceptable hydrological modelling of the edwards aquifer it is not capable of simulating contaminant transport lindgren et al 2004 3 3 conversion of epm to cfpv2 the epm model provides a straightforward way to incorporate conduits into the model by locating them within the high conductivity cells this methodology was successfully utilized in the upper floridan aquifer usa to model discharge at wakulla springs using modflow cfp gallegos et al 2013 this study was later extended to model nitrate transport using cfpv2 and umt3d where the nitrate simulation results were found to be consistent with measured values xu et al 2015 the model development process is illustrated in fig 2 the model boundary conditions described above were retained in the cfpv2 model readers are referred to lindgren et al 2004 for a more thorough discussion of the model boundary conditions the steady state model was created by first changing the conceptualization of conduits high conductivity cells in the epm to the cfp conceptualization pipes the hydraulic conductivity values in the epm s high conductivity cells were lowered to the average hydraulic conductivity values for the surrounding matrix the epm conduits were then replaced with cfp pipes located in the same grid cells in the epm san antonio and san pedro springs were not located on simulated conduits high hydraulic conductivity cells therefore they were not conceptualized as being located on cfp pipes but were simulated using modflow s drain package as they were in the epm the steady state model uses a single one day time step and long term average recharge and pumping values after calibrating the cfp conduit parameters the transient model was created by updating the recharge and pumping data to cover years 2001 2010 month long stress periods with a one day time step were used selected model data are provided in table 1 additional changes to the existing epm were required to incorporate nitrate inputs from a swat model developed by sullivan and gao 2016 new recharge zones were created in modflow to represent swat sub basins overlying the edwards aquifer recharge zone these recharge zones are located in the study area shown in fig 1 diffuse recharge input from the swat model was used in the study area while recharge estimates from the usgs were used for the remaining watersheds previous studies also utilized swat models with modflow and mt3dms to model nitrate transport in aquifers this methodology was successfully employed in the co√´t dan watershed in france conan et al 2003 the yamuna river basin of the himalayas narula and gossain 2013 and the mancha oriental system in spain pulido velazquez et al 2015 recharge and nitrate from traditional septic systems and aerobic drip systems were modeled via injection wells nitrate input from streams was set equal to swat simulated nitrate concentrations finally diffuse nitrate infiltrating the aquifer was calculated from the nitrate that leaches through the bottom of the soil profile in the swat model outside of the study area nitrate concentrations of recharge were estimated as the average aquifer nitrate concentration for the entire aquifer for each stress period finally nitrate input through trans formational flow from the trinity aquifer was set at 2 11 mg n l 1 which represents the average value for the region twdb 2018 the nitrate model inputs are contained in the sink and source mixing ssm file of cmt3d 3 4 model calibration model calibration progressed sequentially beginning with hydrologic calibration of the steady state model recharge calibration of the transient model then progressing to calibration of nitrate transport calibration of the steady state model was accomplished through a combination of beopest schre√ºder 2011 which is the parallel version of parameter estimation pest doherty 2016 and manual calibration pest utilizes regularized inversion to solve the inverse problem with minimum error variance doherty 2016 singular value decomposition svd was used to ensure model numerical stability beopest was run on amazon web services elastic compute cloud using c5 2xlarge instances with 8 virtual cpus and 16 gb of memory cfp conduit parameters tortuosity diameter and the water transfer coefficient per unit length Œ± ex were calibrated in the steady state model during the initial phase of calibration Œ± ex and conduit diameters were calibrated in zones representing conduit segments supplying the four springs fed by cfp conduits comal hueco leona and san marcos initial conduit diameters were chosen based on the hydraulic conductivity of the associated model cell during the first phase of calibration conduit diameters were allowed to range as high as 15 2 m the Œ± ex values were allowed to vary between 3 0 10 6 and 1 8 m day 1 while tortuosity was allowed to vary between 1 and 2 relative roughness was set to 0 1 based on a prior study hovorka et al 1995 the large number of conduit parameters made it impractical to use beopest to calibrate model parameters individually attempts to use beopest to calibrate grouped conduit parameters i e larger segments of conduit failed to achieve acceptable results so manual calibration was utilized to complete the calibration of Œ± ex and conduit diameters details of the manual calibration process are in the supporting information calibration of recharge estimates was required for the transient model during development lindgren et al 2004 and subsequent updates liu et al 2017 to the epm modelers identified that recharge estimates generated using the historical method puente 1978 tend to overestimate recharge in wet years and underestimate recharge in dry years puente s method involves a water balance where recharge equals the difference between streamflow above and below the basin plus a portion of storm runoff within the basin puente 1978 the puente method also overestimates recharge for the cibolo dry comal creek watershed and underestimates recharge for the nueces west nueces and frio dry frio watersheds liu et al 2017 the edwards aquifer authority eaa applies adjustment factors to recharge estimates to develop calibrated recharge estimates for use in the epm the recharge estimates were calibrated using the manual method outlined in the supporting information calibration of the cmt3d model was completed using beopest for matrix transport via mt3dms the three parameters requiring calibration are the longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l ratio of the horizontal transverse dispersivity Œ± th to Œ± l and the molecular diffusion coefficient the molecular diffusion coefficient was also calibrated for contaminant transport in conduits the calibration range for dispersivity Œ± l was set from 6 1 to 18 3 m based on previous studies davis et al 2010 xu et al 2015 the ratio of Œ± l to Œ± th ranged from 0 05 to 0 1 with the upper bound set based on reported maximum expected values zheng and wang 1999 the value for the molecular diffusion coefficient for nitrate in water was allowed to vary between published values of 1 47 10 4 m2 day 1 kreft et al 2001 picioreanu et al 1997 to 1 64 10 4 m2 day 1 parkhurst and appelo 2013 3 4 1 calibration statistics hydraulic calibration performance for the steady state model was measured against long term average streamflow from comal leona san antonio san marcos and san pedro springs as well as head values from 144 edwards aquifer wells located throughout the model domain for the transient model spring flux values were compared against monthly fluxes for each spring while simulated head values were compared against observed head values for 28 wells the accuracy of the hydrologic calibration was assessed with two numerical calibration measures scaled root mean square error rmse for head values and percent error for springflow values scaled rmse is defined as 7 scaled r m s 1 n i 1 n h s h o 2 0 5 h max h min where n is the number of observations hs is the simulated head ho is the observed head hmax is the maximum observed head and hmin is the minimum observed head for springflow the percent error is defined as 8 percent e r r o r 1 f s f o 100 where fs and fo represent the simulated and observed springflows respectively for both statistics values less than 10 are considered acceptable lindgren et al 2004 when evaluating the success of nitrate calibration the primary statistic used was percent bias pbias 9 pbias i 1 n c i o c i s 100 i 1 n c i o where c i o is the observed concentration and c i s is the simulated concentration moriasi et al 2007 lower values of pbias represent more accurate model simulation with values between 70 and 70 considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 the accuracy of nitrate concentration prediction was further evaluated by the mean error me normalized mean error nme mean absolute error mae normalized mean absolute error nmae and a two tailed student s t test nme and nmae were obtained by dividing me and mae by cmax cmin respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 steady state model tortuosity was calibrated globally with a final value of 2 0 since the conduit locations within the edwards aquifer are inferred tortuosity cannot be measured directly however this result is within previously reported ranges for karst aquifers a simulation evaluating 9000 possible flowpaths identified tortuosity values ranging from 1 to 3 9 assari and mohammadi 2017 similarly worthington 2015 analyzed 55 flowpaths worldwide and found tortuosity ranged from 1 103 to 2 369 finally the tortuosity value is within the optimized range of tortuosity values reported for a karst aquifer in the zagros mountain region of iran mohammadi et al 2018 the calibrated tortuosity value also provides a means to assess the reasonableness of simulated groundwater velocities previous dye tests indicate apparent straight line groundwater velocities within the edwards aquifer range from less than 1 m day 1 to 5300 m day 1 johnson et al 2010 johnson et al 2012 johnson and schindel 2015 with a tortuosity value of two these values would range up to 10 600 m day 1 within the steady state model 77 of simulated groundwater velocities fall within this range indicating the simulated groundwater velocities are reasonable conduit diameter and transfer coefficient Œ± ex varied throughout the model domain calibrated values for conduit diameter ranged from 0 05 to 18 3 m diameter values below 3 m represent constrictions within conduits that were used to account for observed head values in the upland northern portion of the model higher values represent the main southwest to northeast running conduits that feed comal and san marcos springs while direct comparison to measured values is not possible the diameter of the conduit feeding comal springs is calibrated at 18 3 m which is within the most probable range of 5 30 m identified for that conduit based on tracer test data worthington 2003 finally calibrated values for Œ± ex varied from 0 to 6 1 m day 1 with higher values indicating increased flux between conduits and the surrounding matrix a scatter plot of observed versus simulated steady state head values is shown in fig 3a the cfpv2 model overestimated the highest observed head values and 9 head values have residuals above 20 m the larger residuals occurred because the observed head values were measured between calendar years 1939 1946 lindgren et al 2004 and are therefore not a synoptic representation of the aquifer at steady state however there are two index wells bexar and uvalde counties with sufficient data to represent the aquifer at steady state the residuals for the bexar and uvalde county index wells were 0 4 and 0 3 m respectively this coupled with the fact that 123 of 144 residuals are less than 1 m indicates acceptable simulation of hydraulic heads the calibration statistics for the steady state model are shown in table 2 the scaled rmse and percent error for springflow at the major springs comal and san marcos are lower than the target value of 10 indicating acceptable model performance for aquifer head values and streamflow to major springs the percent error values for leona san antonio and san pedro springs exceed the target value however the error for leona springs is comparable to the error in the epm lindgren et al 2004 and likely results from significant uncertainty of discharge estimates in leona springs green et al 2008 for san antonio and san pedro springs it is important to note that in the original epm these two springs are not located within high conductivity cells used to simulate conduits therefore in the cfpv2 model they were simulated with modflow s drain package rather than by conduits furthermore in the original epm the errors for san antonio and san pedro springs also exceeded the target values with a combined reported error of 47 lindgren et al 2004 this was attributed to a lack of available data to perform calibration on these springs lindgren et al 2004 the volumetric budget listed in table 3 show the percent error is well below 1 further indicating acceptable model performance based on the alignment of calibrated conduit parameters with published values and acceptable calibration statistics for head values and major springs the steady state model calibration was determined to be acceptable 4 2 transient model the calibrated recharge adjustment factors for the transient hydrologic model are similar to those used by the eaa liu et al 2017 with a few exceptions first the eaa increases recharge in the nueces west nueces basin by a factor of 1 048 for all stress periods in the cfpv2 model this factor is only applied in wet years 2002 2004 and 2007 annual recharge is greater than 1727 mm3 additionally in the cfpv2 recharge in the nueces west nueces basin is reduced by a factor of 1 2 in dry years 2006 2008 and 2009 second the eaa increases recharge in the frio dry frio basin by 1 011 in all stress periods this increase was not applied in the cfpv2 model in the blanco river basin recharge in the cfpv2 model was reduced by a factor of 1 2 in wet and normal years with the exception of 2007 and by a factor of 2 3 in dry years finally for the study area swat recharge estimates were used in lieu of usgs recharge estimates the scatter plot of observed versus simulated heads for the transient simulation fig 3b shows very good agreement with no apparent over or under estimation bias similarly the spring hydrographs for the major springs comal and san marcos show close agreement over the study period figs 4a and 4b further while the maximum absolute springflow errors for comal and san marcos springs are 4 1 m3 s 1 and 2 9 m3 s 1 respectively these values are below the maximum acceptable absolute springflow error of 4 25 m3 s 1 established by the eaa liu et al 2017 for hueco springs fig 4c the modeled discharge values have a slower recession and tend to underestimate discharge during periods of peak flow the delayed recession likely occurs from water moving from the matrix to the conduit in the model due to the model overestimating head values near the conduit the underestimation of springflow peaks is due to uncertainties in recharge estimates for the remaining minor springs san pedro springs show the closest agreement between observed and simulated values figs 4d 4f the model tends to underestimate discharge in wet years and overestimate discharge in dry years for minor springs performance statistics for the transient hydrologic model are shown in table 2 and the volumetric budget is shown in table 3 the data in table 2 demonstrate that the cfp model outperforms the original epm at predicting head values as well as springflows for comal and san marcos springs with the exception of san antonio springs percent error all statistics indicate acceptable model performance consistent with prior modeling efforts lindgren 2006 the cfpv2 model is more accurate at simulating flow at major springs than minor springs as discussed with the steady state model san antonio springs are not located on a conduit in the model and were not the focus of the calibration effort furthermore continuous flow data is not available for san antonio san pedro or leona springs for san antonio and san pedro springs periodic springflow measurements were available while the model output consists of average daily springflows over the course of the month long stress period in the case of leona springs the target values are a combination of measured springflow and estimated discharge to the leona gravel formation the lack of continuous springflow data for these springs represents a source of error in the target springflow values the model calibration was successful as indicated by the scaled rmse for matrix heads and the percent springflow error for major springs comal and san marco being below the target value of 10 a further indication of successful calibration is the volumetric budget error being well below 1 harbaugh 2005 4 3 cmt3d model the calibrated value for longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l of 18 3 m is higher than the reported value 10 m for a previous use of umt3d xu et al 2015 however it is within the range of high to intermediate reliability values reported in an analysis of multiple studies gelhar et al 1992 the calibrated ratio of Œ± l to Œ± th is 0 1 which equals the recommended maximum value zheng and wang 1999 the value of the molecular diffusion coefficient was 1 47 10 4 m2 day 1 plots of observed versus simulated nitrate values for the springs fig 5a c show reasonable agreement between observed and simulated values however the model is unable to simulate low nitrate values which result during extreme rain events this is because the model output represents monthly average nitrate values for a grid cell while the observed values represent point samples this model behavior is consistent with previous research efforts jiang and somers 2009 a comparison of the model nitrate output for hueco springs to the output for comal and san marcos springs shows higher variability and more rapid change in nitrate values for hueco springs this is expected because hueco springs recharge is limited to a small local area while comal and san marcos springs are regional springs the nitrate pbias values table 4 for the springs all indicate acceptable model performance and are classified as very good moriasi et al 2007 the nme values are comparable to those reported by zhang and hiscock 2016 and are indicative of acceptable model performance similarly the two tailed t tests indicate the difference between the means of observed and simulated nitrate values for the springs are not statistically significant p 0 05 simulated groundwater values were compared against nitrate samples from 40 wells within the study area this comparison was complicated by three factors first the wells were sampled sporadically for nitrate second the model only outputs nitrate results at the grid cell level and cannot simulate at smaller scales this limitation is illustrated when comparing wells 68301gv and 68301re which are located in the same grid cell during stress period 115 a nitrate observation from well 68301gv was 10 2 mg n l 1 while an observation for well 68301re was 3 2 mg n l 1 third most of the wells are located within the artesian zone of the aquifer where their nitrate values will be influenced by water flowing from outside the study area the impact of this was assessed by evaluating the accuracy of simulated groundwater nitrate values by distance from the portion of the recharge zone within the study area this is the portion of the model utilizing swat estimated nitrate recharge values the calibration statistics in table 5 indicate the model accurately predicts groundwater nitrate values in wells within 1000 m of the recharge zone in the study area while the me tends to fluctuate with distance from the recharge zone in the study area the mae tends to increase with distance indicating decreasing model accuracy this is corroborated by the two tailed t test indicating the difference between the means of observed and simulated nitrate values are statistically significant p 0 05 when evaluating groundwater nitrate values within 3000 m of recharge zone in the study area despite this limitation the model was able to accurately predict groundwater nitrate values in wells within 1000 m of recharge zone in the study area 4 4 sensitivity analysis two separate sensitivity analyses were conducted using pest one for the conduit parameters and one for the contaminant transport parameters in cmt3d pest calculates the composite sensitivity of each parameter where the composite sensitivity represents the parameter s sensitivity normalized by the number of observations doherty 2016 the pest sensitivity analysis for conduit parameters indicated the model is most sensitive to tortuosity followed by conduit diameter and conduit matrix transfer coefficient Œ± ex these results differ slightly from previous research where head and springflow values were most sensitive to conduit diameter followed by tortuosity and Œ± ex gallegos et al 2013 this difference is likely due to the previous study evaluating hydraulic head and springflow calibration target sensitivities separately while the current study conducted a single sensitivity analysis that included all calibration targets the pest sensitivity analysis for cmt3d parameters revealed the model has a low sensitivity to dispersivity but is most sensitive to Œ± th followed by Œ± l and is not sensitive to the molecular diffusion value these sensitivity results are consistent with those found in the woodville karst plain in the usa xu et al 2015 and the sherwood sandstone aquifer in great britain zhang and hiscock 2016 4 5 potential nitrate sources the previously developed swat model identified sources of nitrate input to the study area as well as nitrate yield to area streams from these sources these percentages were applied to the cmt3d model input to identify the percentage of total nitrate input within the study area from losing streams soil leaching and on site sewage facility ossf injection wells table 6 in typical years the majority of nitrate input comes from soil leaching followed by losing streams with ossf injection wells representing a small portion of the nitrate input this is consistent with the conceptualization of how the majority of nitrate enters the edwards aquifer musgrove et al 2010 as well as other karst aquifers peterson et al 2002 however in the dry years of 2006 and 2008 losing streams and ossf injection wells combined to contribute more nitrate to the aquifer than soil leaching due to reduced water infiltration through the soil matrix the estimated contribution from atmospheric deposition is comparable to the value of 25 reported for a karst aquifer in germany einsiedl and mayer 2006 table 6 also indicates that on average 59 of nitrate entering the aquifer arises from anthropogenic sources agriculture wastewater and urban this is consistent with an aquifer vulnerability and hazard intensity index hii study conducted on the edwards aquifer which indicated areas of highest hii were located near areas of human activity sullivan and gao 2017 previous assessments of nitrate in the edwards aquifer also identified human activity as a likely cause of elevated nitrate levels musgrove et al 2011 musgrove et al 2016 opsahl et al 2017 when looking at the entire edwards aquifer isotopic analysis indicated human and or animal waste might be the cause of increasing nitrate levels musgrove et al 2016 this assessment is consistent with results in the study area where 56 2 of nitrate input is estimated to come from human and animal waste farm fertilizer use was previously classified as unlikely to be a notable source of nitrate contamination musgrove et al 2016 within the study area farm fertilizer use did account for 8 5 of nitrate input however farm fertilizer use decreased significantly during the study period 2000 2010 sullivan and gao 2016 overall the identified nitrate sources are similar to nitrate estimates in a karst aquifer in the city of guiyang china liu et al 2006 as well as in an agricultural portion of the upper floridan aquifer eller and katz 2017 this similarity is likely due to all three watersheds containing mixtures of agricultural and urban land uses 5 conclusions nitrate fate and transport within the karstic edwards aquifer were successfully simulated using swat cfpv2 and cmt3d groundwater flow input for the cmt3d model was supplied by the cfpv2 model while nitrate concentration input for the study area was supplied by the swat model hydrologic calibration results demonstrate the cfpv2 model more accurately represents springflow at major springs and head values throughout the aquifer cmt3d model inputs indicate the predominant mechanism for nitrate to enter the edwards aquifer is soil leaching which is consistent with existing conceptual models results also show anthropogenic sources make up 59 of nitrate input with agricultural activities comprising the bulk of this input the cmt3d model developed for this study does suffer from two primary limitations first it is not able to model phenomena occurring at scales smaller than the size of the model grid while this limitation can be addressed by decreasing the grid size doing so would significantly increase the computational burden and model run times second simulated nitrate values are only calibrated for sample locations within 1000 m of the recharge zone in the study area this is because the swat model used to provide estimated recharge nitrate concentrations only covers one of the nine recharge basins in the san antonio segment of the edwards aquifer at distances farther than 1000 m from the study area swat model calibrated nitrate inputs from the study area mix with average nitrate inputs from the rest of the aquifer which limits the accuracy of the simulated nitrate concentrations future research efforts to model nitrate in adjacent watersheds should mitigate this limitation despite these factors the cmt3d model was successfully calibrated this study provides a tool for watershed managers to assess potential sources of elevated nitrate within karst aquifers identifying likely sources and mechanisms of nitrate infiltration allows watershed managers to target management practices aimed at lowering nitrate inputs to the identified nitrate sources in the case of high localized nitrate readings the results provide watershed managers with a starting point to assess the likelihood that one of the predominant sources identified is contributing to the elevated readings 6 declarations of

6524,presented in this paper is a theoretical and numerical analysis for active particles in a fully developed steady wetland flow dominated by the free surface effect an ecological risk assessment model for the concentration distribution of active particles is devised as an extension of the general form of concentration transport equation for passive particles in wetland flows the vorticity in the free surface wetland flow is found to depend on the dimensionless parameter Œ± which reflects the combined action of vertical momentum dispersion microscopic curvature of flow passages friction of vegetation and water depth the large Œ± results in the decrease of vorticity at the free surface and the increase at the bed bottom the analytical solution of stable concentration distribution is rigorously derived for the active particles in both weak and strong vortical flows under the combined action of the effective mass dispersion by the ambient flow as well as the translational diffusion and vertical swimming by the active particles it is found that the strong vorticity weakens the concentration of active particles in the free surface wetland flow while the strong diffusion by the

active particles pedley and kessler 1990 1992 hill and bees 2002 bearon et al 2011 goldstein 2015 regarding the concentration distribution of active particles there have been various theoretical experimental and numerical investigations with focus on the distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in typical flows in the absence of vegetation such as the flow through a vertical tube or channel kessler 1985 1986 hwang and pedley 2014 the horizontal shear flow between two parallel walls durham et al 2009 2013 the flow in a rotating cylindrical vessel lillo et al 2014 the density stratified

the distribution of active particles in the wetland flow have not been understood very well very recently zeng and pedley 2018 investigated the concentration distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in the flow past a single vertical circular cylinder which is a simple proxy of the flow through the wetland with sparse vegetation a reliable ecological risk assessment and ecological restoration in the wetland flow requires a reasonable understanding of the behavior of both active and passive particles however the current analytical efforts mainly focus on the distribution of passive particles and up to now no analytical solution has been presented to predict the concentration distribution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow this work is to investigate the concentration distribution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow the active particles considered here are gyrotactic micro organisms which widely exist in wetlands many significant ecological phenomena are caused by gyrotactic micro organisms for example the red tide in the coastal region is often caused by the massive growth and accumulation of heterosigma akashiwo the specific objects are i to formulate the typical case of concentration evolution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow ii to obtain the analytical solution of vorticity in the free surface wetland flow iii to find the concrete expression for stable distribution of active particles in both weak and strong vortical flows and iv to determine the effects of typical parameters on the stable concentration distribution and the time scale to reach the stable status 2 formulation in the present work the term active particles refers to the gyrotactic micro organisms which execute directional or random motions by rotating waving or undulating flagella while the term passive particles refers to the non living particles without the ability to convert its internal energy to kinetic motion for example mineral particles the governing equation for the concentration transport of active particles in the wetland flow can be adopted at the phase average scale as liu et al 2005 chen et al 2010 chen 2013 1 œï c t x i u i u i s c x i Œ∫ Œª œï c x i Œ∫ x i k ij œï Œª ij s c x j where œï dimensionless is porosity c kg m 3 the concentration of active particles t s time x i m and x j m the spatial coordinates i j 1 2 3 u i m s 1 the velocity component of ambient flow u i s m s 1 the velocity component of active particles swimming Œ∫ dimensionless the tortuosity Œª m 2 s 1 the mass diffusivity k ij m 2 s 1 the component of mass dispersivity tensor caused by the wetland flow and Œª ij s m 2 s 1 the component of translational diffusivity tensor caused by active particles the diffusion term k ij exists for both passive and active particles the term Œª ij s is related to the rate of strain vorticity as well as cells morphology in general the term Œª ij s varies with position for a velocity profile with spatially varying rate of strain and vorticity however for the spherical gyrotactic cells Œª ij s is only dependent on the vorticity as the first step of theoretical analysis of the distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in the wetland flow the micro organisms considered in the present work are approximately spherical micro organisms such as chlamydomonas dunaliella etc which are found in many important ecological phenomena associated with wetland flows for example harmful algal blooms furthermore the contribution of Œª ij s to the concentration distribution of micro organisms is mainly related to its diagonal components rather than its off diagonal components since the latter are much less than the former also the existence of horizontal vorticity can weaken the difference between the horizontal components Œª xx s and Œª yy s and vertical component Œª zz s for the case of large ambient vorticity Œª xx s Œª yy s Œª zz s even for the case of vorticity equal to zero Œª zz s is still comparable to the horizontal components it is noted that the strong vorticity can change the mean swimming velocity greatly resulting in the large variation of concentration distribution of micro organisms many active particles say chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit the behavior of diel vertical migration diurnal vertical migration that the active particles swim upwards for photosynthesis in the daytime and settle down to gain nutrients at light consider a fully developed steady free surface wetland flow with constant œï Œ∫ k ij and Œª zz s in the cartesian coordinate system with the longitudinal x axis aligned with the flow direction the vertical z axis upwards and the origin at the bottom bed as shown in fig 1 consider the concentration distribution of active particles with the initial concentration zero in the free surface wetland flow caused by the upward migration of the active particles from the bottom layer with constant concentration c 0 the concentration distribution is uniform in the streamwise direction and the governing equation eq 1 reduces to 2 c t 1 œï w s c z Œ∫ Œª Œª zz s k v œï 2 c z 2 where w s m s 1 is the vertical swimming

the water depth which means that the active particles cannot escape from the water body through the free surface with dimensionless parameters of 4 œâ c c 0 œÑ h 2 Œ∫ Œª Œª zz s k v œï Œ∂ z h œà v r w s v s where v s m s 1 denotes the swimming speed of active particles the governing equation boundary conditions and initial conditions for the concentration distribution can be rewritten as 5 œâ œÑ pe

relative importance of active particles swimming and vertical translational diffusion and d cw dimensionless reflects the relative strength of the effective mass dispersion in the vertical direction due to the wetland flow and the vertical translational diffusion due to particles swimming 3 vorticity distribution in the free surface wetland flow for the swimming of gyrotactic micro organisms vorticity œâ m 1 is an important indicator to influence the swimming velocity and direction especially for the spherical gyrotactic micro organisms pedley and kessler 1992 for the weak vorticity field the active particles can swim upwards in the non vertical direction while for the strong voriticity filed they tumble unsteadily vorticity is a pseudo vector field to reflect the local spinning motion of a continuum defined as œâ u where is the del operator for the free surface wetland flow the vertical velocity profile has been given by zeng and chen 2011 7 u Œ∂ u m cosh Œ± cosh Œ± 1 Œ∂ Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± Œ± where u m m s 1 is the depth averaged velocity and Œ± is a dimensionless parameter to represent the combined action of vertical momentum dispersion microscopic curvature of flow passage friction of vegetation as well as water depth therefore the dimensionless vorticity œâ r for the free surface wetland flow can be expressed as 8 œâ r œâ 1 b œâ 0 Œ± 2 sinh Œ± 1 Œ∂ Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± where b s is the gyrotactic parameter to reflect the time scale for reorientation of active particles by the gravitational torque against the viscous torque exerted by the shear of ambient flow and œâ 0 bu m h reflects the relative strength of the flow shear and reorientation of active particles fig 2 a presents the variation of œâ r with Œ∂ for various Œ± the maximum vorticity œâ r max œâ 0 Œ± 2 sinh Œ± Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± always appears at the bed bottom while the minimum vorticity œâ r min 0 always exists at the free water surface in contrast to the dependence of the maximum vorticity on Œ± the minimum vorticity keeps constant œâ r increases with the increase of Œ± for the region near the free water surface while it decreases for the region near the bottom fig 2 b presents the variation of œâ r with Œ∂ for various œâ 0 it is shown that the larege œâ 0 can enhance the vorticity in the whole region 4 stable distribution of active particles in the weak vortical flow for the long time evolution of passive particles the concentration distribution can reach a asymptotic stable status further more the swimming velocity of gyrotactic micro organisms for the weak vorticity flow of b œâ 1 can be expressed in the present notation as pedley and kessler 1990 9 u s v s b œâ y j 1 b œâ x j 1 œà 0 where œâ x m 1 and œâ y m 1 are the horizontal components of œâ and j 1 dimensionless and œà 0 dimensionless are the parameters associated with b and d r m 2 s 1 where d r is the rotary diffusivity to reflect the randomness of active particles œà 0 can be expressed as pedley and kessler 1990 10 œà 0 coth Œª 1 œÉ œÉ 1 bd r where œÉ represents the relative strength of cells reorientation and rotary diffusion the large œÉ means the relative strong gyrotaxis while the small œÉ is corresponding to the strong randomness j 1 can be expressed in the present notation as pedley and kessler 1990 11 j 1 œÄ œÉ 2 4 œÄ œÉ sinh œÉ 1 1 1 Œ∑ 2 1 2 g 1 Œ∑ d Œ∑ where Œ∑ is the integral variable and g 1 Œ∑ is subject to 12 d d q 1 Œ∑ 2 g 1 g 1 1 Œ∑ 2 œÉ d d q 1 Œ∑ 2 g 1 œÉ 1 Œ∑ 2 1 2 exp œÉ Œ∑ where g 1 denotes for the differentiation of g 1 with respect to q cos Œ∏ with Œ∏ standing for the polar angle in the spherical coordinate system in which Œ∏ 0 is vertically upward therefore for the case of weak vortical flow of 13 œâ 0 Œ± 2 sinh Œ± 1 Œ∂ Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± 1 the vertical swimming velocity is independent of position and the definite problem described by eq 5 can be simplified as 14 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà 0 d œâ d Œ∂ d 2 œâ d Œ∂ 2 œâ Œ∂ 0 1 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà 0 œâ d œâ d Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 0 eq 14 is a second order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients and its solution is 15 œâ Œ∂ exp pe œà 0 Œ∂ where pe pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ reflects the relative strength of the mean swimming and the total diffusion including the effective mass dispersion in the vertical direction caused by the wetland flow and the vertical translational diffusion caused by the active particles the concentration distribution of active particles is subject to the exponential distribution in the weak shear flow the concentration at the free surface increases with the increase of upward swimming velocity because the large vertical swimming velocity means the large pe s for a given wetland flow for the case of positive œà 0 the concentration of active particles increases with Œ∂ although active particles swim upward continuously the concentration at the free surface cannot increase indefinitely due to the diffusive effects by the active particles and the wetland flow for the case of negative œà 0 which represents the settling of active particles the concentration decreases with the increasing Œ∂ for the limiting case of œà 0 0 eq 19 reduces to œâ Œ∂ 1 which implies that the concentration of non motile particles eventually reach uniform distribution in the vertical direction 5 stable distribution of active particles in the strong vortical flow for the case of strong vortical flow œâ does not satisfy the condition of b œâ 1 and the effect of horizontal vorticity on the vertical swimming velocity cannot be neglected in general the vertical swimming velocity varies with Œ∂ for the strong vortical flow and the definite problem described by eq 5 reduces to 16 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà v r d œâ d Œ∂ œâ d œà v r d Œ∂ d 2 œâ d Œ∂ 2 œâ Œ∂ 0 1 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà v r œâ d œâ d Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 0 in contrast to the concentration distribution of active particles in the weak vortical flow in which the vertical swimming influences the concentration distribution only by the vertical variation of cells concentration an additional term source term œâ d œà v r d Œ∂ appears for the strong vortical flow due to the variation of vertical swimming velocity solving eq 16 gives 17 œâ Œ∂ c 1 1 0 exp 1 0 pe œà v r d Œ∂ d Œ∂ c 2 exp 1 Œ∂ pe œà v r d Œ∂ where c 1 and c 2 are the undetermined constants related to the concentration boundary conditions at the free surface and bed bottom substituting the concentration boundary conditions in eq 16 into eq 17 yields 18 c 1 0 c 2 exp 1 0 pe œà v r d Œ∂ therefore the concentration distribution of active particles in the strong vortical flow can be expressed as 19 œâ Œ∂ exp 0 Œ∂ pe œà v r d Œ∂ which means that the concentration of active particles at Œ∂ is independent of swimming in the region above Œ∂ to illustrate the effects of pe Œ± and œâ 0 on the concentration distribution of active particles chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been chosen in the present work the swimming velocity of chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be expressed in the present notation as liu 2018 20 œà v r a 0 a 1 exp a 3 a 4 œâ r 1 exp a 2 a 4 œâ r 1 exp a 3 a 4 œâ r 0 œâ r b 0 a 5 œâ r a 6 b 0 œâ r b 1 where a 0 4 700 10 2 a 1 9 800 10 1 a 2 2 807 10 6 a 3 2 577 10 6 a 4 8 936 10 1 a 5 9 255 10 1 a 6 1 829 b 0 4 089 and b 1 5 918 10 1 in general the size of a gyrotactic micro organism is much less than that of stem spacing in a typical free surface wetland the mean diameter of most gyrotactic mirco organisms lies in the range of 1 Œº m 200 Œº m while in general the size of the stem spacing lies on the order of 1 cm and 10 cm for the free surface wetland therefore the expression of swimming velocity eq 20 for micro organisms in free space can be adopted however it may be not a reasonable choice for porous media with the size of pores comparable to the size of a micro organism for the case of œâ r b 1 the vertical swimming velocity tends to approach constant zero similar results have been reported for heterosigma akashiwo in a three dimensional vorticity field chen et al 2018 the reason is that the strong horizontal vorticity causes micro organisms to tumble some important ecological phenomena for example formation of thin phytoplankton layer in oceans can be triggered by the strong horizontal vorticity durham et al 2009 fig 3 presents the variation of œâ with Œ∂ for various Œ± œâ 0 and pe œâ increases with the increase of Œ± near the free surface while it decreases with the increasing Œ± near the bed bottom as shown in fig 3 a the strong ambient vorticity results in a small concentration as shown in fig 3 b since the strong vorticity weakens the vertical swimming velocity of active particles œâ increases with the increase of pe as shown in fig 3 c because the large pe represents a strong effective vertical diffusion for a given swimming velocity 6 time scale for active particles to reach the asymptotic stable distribution for the time evolution of active particles during the initial stage œâ varies with the vertical position Œ∂ and time œÑ here the finite difference method is employed to compute the concentration distribution fig 4 presents the variation of œâ with œÑ for Œ∂ 0 5 a pe 1 0 and œâ 0 1 0 b Œ± 1 0 and pe 1 0 and c Œ± 1 0 and œâ 0 1 0 it is shown that the concentration of active particles gradually increases to reach a stable status under the combined action of vertical swimming the translational diffusion by the active particles as well as the effective mass dispersion by the wetland flow which is similar to the asymptotic characteristics of concentration transport of passive particles in the free surface wetland flow chen et al 2010 zeng and chen 2011 the time scale t 0 s for the concentration distribution to reach the stable status is mainly influenced by pe t 0 increases with the increase of pe while it decreases with the increase of œâ 0 the reason is that the large pe implies the strong vertical swimming or the weak vertical diffusion t 0 is not sensitive to the variation of Œ± for the given parameters pe and b 7 conclusions with essential implications to ecological risk assessments and restoration associated with wetlands a typical case of active particles transport in the free surface wetland flow is concretely formulated by extending the basic equation of concentration transport adopted for passive particles in wetland flows it is found that the vorticity for the free surface wetland flow depends on two dimensionless parameters Œ± and œâ 0 the large Œ± can enhance the vorticity near the free water surface while it weakens the vorticity near the bed bottom the vorticity always increases with the increase of œâ 0 for the large œâ 0 the gyrotactic micro organisms probably tumble unsteadily the solution of concentration distribution of active particles is derived rigorously for the free surface wetland flow with weak vorticity results show that the concentration of active particle is subject to an exponential distribution the upward swimming results in the special distribution pattern of particles with high concentration at the free surface and low concentration at the bed bottom for the limiting case of œà 0 0 the active particles distribute uniformly through the whole depth due to the total diffusion by the wetland flow and the active particles the concentration distribution of passive particles settling with a constant speed can be included as a special case of negative œà 0 the analytical solution of concentration distribution is also obtained for long time evolution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow with the strong vorticity results show that the concentration distribution of active particles can be expressed in the form of exp 0 Œ∂ pe œà v r d Œ∂ which in general is not subject to the exponential distribution of Œ∂ as in the weak vortical flow the vertical concentration depends on three dimensionless parameters pe Œ± and œâ 0 the large pe and small œâ 0 can enhance the concentration of active particles through the whole water depth however the enhancement of concentration due to the increase of Œ± only occurs near the free surface which is consistent with the effect of Œ± on the vorticity distribution numerical results show that the time scale t 0 for active particles to reach the stable distribution mainly depends on pe t 0 increases with the increase of pe the analytical solution presented in this work provides one potential way to estimate the concentration distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in the free surface wetland flow which may be useful and meaningful in the qualitative ecological risk assessments associated with harmful algal blooms however the analytical solution of vertical distribution of active particles presented in this work is based on an idealized case in which some simplifications have been made for the flow and micro organisms for example the gyrotactic micro organisms considered here are the spherical micro organisms and the wetland flow considered here is the two dimensional steady flow further work associated with practical flow conditions biological characteristics light temperature and nutrient levels should be performed to predict the harmful algal blooms in a realistic wetland flow conflict of interest none acknowledgments this work is supported by the national key r d program

6524,presented in this paper is a theoretical and numerical analysis for active particles in a fully developed steady wetland flow dominated by the free surface effect an ecological risk assessment model for the concentration distribution of active particles is devised as an extension of the general form of concentration transport equation for passive particles in wetland flows the vorticity in the free surface wetland flow is found to depend on the dimensionless parameter Œ± which reflects the combined action of vertical momentum dispersion microscopic curvature of flow passages friction of vegetation and water depth the large Œ± results in the decrease of vorticity at the free surface and the increase at the bed bottom the analytical solution of stable concentration distribution is rigorously derived for the active particles in both weak and strong vortical flows under the combined action of the effective mass dispersion by the ambient flow as well as the translational diffusion and vertical swimming by the active particles it is found that the strong vorticity weakens the concentration of active particles in the free surface wetland flow while the strong diffusion by the wetland flow and active particles enhances the concentration the large Œ± results in the increase of concentration near the free surface and the decrease of concentration near the bed bottom the time

in the flow past a single vertical circular cylinder which is a simple proxy of the flow through the wetland with sparse vegetation a reliable ecological risk assessment and ecological restoration in the wetland flow requires a reasonable understanding of the behavior of both active and passive particles however the current analytical efforts mainly focus on the distribution of passive particles and up to now no analytical solution has been presented to predict the concentration distribution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow this work is to investigate the concentration distribution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow the active particles considered here are gyrotactic micro organisms which widely exist in wetlands many significant ecological phenomena are caused by gyrotactic micro organisms for example the red tide in the coastal region is often caused by the massive growth and accumulation of heterosigma akashiwo the specific objects are i to formulate the typical case of concentration evolution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow ii to obtain the analytical solution of vorticity in the free surface wetland flow iii to find the concrete expression for stable distribution of active particles in both weak and strong vortical flows and iv to determine the effects of typical parameters on the stable concentration distribution and the time scale to reach the stable status 2 formulation in the present work the term active particles refers to the gyrotactic micro organisms which execute directional or random motions by rotating waving or undulating flagella while the term passive particles refers to the non living particles without the ability to convert its internal energy to kinetic motion for example mineral particles the governing equation for the concentration transport of active particles in the wetland flow can be adopted at the phase average scale as liu et al 2005 chen et al 2010 chen 2013 1 œï c t x i u i u i s c x i Œ∫ Œª œï c x i Œ∫ x i k ij œï Œª ij s c x j where œï dimensionless is porosity c kg m 3 the concentration of active particles t s time x i m and x j m the spatial coordinates i j 1 2 3 u i m s 1 the velocity component of ambient flow u i s m s 1 the velocity component of active particles swimming Œ∫ dimensionless the tortuosity Œª m 2 s 1 the mass diffusivity k ij m 2 s 1 the component of mass dispersivity tensor caused by the wetland flow and Œª ij s m 2 s 1 the component of translational diffusivity tensor caused by active particles the diffusion term k ij exists for both passive and active particles the term Œª ij s is related to the rate of strain vorticity as well as cells morphology in general the term Œª ij s varies with position for a velocity profile with spatially varying rate of strain and vorticity however for the spherical gyrotactic cells Œª ij s is only dependent on the vorticity as the first step of theoretical analysis of the distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in the wetland flow the micro organisms considered in the present work are approximately spherical micro organisms such as chlamydomonas dunaliella etc which are found in many important ecological phenomena associated with wetland flows for example harmful algal blooms furthermore the contribution of Œª ij s to the concentration distribution of micro organisms is mainly related to its diagonal components rather than its off diagonal components since the latter are much less than the former also the existence of horizontal vorticity can weaken the difference between the horizontal components Œª xx s and Œª yy s and vertical component Œª zz s for the case of large ambient vorticity Œª xx s Œª yy s Œª zz s even for the case of vorticity equal to zero Œª zz s is still comparable to the horizontal components it is noted that the strong vorticity can change the mean swimming velocity greatly resulting in the large variation of concentration distribution of micro organisms many active particles say chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit the behavior of diel vertical migration diurnal vertical migration that the active particles swim upwards for photosynthesis in the daytime and settle down to gain nutrients at light consider a fully developed steady free surface wetland flow with constant œï Œ∫ k ij and Œª zz s in the cartesian coordinate system with the longitudinal x axis aligned with the flow direction the vertical z axis upwards and the origin at the bottom bed as shown in fig 1 consider the concentration distribution of active particles with the initial concentration zero in the free surface wetland flow caused by the upward migration of the active particles from the bottom layer with constant concentration c 0 the concentration distribution is uniform in the streamwise direction and the governing equation eq 1 reduces to 2 c t 1 œï w s c z Œ∫ Œª Œª zz s k v œï 2 c z 2 where w s m s 1 is the vertical swimming velocity of active particles and k v m 2 s 1 is the vertical mass dispersivity for the free water surface we have zero flux boundary condition 3 w s c œï Œ∫ Œª Œª zz s k v œï c z z h 0 where h m is the water depth which means that the active particles cannot escape from the water body through the free surface with dimensionless parameters of 4 œâ c c 0 œÑ h 2 Œ∫ Œª Œª zz s k v œï Œ∂ z h œà v r w

relative importance of active particles swimming and vertical translational diffusion and d cw dimensionless reflects the relative strength of the effective mass dispersion in the vertical direction due to the wetland flow and the vertical translational diffusion due to particles swimming 3 vorticity distribution in the free surface wetland flow for the swimming of gyrotactic micro organisms vorticity œâ m 1 is an important indicator to influence the swimming velocity and direction especially for the spherical gyrotactic micro organisms pedley and kessler 1992 for the weak vorticity field the active particles can swim upwards in the non vertical direction while for the strong voriticity filed they tumble unsteadily vorticity is a pseudo vector field to reflect the local spinning motion of a continuum defined as œâ u where is the del operator for the free surface wetland flow the vertical velocity profile has been given by zeng and chen 2011 7 u Œ∂ u m cosh Œ± cosh Œ± 1 Œ∂ Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± Œ± where u m m s 1 is the depth averaged velocity and Œ± is a dimensionless parameter to represent the combined action of vertical momentum dispersion microscopic curvature of flow passage friction of vegetation as well as water depth therefore the dimensionless vorticity œâ r for the free surface wetland flow can be expressed as 8 œâ r œâ 1 b œâ 0 Œ± 2 sinh Œ± 1 Œ∂ Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± where b s is the gyrotactic parameter to reflect the time scale for reorientation of active particles by the gravitational torque against the viscous torque exerted by the shear of ambient flow and œâ 0 bu m h reflects the relative strength of the flow shear and reorientation of active particles fig 2 a presents the variation of œâ r with Œ∂ for various Œ± the maximum vorticity œâ r max œâ 0 Œ± 2 sinh Œ± Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± always appears at the bed bottom while the minimum vorticity œâ r min 0 always exists at the free water surface in contrast to the dependence of the maximum vorticity on Œ± the minimum vorticity keeps constant œâ r increases with the increase of Œ± for the region near the free water surface while it decreases for the region near the bottom fig 2 b presents the variation of œâ r with Œ∂ for various œâ 0 it is shown that the larege œâ 0 can enhance the vorticity in the whole region 4 stable distribution of active particles in the weak vortical flow for the long time evolution of passive particles the concentration distribution can reach a asymptotic stable status further more the swimming velocity of gyrotactic micro organisms for the weak vorticity flow of b œâ 1 can be expressed in the present notation as pedley and kessler 1990 9 u s v s b œâ y j 1 b œâ x j 1 œà 0 where œâ x m 1 and œâ y m 1 are the horizontal components of œâ and j 1 dimensionless and œà 0 dimensionless are the parameters associated with b and d r m 2 s 1 where d r is the rotary diffusivity to reflect the randomness of active particles œà 0 can be expressed as pedley and kessler 1990 10 œà 0 coth Œª 1 œÉ œÉ 1 bd r where œÉ represents the relative strength of cells reorientation and rotary diffusion the large œÉ means the relative strong gyrotaxis while the small œÉ is corresponding to the strong randomness j 1 can be expressed in the present notation as pedley and kessler 1990 11 j 1 œÄ œÉ 2 4 œÄ œÉ sinh œÉ 1 1 1 Œ∑ 2 1 2 g 1 Œ∑ d Œ∑ where Œ∑ is the integral variable and g 1 Œ∑ is subject to 12 d d q 1 Œ∑ 2 g 1 g 1 1 Œ∑ 2 œÉ d d q 1 Œ∑ 2 g 1 œÉ 1 Œ∑ 2 1 2 exp œÉ Œ∑ where g 1 denotes for the differentiation of g 1 with respect to q cos Œ∏ with Œ∏ standing for the polar angle in the spherical coordinate system in which Œ∏ 0 is vertically upward therefore for the case of weak vortical flow of 13 œâ 0 Œ± 2 sinh Œ± 1 Œ∂ Œ± cosh Œ± sinh Œ± 1 the vertical swimming velocity is independent of position and the definite problem described by eq 5 can be simplified as 14 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà 0 d œâ d Œ∂ d 2 œâ d Œ∂ 2 œâ Œ∂ 0 1 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà 0 œâ d œâ d Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 0 eq 14 is a second order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients and its solution is 15 œâ Œ∂ exp pe œà 0 Œ∂ where pe pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ reflects the relative strength of the mean swimming and the total diffusion including the effective mass dispersion in the vertical direction caused by the wetland flow and the vertical translational diffusion caused by the active particles the concentration distribution of active particles is subject to the exponential distribution in the weak shear flow the concentration at the free surface increases with the increase of upward swimming velocity because the large vertical swimming velocity means the large pe s for a given wetland flow for the case of positive œà 0 the concentration of active particles increases with Œ∂ although active particles swim upward continuously the concentration at the free surface cannot increase indefinitely due to the diffusive effects by the active particles and the wetland flow for the case of negative œà 0 which represents the settling of active particles the concentration decreases with the increasing Œ∂ for the limiting case of œà 0 0 eq 19 reduces to œâ Œ∂ 1 which implies that the concentration of non motile particles eventually reach uniform distribution in the vertical direction 5 stable distribution of active particles in the strong vortical flow for the case of strong vortical flow œâ does not satisfy the condition of b œâ 1 and the effect of horizontal vorticity on the vertical swimming velocity cannot be neglected in general the vertical swimming velocity varies with Œ∂ for the strong vortical flow and the definite problem described by eq 5 reduces to 16 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà v r d œâ d Œ∂ œâ d œà v r d Œ∂ d 2 œâ d Œ∂ 2 œâ Œ∂ 0 1 pe s 1 d cw œï Œ∫ œà v r œâ d œâ d Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 0 in contrast to the concentration distribution of active particles in the weak vortical flow in which the vertical swimming influences the concentration distribution only by the vertical variation of cells concentration an additional term source term œâ d œà v r d Œ∂ appears for the strong vortical flow due to the variation of vertical swimming velocity solving eq 16 gives 17 œâ Œ∂ c 1 1 0 exp 1 0 pe œà v r d Œ∂ d Œ∂ c 2 exp 1 Œ∂ pe œà v r d Œ∂ where c 1 and c 2 are the undetermined constants related to the concentration boundary conditions at the free surface and bed bottom substituting the concentration boundary conditions in eq 16 into eq 17 yields 18 c 1 0 c 2 exp 1 0 pe œà v r d Œ∂ therefore the concentration distribution of active particles in the strong vortical flow can be expressed as 19 œâ Œ∂ exp 0 Œ∂ pe œà v r d Œ∂ which means that the concentration of active particles at Œ∂ is independent of swimming in the region above Œ∂ to illustrate the effects of pe Œ± and œâ 0 on the concentration distribution of active particles chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been chosen in the present work the swimming velocity of chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be expressed in the present notation as liu 2018 20 œà v r a 0 a 1 exp a 3 a 4 œâ r 1 exp a 2 a 4 œâ r 1 exp a 3 a 4 œâ r 0 œâ r b 0 a 5 œâ r a 6 b 0 œâ r b 1 where a 0 4 700 10 2 a 1 9 800 10 1 a 2 2 807 10 6 a 3 2 577 10 6 a 4 8 936 10 1 a 5 9 255 10 1 a 6 1 829 b 0 4 089 and b 1 5 918 10 1 in general the size of a gyrotactic micro organism is much less than that of stem spacing in a typical free surface wetland the mean diameter of most gyrotactic mirco organisms lies in the range of 1 Œº m 200 Œº m while in general the size of the stem spacing lies on the order of 1 cm and 10 cm for the free surface wetland therefore the expression of swimming velocity eq 20 for micro organisms in free space can be adopted however it may be not a reasonable choice for porous media with the size of pores comparable to the size of a micro organism for the case of œâ r b 1 the vertical swimming velocity tends to approach constant zero similar results have been reported for heterosigma akashiwo in a three dimensional vorticity field chen et al 2018 the reason is that the strong horizontal vorticity causes micro organisms to tumble some important ecological phenomena for example formation of thin phytoplankton layer in oceans can be triggered by the strong horizontal vorticity durham et al 2009 fig 3 presents the variation of œâ with Œ∂ for various Œ± œâ 0 and pe œâ increases with the increase of Œ± near the free surface while it decreases with the increasing Œ± near the bed bottom as shown in fig 3 a the strong ambient vorticity results in a small concentration as shown in fig 3 b since the strong vorticity weakens the vertical swimming velocity of active particles œâ increases with the increase of pe as shown in fig 3 c because the large pe represents a strong effective vertical diffusion for a given swimming velocity 6 time scale for active particles to reach the asymptotic stable distribution for the time evolution of active particles during the initial stage œâ varies with the vertical position Œ∂ and time œÑ here the finite difference method is employed to compute the concentration distribution fig 4 presents the variation of œâ with œÑ for Œ∂ 0 5 a pe 1 0 and œâ 0 1 0 b Œ± 1 0 and pe 1 0 and c Œ± 1 0 and œâ 0 1 0 it is shown that the concentration of active particles gradually increases to reach a stable status under the combined action of vertical swimming the translational diffusion by the active particles as well as the effective mass dispersion by the wetland flow which is similar to the asymptotic characteristics of concentration transport of passive particles in the free surface wetland flow chen et al 2010 zeng and chen 2011 the time scale t 0 s for the concentration distribution to reach the stable status is mainly influenced by pe t 0 increases with the increase of pe while it decreases with the increase of œâ 0 the reason is that the large pe implies the strong vertical swimming or the weak vertical diffusion t 0 is not sensitive to the variation of Œ± for the given parameters pe and b 7 conclusions with essential implications to ecological risk assessments and restoration associated with wetlands a typical case of active particles transport in the free surface wetland flow is concretely formulated by extending the basic equation of concentration transport adopted for passive particles in wetland flows it is found that the vorticity for the free surface wetland flow depends on two dimensionless parameters Œ± and œâ 0 the large Œ± can enhance the vorticity near the free water surface while it weakens the vorticity near the bed bottom the vorticity always increases with the increase of œâ 0 for the large œâ 0 the gyrotactic micro organisms probably tumble unsteadily the solution of concentration distribution of active particles is derived rigorously for the free surface wetland flow with weak vorticity results show that the concentration of active particle is subject to an exponential distribution the upward swimming results in the special distribution pattern of particles with high concentration at the free surface and low concentration at the bed bottom for the limiting case of œà 0 0 the active particles distribute uniformly through the whole depth due to the total diffusion by the wetland flow and the active particles the concentration distribution of passive particles settling with a constant speed can be included as a special case of negative œà 0 the analytical solution of concentration distribution is also obtained for long time evolution of active particles in the free surface wetland flow with the strong vorticity results show that the concentration distribution of active particles can be expressed in the form of exp 0 Œ∂ pe œà v r d Œ∂ which in general is not subject to the exponential distribution of Œ∂ as in the weak vortical flow the vertical concentration depends on three dimensionless parameters pe Œ± and œâ 0 the large pe and small œâ 0 can enhance the concentration of active particles through the whole water depth however the enhancement of concentration due to the increase of Œ± only occurs near the free surface which is consistent with the effect of Œ± on the vorticity distribution numerical results show that the time scale t 0 for active particles to reach the stable distribution mainly depends on pe t 0 increases with the increase of pe the analytical solution presented in this work provides one potential way to estimate the concentration distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms in the free surface wetland flow which may be useful and meaningful in the qualitative ecological risk assessments associated with harmful algal blooms however the analytical solution of vertical distribution of active particles presented in this work is based on an idealized case in which some simplifications have been made for the flow and micro organisms for example the gyrotactic micro organisms considered here are the spherical micro organisms and the wetland flow considered here is the two dimensional steady flow further work associated with practical flow conditions biological characteristics light temperature and nutrient levels should be performed to predict the harmful algal blooms in a realistic wetland flow conflict of interest none acknowledgments this work is supported by the national key r d program
