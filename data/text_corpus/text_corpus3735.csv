purchased from sigma aldrich st louis usa sodium chloride hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and other reagents were analytical grade and obtained without further purification all solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω cm 1 millipore corp ma usa commercial flat sheet polyethersulfone pes micro filtration membrane was obtained from nadir corp the membrane mp005 microdyn nadir usa had a nominal pore size of 0 05 μm before being installed into a filter holder cartridge surface area of 9 62 cm2 a membrane disk shaped sample with a 47 mm diameter was cut from a flat pes membrane sheet soaked in deionized water overnight and carefully rinsed the area of membrane in contact with solution was 5 cm2 membrane tests used solutions containing 10 mg l alginate added as its sodium salt solution ph was adjusted to 7 using hcl or naoh solution ph was monitored using orion versa star ph detector thermo fisher scientific usa ionic strength was controlled by adding requisite amounts of sodium chloride stock solutions tmp measurements were carried out for 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m ionic strengths the membrane unit was operated under a constant flux mode 100 l m 2hr 1 lmh the flow was controlled using a constant flow peristaltic pump which was calibrated via adjusting the rate every hour to avoid the fouling response effect the inlet of the filter cartridge was connected to a pressure transducer omega engineering ct usa by a y junction and subsequently connected to a data logger linked to a desktop computer which was used for data acquisition and processing under the filter cartridge a three way pinch valve was used for outlet sampling and permeate reservoir in a typical filtration run a pes membrane placed in a standard polycarbonate holder was initially exposed to deionized water that was fed to the unit to stabilize the membrane and get control tmp data after reaching a tmp value that was stable for 30 min the feed solution was switched to an alginate solution filtration experiments were conducted using runtimes that ranged from 2 min to above 8 h without stirring during filtrations in the end of each filtration run with a predetermined duration the membrane was withdrawn from the cartridge air dried overnight by employing the similar method in the previous studies until the weight loss of membrane is stable and used for further analyses doumeche et al 2007 howe et al 2002 lujan facundo et al 2015 comparison of tmp results for varying filtration runtimes showed a good reproducibility of the measurements as demonstrated by the data for a 0 001 m ionic strength shown fig s1 in the supplementary information si section measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l japan in the filtrate showed that typically less than 10 of the doc of the feed solution was retained on the membrane surface for the 0 1 m ionic strength solution data not shown weight loss measurements showed that the weight of membrane was stable after 30 60 min of drying atr ftir spectra for the membrane samples were acquired with an ftir vertex 70 instrument bruker usa equipped with a diamond atr element in a typical test the fouling surface of the selected membrane sample was put against the diamond the atr spectra were acquired in a 400 to 4000 cm 1 wavenumber range with a 1 cm 1 wavenumber increment three to five atr spectra were acquired for randomly selected spots on the surface of each membrane sample the data were averaged and numerically processed as described in the sections that follow 3 results and discussion tmp measurements showed fig 1 that the filtration of alginate solution that had a 0 001 m ionic strength resulted in an initially gradual increase of tmp values following which the tmp increased abruptly thus indicating the consolidation of the fouling film and a rapid decrease of its hydraulic permeability data for a 0 01 m ionic strength show consistently lower tmp values compared with those for 0 001 m ionic strength tmp values observed in experiments with 0 01 m alginate solution increased almost linearly with time but no rapidly developing fouling was seen tmp measurements for alginate solution with a 0 1 m ionic strength showed little tmp changes these observations are in agreement with the data of prior research that has demonstrated the occurrence of lower membrane fouling rates at increasing ionic strengths kim and dempsey 2013 lee et al 2017 lee and elimelech 2006 listiarini et al 2009 mi and elimelech 2010 sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 van den brink et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 our results are also consistent with the notion that increases of the ionic strength affect conformations of alginate macromolecules inducing their coiling compressing the electric double layer around these macromolecules and ultimately decreasing their propensity to form fouling layers on membrane surfaces ang et al 2005 lee and elimelech 2006 atr ftir spectra of the membranes exposed to alginate solutions were compared with that of the pristine washed pes membrane whose atr spectrum is shown in fig s2 in the si section the data shown in fig s2 are close to those reported in prior research pihlajamaki et al 1998 they indicate the presence of multiple lines associated with the vibrations of the sulfonic groups in the range of wavenumbers 400 to 1800 cm 1 as well as relatively weak lines associated with anomeric carbon in the range of wavenumbers 2400 to 3800 cm 1 the ftir spectrum in the latter range of wavelength also had weak bands associated with the presence of residual water in the membrane atr spectra of the pes membrane samples generated at varying runtimes and ionic strengths of alginate solutions are exemplified by those for a 0 001 m ionic strength fig 2 similar sets of atr ftir spectra obtained for 0 01 and 0 1 m ionic strengths are shown in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively examination of these spectra indicates that they contain both the lines associated with the molecular vibrations of pes polymer and those associated with the deposited alginate film this is especially evident for 0 001 m and 0 01 m ionic strengths while the changes of the ftir spectra for a 0 1 m ionic strength are subtle this is consistent with the slight changes of the transmembrane pressure tmp in these experiments further interpretation of the atr data makes it necessary to separate the contributions of the vibrations of the membrane substrate and those of the deposited film given that in the atr configuration the intensity of the vibrations of the pes substrate becomes progressively weaker as the thickness of the film deposited on the membrane surface increases the overall ftir spectrum will have contributions of the substrate and the deposited film as described by the following equation 1 a ν 1 α f f v a p e s ν a f f ν in equation 1 a ν a p e s ν and a f f ν are the experimental atr spectrum of the membrane those of the pes substrate without a fouling film and of the fouling film per se respectively α f f v is a dimensionless coefficient that quantifies effects of the fouling film in the intensity of the atr spectrum of the substrate as per this definition when α f f v equals to one the fouling film is either absent or it is too thin to affect the vibration lines of the substrate conversely as the fouling occurs α f f v values increase due to the growth of the fouling film whose presence results in a physical separation between the atr element and the substrate for sufficiently thick fouling layers the value of α f f v becomes close to infinity and the atr spectra will have only the contribution of the fouling film coefficients α f f v are expected to depend on the thickness of the fouling layer and the wavenumber dependent penetration depth denoted henceforth as d p v of the evanescent electromagnetic field generated by the atr element in principle d p v values can be determined by the following equation boccaccio et al 2002 mohr et al 1991 pihlajamaki et al 1998 2 d p v 1 2 π v n 1 s i n 2 ϕ n 2 n 1 2 0 5 in that equation n1 and n2 are the refractive indexes of the sample and the atr element respectively ϕ is the angle of incidence of light in the atr element and ν is the wavenumber calculations that use equation 2 show that for the refraction indexes of diamond and pes hart et al 2002 the penetration depth of the atr evanescent field into the pes substrate changes from ca 10 to 1 μm when the wavenumber increases from 400 to 4000 cm 1 for more complex systems that include both the membrane substrate e g pes layer and a fouling film equation 2 can be processed to derive another expression that allows estimating and separating the contributions of the membrane per se and a fouling film of its surface the apparent thickness of such film estimated based on the data of atr measurements is denoted henceforth as d f f a p p the term apparent is introduced here to reflect the fact that the atr based determinations of the thickness of surface layers formed on membrane surfaces ultimately need to be compared with those of direct measurements of the thickness of the fouling films further derivation of the equations relevant to this reasoning is given in the si section suffice it to mention here that the overall atr spectrum of a two film system can be shown to be described by the following expression 3 a ν 1 1 d f f a p p v a p e s ν a f f ν this expression signifies that for a two film system with a fouling film deposited on the pes substrate the contribution of the former will decrease with both increasing thicknesses of the fouling film and ir light wavenumbers practical application of the above expression requires that the value of d f f a p p be determined as we argue the sections that follow experimental determination of the d f f a p p values can be made based on the comparison of the change of indicative lines in the atr spectrum of pes as a function of ir light wavenumber we demonstrate here that determination of d f f a p p can be done via the quantitation of the attenuation of the characteristic ir lines of pes polymer at increasing thicknesses of the fouling layer to suppress the influence of the background ir absorption present in the vicinity of the characteristic pes lines we calculated the derivatives of the atr spectra shown in fig 2 changes of the intensity of these derivatives located in the ranges of a number of ir lines characteristic for pes e g 560 cm 1 assigned to so2 vibration 720 cm 1 1075 cm 1 and 1485 cm 1 assigned to ar so2 ar symmetric stretching vibrations pihlajamaki et al 1998 at varying runtimes are shown in fig 3 fig 3 demonstrates that the intensity of the derivatives of the pes lines in the atr spectra of the fouled membranes decreases with the filtration runtime but the shape of these derivatives remains the same it also shows that the decrease of the intensity of the derivatives becomes more prominent with the increase of the observation wavenumber this is in accord with the assumption that the attenuation coefficient increases with the wavenumber thus equation 4 shown below was used to determine the d f f a p p values based on the linear fitting dependence concerning the ratio of the first derivatives values in the initial pes ir lines to that in the presence of fouling layer 4 d f f a p p 1 v d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v 1 in the above equation d a v p e s d v and d a v f f d v are the values of the derivatives of the reference pes lines in the atr ftir spectra of the pes membrane per se and that with a deposited layer respectively and d f f a p p is the best fit estimate of the slope between d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v ratios and the wavenumbers of the ir radiation correlations between the wavenumber of ir radiation and ratios of the intensities of the first derivatives of the atr spectra fig 3 are presented in fig 4 the values of derivatives used in these figures and employed in subsequent calculations were the averages of the d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v ratios at wavenumbers located on the left and right sides from the zero value of the derivatives corresponding to the maximum of any particular pes reference line shown in fig 3 fig 4 clearly demonstrates the existence of strongly linear correlations between d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v ratios and wavenumbers of the pes reference lines the slope of these correlations increases at longer filtration runtimes which is consistent with the expectation that the apparent thickness of the fouling layer d f f a p p increases in these conditions once d f f a p p values are established as described above the differential atr ftir spectra of the fouling film that is those from which the contributions of the pes substrate have seen removed and only the vibration lines of the fouling film per se remain can be calculated using equation 5 5 a f f ν a ν 1 1 d f f a p p v a p e s ν results of these calculations for the atr spectra are shown in fig 5 and fig s5 for experiments carried out for 0 001 and 0 01 m ionic strengths respectively the differential atr spectra for the samples generated in experiments with a 0 1 m ionic strength alginate solution were much weaker than those for 0 001 m and 0 01 m ionic strengths in agreement with the minimal changes of tmps in the presence of the high salt concentration the data indicate the nearly complete absence of the pes vibrations in the differential spectra albeit some minor residual contributions of these bands for instance nearly the characteristic line at 560 cm 1 can still be observed their presence is caused by the deviations from a perfectly linear fit of the d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v data it is pertinent to mention here that while the apparent thickness and other morphological properties of the hydrogel alginate fouling x2028 layers may be affected by drying process a necessary preparation step for ex situ analyses and the compression during optical contact in atr ftir measurements wang and waite 2008 zhang et al 2018 these steps does not affect the point that the decrease of the substrate contribution to the overall atr spectrum is expected to be inversely proportional to the apparent thickness of the atr film the data shown in fig 5 and fig s5 demonstrate that the profiles of the vibration lines associated with the alginate fouling film do not undergo visually prominent changes as apparent thickness increased although some changes were observed that will be described elsewhere attributions of the observed main lines are shown in fig s6 which largely correspond those discussed in prior research papageorgiou et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 some differences in the positions of these lines are likely to be associated with the structural arrangements of alginate molecules related with their incorporation in the fouling hydrogel layer on the surface of the pes membranes further interpretation of these differences as well as that of the evolution of these lines may be useful for gaining more microscopic level insight into the molecular nature of the fouling films but this option was outside of the scope of this paper the systems of the broad ftir bands located in the wavenumber region 2400 to 3600 cm 1 had only minor contributions of vibrations attributable to anomeric carbon of the alginate in general this band that had local maxima at ca 3200 and 3350 cm 1 is associated with water molecules in the hydrogel surface layer belfer et al 2000 dias et al 1998 drazevic et al 2014 the evolution of the broad bands located in the region 2400 to 3600 cm 1 and associated with the formation of the fouling alginate hydrogel can be explored further to examine the intrinsic properties of such systems which will be pursued elsewhere tam et al 2005 xie et al 2015 given that the intensity of the differential background corrected atr ftir spectra of the surface film and its apparent thickness increase with runtime it was deemed useful to compare the behavior of these spectroscopic indicators with those of the atr these comparisons were carried out for two parameters that included the apparent thickness of the surface layer d f f a p p and the intensity of the atr ftir spectra at 3200 nm 1 the latter parameter may be deemed to be proportional similarly to the independently developed set of d f f a p p values to the apparent thickness of the hydrogel surface films these comparisons showed that the d f f a p p values determined for filtration runs of different duration were reasonably well correlated with tmp increases fig 6 although the correlation for the entire dataset of relevant tmp and d f f a p p values is not linear it has been well accepted that tmp variation might be caused by both cake layers fouling and membrane pores blocking meng et al 2018 however our study here aimed at correlating the overall tmp performance and taking into the various operational conditions like ionic strength directly with the atr ftir results instead of distinguishing the intrinsic cause for the two fouling types in order to propose a visual response for membrane fouling the data that show the relationship between tmp and d f f a p p values for each used ionic strength are presented in fig s7 the latter figure also demonstrates the relationship between the values of atr absorbance at 3200 cm 1 defined mostly by water molecules present in the hydrogel layer and tmp increases in this case the correlation is clearly strongly non linear albeit it deviates from linearity primarily due the presence of the point that correspond to the rapid increase of tmp in the end of filtration of 0 001 m ionic strength alginate solution while the value of atr 3200 cm 1 absorbance does not change proportionally in this case if this point is excluded however the correlation between 3200 cm 1 absorbance and tmp values becomes practically perfectly linear fig 6 the occurrence of the linear correlation between 3200 cm 1 absorbance value of the membrane and tmp values in their range below the onset of rapid fouling and the pronounced deviation from this simple relationship when the hydraulic permeability of the surface film undergoes a steep decrease necessitate a more detailed analysis of the structure of the broad bands located in the 2800 to 3200 cm 1 wavenumber range given the presence of several local maxima in the band e g 2940 3180 3354 cm 1 and the noticeable emergence of the broad structure in the 3050 to 3250 wavenumber range fig 5 and fig s6 it is clear that this band comprises contribution of several types of bound water including those that may be associated with the structural changes of the fouling film when it reaches the point of rapidly developing failure of the hydraulic permeability of the system 4 conclusions this study examined mechanisms of fouling films formation deposited on the surface of a pes membrane during the filtration of alginate solutions that had ionic strengths varying from 0 001 to 0 1 m the atr spectra that comprise the vibration bands characteristic of the pes substrate and the deposited film were processed using a quantitative approach via which the intensity of pes vibration bands in the presence of fouling was found to depend on the wavenumber of ir radiation and apparent thickness d f f a p p of the deposited layer the results presented above showed the existence of a strong correlation between tmp development and d f f a p p values of the fouling layers the data demonstrate the possibility of unambiguously separating the contributions of the system components and determining both the thickness of the deposited layers and the ftir spectra specific to them while more research is needed to further explore the performance of this method applied to other membrane materials alternative model foulants and membranes exposed to actual surface waters or wastewater it can also be argued that the presented method broadens the interpretability of atr ftir data generated in studies concerned with membrane fouling allowing for gaining new insights into its mechanisms declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

pressure transducer omega engineering ct usa by a y junction and subsequently connected to a data logger linked to a desktop computer which was used for data acquisition and processing under the filter cartridge a three way pinch valve was used for outlet sampling and permeate reservoir in a typical filtration run a pes membrane placed in a standard polycarbonate holder was initially exposed to deionized water that was fed to the unit to stabilize the membrane and get control tmp data after reaching a tmp value that was stable for 30 min the feed solution was switched to an alginate solution filtration experiments were conducted using runtimes that ranged from 2 min to above 8 h without stirring during filtrations in the end of each filtration run with a predetermined duration the membrane was withdrawn from the cartridge air dried overnight by employing the similar method in the previous studies until the weight loss of membrane is stable and used for further analyses doumeche et al 2007 howe et al 2002 lujan facundo et al 2015 comparison of tmp results for varying filtration runtimes showed a good reproducibility of the measurements as demonstrated by the data for a 0 001 m ionic strength shown fig s1 in the supplementary information si section measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l japan in the filtrate showed that typically less than 10 of the doc of the feed solution was retained on the membrane surface for the 0 1 m ionic strength solution data not shown weight loss measurements showed that the weight of membrane was stable after 30 60 min of drying atr ftir spectra for the membrane samples were acquired with an ftir vertex 70 instrument bruker usa equipped with a diamond atr element in a typical test the fouling surface of the selected membrane sample was put against the diamond the atr spectra were acquired in a 400 to 4000 cm 1 wavenumber range with a 1 cm 1 wavenumber increment three to five atr spectra were acquired for randomly selected spots on the surface of each membrane sample the data were averaged and numerically processed as described in the sections that follow 3 results and discussion tmp measurements showed fig 1 that the filtration of alginate solution that had a 0 001 m ionic strength resulted in an initially gradual increase of tmp values following which the tmp increased abruptly thus indicating the consolidation of the fouling film and a rapid decrease of its hydraulic permeability data for a 0 01 m ionic strength show consistently lower tmp values compared with those for 0 001 m ionic strength tmp values observed in experiments with 0 01 m alginate solution increased almost linearly with time but no rapidly developing fouling was seen tmp measurements for alginate solution with a 0 1 m ionic strength showed little tmp changes these observations are in agreement with the data of prior research that has demonstrated the occurrence of lower membrane fouling rates at increasing ionic strengths kim and dempsey 2013 lee et al 2017 lee and elimelech 2006 listiarini et al 2009 mi and elimelech 2010 sioutopoulos and karabelas 2016 van den brink et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 our results are also consistent with the notion that increases of the ionic strength affect conformations of alginate macromolecules inducing their coiling compressing the electric double layer around these macromolecules and ultimately decreasing their propensity to form fouling layers on membrane surfaces ang et al 2005 lee and elimelech 2006 atr ftir spectra of the membranes exposed to alginate solutions were compared with that of the pristine washed pes membrane whose atr spectrum is shown in fig s2 in the si section the data shown in fig s2 are close to those reported in prior research pihlajamaki et al 1998 they indicate the presence of multiple lines associated with the vibrations of the sulfonic groups in the range of wavenumbers 400 to 1800 cm 1 as well as relatively weak lines associated with anomeric carbon in the range of wavenumbers 2400 to 3800 cm 1 the ftir spectrum in the latter range of wavelength also had weak bands associated with the presence of residual water in the membrane atr spectra of the pes membrane samples generated at varying runtimes and ionic strengths of alginate solutions are exemplified by those for a 0 001 m ionic strength fig 2 similar sets of atr ftir spectra obtained for 0 01 and 0 1 m ionic strengths are shown in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively examination of these spectra indicates that they contain both the lines associated with the molecular vibrations of pes polymer and those associated with the deposited alginate film this is especially evident for 0 001 m and 0 01 m ionic strengths while the changes of the ftir spectra for a 0 1 m ionic strength are subtle this is consistent with the slight changes of the transmembrane pressure tmp in these experiments further interpretation of the atr data makes it necessary to separate the contributions of the vibrations of the membrane substrate and those of the deposited film given that in the atr configuration the intensity of the vibrations of the pes substrate becomes progressively weaker as the thickness of the film deposited on the membrane surface increases the overall ftir spectrum will have contributions of the substrate and the deposited film as described by the following equation 1 a ν 1 α f f v a p e s ν a f f ν in equation 1 a ν a p e s ν and a f f ν are the experimental atr spectrum of the membrane those of the pes substrate without a fouling film and of the fouling film per se respectively α f f v is a dimensionless coefficient that quantifies effects of the fouling film in the intensity of the atr spectrum of the substrate as per this definition when α f f v equals to one the fouling film is either absent or it is too thin to affect the vibration lines of the substrate conversely as the fouling occurs α f f v values increase due to the growth of the fouling film whose presence results in a physical separation between the atr element and the substrate for sufficiently thick fouling layers the value of α f f v becomes close to infinity and the atr spectra will have only the contribution of the fouling film coefficients α f f v are expected to depend on the thickness of the fouling layer and the wavenumber dependent penetration depth denoted henceforth as d p v of the evanescent electromagnetic field generated by the atr element in principle d p v values can be determined by the following equation boccaccio et al 2002 mohr et al 1991 pihlajamaki et al 1998 2 d p v 1 2 π v n 1 s i n 2 ϕ n 2 n 1 2 0 5 in that equation n1 and n2 are the refractive indexes of the sample and the atr element respectively ϕ is the angle of incidence of light in the atr element and ν is the wavenumber calculations that use equation 2 show that for the refraction indexes of diamond and pes hart et al 2002 the penetration depth of the atr evanescent field into the pes substrate changes from ca 10 to 1 μm when the wavenumber increases from 400 to 4000 cm 1 for more complex systems that include both the membrane substrate e g pes layer and a fouling film equation 2 can be processed to derive another expression that allows estimating and separating the contributions of the membrane per se and a fouling film of its surface the apparent thickness of such film estimated based on the data of atr measurements is denoted henceforth as d f f a p p the term apparent is introduced here to reflect the fact that the atr based determinations of the thickness of surface layers formed on membrane surfaces ultimately need to be compared with those of direct measurements of the thickness of the fouling films further derivation of the equations relevant to this reasoning is given in the si section suffice it to mention here that the overall atr spectrum of a two film system can be shown to be described by the following expression 3 a ν 1 1 d f f a p p v a p e s ν a f f ν this expression signifies that for a two film system with a fouling film deposited on the pes substrate the contribution of the former will decrease with both increasing thicknesses of the fouling film and ir light wavenumbers practical application of the above expression requires that the value of d f f a p p be determined as we argue the sections that follow experimental determination of the d f f a p p values can be made based on the comparison of the change of indicative lines in the atr spectrum of pes as a function of ir light wavenumber we demonstrate here that determination of d f f a p p can be done via the quantitation of the attenuation of the characteristic ir lines of pes polymer at increasing thicknesses of the fouling layer to suppress the influence of the background ir absorption present in the vicinity of the characteristic pes lines we calculated the derivatives of the atr spectra shown in fig 2 changes of the intensity of these derivatives located in the ranges of a number of ir lines characteristic for pes e g 560 cm 1 assigned to so2 vibration 720 cm 1 1075 cm 1 and 1485 cm 1 assigned to ar so2 ar symmetric stretching vibrations pihlajamaki et al 1998 at varying runtimes are shown in fig 3 fig 3 demonstrates that the intensity of the derivatives of the pes lines in the atr spectra of the fouled membranes decreases with the filtration runtime but the shape of these derivatives remains the same it also shows that the decrease of the intensity of the derivatives becomes more prominent with the increase of the observation wavenumber this is in accord with the assumption that the attenuation coefficient increases with the wavenumber thus equation 4 shown below was used to determine the d f f a p p values based on the linear fitting dependence concerning the ratio of the first derivatives values in the initial pes ir lines to that in the presence of fouling layer 4 d f f a p p 1 v d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v 1 in the above equation d a v p e s d v and d a v f f d v are the values of the derivatives of the reference pes lines in the atr ftir spectra of the pes membrane per se and that with a deposited layer respectively and d f f a p p is the best fit estimate of the slope between d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v ratios and the wavenumbers of the ir radiation correlations between the wavenumber of ir radiation and ratios of the intensities of the first derivatives of the atr spectra fig 3 are presented in fig 4 the values of derivatives used in these figures and employed in subsequent calculations were the averages of the d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v ratios at wavenumbers located on the left and right sides from the zero value of the derivatives corresponding to the maximum of any particular pes reference line shown in fig 3 fig 4 clearly demonstrates the existence of strongly linear correlations between d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v ratios and wavenumbers of the pes reference lines the slope of these correlations increases at longer filtration runtimes which is consistent with the expectation that the apparent thickness of the fouling layer d f f a p p increases in these conditions once d f f a p p values are established as described above the differential atr ftir spectra of the fouling film that is those from which the contributions of the pes substrate have seen removed and only the vibration lines of the fouling film per se remain can be calculated using equation 5 5 a f f ν a ν 1 1 d f f a p p v a p e s ν results of these calculations for the atr spectra are shown in fig 5 and fig s5 for experiments carried out for 0 001 and 0 01 m ionic strengths respectively the differential atr spectra for the samples generated in experiments with a 0 1 m ionic strength alginate solution were much weaker than those for 0 001 m and 0 01 m ionic strengths in agreement with the minimal changes of tmps in the presence of the high salt concentration the data indicate the nearly complete absence of the pes vibrations in the differential spectra albeit some minor residual contributions of these bands for instance nearly the characteristic line at 560 cm 1 can still be observed their presence is caused by the deviations from a perfectly linear fit of the d a v p e s d v d a v f f d v data it is pertinent to mention here that while the apparent thickness and other morphological properties of the hydrogel alginate fouling x2028 layers may be affected by drying process a necessary preparation step for ex situ analyses and the compression during optical contact in atr ftir measurements wang and waite 2008 zhang et al 2018 these steps does not affect the point that the decrease of the substrate contribution to the overall atr spectrum is expected to be inversely proportional to the apparent thickness of the atr film the data shown in fig 5 and fig s5 demonstrate that the profiles of the vibration lines associated with the alginate fouling film do not undergo visually prominent changes as apparent thickness increased although some changes were observed that will be described elsewhere attributions of the observed main lines are shown in fig s6 which largely correspond those discussed in prior research papageorgiou et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 some differences in the positions of these lines are likely to be associated with the structural arrangements of alginate molecules related with their incorporation in the fouling hydrogel layer on the surface of the pes membranes further interpretation of these differences as well as that of the evolution of these lines may be useful for gaining more microscopic level insight into the molecular nature of the fouling films but this option was outside of the scope of this paper the systems of the broad ftir bands located in the wavenumber region 2400 to 3600 cm 1 had only minor contributions of vibrations attributable to anomeric carbon of the alginate in general this band that had local maxima at ca 3200 and 3350 cm 1 is associated with water molecules in the hydrogel surface layer belfer et al 2000 dias et al 1998 drazevic et al 2014 the evolution of the broad bands located in the region 2400 to 3600 cm 1 and associated with the formation of the fouling alginate hydrogel can be explored further to examine the intrinsic properties of such systems which will be pursued elsewhere tam et al 2005 xie et al 2015 given that the intensity of the differential background corrected atr ftir spectra of the surface film and its apparent thickness increase with runtime it was deemed useful to compare the behavior of these spectroscopic indicators with those of the atr these comparisons were carried out for two parameters that included the apparent thickness of the surface layer d f f a p p and the intensity of the atr ftir spectra at 3200 nm 1 the latter parameter may be deemed to be proportional similarly to the independently developed set of d f f a p p values to the apparent thickness of the hydrogel surface films these comparisons showed that the d f f a p p values determined for filtration runs of different duration were reasonably well correlated with tmp increases fig 6 although the correlation for the entire dataset of relevant tmp and d f f a p p values is not linear it has been well accepted that tmp variation might be caused by both cake layers fouling and membrane pores blocking meng et al 2018 however our study here aimed at correlating the overall tmp performance and taking into the various operational conditions like ionic strength directly with the atr ftir results instead of distinguishing the intrinsic cause for the two fouling types in order to propose a visual response for membrane fouling the data that show the relationship between tmp and d f f a p p values for each used ionic strength are presented in fig s7 the latter figure also demonstrates the relationship between the values of atr absorbance at 3200 cm 1 defined mostly by water molecules present in the hydrogel layer and tmp increases in this case the correlation is clearly strongly non linear albeit it deviates from linearity primarily due the presence of the point that correspond to the rapid increase of tmp in the end of filtration of 0 001 m ionic strength alginate solution while the value of atr 3200 cm 1 absorbance does not change proportionally in this case if this point is excluded however the correlation between 3200 cm 1 absorbance and tmp values becomes practically perfectly linear fig 6 the occurrence of the linear correlation between 3200 cm 1 absorbance value of the membrane and tmp values in their range below the onset of rapid fouling and the pronounced deviation from this simple relationship when the hydraulic permeability of the surface film undergoes a steep decrease necessitate a more detailed analysis of the structure of the broad bands located in the 2800 to 3200 cm 1 wavenumber range given the presence of several local maxima in the band e g 2940 3180 3354 cm 1 and the noticeable emergence of the broad structure in the 3050 to 3250 wavenumber range fig 5 and fig s6 it is clear that this band comprises contribution of several types of bound water including those that may be associated with the structural changes of the fouling film when it reaches the point of rapidly developing failure of the hydraulic permeability of the system 4 conclusions this study examined mechanisms of fouling films formation deposited on the surface of a pes membrane during the filtration of alginate solutions that had ionic strengths varying from 0 001 to 0 1 m the atr spectra that comprise the vibration bands characteristic of the pes substrate and the deposited film were processed using a quantitative approach via which the intensity of pes vibration bands in the presence of fouling was found to depend on the wavenumber of ir radiation and apparent thickness d f f a p p of the deposited layer the results presented above showed the existence of a strong correlation between tmp development and d f f a p p values of the fouling layers the data demonstrate the possibility of unambiguously separating the contributions of the system components and determining both the thickness of the deposited layers and the ftir spectra specific to them while more research is needed to further explore the performance of this method applied to other membrane materials alternative model foulants and membranes exposed to actual surface waters or wastewater it can also be argued that the presented method broadens the interpretability of atr ftir data generated in studies concerned with membrane fouling allowing for gaining new insights into its mechanisms declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

18676,nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is a newly discovered bioprocess which uses methane as electron donor to reduce nitrite into dinitrogen it is a promising clean bioprocess for denitrification in wastewater treatment however the low reaction rate and slow growth rate of n damo bacteria within nc10 phylum limit the application of the process in this study we chose vitamin heme nucleobase and betaine to investigate their short and long term effects on n damo bacteria the concentrations of the growth factors of medium were improved according to the short term experiments the results were subsequently verified via long term inoculations and were applied in a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor msglr the results indicated that nucleobase and betaine 5 0 and 200 μg l 1 respectively significantly stimulated the n damo activity whereas vitamin and heme had no significant effects in the tested concentration ranges during the long term incubation n damo bacteria continuously increased and finally achieved a relative abundance of 14 4 on day 300 notably larger aggregates of n damo bacteria were observed at the end of the long term incubation and the nitrogen removal rate of the msglr increased to 70 mg n l 1 day 1 with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99 0 however the addition of betaine introduced methyl into the reactors and this made methylotrophs account a considerable part of the bacterial community which limited the enrichment degree of n damo bacteria this work will contribute to the engineering application and enrichment of n damo bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen removal nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo growth factor medium improvement 1 introduction eutrophication is a severe environmental challenge threatening ecosystem balance and water supply security it happens in water bodies overly enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients the discharge of nitrogen containing wastewater is a widespread problem in industry and agriculture such as fertilizer utilization and production petrochemical industry food manufacturing and pharmaceuticals besides nitrate and nitrite are related to the formation of nitrosamines under certain conditions which may lead to increased cancer risk habermeyer et al 2015 therefore nitrogen removal from wastewater is important to prevent eutrophication and guarantee water supply security heterotrophic denitrification is widely used to treat wastewater rich in nitrate or nitrite grady et al 2011 however this bioprocess has some shortcomings in terms of economy and environment in wastewater treatment plants wwtps heterotrophic denitrification requires extra electron donor such as methanol and ethanol for wastewater with low c n ratio this is an additional cost in the wastewater treatment process second heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria grow fast usually with doubling times of a few hours rittmann and mccarty 2001 which results in large amounts of excess sludge excess sludge treatment needs extra labor and costs improper sludge treatment might cause secondary pollution to the environment moreover n2o emission from wastewater treatment processes is also an important environmental issue and the heterotrophic denitrification is one of the most important sources law et al 2012 according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the global warming potential value for 100 years of n2o is around 300 times that of co2 and n2o has become the third largest greenhouse gas since 2011 myhre et al 2013 to sum up heterotrophic denitrification is not a low cost and clean wastewater treatment method and we should find a novel way to replace it a newly discovered bioprocess denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo which couples denitrification to anaerobic methane oxidation might be the promising wastewater treatment technology that we are looking for raghoebarsing et al 2006 damo process consists of two subprocesses according to the final electron acceptor nitrite or nitrate nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation is mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea which use electrons generated through reverse methanogenesis to reduce nitrate to nitrite haroon et al 2013 arshad et al 2015 nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is catalyzed by bacteria belonging to nc10 phylum ettwig et al 2008 it can bypass the conventional denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen and then use oxygen to oxidize methane ettwig et al 2010 damo microorganisms have been found in various habitats in the past years such as lake sediments deutzmann et al 2014 freshwater wetlands hu et al 2014a paddy field shen et al 2014 ding et al 2016 marine habitats chen et al 2014a padilla et al 2016 shen et al 2016 and coastal sediments wang et al 2017a 2019 he et al 2019 some researchers have paid attention to the potential application of damo in wastewater treatment wang et al 2017b compared to heterotrophic denitrification damo process does not generate n2o and the electron donor for damo process is methane which could be easily achieved from anaerobic digestion in wwtps recently damo process was combined with anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox to address the nitrate accumulation caused by anammox strous et al 1998 van kessel et al 2018 with the development of material such as hollow fiber membrane the efficiency of methane utilization was significantly improved and the total nitrogen removal efficiency of combined damo anammox reached 90 cai et al 2015 xie et al 2016 2018 although damo microorganisms show a wide distribution spectrum in natural habitats the growth rates of damo microorganisms are incredibly slow with doubling time over two weeks he et al 2013 chen et al 2014b this has become the biggest bottleneck for its application many studies have been conducted to improve the activity and growth rate of damo microorganisms for example the optimization of environmental conditions and trace metal content in medium was carried out in order to stimulate the growth of n damo bacteria he et al 2015a 2015b 2016a we also investigated the effects of reactor configurations on n damo bacteria hu et al 2014b besides the activity and growth rate of damo archaea were promoted by addition of paraffin oil to improve methane solubility fu et al 2015 however the growth rates of damo microorganisms are still at a low level which made the enrichment take long time microbial growth factors are natural substances capable of stimulating cellular growth and proliferation even present in tiny quantities madigan et al 2012 in a broad sense growth factors include vitamins amino acids purines pyrimidines amine porphyrins and their derivatives some microorganisms must obtain one or more of growth factors from the environment thus these compounds must be supplied if they are unable to be biosynthesized when cultured in the laboratory in this work the effects of growth factors on the growth and activity of n damo bacteria were investigated by a series of short and long term experiments the improved n damo medium was then applied in a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor msglr and the rapidly increasing activity abundance and larger aggregates of n damo bacteria were observed 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and medium the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture enriched from paddy soil he et al 2015c the initial inorganic medium

investigate the short term effects of growth factors on n damo bacteria n damo activity was measured in triplicate with varying concentrations of growth factors multi vitamins 2 50 μg l 1 heme 2 50 μg

medium with varying growth factor content were transferred into the 75 ml serum bottles then 100 μl nitrite solution 1 0 mol l 1 was added into each bottle to keep the final concentration of no2 at 2 0 mmol l 1 the serum bottles were flushed with pure ar for 5 min then sealed with stoppers 2 5 ml of methane was injected into the serum bottles the serum bottles were incubated on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 c the liquid and gas were sampled every 6 h to measure the nitrite and methane concentrations 2 3 long term experiments on growth factors effects according to the results of the short term experiments we chose three concentration levels in the tested range of the four factors and designed a group of long term incubation experiments according to l9 34 orthogonal table table 1 the

the 75 ml serum bottles the serum bottles were flushed with pure ar for 5 min sealed with stoppers and then 10 ml ar in the gas phase was replaced with methane the serum bottles were incubated on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 c every 2 days 25 ml supernatant liquid was exchanged with an equal volume of the corresponding fresh medium after 2 h settling then concentrated nitrite solution was injected to keep the final no2 concentration 5 0 mmol l 1 and the methane was supplemented to 40 v v every 6 days after the long term incubation the n damo activity was determined by measuring the conversion rates of methane and nitrite 2 4 verification tests in sequencing batch reactors sbr four 1 l sbrs were operated for 172 days to verify the results obtained from the orthogonal tests the biomass was the same as described in the section biomass and medium the treatments of the four sbrs were set as follows a initial medium b initial medium nucleobase c initial medium betaine d initial medium nucleobase betaine the concentrations of nucleobase and betaine were 5 μg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 respectively the nitrite concentration in the fresh medium was gradually promoted according to the conversion rate of nitrite the n damo activity was monitored by determining the conversion rates of nitrite 2 5 operation of a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor msglr an msglr seeded with 100 ml biomass was operated at 30 c for 348 days to verify the effects of the improved medium on n damo bacteria the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture he et al 2015d which has been stopped being fed for 6 months and the nc10 phylum bacteria only accounted for 0 1 of total bacteria in this culture the msglr had a 1 0 l of working volume and an additional 0 3 l of headspace as previously described hu et al 2014b the msglr was magnetically stirred at 150 rpm with gas recirculation flowrate at 1000 ml min 1 0 5 l liquid was exchanged with fresh medium every 2 days after 2 h settling pure ar gas was flushed for 5 min to eliminate dissolved oxygen in the medium and then 0 1 l of pure methane 99 99 was injected into the headspace the nitrite concentration in the influent was increased gradually according to the nitrite conversion rate the biomass in the msglr was sampled regularly for microbial analysis 2 6 quantitative pcr dna extraction of the biomass samples was

electron microscope sem hitachi su 8010 following the methods mentioned by lu et al 2019 3 results 3 1 short term effects of growth factors the short term single factor experiment results are shown in fig 1 the n damo activity increased with an increase in heme at low concentrations 10 μg l 1 and then decreased at high concentrations 10 μg l 1 when the heme concentration reached 50 μg l 1 the conversion rate of methane was even lower than the rate of the group without the addition of heme in the experiment group for nucleobase n damo activity increased with the increase of nucleobase concentration but when the nucleobase concentration reached 10 0 μg l 1 the increase of nucleobase concentration does not promote the n damo activity the addition of betaine significantly promoted the n damo activity however the ratios of methane oxidation to nitrite reduction rates in this group deviated from the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 3 8 indicating that betaine might change the metabolic pathway of the culture system besides in the tested range vitamin had no obvious influence on n damo activity 3 2 improvement of growth factors content via long term orthogonal tests the results of the l9 34 orthogonal tests are shown in table 1 and the range analysis is shown in table 2 according to the maximum ranges r j of the four factors betaine exhibited a significant influence on the n damo activity compared to betaine the n damo activities were only slightly promoted by the other three factors but nucleobase showed a more obvious promotion than vitamin and heme the increase in k value also indicated that the n damo activity increased with the increase of betaine and nucleobase in the tested concentration ranges according to the orthogonal tests results we improved the medium with betaine and nucleobase concentration at 5 0 μg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 for the long term verification in bioreactors 3 3 verification via long term incubations four sbrs were subsequently operated for 172 days to verify the results obtained from the orthogonal tests fig 2 the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture and the initial conversion rates of the four sbrs were only around 3 5 mg n l 1 day 1 because of the dilution of the sludge during the incubation n damo activity increased in all of the groups before day 111 but when the nitrite concentration of influent increased to 100 mg n l 1 the group without addition of nucleobase and betaine deteriorated among the three experiment groups the n damo activity increased fastest in group betaine nucleobase followed by group betaine and group nucleobase and the final nitrite conversion rates on day 172 of the three groups were 14 3 10 5 and 8 6 times respectively of the initial nitrite conversion rate notably the increase rate of the n damo activity of group betaine nucleobase was over 2 times of the control group before the control group deteriorated on day 111 and this is consistent with the results of the long term orthogonal tests 3 4 application of the improved medium in msglr the improved medium was applied in an msglr and the msglr was operated for 348 days to verify the effects of the improved medium on n damo bacteria fig 3 the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture which has been stopped being fed for 6 months and the nc10 phylum bacteria only accounted for 0 1 of the total bacteria in this culture fig 4 a at the first stage the nitrite conversion increased rapidly before day 20 and then decreased to 6 7 mg n l 1 day 1 on day 34 we speculated that heterotrophic denitrification might be responsible for the rapid increase in nitrite conversion rate but when the organic matters from the biomass were exhausted nitrite was then reduced by n damo bacteria from day 34 227 the n damo activity gradually increased from 6 7 mg n l 1 day 1 to 48 0 mg n l 1 day 1 then the nitrite concentration in the fresh medium was increased to 280 mg n l 1 and the n damo activity reached 60 mg n l 1 day 1 after day 233 after day 288 the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the effluent were measured and the total inorganic nitrogen concentration was lower than 1 0 mg n l 1 indicating that the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 99 0 3 5 microbial community characterization the abundance of n damo bacterial 16s rrna genes in the msglr increased rapidly from 6 2 105 copies per ml of mixed liquor on day 1 1 4 108 copies per ml of mixed liquor on day 300 fig 4a this suggested that the improvement of growth factors not only promoted n damo activity but also stimulated n damo bacterial growth the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing also revealed that the relative abundance of nc10 bacteria increased from 0 1 to 14 4 after 300 days incubation but the results also indicated that many methylotrophs accounted for a considerable part of the bacterial community such as family methylophilaceae methylococcaceae and methylocystaceae fig 4b remarkably the sem micrographs fig 4c e revealed that the aggregates became lager gradually during the incubation after incubation for 300 days dense large aggregates with the diameter of 20 50 μm were observed fig 4f h 4 discussion n damo bacteria have a special denitrification pathway in which nitrite is first reduced to nitric oxide no and no is then putatively dismutated to molecular dinitrogen and oxygen ettwig et al 2010 2012 wu et al 2011 2012 the oxygen generated by no dismutation is then used for the conventional aerobic methane oxidation while the dinitrogen escapes from the liquid phase and this means that nitrogen source might be a limiting factor for n damo bacterial growth ammonia is the necessary precursor for biosynthesis of amino acids the weak capability of ammonia production limited the amino acid production rate of n damo bacteria and even limited that of the whole bacteria community addition of ammonium into medium is a solution to the ammonia limitation but coexistence of ammonium and nitrite makes a suitable niche for anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox bacteria luesken et al 2011a zhu et al 2011 ding et al 2014 who even successfully outcompeted n damo bacteria in a bioreactor fed with ammonium methane and nitrate nitrite hu et al 2015 environmental molecular studies also revealed that anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria frequently coexist in anoxic environments shen et al 2014 2015 considering the lack of nitrogen source we chose to use nucleobase in order to break the limits of nitrogen sources for n damo bacteria since purine and pyrimidine rings contain 4 and 2 nitrogen atoms respectively in this work the addition of nucleobase significantly improved the bacterial activity of n damo bacteria as expected the previous study demonstrated that cytochrome cd 1 type nitrite reductase is responsible for nitrite reduction in n damo bacteria wu et al 2012 indicating a demand for heme in n damo bacterial growth the biosynthesis of one molecule of heme needs four molecules of amino acid heinemann et al 2008 as mentioned above the lack of ammonia might also limit the heme synthesis but in this work the addition of heme did not exhibit an obvious effect on n damo bacteria unlike anaerobic methanotrophic archaea responsible for nitrate and sulfate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation whose genomes encode for a high number of cytochrome c proteins haroon et al 2013 arshad et al 2015 kletzin et al 2015 the availability of heme might not be the limit factor of n damo bacterial activity and growth another idea is that heme can provide iron for the metalloenzymes involved in the putative metabolic pathway of n damo bacteria wu et al 2011 sazanov and hinchliffe 2006 glass and orphan 2012 however the iron concentration of the initial inorganic medium has been improved in the previous work and the further addition of heme led to a slight slide of n damo activity which was in line with the results of iron he et al 2015a vitamins are organic molecules and essential micronutrients involved in many important pathways even in very small quantities abelson and simon 1997 for example riboflavin is the necessary component of flavin adenine dinucleotide and plays an important role in electron and proton transfer abbas and sibirny 2011 and nicotinic acid is necessary for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate which is involved in energy transfer in the redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases pollak et al 2007 such as formate dehydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase starkenburg et al 2006 besides cobalamin functions as a coenzyme of methyltransferases banerjee and ragsdale 2003 and biotin is an important component of enzymes involved in influencing protein synthesis and cell growth chapman smith and cronan 1999 generally speaking vitamins make nonnegligible contributions to the activity and growth of microbial cells however in this work the activity of n damo bacteria was not improved by the addition of vitamins the previous work indicated that in anammox granules anammox bacteria could share vitamin b12 with chlorobi affiliated bacteria and chlorobi affiliated bacteria could reduce nitrate to nitrite for anammox lawson et al 2017 the microorganisms in the msglr might form an autarkical community during the incubation therefore vitamins generated by the bacteria would be enough for their growth our previous work pointed out that the mass transfer of methane might be an essential impact factor of n damo bacteria hu et al 2014b although betaine usually serves as organic osmolytes for protection against osmotic stress drought and high salinity it is also a methyl donor of increasingly recognized significance lever and slow 2010 obeid 2013 the addition of one molecule of betaine introduced 3 molecules of active methylene groups which could replace methane as an electron donor at a certain degree but as shown in fig 1d the ratios of methane oxidation to nitrite reduction rates in the betaine treated group deviated from the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 3 8 implying a shift in denitrification and methanotrophic pathways in the culture system and the abundant methylotrophs limited the enrichment degree of n damo bacteria compared to the previous studies he et al 2015d bhattacharjee et al 2016 ma et al 2017 this work achieved a relatively high nitrite conversion rate and provided a better way to enrich n damo bacteria in a relatively short time in order to obtain highly enriched damo bacteria how to reduce the abundance of methylotrophs is still a problem to be solved according to stokes law the denser larger aggregates had better settleability than the free cells and small aggregates and the free cells and small aggregates were in constant danger of being washed out with the effluent luesken et al 2011b therefore the larger aggregates in the msglr might well solve this problem furthermore dense large aggregates may also promote the growth of n damo bacteria in which the mass transfers are more efficient and cells could receive various growth factors easily from each other there was an example that anammox bacteria require a certain cell density to grow rapidly due to quorum sensing diggle et al 2007 some previous studies revealed that microorganisms would form aggregates to resist the adverse conditions kadouri et al 2005 thus we can expect that larger and denser aggregates of n damo bacteria will perform better in resisting load shocks and toxic substances in engineering applications in this work the nitrogen removal rate of the msglr increased to 70 mg n l 1 day 1 at the end of the incubation with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99 0 considering the high nitrogen removal efficiency of n damo bacteria we proposed that combined nitritation n damo would be a promising nitrogen removal technology in which all ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite through nitritation and then reduced to dinitrogen through n damo compared to partial nitritation anammox pna although the oxygen demand for nitritation doubles nitritation n damo does not accumulate nitrate and the subsequent advanced treatment can be saved however at the present stage how to improve the activity and growth rate of n damo bacteria is still a top priority 5 conclusions this work indicated that nucleobase and betaine 5 0 and 200 μg l 1 respectively significantly stimulated the n damo activity whereas vitamin and heme had no significant effects in the tested concentration ranges after incubation for 300 days in the msglr larger aggregates of n damo bacteria were observed and the nitrogen removal rate increased to 70 mg n l 1 day 1 with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99 0 the addition of betaine introduced methyl into the reactors and this made methylotrophs account a considerable part of the bacterial community which limited the enrichment degree of n damo bacteria

18676,nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is a newly discovered bioprocess which uses methane as electron donor to reduce nitrite into dinitrogen it is a promising clean bioprocess for denitrification in wastewater treatment however the low reaction rate and slow growth rate of n damo bacteria within nc10 phylum limit the application of the process in this study we chose vitamin heme nucleobase and betaine to investigate their short and long term effects on n damo bacteria the concentrations of the growth factors of medium were improved according to the short term experiments the results were subsequently verified via long term inoculations and were applied in a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor msglr the results indicated that nucleobase and betaine 5 0 and 200 μg l 1 respectively significantly stimulated the n damo activity whereas vitamin and heme had no significant effects in the tested concentration ranges during the long term incubation n damo bacteria continuously increased and finally achieved a relative abundance of 14 4 on day 300 notably larger aggregates of n damo bacteria were observed at the end of the long term incubation and the nitrogen removal rate of the msglr increased to 70 mg n l 1 day 1 with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99 0 however the addition of betaine introduced methyl into the reactors and this made methylotrophs account a considerable part of the bacterial community which limited the enrichment degree of n damo bacteria this work will contribute to the engineering application and enrichment of n damo bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen removal nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo growth factor medium improvement 1 introduction eutrophication is a severe environmental challenge threatening ecosystem balance and water supply security it happens in water bodies overly enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients the discharge of nitrogen containing wastewater is a widespread problem in industry and agriculture such as fertilizer utilization and production petrochemical industry food manufacturing and pharmaceuticals besides nitrate and nitrite are related to the formation of nitrosamines under certain conditions which may lead to increased cancer risk habermeyer et al 2015 therefore nitrogen removal from wastewater is important to prevent eutrophication and guarantee water supply security heterotrophic denitrification is widely used to treat wastewater rich in nitrate or nitrite grady et al 2011 however this bioprocess has some shortcomings in terms of economy and environment in wastewater treatment plants wwtps heterotrophic denitrification requires extra electron donor such as methanol and ethanol for wastewater with low c n ratio this is an additional cost in the wastewater treatment process second heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria grow fast usually with doubling times of a few hours rittmann and mccarty 2001 which results in large amounts of excess sludge excess sludge treatment needs extra labor and costs improper sludge treatment might cause secondary pollution to the environment moreover n2o emission from wastewater treatment processes is also an important environmental issue and the heterotrophic denitrification is one of the most important sources law et al 2012 according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the global warming potential value for 100 years of n2o is around 300 times that of co2 and n2o has become the third largest greenhouse gas since 2011 myhre et al 2013 to sum up heterotrophic denitrification is not a low cost and clean wastewater treatment method and we should find a novel way to replace it a newly discovered bioprocess denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo which couples denitrification to anaerobic methane oxidation might be the promising wastewater treatment technology that we are looking for raghoebarsing et al 2006 damo process consists of two subprocesses according to the final electron acceptor nitrite or nitrate nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation is mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea which use electrons generated through reverse methanogenesis to reduce nitrate to nitrite haroon et al 2013 arshad et al 2015 nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is catalyzed by bacteria belonging to nc10 phylum ettwig et al 2008 it can bypass the conventional denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen and then use oxygen to oxidize methane ettwig et al 2010 damo microorganisms have been found in various habitats in the past years such as lake sediments deutzmann et al 2014 freshwater wetlands hu et al 2014a paddy field shen et al 2014 ding et al 2016 marine habitats chen et al 2014a padilla et al 2016 shen et al 2016 and coastal sediments wang et al 2017a 2019 he et al 2019 some researchers have paid attention to the potential application of damo in wastewater treatment wang et al 2017b compared to heterotrophic denitrification damo process does not generate n2o and the electron donor for damo process is methane which could be easily achieved from anaerobic digestion in wwtps recently damo process was combined with anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox to address the nitrate accumulation caused by anammox strous et al 1998 van kessel et al 2018 with the development of material such as hollow fiber membrane the efficiency of methane utilization was significantly improved and the total nitrogen removal efficiency of combined damo anammox reached 90 cai et al 2015 xie et al 2016 2018 although damo microorganisms show a wide distribution spectrum in natural habitats the growth rates of damo microorganisms are incredibly slow with doubling time over two weeks he et al 2013 chen et al 2014b this has become the biggest bottleneck for its application many studies have been conducted to improve the activity and growth rate of damo microorganisms for example the optimization of environmental conditions and trace metal content in medium was carried out in order to stimulate the growth of n damo bacteria he et al 2015a 2015b 2016a we also investigated the effects of reactor configurations on n damo bacteria hu et al 2014b besides the activity and growth rate of damo archaea were promoted by addition of paraffin oil to improve methane solubility fu et al 2015 however the growth rates of damo microorganisms are still at a low level which made the enrichment take long time microbial growth factors are natural substances capable of stimulating cellular growth and proliferation even present in tiny quantities madigan et al 2012 in a broad sense growth factors include vitamins amino acids purines pyrimidines amine porphyrins and their derivatives some microorganisms must obtain one or more of growth factors from the environment thus these compounds must be supplied if they are unable to be biosynthesized when cultured in the laboratory in this work the effects of growth factors on the growth and activity of n damo bacteria were investigated by a series of short and long term experiments the improved n damo medium was then applied in a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor msglr and the rapidly increasing activity abundance and larger aggregates of n damo bacteria were observed 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and medium the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture enriched from paddy soil he et al 2015c the initial inorganic medium

investigate the short term effects of growth factors on n damo bacteria n damo activity was measured in triplicate with varying concentrations of growth factors multi vitamins 2 50 μg l 1 heme 2 50 μg

medium with varying growth factor content were transferred into the 75 ml serum bottles then 100 μl nitrite solution 1 0 mol l 1 was added into each bottle to keep the final concentration of no2 at 2 0 mmol l 1 the serum bottles were flushed with pure ar for 5 min then sealed with stoppers 2 5 ml of methane was injected into the serum bottles the serum bottles were incubated on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 c the liquid and gas were sampled every 6 h to measure the nitrite and methane concentrations 2 3 long term experiments on growth factors effects according to the results of the short term experiments we chose three concentration levels in the tested range of the four factors and designed a group of long term incubation experiments according to l9 34 orthogonal table table 1 the settings and concentrations of the growth factors are shown in table 1 the long term incubation experiments were performed for 30 days 10 ml biomass 40 ml corresponding medium were transferred into the 75 ml serum bottles the serum bottles were flushed with pure ar for 5 min sealed with stoppers and then 10 ml ar in the gas phase was replaced with methane the serum bottles were incubated on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 c every 2 days 25 ml supernatant liquid was exchanged with an equal volume of the corresponding fresh medium after 2 h settling then concentrated nitrite solution was injected to keep the final no2 concentration 5 0 mmol l 1 and the methane was supplemented to 40 v v every 6 days after the long term incubation the n damo activity was determined by measuring the conversion rates of methane and nitrite 2 4 verification tests in sequencing batch reactors sbr four 1 l sbrs were operated for 172 days to verify the results obtained from the orthogonal tests the biomass was the same as described in the section biomass and medium the treatments of the four sbrs were set as follows a initial medium b initial medium nucleobase c initial medium betaine d initial medium nucleobase betaine the concentrations of nucleobase and betaine were 5 μg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 respectively the nitrite concentration in the fresh medium was gradually promoted according to the conversion rate of nitrite the n damo activity was monitored by determining the conversion rates of nitrite 2 5 operation of a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor msglr an msglr seeded with 100 ml biomass was operated at 30 c for 348 days to verify the effects of the improved medium on n damo bacteria the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture he et al 2015d which has been stopped being fed for 6 months and the nc10 phylum bacteria only accounted for 0 1 of total bacteria in this culture the msglr had a 1 0 l of working volume and an additional 0 3 l of headspace as previously described hu et al 2014b the msglr was magnetically stirred at 150 rpm with gas recirculation flowrate at 1000 ml min 1 0 5 l liquid was exchanged with fresh medium every 2 days after 2 h settling pure ar gas was flushed for 5 min to eliminate dissolved oxygen in the medium and then 0 1 l of pure methane 99 99 was injected into the headspace the nitrite concentration in the influent was increased gradually according to the nitrite conversion rate the biomass in the msglr was sampled regularly for microbial analysis 2 6 quantitative pcr dna extraction of the biomass samples was

electron microscope sem hitachi su 8010 following the methods mentioned by lu et al 2019 3 results 3 1 short term effects of growth factors the short term single factor experiment results are shown in fig 1 the n damo activity increased with an increase in heme at low concentrations 10 μg l 1 and then decreased at high concentrations 10 μg l 1 when the heme concentration reached 50 μg l 1 the conversion rate of methane was even lower than the rate of the group without the addition of heme in the experiment group for nucleobase n damo activity increased with the increase of nucleobase concentration but when the nucleobase concentration reached 10 0 μg l 1 the increase of nucleobase concentration does not promote the n damo activity the addition of betaine significantly promoted the n damo activity however the ratios of methane oxidation to nitrite reduction rates in this group deviated from the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 3 8 indicating that betaine might change the metabolic pathway of the culture system besides in the tested range vitamin had no obvious influence on n damo activity 3 2 improvement of growth factors content via long term orthogonal tests the results of the l9 34 orthogonal tests are shown in table 1 and the range analysis is shown in table 2 according to the maximum ranges r j of the four factors betaine exhibited a significant influence on the n damo activity compared to betaine the n damo activities were only slightly promoted by the other three factors but nucleobase showed a more obvious promotion than vitamin and heme the increase in k value also indicated that the n damo activity increased with the increase of betaine and nucleobase in the tested concentration ranges according to the orthogonal tests results we improved the medium with betaine and nucleobase concentration at 5 0 μg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 for the long term verification in bioreactors 3 3 verification via long term incubations four sbrs were subsequently operated for 172 days to verify the results obtained from the orthogonal tests fig 2 the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture and the initial conversion rates of the four sbrs were only around 3 5 mg n l 1 day 1 because of the dilution of the sludge during the incubation n damo activity increased in all of the groups before day 111 but when the nitrite concentration of influent increased to 100 mg n l 1 the group without addition of nucleobase and betaine deteriorated among the three experiment groups the n damo activity increased fastest in group betaine nucleobase followed by group betaine and group nucleobase and the final nitrite conversion rates on day 172 of the three groups were 14 3 10 5 and 8 6 times respectively of the initial nitrite conversion rate notably the increase rate of the n damo activity of group betaine nucleobase was over 2 times of the control group before the control group deteriorated on day 111 and this is consistent with the results of the long term orthogonal tests 3 4 application of the improved medium in msglr the improved medium was applied in an msglr and the msglr was operated for 348 days to verify the effects of the improved medium on n damo bacteria fig 3 the biomass was taken from a previous n damo culture which has been stopped being fed for 6 months and the nc10 phylum bacteria only accounted for 0 1 of

reached 60 mg n l 1 day 1 after day 233 after day 288 the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the effluent were measured and the total inorganic nitrogen concentration was lower than 1 0 mg n l 1 indicating that the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 99 0 3 5 microbial community characterization the abundance of n damo bacterial 16s rrna genes in the msglr increased rapidly from 6 2 105 copies per ml of mixed liquor on day 1 1 4 108 copies per ml of mixed liquor on day 300 fig 4a this suggested that the improvement of growth factors not only promoted n damo activity but also stimulated n damo bacterial growth the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing also revealed that the relative abundance of nc10 bacteria increased from 0 1 to 14 4 after 300 days incubation but the results also indicated that many methylotrophs accounted for a considerable part of the bacterial community such as family methylophilaceae methylococcaceae and methylocystaceae fig 4b remarkably the sem

anammox bacteria require a certain cell density to grow rapidly due to quorum sensing diggle et al 2007 some previous studies revealed that microorganisms would form aggregates to resist the adverse conditions kadouri et al 2005 thus we can expect that larger and denser aggregates of n damo bacteria will perform better in resisting load shocks and toxic substances in engineering applications in this work the nitrogen removal rate of the msglr increased to 70 mg n l 1 day 1 at the end of the incubation with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99 0 considering the high nitrogen removal efficiency of n damo bacteria we proposed that combined nitritation n damo would be a promising nitrogen removal technology in which all ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite through nitritation and then reduced to dinitrogen through n damo compared to partial nitritation anammox pna although the oxygen demand for nitritation doubles nitritation n damo does not accumulate nitrate and the subsequent advanced treatment can be saved however at the present stage how to improve the activity and growth rate of n damo bacteria is still a top priority 5 conclusions this work indicated that nucleobase and betaine 5 0 and 200 μg l 1 respectively significantly stimulated the n damo activity whereas vitamin and heme had no significant effects in the tested concentration ranges after incubation for 300 days in the msglr larger aggregates of n damo bacteria were observed and the nitrogen removal rate increased to 70 mg n l 1 day 1 with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99 0 the addition of betaine introduced methyl into the reactors and this made methylotrophs account a considerable part of the bacterial community which limited the enrichment degree of n damo bacteria

18677,arctic rivers export a large amount of organic carbon oc and mercury hg to arctic oceans because there are only a few direct calculations of oc and hg exports from these large rivers very little is known about their response to changes in the active layer in northern permafrost dominated areas in this study multiyear data sets from the arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro are used to estimate the export of dissolved organic carbon doc particulate organic carbon poc total mercury thg and methylmercury mehg from the six largest rivers yenisey lena ob mackenzie yukon and kolyma draining to the arctic ocean from 2003 to 2017 annual doc and poc export to the arctic ocean was approximately 21612 gg and 2728 gg and the exports of hg and mehg to the arctic ocean were approximately 20090 kg and 110 kg 0 002 of the total hg stored in the northern hemisphere active layer there were great variations in seasonal oc and hg concentrations and chemical characteristics with higher fluxes in spring and lower fluxes in winter baseline doc and hg concentrations are significantly positively correlated to discharge as discharge continues to increase in response to a deepening active layer thickness during recent past decades this study shows that previous results likely underestimated doc exports from rivers in the circum arctic regions and both oc and hg exports will increase under predicted climate warming scenarios graphical abstract image 1 keywords organic carbon mercury riverine export active layer discharge 1 introduction approximately 25 of the earth s land surface is covered by permafrost which is thawing in the arctic and subarctic regions due to a warming climate qin et al 2018 permafrost soils store a vast reservoir of organic carbon oc schuur et al 2015a hugelius et al 2014 increasing global air temperature is expected to accelerate thawing of this vast reservoir of frozen carbon schuur et al 2015a 2015b upon thaw a fraction of carbon will release to the atmosphere as greenhouse house gases and the remaining fractions will be exported to aquatic systems via rivers guo et al 2007 in addition to the huge oc pool the circum arctic permafrost regions also contain a substantial reservoir of hg bound with organic matter oc bound hg schuster et al 2018 consequently climate warming will likely accelerate the mobilization of hg from thawing permafrost increasing the riverine oc bound hg the export of hg can potentially increase the production of bioavailable methylmercury emmerton et al 2013 which can bioaccumulate up the aquatic food chain creating a public health risk in arctic ocean seawater hg and mehg concentrations are higher compared to sea water in lower latitudes and approximately 15 of mehg inputs was ascribed to riverine transport 2 5 mg a 1 soerensen et al 2016 future inputs of hg and mehg in arctic ocean are likely to increase due to the increasing freshwater discharges and permafrost degradation soerensen et al 2016 several of earth s largest rivers drain to the arctic ocean and surrounding seas which together transport huge quantities of water and solutes and particulates it was reported that the oc exports from the major 9 northern rivers averaged 26000 c yr 1 and the exports of hg averaged 16000 kg hg yr 1 schuster et al 2011 among the 9 rivers the yukon river is the largest river with the oc export of 2300 c yr 1 striegl et al 2007a and the hg export of 4400 kg hg yr 1 schuster et al 2011 evidence of increasing arctic river discharge has been reported in recent publications semiletov et al 2000 shiklomanov et al 2000 and found to be correlated with increasing global mean surface air temperature peterson et al 2002 during recent past decades the alt in the northern hemisphere has increased significantly peng et al 2018 because the thawing of permafrost can increase the release of soil water the deepening of active layer thickness alt will likely change the hydrologic flow paths increasing river discharges mcclelland et al 2004 continued warming leads to permafrost degradation increasing ground temperature deepening the active layer and altering thermokarst landscapes wu et al 2018 frey et al 2007 because deepening active layer and thermokarst landforms will likely promote or accelerate the mobilization of oc and hg from permafrost abbott et al 2015 ma et al 2018 it is expected that permafrost degradation will increase the concentrations exports and potential hg methylation in northern river basins jeansson et al 2011 however the dearth of literature on discharge oc and hg exports in different arctic rivers at different time periods jeansson et al 2011 drake et al 2015 makes it difficult to generalize the temporal trends in oc and hg export to the arctic ocean in this study based on data available from the yenisey lena ob yukon mackenzie and kolyma rivers we aimed to quantify 1 annual and seasonal export of doc poc hg and mehg in these arctic rivers from 1999 to 2017 2 the chemical characteristics of doc such as suva254 13c doc and 14c doc which can estimate the bioavailability of hg 3 the effects of changes in active layer thickness on discharge using the field observation data this study will report an estimation of doc poc hg and mehg fluxes from arctic rivers and provide insights on the effects of permafrost degradation in regard to carbon and mercury export from arctic rivers to the arctic ocean and ultimately the global hg cycle 2 data and methods six arctic rivers were selected in this study fig 1 the yukon river is the 19th longest river in the world 3200 km draining the fourth largest basin 853 500 km2 with the fifth largest average annual discharge 6500 m3 s 1 in north america the mackenzie river is the largest riverine source of suspended sediments the second largest in dissolved matter after the yenisei and the fourth in water discharge among the six rivers after the lena yenisei and ob rivers millot et al 2003 the dataset spanning from 1999 to 2017 for these arctic rivers is available through the arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro including water quality holmes et al 2018a absorbance holmes et al 2018b and discharge shiklomanov et al 2018 although the gro data can be obtained from 1999 the water quality data such as doc concentrations and characteristics were available since 2003 therefore we analyzed the data from 2003 to 2017 detailed information for the sample collection and analysis can be found in the arcticgro https arcticgreatrivers org briefly samples were collected using united states geological survey usgs equal discharge increment edi protocol on each sampling date five depth integrated samples were collected across the river channel using a d 96 depth integrating sampler fitted with a teflon nozzle and collecting bag and the water samples were composited in a 14 l teflon churn to form a single collated sample this sampling approach was designed to capture the vertical and cross sectional and depth variability in water sample constituents during ice covered periods samples were collected at the centroid of maximum flow from a single and midchannel hole about 10 cm below the bottom of the surface ice doc concentration was analyzed on a shimadzu toc tn analyzer after samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters for poc measurements the filters were treated with direct applications of sulfurous acid h2so3 acs 6 so2 minimum applied through wetting drying cycles to remove inorganic carbon samples were uv oxidized and cryogenically purified and analyzed for 13c doc and 14c doc total hg analysis followed u s epa method 1631 and methylmercury analyses were performed following standard distillation and ethylation procedures absorbance was measured at 254 nm using a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer specific uv absorbance suva254 values a measure of doc aromaticity were determined by dividing the uv absorbance at λ 254 nm by the doc concentrations weishaar et al 2003 the active layer thickness in the arctic basins were available in the circumpolar active layer monitoring network calm and global terrestrial network for permafrost gtn p peng et al 2018 brown et al 2000 the alt in ob river basin were only available from 2002 to 2005 in addition the permafrost underlies only about 5 11 of the ob river basin therefore the alt in the ob basin was not included in the analysis there were great temporal variations both in discharges and carbon and hg concentrations for each river therefore we categorized the river discharges carbon and hg concentrations by three seasons spring may to june 61 days summer july october 123 days and winter november april 181 days striegl et al 2005 an uncertainty analysis was conducted using the percentile method and we used a quartile confidence interval to find the range of carbon and hg exports we used simple linear regressions to examine the relationships among carbon hg concentrations and discharges because discharges and active layer thicknesses varied greatly in different watersheds the watersheds were normalized using the min max method jain et al 2005 and then produced an average value for each watershed and their relationships were described using linear regressions this method allowed for the comparison of changes in alt among different watersheds all the data analysis was conducted using r statistical software version 3 3 4 www r project org 3 results 3 1 exports of doc poc thg and mehg in the arctic rivers from 2003 to 2017 for the major arctic rivers reported here the average annual doc export was estimated up to 21612 gg interquartile 19272 23899 gg with 60 9 13170 gg exported in spring may june 29 1 6285 gg occurred in summer july october and only 10 0 2157 gg in winter november april fig 2 a the average annual poc export was 2728 gg interquartile 2326 3067 gg yr 1 with 57 8 1576 gg exported in spring 37 0 1010 gg in summer and 5 2 142 gg in winter fig 2b the average annual thg export was 20090 kg interquartile 14848 28780 kg y 1 with 52 7 42 5 and 4 8 were occurred in spring summer and winter respectively fig 2c for mehg the annual export was 110 kg interquartile 83 172 kg y 1 and the exports in spring summer and winter contributed to 48 4 46 1 and 5 5 of the annual exports fig 2d during 2003 2017 the doc concentrations were all significantly correlated with discharges for all the six rivers while only three rivers showed the significant linear relationships with discharges for poc fig 3 a and b the thg and mehg concentrations were largely significantly correlated with discharges for all the rivers fig 3c and d the largest river lena river has the lowest slopes of the linear regressions for the doc poc thg and mehg concentrations 3 2 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva and carbon isotopes of doc in the arctic rivers there were significant variations in the distribution of suva254 with highest values in the spring and lowest values in the winter except for the lena fig 4 the yenisey mackenzie yukon and kolyma rivers showed the highest values of suva254 in spring and the lowest values were recorded in winter the doc concentrations were significantly positively corrected with suva254 in spring summer and winter fig 5 for the carbon isotopes compositions the 13c doc values showed positive trends with doc concentrations in spring and summer but the linear regressions were not statistically significant and there were also no significant relationships between 14c doc values and doc concentrations 3 3 changes of alt and discharge from 1999 to 2015 the average normalized alt and discharges showed significantly increasing trends and the normalized alt was also significantly correlated with the standardized discharge fig 6 indicating that alt and discharge of the rivers increased gradually during past two decades 4 discussion dittmar and kattner 2002 estimated doc exported by the 17 arctic rivers into the arctic ocean was 13000 26000 gg however this estimation has a large uncertainty and did not include the data of yukon river using the arcticgro data from the six rivers holmes et al 2012 estimated that the annual doc export from 1999 to 2008 of the six rivers was 18109 gg using the updated arcticgro data collected from 2003 to 2017 our study showed the doc export was about 21612 gg interquartile 19272 23899 gg and the poc export in these rivers was about 2728 gg interquartile 2326 3067 gg which was 0 004 of the total oc stored in the northern hemisphere active layer the variation among the studies could be explained by differences in time span of the data sets and calculation methods holmes et al 2012 mainly used models to estimate the doc and poc export based on the field monitoring data while our study directly calculated the field monitoring data a comparison of the results from holmes et al 2012 and recent data from this study suggest that the export of doc and poc has increased during the recent years in our study the yukon river exported 3273 kg hg y 1 which is similar with the previous report 4400 kg hg y 1 schuster et al 2011 we calculated that annual export of hg and mehg from mackenzie river was 3272 kg y 1 interquartile 1582 4350 kg and 14 kg y 1 interquartile 10 25 kg respectively this result is also in agreement with the results from another study 2200 4200 kg hg y 1 and 15 23 kg mehg y 1 emmerton et al 2013 leitch et al 2007 although the concentrations and fluxes for this study were measured during 2012 2015 our results compare well to that during 2003 2005 emmerton et al 2013 and 2007 2010 leitch et al 2007 suggesting hg and mehg exports in our study are reliable the seasonal changes of doc poc thg and mehg export can be attributed to the seasonal changes in their concentrations and discharges emmerton et al 2013 finlay et al 2006 kirk and st louis 2009 in circum arctic regions spring snowmelt produces the highest discharge of the year yang et al 2002 with the riverine doc concentrations at their highest values raymond et al 2007 our study also observed significantly relationships between doc concentrations and discharges fig 3a the significant relationships between poc and discharges were observed only in three of the six rivers fig 3b other factors such as soil taxonomy and land cover types could explain the poor correlation of poc and discharge striegl et al 2007b it is worth mentioning that the largest river lena river has the lowest slopes for the linear regressions for the doc poc thg and mehg concentrations this could be explained by the fact that lena river has the largest catchment area indicating a longer water flow distance and longer retention time favors to the decomposition absorption sedimentation of carbon and mercury ma et al 2018 in addition the largest active layer thickness in this catchment may also be responsible for the soil adsorption of doc and mercury during warm seasons mu et al 2017 hg cycles in circum arctic regions are closely associated with carbon cycles schuster et al 2011 2018 the hg and mehg export in spring and summer accounted for more than 40 of the annual export similar to doc exports doc poc hg and mehg exports were lowest in winter when river discharges were at their lowest values and frozen soils were not actively exporting carbon and hg via leaching and erosion processes the suva254 values in spring were largely higher than those in summer and winter during the spring the snowmelt runoff produces peak discharges with more aromatic doc from a higher proportion of debris from vascular plants exporting during this period spencer et al 2008 the lower suva254 values in summer probably indicated higher biodegradability due to increasing contributions of ground water and melting ground ice exporting more biodegradable water soluble oc from permafrost affected soils vonk et al 2015 the lowest suva254 values were largely recorded in winter wickland et al 2012 which can be explained by the lowest microbial decomposition rate of doc both in situ and the riverine transport mu et al 2017 in addition the lowest solar radiation in winter also means the lowest photo degradation of doc and thus leads to lower suva254 values cory et al 2014 the suva254 values in the lena river showed the lowest values in summer instead of winter although the mechanism underlies this pattern needs to be clarified by further studies the higher suva254 can be partly explained by the deeper active layer thickness in this catchment i e the deep active layer indicated that the doc leached from the soils in winter has been experienced a relatively long term microbial decomposition in summer mu et al 2017 the 14c values of oc is used to indicate the loss of old carbon in permafrost regions and the 13c value is an indicator for the vulnerability of organic matter decomposition wickland et al 2012 it has been reported that water in spring was enriched in 14c doc and depleted 14c doc in winter suggesting that water in spring contains modern carbon whereas those in winter may contain ancient carbon neff et al 2006 the 14c doc dynamic in the arctic rivers is important because the fresh organic carbon promotes the growth the sulfate reducing bacteria srb which can increase mehg production schuster et al 2008 in our study both 13c and 14c values showed no significant relationships with doc concentrations and the 13c and 14c values showed no significant differences among the three seasons data not shown it has been suggested that 14c doc signals were mainly originated from terrestrial plant materials benner et al 2004 and thus 14c doc values showed no significant differences in addition many other factors such as the heterogeneities in hydrology sources of soil organic matter and anthropogenic influences can also affect the carbon isotope fractionation lobbes et al 2000 resulting in the non significant differences of 13c and 14c values among the three seasons although we could not directly explain the relationship between increasing alt and carbon or hg exports for these watersheds because of a lack of carbon and hg concentrations field data the significant relationships between discharge and carbon and hg exports established in previous reports schuster et al 2018 rydberg et al 2010 make it possible to predict the carbon and hg exports using discharges permafrost thawing has been observed in both alaskan and sweden osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 the changes in average normalized alt clearly indicated a deepening active layer thickness in the catchments this is likely due to increasing air temperature in the circum arctic regions during recent past decades huang et al 2017 the significant positive correlation between alt and discharge is attributed to increasing precipitation due to climate changes bintanja and selten 2014 from 1936 to 1999 the discharges of the six large rivers increased by 7 peterson et al 2002 in addition permafrost thawing can increase the discharges of river basin since melting of ground ice likely contributes to the ground water lecher 2017 our results clearly showed that the exports of carbon and hg increased with deepening active layers and thus the carbon and hg exports will likely continue to increase in the future under global warming scenarios 5 conclusions using the data from the arctic gro this study updated the export of doc poc hg and mehg from the six arctic rivers draining to the arctic ocean during 2003 2017 annual doc and poc export was 21612 gg and 2728 gg yr 1 and the exports of hg and mehg averaged 20090 kg and 110 kg yr 1 respectively our results showed that the doc export which was calculated using the updated data was higher than previous reports 18109 gg data from 1999 to 2008 for the six largest rivers in arctic regions our results also indicated that using the past 20 years the alt and river discharges showed increasing trends and these changes will likely lead to increasing exports of doc poc hg and mehg overall our study showed that the c and hg exports estimated from recent arctic gro data 2003 2017 are higher than the previous reports using different temporal and spatial datasets and will increase under global warming scenarios declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

approximately 20090 kg and 110 kg 0 002 of the total hg stored in the northern hemisphere active layer there were great variations in seasonal oc and hg concentrations and chemical characteristics with higher fluxes in spring and lower fluxes in winter baseline doc and hg concentrations are significantly positively correlated to discharge as discharge continues to increase in response to a

will increase under predicted climate warming scenarios graphical abstract image 1 keywords organic carbon mercury riverine export active layer discharge 1 introduction approximately 25 of the earth s land surface is covered by permafrost which is thawing in the arctic and subarctic regions due to a warming climate qin et al 2018 permafrost soils store a vast reservoir of organic carbon oc schuur et al 2015a hugelius et al 2014 increasing global air temperature is expected to accelerate thawing of this vast reservoir of frozen carbon schuur et al 2015a 2015b upon thaw a fraction of carbon will release to the atmosphere as greenhouse house gases and the remaining fractions will be exported to aquatic systems via rivers guo et al 2007 in addition to the huge oc pool the circum arctic permafrost regions also contain a substantial reservoir of hg bound with organic matter oc bound hg schuster et al 2018 consequently climate warming will likely accelerate the mobilization of hg from thawing permafrost increasing the riverine oc bound hg the export of hg can potentially increase the production of bioavailable methylmercury emmerton et al 2013 which can bioaccumulate up the aquatic

increased significantly peng et al 2018 because the thawing of permafrost can increase the release of soil water the deepening of active layer thickness alt will likely change the hydrologic flow

it is expected that permafrost degradation will increase the concentrations exports and potential hg methylation in northern river basins jeansson et al 2011 however the dearth of literature on discharge oc and hg exports in different arctic rivers at different time periods jeansson et al 2011 drake et al 2015 makes it difficult to generalize the temporal trends in oc and hg export to the

al 2018 brown et al 2000 the alt in ob river basin were only available from 2002 to 2005 in addition the permafrost underlies only about 5 11 of the ob river basin therefore the alt in the ob basin was not included in the analysis there were great temporal variations both in discharges and carbon and hg concentrations for each river therefore we categorized the river discharges carbon and hg

method and we used a quartile confidence interval to find the range of carbon and hg exports we used simple linear regressions to examine the relationships among carbon hg concentrations and discharges because discharges and active layer thicknesses varied greatly in different watersheds the watersheds were normalized using the min max method jain et al 2005 and then produced an average value for each watershed and their relationships were described using linear regressions this method allowed for the comparison of changes in alt among different watersheds all the data analysis was

values in the winter except for the lena fig 4 the yenisey mackenzie yukon and kolyma rivers showed the highest values of suva254 in spring and the lowest values were recorded in winter the doc concentrations were significantly positively corrected with suva254 in spring summer and winter fig 5 for the carbon isotopes compositions the 13c doc values showed positive trends with doc concentrations in spring and summer but the linear regressions were not statistically significant and there were also no significant relationships between 14c doc values and doc concentrations 3 3 changes of alt and discharge from 1999 to 2015 the average normalized alt and discharges showed significantly increasing trends and the normalized alt was also significantly correlated with the standardized discharge fig 6 indicating that alt and discharge of the rivers increased gradually during past two decades 4 discussion dittmar and kattner 2002 estimated doc exported by the 17 arctic rivers into the arctic ocean was 13000 26000 gg however this estimation has a large uncertainty and did not include the data of yukon river using the arcticgro data from the six rivers holmes et al 2012 estimated that the annual doc export from 1999 to 2008 of the six rivers was 18109 gg using the updated arcticgro data collected from 2003 to 2017 our study showed the doc export was about 21612 gg interquartile 19272 23899 gg and the poc export in these rivers was about 2728 gg interquartile 2326 3067 gg which was 0 004 of the total oc stored in the northern hemisphere active layer the variation among the studies could be explained by differences in time span of the data sets and calculation methods holmes et al 2012 mainly used models to estimate the doc and poc export based on the field monitoring data while our study directly calculated the field monitoring data a comparison of the results from holmes et al 2012 and recent data from this study suggest that the export of doc and poc has increased during the recent years in our study the yukon river exported 3273 kg hg y 1 which is similar with the previous report 4400 kg hg y 1 schuster et al 2011 we calculated that annual export of hg and mehg from mackenzie river was 3272 kg y 1 interquartile 1582 4350 kg and 14 kg y 1 interquartile 10 25 kg respectively this result is also in agreement with the results from another study 2200 4200 kg hg y 1 and 15 23 kg mehg y 1 emmerton et al 2013 leitch et al 2007 although the concentrations and fluxes for this study were measured during 2012 2015 our results compare well to that during 2003 2005 emmerton et al 2013 and 2007 2010 leitch et al 2007 suggesting hg and mehg exports in our study are reliable the seasonal changes of doc poc thg and mehg export can be attributed to the seasonal changes in their concentrations and discharges emmerton et al 2013 finlay et al 2006 kirk and st louis 2009 in circum arctic regions spring snowmelt produces the highest discharge of the year yang et al 2002 with the riverine doc concentrations at their highest values raymond et al 2007 our study also observed significantly relationships between doc concentrations and discharges fig 3a the significant relationships between poc and discharges were observed only in three of the six rivers fig 3b other factors such as soil taxonomy and land cover types could explain the poor correlation of poc and discharge striegl et al 2007b it is worth mentioning that the largest river lena river has the lowest slopes for the linear regressions for the doc poc thg and mehg concentrations this could be explained by the fact that lena river has the largest catchment area indicating a longer water flow distance and longer retention time favors to the decomposition absorption sedimentation of carbon and mercury ma et al 2018 in addition the largest active layer thickness in this catchment may also be responsible for the soil adsorption of doc and mercury during warm seasons mu et al 2017 hg cycles in circum arctic regions are closely associated with carbon cycles schuster et al 2011 2018 the hg and mehg export in spring and summer accounted for more than 40 of the annual export similar to doc exports doc poc hg and mehg exports were lowest in winter when river discharges were at their lowest values and frozen soils were not actively exporting carbon and hg via leaching and erosion processes the suva254 values in spring were largely higher than those in summer and winter during the spring the snowmelt runoff produces peak discharges with more aromatic doc from a higher proportion of debris from vascular plants exporting during this period spencer et al 2008 the lower suva254 values in summer probably indicated higher biodegradability due to increasing contributions of ground water and melting ground ice exporting more biodegradable water soluble oc from permafrost affected soils vonk et al 2015 the lowest suva254 values were largely recorded in winter wickland et al 2012 which can be explained by the lowest microbial decomposition rate of doc both in situ and the riverine transport mu et al 2017 in addition the lowest solar radiation in winter also means the lowest photo degradation of doc and thus leads to lower suva254 values cory et al 2014 the suva254 values in the lena river showed the lowest values in summer instead of winter although the mechanism underlies this pattern needs to be clarified by further studies the higher suva254 can be partly explained by the deeper active layer thickness in this catchment i e the deep active layer indicated that the doc leached from the soils in winter has been experienced a relatively long term microbial decomposition in summer mu et al 2017 the 14c values of oc is used to indicate the loss of old carbon in permafrost regions and the 13c value is an indicator for the vulnerability of organic matter decomposition wickland et al 2012 it has been reported that water in spring was enriched in 14c doc and depleted 14c doc in winter suggesting that water in spring contains modern carbon whereas those in winter may contain ancient carbon neff et al 2006 the 14c doc dynamic in the arctic rivers is important because the fresh organic carbon promotes the growth the sulfate reducing bacteria srb which can increase mehg production schuster et al 2008 in our study both 13c and 14c values showed no significant relationships with doc concentrations and the 13c and 14c values showed no significant differences among the three seasons data not shown it has been suggested that 14c doc signals were mainly originated from terrestrial plant materials benner et al 2004 and thus 14c doc values showed no significant differences in addition many other factors such as the heterogeneities in hydrology sources of soil organic matter and anthropogenic influences can also affect the carbon isotope fractionation lobbes et al 2000 resulting in the non significant differences of 13c and 14c values among the three seasons although we could not directly explain the relationship between increasing alt and carbon or hg exports for these watersheds because of a lack of carbon and hg concentrations field data the significant relationships between discharge and carbon and hg exports established in previous reports schuster et al 2018 rydberg et al 2010 make it possible to predict the carbon and hg exports using discharges permafrost thawing has been observed in both alaskan and sweden osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 the changes in average normalized alt clearly indicated a deepening active layer thickness in the catchments this is likely due to increasing air temperature in the circum arctic regions during recent past decades huang et al 2017 the significant positive correlation between alt and discharge is attributed to increasing precipitation due to climate changes bintanja and selten 2014 from 1936 to 1999 the discharges of the six large rivers increased by 7 peterson et al 2002 in addition permafrost thawing can increase the discharges of river basin since melting of ground ice likely contributes to the ground water lecher 2017 our results clearly showed that the exports of carbon and hg increased with deepening active layers and thus the carbon and hg exports will likely continue to increase in the future under global warming scenarios 5 conclusions using the data from the arctic gro this study updated the export of doc poc hg and mehg from the six arctic rivers draining to the arctic ocean during 2003 2017 annual doc and poc export was 21612 gg and 2728 gg yr 1 and the exports of hg and mehg averaged 20090 kg and 110 kg yr 1 respectively our results showed that the doc export which was calculated using the updated data was higher than previous reports 18109 gg data from 1999 to 2008 for the six largest rivers in arctic regions our results also indicated that using the past 20 years the alt and river discharges showed increasing trends and these changes will likely lead to increasing exports of doc poc hg and mehg overall our study showed that the c and hg exports estimated from recent arctic gro data 2003 2017 are higher than the previous reports using different temporal and spatial datasets and will increase under global warming scenarios declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

18678,bioretention systems have been found to be potential candidates for the removal of various pollutants nutrients from rainfall or stormwater runoff despite bioretention has been widely developed for the removal of nutrients from stormwater effective removal of both phosphorus and nitrogen is still a challenge hence in this study bioretention systems modified by alkaline solid waste media have been reported for the effective removal of nutrients six different types of solid wastes were first assessed using leaching and adsorption tests and then the bottom ash from a refuse incineration plant was selected as a modifier the bottom ash was mixed with soil to form a special media as the filter layer in the bioretention systems the nutrient removal efficiencies of the modified bioretention systems were evaluated and also compared with those of the unmodified control for this purpose the design of the modified filter media with a saturated zone was combined to enhance the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the effect of different rainfall intensities and nutrient concentrations in stormwater runoff on the removal efficiency of nutrients was evaluated the results indicated that the modified bioretention with bottom ash modified soil media and saturated zone could exhibit the excellent removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus from stormwater runoff the extent of removal of total nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus was found to be 58 70 66 82 and 82 97 respectively the performed correlation analysis showed that the bioretention cell using the special media could simultaneously enhance the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen as a part of this study the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus removal by the modified bioretention systems have also been determined finally the implications and opportunities for deploying modified bioretention systems for optimizing water energy nexus and stormwater management were illustrated in overall this study demonstrated that the modified bioretention systems could substantially enhance the removal efficiencies of nutrients from stormwater runoff graphical abstract image 1 keywords green infrastructure bottom ash dissolved phosphorus rainfall intensity isotherm freundlich 1 introduction the prompt growth in impermeable surfaces in urban areas did not only cause the increased flood volumes and stormwater peak flow but also exacerbated the wash off of pollutants which could seriously deteriorate the runoff water quality stormwater runoff could contain various water contaminants such as organic matter suspended solids ss phosphorus p nitrogen n and dissolved heavy metals thus the stormwater runoff has been considered as one of the major causes for aquatic environment deteriorations and ecosystem health impacts chahal et al 2016 mcintyre et al 2016 it would transport a range of pollutants such as sediments ermolin et al 2018 heavy metals ashoori et al 2019 hydrocarbon bakacs et al 2013 diblasi et al 2009 garden fertilizers and pesticides cameron et al 2012 to the receiving watersheds although nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for growing the plants liu and davis 2014 the excessive nutrients in stormwater runoff would cause eutrophication yan et al 2016 and could destroy the aquatic ecosystems xue et al 2009 in general nutrients could be effectively removed by physical chemical and biological approaches in wastewater treatment plants however in most of the stormwater runoff agricultural and horticultural drainage their collection for the wastewater treatment would be very difficult thus green infrastructure has been considered as one of the best management practices for the nonpoint source pollution such as stormwater among various green infrastructure facilities bioretention systems have been considered to exhibit excellent ability in water quality control and quantity retention of stormwater runoff with the multiple layer structure bioretention could maximize the potential for moisture storage utilization and evapotranspiration thereby possessing complex functions of physical chemical and biological treatment county 1993 extensive studies have been reported to improve the design of bioretention systems austin 2012 bjorklund and li 2017 hsieh and davis 2005 as well as to evaluate the performance of the removal of nutrients from stormwater runoff dietz 2016 goh et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 the transport pathways and fate of nitrogen and phosphorus in the bioretention have been evaluated by numerous field and lab scale studies nitrogen removal has remained as a technical challenge in bioretention mainly due to the high solubility and the poor absorbability of the dissolved n species such as nitrite and nitrate nitrogen removal was mainly taken place through assimilation of plants boelee et al 2011 adsorption of negative charge in soil media bassin et al 2011 and nitrification denitrification processes via microorganisms norton et al 2017 due to atmospheric reoxygenation and oxygen supply from plant roots the surface layer in bioretention systems could provide an aerobic environment for ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria to promote ammonization and nitrification respectively the obtained no3 n from the nitrification reaction and the original no3 n in the runoff were fixed by the assimilation of vegetation and microorganisms while part of no3 n was converted into n2 by denitrification in the deep anaerobic zone and discharged from the bioretention chen et al 2013 kim et al 2003 developed the nitrogen removal system using newspapers wood chips and elemental sulphur lime as the medium for denitrification in their lab scale system almost 80 removal ratio of no3 n was successfully achieved similarly sengupta et al 2007 used a ground oyster shell as a solid phase buffer in a sulphur oxidation denitrification reactor to enhance the denitrification reactions studies have confirmed that the removal of nitrogen by plant uptake was different under saturated and unsaturated conditions in bioretention systems on the other hand phosphorus in water could be divided into particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp similar to suspended solids bioretention was found to be effective in removing pp through the physical approaches including sedimentation and filtration li and davis 2016 however it was less effective for the removal of dp due to the limited adsorption capacity of dp most phosphate fertilizers such as monoammonium phosphate ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and calcium phosphate were highly soluble and would easily be transported by the runoff in other words the phosphorus species in stormwater runoff were mostly present in the form of dp the major mechanisms of dp removal could include bio utilization adsorption and precipitation although the bio utilization approaches via phytoremediation and p accumulating organisms were widely used mortula 2006 wang et al 2014 and the phosphorus absorbed during the growth of plants might return to the soils due to the fallen leaves verhoeven and meuleman 1999 thus bioretention also could not function like activated sludge processes in wastewater treatment plants with periodical discharge of phosphorus rich sludge in fact the removal of dp by bioretention mainly relies on adsorption and chemical precipitation with metal salts such as calcium aluminum and iron in the layer of the soil media to form pp barca et al 2013 bird and drizo 2010 the formed pp could be removed afterward via the physical approach the adsorption process was reported to occur much faster i e electrostatic ion exchange reactions fast and reversible could first occur on the outer spherical surface followed by the adsorption forming monodentate and bidentate complexes on the inner sphere surface li and davis 2016 compared with adsorption reactions the kinetics of precipitation reactions was found to be slower and even could take up to a few days søvik and kløve 2005 therefore the rapid adsorption process was suggested to predominate when the runoff flowed through the soil media layer in stormwater runoff the partition of p between the particulate and dissolved forms was highly variable as the metal ions in the soil media of bioretention systems were limited proper modification of the filler media layer in bioretention was better known as the key to enhance the phosphorus especially dp removal industrial solid wastes such as fly ash oil shale red mud and steel slag have been used as effective adsorbents for phosphorus removal in water treatment mohammed and rashid 2012 westholm 2006 zhou et al 2016 and constructed wetlands vohla et al 2011 the utilization of industrial solid wastes as adsorbents could emphasize the concept of waste to resource supply chains to achieve a circular economy pan et al 2017 for instance drizo et al 2006 used electric arc furnace slag eafs mixed with limestone in adsorption columns and they could almost achieve 100 removal efficiency of phosphorus with an adsorption capacity of 2 2 mg p per gram of adsorbent similarly claveau mallet et al 2012 used eafs as a medium to absorb phosphorus and they observed the formation of precipitate crystals in the filter cavities thus some modification processes were necessary to incorporate both n and p removal in bioretention despite the rapid progress of using solid wastes in water treatment barca et al 2014 2018 bowden et al 2009 little to no research has been conducted to use alkaline solid wastes as the media in bioretention cells the primary goal of this study was to enhance the removal of nutrients in bioretention systems by employing a prototype in this study six different types of solid wastes as discussed in experimental section were first evaluated for phosphorus removal from wastewater then one with the best performance was finally selected and mixed with the soil to form special media in the bioretention the design of the saturated zone was combined with the use of special media to simultaneously enhance nitrogen and phosphorus removal we have simulated the runoff of the stormwater with five different intensities through the chicago method and mimicked the synthetic agricultural runoff with two different levels of nutrients concentrations these could determine the flexibility and reliability of the modified bioretention cells in the cases of extreme weather and pollution events such as heavy rain and nutrients loss after fertilization applies the correlation analysis was also performed to evaluate the relationship between the rainfall intensity and nutrient removal finally the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus by the modified bioretention media was determined in order to provide the basis of the criteria of design 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of solid wastes based on leaching and adsorption tests figure s1 see supplementary information shows the framework of research objectives and experimental designs for performance evaluation of modified bioretention systems in this study in order to select the potential candidate as the substrate of the modified media in bioretention the performance of nutrient removal using six different solid wastes was evaluated 1 shells collected from market 2 eafs from tung ho

refining slag rfs from china steel corp all these materials were crushed and sieved to pass through a 60 mesh sieve 0 25 mm the leaching and adsorption tests for these materials were conducted and then the one with the highest phosphorus adsorption capacity under the premise of leaching less impurities and nutrients was selected for the leaching tests 5 g of materials was added to 250 ml di water in the glass bottle with crew cap shaking at 150 rpm in an orbital water bath rvb 20 firstek taiwan at 25 c for 24 h the leaching tests lasted for 10 days and the aqueous solution was collected and replaced with fresh di water every day the sample was filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters and then analyzed with ic eco ic package metrohm switzerland after the leaching test the filtered solid materials were dried in an oven do45 deng yng taiwan for subsequent adsorption tests for the adsorption tests the effect of various operating factors viz initial phosphate concentrations 1 2 3 4 and 5

orbital water bath at 25 c for 120 min the final solutions were filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters for ion chromatography in accordance with astm d8001 16 astm 2016 the amount of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent q mg g and the percentage of sorption η were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q v c 0 c e w 1000 2 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where v ml is the volume of the adsorbate solution c o mg l and c e mg l are the concentration of adsorbate in the solution before and after adsorption respectively and w g is the weight of the adsorbent 2 2 set up of modified bioretention columns four column type bioretention cells 90 cm in height and 15 cm in diameter were set to evaluate the effect of bioretention designs and operating conditions such as rainfall intensity and nutrient concentration on the removal efficiency of nutrients fig s2 see supplementary information shows the framework of the experimental design for the modified bioretention in this study the heights of media layer coarse layer and drainage layer in bioretention cells were 55 10 and 15 cm respectively fig 1 shows the designs and specific characteristics of each bioretention column the columns were made of transparent pvc with a sampling port at the bottom and a drain at 5 cm from the top to limit the aquifer height based on the aforementioned leaching and adsorption tests ba was used as the modification material in the column of sm with a layer containing special media and smsz with both special media and saturated zone as presented in table s1 see supplementary information for the modified bioretention 10 of soil in sm and smsz columns was substituted by ba the soil used was 7 02 miscellaneous organic cultivation medium organic matter 52 tn 0 5 tp2o5 0 1 tk2o 0 4 ph 5 6 conductivity 2 ds m produced from cui yun horticulture company guangdong china the composition of the soil included peat soil perlite vermiculite cocoanut fiber and carbonized rice husk based on triple permeability tests in accordance with astm d2434 68 astm 2006 the permeability of the soil and ba modified soil was found to be 125 8 8 9 mm h and 102 8 6 2 mm h respectively the sand used was quartz sand specific gravity 2 66 g cm3

ranged from 1 to 2 cm the soil media coarse sand and gravel layers were separated by geotextiles gold joint industry co ltd taiwan with a pore size of 0 194 mm a thickness of 2 6 mm and a water permeability of 1 677 sec 1 the type of vegetation used on the surface of bioretention columns was codiaeum variegatum a species of plant in the genus codiaeum a member of the euphorbiaceae family 2 3 rainfall simulation and runoff calculation based on the empirical model of rainfall intensity in nanjing jiangsu province china in eq 3 we simulated the rainfall patterns with the chicago storm theory keifer and chu 1957 using eqs 4 and 5 the rainfall duration t was assumed to be 120 min with a rain peak coefficient of 0 4 five different recurrence intervals p in years i e 2a 5a 10a 20a and 30a were used as presented in table s2 see supplementary information 3 i 64 3 53 8 l o g p t 32 9 1 001 4 before peak i t b a 1 n t b r b t b r b n 1 5 after peak i t a a 1 n t a 1 r b t a 1 r b n 1 where i mm min is the rainfall intensity t mins is the rainfall duration p a is the recurrence interval and a b and n are the constants dependent on the units employed and the recurrence interval of the storm the rainwater runoffs associated with different recurrence intervals were then calculated according to the drainage criterion gb 50014 2006 the rainwater design flow rate was calculated according to eq 6 6 q s i ψ f where q s ml min is the design flow rate of rainwater ψ is the runoff coefficient i e assumed to be 0 3 for soil road such as farmland or suburb and f cm2 is the catchment area percentage i e assumed to be 5 as the ratio of the bioretention area to the catchment area in order to determine the performance of modified bioretention cells in the case of excessive nutrients contaminated stormwater two different concentrations of synthetic water runoff were used as presented in table 1 the concentration of pollutants in synthetic runoff for normal event was designed to be similar to the agricultural runoff as suggested in the literature ergas et al 2010 lucke and nichols 2015 zhang et al 2010 the experimental conditions for the extreme event were used to evaluate the performance of modified bioretention in the case of sudden high concentration in stormwater 2 4 evaluation of removal efficiency by modified bioretention prior to applying bioretention columns for performance evaluation they were flushed with tap water for three weeks to ensure sufficient settlement and natural compaction as well as allowing the growth of microorganisms especially the anaerobic microorganisms in the saturated zone the sufficient leaching of nutrients and unstable pollutants from the soil could also avoid the interference of data analysis during evaluation experiments the synthetic agricultural runoff was continuously introduced from the storage bucket to the top of bioretention columns using peristaltic pumps parmer masterflex l s with model 7518 10 cole usa at the designated runoff intensity the flow through water was sampled every 30 min and then filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters for the subsequent digestion the filtered solutions were prepared and then digested for ion chromatography to determine the concentrations of no3 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn the removal ratio for different forms of nutrients was calculated by eq 7 7 η c 0 c t c 0 100 where η is the removal ratio c 0 mg l is the nutrients concentrations in the runoff before getting into the bioretention cells and c t mg l is the nutrients concentrations in the outflow 2 5 adsorption isotherms for modified media layers in bioretention the adsorption isotherm of phosphorus was modeled by both the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir isotherm model describes the formation of a monolayer adsorbate on the outer surface of the adsorbent while the freundlich isotherm model represents the characteristics of multiple layers adsorption on the heterogeneous surface dada et al 2012 the general form of the langmuir isotherm model can be described by eq 8 or 9 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 9 1 q e 1 q m 1 q m 1 k l c e where q e mg g is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed per gram at equilibrium q m mg g is the saturated adsorption capacity c e mg l is the adsorbate equilibrium concentration and k l l mg is the langmuir adsorption constant the freundlich isotherm model can be described by eqs 10 and 11 10 q e k f c e 1 n 11 log q e l o g k f 1 n log c e where q e mg g the amount of metal adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium k f is the freundlich isotherm coefficient c e mg l is the adsorbate equilibrium concentration and n is a constant representing the adsorption intensity 2 6 chemical compositions and surface characterization the chemical compositions of all materials were analyzed with x ray fluorescence xrf by the cement and concrete laboratory of chc resources co ltd taiwan the materials before and after the leaching and adsorption tests were characterized by the scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds to evaluate the changes in morphology crystal structure and the chemical compositions of the surface the compositions and distribution of elements on the surface of solid wastes could be determined by eds analysis dass amiour et al 2013 for all analytical tests the materials were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nutrient adsorption capacity using solid wastes table 2 summarizes the chemical compositions of different types of solid wastes determined by the xrf analysis the major components in these solid wastes included cao sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 mgo and na2o especially for ba and eafs with trace amounts of so3 and k2o in contrast the component in shell was mainly cao where the content of calcium carbonate was around 88 4 based on the thermogravimetric analysis the previous studies suggested that the removal efficiency of phosphorus by solid wastes was greatly influenced by the chemical components such as aluminum calcium and iron oxides drizo et al 1999 the as received eafs fa and ba contained a small portion of p2o5 which might potentially result in phosphorus leaching it was noted that the phosphorus leaching potential of these materials was also greatly influenced by the leachable p content yan et al 2016 upon the leaching experiment all these materials were rinsed with tap water for 10 days to simulate the leaching process of the bioretention under actual conditions during these days the conductivity and nutrients leaching amount were determined as shown in fig 2 from fig 2 a it was observed that the electrical conductivity dropped rapidly after the first day and the same trend slowed down after the sixth day this observation indicated that most of the leachable ions were leached from these materials after being washed in the first five days especially in the first day in fig 2 b the rapid leaching of nitrate ions was observed in the first five days for all materials except ba and similarly the leaching of phosphate was observed for all materials the leaching concentration of phosphate from rfs could be up to 50 mg l at the first day fig 2 c the phosphate concentration in leachate for both eafs and fa also was relatively higher i e 50 mg l at the first day and then over 70 mg l at the tenth day compared to ba bofs and shell as a result solid wastes including eafs fa and rfs were not used for subsequent adsorption experiments because of their higher phosphate leaching potential fig 3 shows the results of adsorption experiments for ba bofs and shell indicating that ba could exhibit excellent adsorption efficiency of phosphorus when comparison with other two materials the efficiency of phosphorus adsorption using ba exceeded to 98 regardless the change of the phosphate concentration the ph of the solution and the amount of adsorbent in contrast the efficiency of phosphorus adsorption using bofs and shell was approximately determined as 50 95 and 25 50 respectively the adsorption efficiency of these waste derived adsorbents began to decrease with the increase of phosphorus concentrations in water this might be attributed to the concentrations of phosphorus in water beyond the saturated adsorption capacity of adsorbents also the performance of adsorption and precipitation processes was greatly altered by the ph values of the solution barca et al 2014 the efficiency of phosphate adsorption on these three adsorbents inclined to decrease with the increase of ph in water in particular the adsorption capacity for bofs showed a strongly dependent on the ph of the solution it was noted that a higher ph value would result in more negative charged oh on the surface of active sites of adsorbents and the formation of this new charged layer would significantly repulse the negatively charged species in solution xue et al 2009 such as phosphate the ph would influence the dissolution of ca2 fe3 and al3 from the solid wastes as well as the precipitation of calcium phosphate which was proposed as the main mechanism of phosphate removal barca et al 2014 despite the aforementioned mechanism ba could still maintain high adsorption efficiency as the ph of the solution increased according to the above results ba was selected as substrates for the modified soil media in bioretention systems as it could exhibit the excellent performance in both leaching and adsorption experiments at different ph values adsorbent dosages and phosphorus concentrations sem with the eds analysis fig s3 in the supplementary information were performed and the atomic percentage table s3 in the supplementary information on the selected area of ba was calculated the obtained results from sem eds analyses indicated a significant change on the surface of ba after leaching and adsorption processes compared to fig 4 a the surface of ba after leaching fig 4 b was smoother however after the adsorption process a remarkable change in the surface structure was observed where polyhedral crystal aggregates and or metal phosphate precipitates were formed due to the phosphorus adsorption on the surface of the ba similar findings of the formation of precipitates on the surface of the materials were observed in the previous studies bowden et al 2009 okochi 2013 according to the eds results the major elements on the surface of ba were found to include calcium iron aluminum and silicon fig s3 a it was noted that after the leaching experiments the eds peak intensities of several elements such as aluminum and magnesium in ba were diminished fig s3 b the formation of phosphorus peak in ba after the adsorption experiments indicated that phosphate precipitates were formed on the surface of ba after the adsorption fig s3 c 3 2 effect of rainfall intensity on nutrient retention by modified bioretention based on the above preliminary evaluation of leaching and adsorption performance ba was suggested as the filler media in the modified bioretention cells to determine the effect of rainfall intensities on the modified bioretention systems the chicago storm theory was applied to simulate five different storm intensities as shown in fig 5 the area of each column indicated the total amount of rainfalls introducing into the bioretention cells for every 5 min all columns could exhibit high tp removal efficiency at the initial sampling time fig 6 it was observed that the tp concentration in the effluent was reduced to less than 1 mg l as p the traditional bioretention cell i e the control column exhibited the lowest tp removal efficiency in most cases 50 at the same time the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent was significantly reduced for the sm and smsz columns this indicates that a strongly adsorption and chemical precipitation processes have occurred yan et al 2018 further assessment conveyed that the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent gradually increased as the rainfall time increased this might be attributed to the fact that the rapid reversible adsorption sites would be gradually occupied as the rainfall period increased the adsorbed phosphorus would be slowly relocated to an irreversible adsorption site during each rainfall event hsieh et al 2007 lucas and greenway 2008 it was also identified that the released reversible sites could regain the adsorption capacity for the soil media layer in bioretention cells when next rainfall starts lucas and greenway 2008 despite the gradual reduction in the removal ratio with the increase of sampling time rainfall period the removal ratio of phosphorus in five different rainfall intensities by the sm column remained high i e over 95 5 the bioretention systems with improved media e g sm and smsz could even reach high efficiency over 96 5 when the rainfall recurrence interval was noticed as 2a however the removal ratio of tp in the effluent gradually decreased with the increase of rainfall intensity this could be due to the fact that the hydraulic retention time in bioretention would decrease under a higher intensity rainfall due to a greater volume of runoff within the same period the traditional bioretention with the control column was relatively vulnerable to high rainfall intensity where the removal ratio of tp decreased to 78 if the recurrence interval increased to 30a it thus suggested that the bioretention with ba modified special media should be more reliable and stable even in the extreme weather event with a higher rainfall recurrence interval fig 7 shows the tn removal efficiency using different types of columns the removal efficiency of tn for all columns decreased with the increase of sampling time regardless of rainfall recurrence intervals the bioretention columns with the saturated zone i e sz and smsz exhibited a higher removal ratio over 42 it was observed that the efficiency of tn removal by bioretention columns could even reach 55 when the recurrence interval was found as 5a this enhanced removal of nitrogen could be due to the denitrification process under the anaerobic conditions in the saturated zone as the aforementioned the nitrates could be converted into n2 by denitrification in the deep anaerobic zone and thus removed by the bioretention chen et al 2013 fig 8 shows the no3 concentration in the effluent under different rainfall recurrence intervals in most cases the no3 removal efficiency of the bioretention column seemed to decrease with the increase of sampling time the bioretention columns with the saturated zone i e sz and smsz did not exhibit a higher no3 n removal ratio than that without the saturated zone i e control and sm a suitable aerobic anaerobic environment could enhance the nitrogen cycle in bioretention and promote the growth of ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria li and davis 2014 although the organic nitrogen was continuously ammoniated during denitrification in the saturated zone the nitrification process could convert both nitrite and ammonia into nitrate thereby maintaining the no3 n concentration in the effluent however the tn concentration in the bioretention cells with the saturated zone was greatly reduced fig 7 indicating the significant enhancement of denitrification similar results were observed in the previous studies dietz and clausen 2006 fig 9 shows the tkn removal efficiency of the four different types of bioretention columns and all the columns showed a remarkable tkn removal efficiency the removal efficiency of tkn was normally higher than that of nitrate indicating that the tkn organic n and ammonia n content was effectively converted through ammoniation and nitrification reactions compared with other columns the sz column maintained a stable removal efficiency of tkn under different rainfall recurrence intervals this might be attributed to the reason that the no3 n in the saturated zone was continuously consumed by the denitrification reactions thereby facilitating the conversion of tkn into no3 n in contrast the sm column exhibited relatively lower removal efficiency of tkn fig 9 b the results and findings from this study could provide an insight of large scale engineering demonstration in this study the performance of modified bioretention by simulating an immediate rainfall for 2 h with different intensities was evaluated however the removal of nutrients by bio utilization in modified bioretention systems such as plant uptake and biochemical reactions by microorganisms was not yet studied in details the interaction between adsorption by ba modified media and bioprocesses and their contribution to the removal of nutrients would be important for long term operations longer and or more rainfalls thus our future research will be focused on the effect of long term operations as well as the contributions of different mechanisms e g adsorption and bioconversion on the removal of nutrients in stormwater using ba modified bioretention systems 3 3 effect of nutrient concentration on nutrient retention by modified bioretention fig 10 shows the effect of tp and no3 concentrations normal vs extreme events as presented in table 1 on the removal efficiency of bioretention cells with different columns in general the inflow rainwater with higher nutrient concentrations would result in higher concentrations in the outflow of bioretention davis et al 2006 it was noted that the tp removal efficiency increased in the case of higher concentrations extreme event for both the control and sm columns a higher phosphorus load in fact could represent a larger concentration gradient which in turn promoted the adsorption process between the adsorbate and adsorbent in the solution by enhancing the available chelate sites on the adsorbent the extent of removal of phosphorus was markedly influenced by the ratio of the phosphorus in the solution i e dp and the adsorbed phosphorus rosenquist et al 2010 similarly for the no3 removal all columns except the sm column exhibited excellent removal efficiency in the case of a high concentration of nutrients although the concentration of nutrients in the synthetic rainwater increased the modified bioretention systems could still possess sufficient treatment capacity to handle the excessive concentration of nutrients within a short period fig 11 shows the effect of tkn and tn concentrations on the removal efficiency of bioretention cells with different columns for tkn the removal efficiency in the case of high nutrient concentrations extreme event was higher than that of normal event especially the two columns with submerged zones 80 similar observations were found for the removal of tn in the case of extreme event where the columns with the saturated zone exhibited a higher removal efficiency over 60 according to the study reported by lucke et al 2017 the removal ratio of tn at high nutrients inflow concentrations was about 30 which was higher than that at low nutrients inflow concentrations it was thus noteworthy to mention that the improved bioretention with the smsz column combines the special ba modified media and the saturated zone could enable the simultaneous removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from runoff it was inferred that the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp with the typical nutrient concentration normal event was found to be 58 66 and 97 respectively when the recurrence interval of the rainfall was observed as 2a in the case of the high nutrient concentration extreme event the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp became 70 82 and 82 respectively according to the experimental data the correlation analysis between the rainfall intensity and nutrient removal was performed as presented in table 3 the results indicated that the rainfall intensity could be negatively correlated with the removal efficiency of tp and no3 via the modified bioretention especially for the removal of tp in the runoff the bioretention cell with the control and sm columns exhibited a significant correlation with the coefficients over 0 98 our results could also indicate a strong positive correlation between the tp denoted as p in table 3 and no3 n denoted as n in table 3 removal for the sm column both c2 and c4 in table 3 the bioretention cell using the ba modified special media thus could simultaneously enhance the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen 3 4 isotherms of phosphate adsorption by modified bioretention media in order to provide the basis of design criteria for the modified bioretention media both the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were applied for po4 3 adsorption fig 12 the results indicated that the freundlich model fitted well r 2 0 945 for the adsorption process of phosphate rather than the langmuir model r 2 0 939 this implied that the behavior of po4 3 adsorption by the modified ba based bioretention media was characterized by a multilayer sorption table 4 presents the parameters fitting results of the models for the freundlich model the adsorption energy should exponentially decrease on the ending point of the adsorption centers of an adsorbent rangabhashiyam et al 2014 the freundlich isotherm coefficient k f and n value were 0 34 0 01 mg0 79l0 21g 1 and 4 76 respectively the n value greater than one represented favorable adsorption conditions in other words the modified bioretention systems with ba could exhibited an excellent adsorption affinity for po4 3 which could be feasibly applied for phosphorus removal from rainwater 3 5 implications to excessive nutrients contaminated stormwater management nexus optimization of water food energy elements is one of the core directions for achieving sustainable development in recent years green infrastructure such as bioretention is a network system that could provide ingredients for cities and suburbs to address the challenges in climate change and strengthen the resilience and sustainability of water energy resources the deployment of green infrastructure for water treatment could bring a synergy in optimizing the complex nexus between water and energy elements as wastewater treatment plants are energy intensive especially for stormwater runoff management enhanced removal of nitrogen and phosphorus has been an important research direction in this study we have used solid wastes i e bottom ash as the modified filter media together with the saturated zone to improve the retention and removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by bioretention we have evaluated six different types of solid waste materials by preliminary leaching and adsorption tests and noticed that some of the solid wastes might exhibit negative impacts to the soil and the aquatic environment such as heavy metals leaching industrial solid wastes such as steel slags and fly ashes have been used in water treatment and achieved significant results however the risk of heavy metals e g hg cr zn and pb leaching from these materials needed to be carefully assessed prior to large scale applications it was suggested that an additional pretreatment and or stabilization for industrial solid wastes were required to ensure the safety and sustainability of the environment in addition to industrial solid wastes biomass such as lignocellulosic substrates and woody pellets might be suitable as the modifiers in bioretention systems biomass could be converted as biochars to provide high specific surface area for nutrients adsorption thereby increasing the nutrient retention capacity beusch et al 2019 furthermore the formula of the special media e g the substitution ratios of solid wastes was essential to maximize the performance of nutrients removal by the modified bioretention systems in overall the design of bioretention could also be integrated with spatial planning and landscape development pötz and bleuzé 2012 4 conclusions this study established the enhanced removal of nutrients p and n in a simulated stormwater runoff by a bioretention system amended with the addition of alkaline solid waste in this study bottom ash ba was used as the filter media in bioretention systems to enhance the treatment capacity and the efficiency of removal of nutrients from stormwater the results indicated that the phosphorus removal was greatly enhanced by adding metal rich solid wastes within the filter media of bioretention systems thus the bioretention cell column with ba filler media could exhibit a high phosphorus removal efficiency 90 according to the sem eds analysis phosphate precipitates were formed on the surface of ba after the adsorption rainfall intensity could pose a great influence on the removal of pollutants from bioretention it was inferred that a longer rainfall recurrence interval would reduce the treatment capacity of bioretention systems also the design of combining the modified media layer with the saturated zone in bioretention could effectively improve both the phosphorus and nitrogen removal efficiencies at two years of recurrence interval the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp was found to be about 58 66 and 97 respectively in the normal event in the case of an extreme event i e double concentrations of nutrients the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp became 70 82 and 82 respectively the behavior of phosphorus removal by modified bioretention was characterized by a multilayer sorption in the freundlich model indicating an excellent adsorption affinity for phosphorus for future research the effect of long term operations and their mechanisms e g adsorption and bioconversion of nutrient retention as well as the roles of modified bioretention in addressing water energy nexus should be priority research directions in the field of stormwater management declaration of interests the

18678,bioretention systems have been found to be potential candidates for the removal of various pollutants nutrients from rainfall or stormwater runoff despite bioretention has been widely developed for the removal of nutrients from stormwater effective removal of both phosphorus and nitrogen is still a challenge hence in this study bioretention systems modified by alkaline solid waste media have been reported for the effective removal of nutrients six different types of solid wastes were first assessed using leaching and adsorption tests and then the bottom ash from a refuse incineration plant was selected as a modifier the bottom ash was mixed with soil to form a special media as the filter layer in the bioretention systems the nutrient removal efficiencies of the modified bioretention systems were evaluated and also compared with those of the unmodified control for this purpose the design of the modified filter media with a saturated zone was combined to enhance the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the effect of different rainfall intensities and nutrient concentrations in stormwater runoff on the removal efficiency of nutrients was evaluated the results indicated that the modified bioretention with bottom ash modified soil media and saturated zone could exhibit the excellent removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus from stormwater runoff the extent of removal of total nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus was found to be 58 70 66 82 and 82 97 respectively the performed correlation analysis showed that the bioretention cell using the special media could simultaneously enhance the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen as a part of this study the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus removal by the modified bioretention systems have also been determined finally the implications and opportunities for deploying modified bioretention systems for optimizing water energy nexus and stormwater management were illustrated in overall this study demonstrated that the modified bioretention systems could substantially enhance the removal efficiencies of nutrients from stormwater runoff graphical abstract image 1 keywords green infrastructure bottom ash dissolved phosphorus rainfall intensity isotherm freundlich 1 introduction the prompt growth in impermeable surfaces in urban areas did not only cause the increased flood volumes and stormwater peak flow but also exacerbated the wash off of pollutants which could seriously deteriorate the runoff water quality stormwater runoff could contain various water contaminants such as organic matter suspended solids ss phosphorus p nitrogen n and dissolved heavy metals thus the stormwater runoff has been considered as one of the major causes for aquatic environment deteriorations and ecosystem health impacts chahal et al 2016 mcintyre et al 2016 it would transport a range of pollutants such as sediments ermolin et al 2018 heavy metals ashoori et al 2019 hydrocarbon bakacs et al 2013 diblasi et al 2009 garden fertilizers and pesticides cameron et al 2012 to the receiving watersheds although nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for growing the plants liu and davis 2014 the excessive nutrients in stormwater runoff would cause eutrophication yan et al 2016 and could destroy the aquatic ecosystems xue et al 2009 in general nutrients could be effectively removed by physical chemical and biological approaches in wastewater treatment plants however in most of the stormwater runoff agricultural and horticultural drainage their collection for the wastewater treatment would be very difficult thus green infrastructure has been considered as one of the best management practices for the nonpoint source pollution such as stormwater among various green infrastructure facilities bioretention systems have been considered to exhibit excellent ability in water quality control and quantity retention of stormwater runoff with the multiple layer structure bioretention could maximize the potential for moisture storage utilization and evapotranspiration thereby possessing complex functions of physical chemical and biological treatment county 1993 extensive studies have been reported to improve the design of bioretention systems austin 2012 bjorklund and li 2017 hsieh and davis 2005 as well as to evaluate the performance of the removal of nutrients from stormwater runoff dietz 2016 goh et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 the transport pathways and fate of nitrogen and phosphorus in the bioretention have been evaluated by numerous field and lab scale studies nitrogen removal has remained as a technical challenge in bioretention mainly due to the high solubility and the poor absorbability of the dissolved n species such as nitrite and nitrate nitrogen removal was mainly taken place through assimilation of plants boelee et al 2011 adsorption of negative charge in soil media bassin et al 2011 and nitrification denitrification processes via microorganisms norton et al 2017 due to atmospheric reoxygenation and oxygen supply from plant roots the surface layer in bioretention systems could provide an aerobic environment for ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria to promote ammonization and nitrification respectively the obtained no3 n from the nitrification reaction and the original no3 n in the runoff were fixed by the assimilation of vegetation and microorganisms while part of no3 n was converted into n2 by denitrification in the deep anaerobic zone and discharged from the bioretention chen et al 2013 kim et al 2003 developed the nitrogen removal system using newspapers wood chips and elemental sulphur lime as the medium for denitrification in their lab scale system almost 80 removal ratio of no3 n was successfully achieved similarly sengupta et al 2007 used a ground oyster shell as a solid phase buffer in a sulphur oxidation denitrification reactor to enhance the denitrification reactions studies have confirmed that the removal of nitrogen by plant uptake was different under saturated and unsaturated conditions in bioretention systems on the other hand phosphorus in water could be divided into particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp similar to suspended solids bioretention was found to be effective in removing pp through the physical approaches including sedimentation and filtration li and davis 2016 however it was less effective for the removal of dp due to the limited adsorption capacity of dp most phosphate fertilizers such as monoammonium phosphate ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and calcium phosphate were highly soluble and would easily be transported by the runoff in other words the phosphorus species in stormwater runoff were mostly present in the form of dp the major mechanisms of dp removal could include bio utilization adsorption and precipitation although the bio utilization approaches via phytoremediation and p accumulating organisms were widely used mortula 2006 wang et al 2014 and the phosphorus absorbed during the growth of plants might return to the soils due to the fallen leaves verhoeven and meuleman 1999 thus bioretention also could not function like activated sludge processes in wastewater treatment plants with periodical discharge of phosphorus rich sludge in fact the removal of dp by bioretention mainly relies on adsorption and chemical precipitation with metal salts such as calcium aluminum and iron in the layer of the soil media to form pp barca et al 2013 bird and drizo 2010 the formed pp could be removed afterward via the physical approach the adsorption process was reported to occur much faster i e electrostatic ion exchange reactions fast and reversible could first occur on the outer spherical surface followed by the adsorption forming monodentate and bidentate complexes on the inner sphere surface li and davis 2016 compared with adsorption reactions the kinetics of precipitation reactions was found to be slower and even could take up to a few days søvik and kløve 2005 therefore the rapid adsorption process was suggested to predominate when the runoff flowed through the soil media layer in stormwater runoff the partition of p between the particulate and dissolved forms was highly variable as the metal ions in the soil media of bioretention systems were limited proper modification of the filler media layer in bioretention was better known as the key to enhance the phosphorus especially dp removal industrial solid wastes such as fly ash oil shale red mud and steel slag have been used as effective adsorbents for phosphorus removal in water treatment mohammed and rashid 2012 westholm 2006 zhou et al 2016 and constructed wetlands vohla et al 2011 the utilization of industrial solid wastes as adsorbents could emphasize the concept of waste to resource supply chains to achieve a circular economy pan et al 2017 for instance drizo et al 2006 used electric arc furnace slag eafs mixed with limestone in adsorption columns and they could almost achieve 100 removal efficiency of phosphorus with an adsorption capacity of 2 2 mg p per gram of adsorbent similarly claveau mallet et al 2012 used eafs as a medium to absorb phosphorus and they observed the formation of precipitate crystals in the filter cavities thus some modification processes were necessary to incorporate both n and p removal in bioretention despite the rapid progress of using solid wastes in water treatment barca et al 2014 2018 bowden et al 2009 little to no research has been conducted to use alkaline solid wastes as the media in bioretention cells the primary goal of this study was to enhance the removal of nutrients in bioretention systems by employing a prototype in this study six different types of solid wastes as discussed in experimental section were first evaluated for phosphorus removal from wastewater then one with the best performance was finally selected and mixed with the soil to form special media in the bioretention the design of the saturated zone was combined with the use of special media to simultaneously enhance nitrogen and phosphorus removal we have simulated the runoff of the stormwater with five different intensities through the chicago method and mimicked the synthetic agricultural runoff with two different levels of nutrients concentrations these could determine the flexibility and reliability of the modified bioretention cells in the cases of extreme weather and pollution events such as heavy rain and nutrients loss after fertilization applies the correlation analysis was also performed to evaluate the relationship between the rainfall intensity and nutrient removal finally the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus by the modified bioretention media was determined in order to provide the basis of the criteria of design 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of solid wastes based on leaching and adsorption tests figure s1 see supplementary information shows the framework of research objectives and experimental designs for performance evaluation of modified bioretention systems in this study in order to select the potential candidate as the substrate of the modified media in bioretention the performance of nutrient removal using six different solid wastes was evaluated 1 shells collected from market 2 eafs from tung ho

refining slag rfs from china steel corp all these materials were crushed and sieved to pass through a 60 mesh sieve 0 25 mm the leaching and adsorption tests for these materials were conducted and then the one with the highest phosphorus adsorption capacity under the premise of leaching less impurities and nutrients was selected for the leaching tests 5 g of materials was added to 250 ml di water in the glass bottle with crew cap shaking at 150 rpm in an orbital water bath rvb 20 firstek taiwan at 25 c for 24 h the leaching tests lasted for 10 days and the aqueous solution was collected and replaced with fresh di water every day the sample was filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters and then analyzed with ic eco ic package metrohm switzerland after the leaching test the filtered solid materials were dried in an oven do45 deng yng taiwan for subsequent adsorption tests for the adsorption tests the effect of various operating factors viz initial phosphate concentrations 1 2 3 4 and 5

orbital water bath at 25 c for 120 min the final solutions were filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters for ion chromatography in accordance with astm d8001 16 astm 2016 the amount of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent q mg g and the percentage of sorption η were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q v c 0 c e w 1000 2 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where v ml is the volume of the adsorbate solution c o mg l and c e mg l are the concentration of adsorbate in the solution before and after adsorption respectively and w g is the weight of the adsorbent 2 2 set up of modified bioretention columns four column type bioretention cells 90 cm in height and 15 cm in diameter were set to evaluate the effect of bioretention designs and operating conditions such as rainfall intensity and nutrient concentration on the removal efficiency of nutrients fig s2 see supplementary information shows the framework of the experimental design for the modified bioretention in this study the heights of media layer coarse layer and drainage layer in bioretention cells were 55 10 and 15 cm respectively fig 1 shows the designs and specific characteristics of each bioretention column the columns were made of transparent pvc with a sampling port at the bottom and a drain at 5 cm from the top to limit the aquifer height based on the aforementioned leaching and adsorption tests ba was used as the modification material

permeability of 1 677 sec 1 the type of vegetation used on the surface of bioretention columns was codiaeum variegatum a species of plant in the genus codiaeum a member of the euphorbiaceae family 2 3 rainfall simulation and runoff calculation based on the empirical model of rainfall intensity in nanjing jiangsu province china in eq 3 we simulated the rainfall patterns with the chicago storm theory keifer and chu 1957 using eqs 4 and 5 the rainfall duration t was assumed to be 120 min with a rain peak coefficient of 0 4 five different recurrence intervals p in years i e 2a 5a 10a 20a and 30a were used as presented in table s2 see supplementary information 3 i 64 3 53 8 l o g p t 32 9 1 001 4 before peak i t b a 1 n t b r b t b r b n 1 5 after peak i t a a 1 n t a 1 r b t a 1 r b n 1 where i mm min is the rainfall intensity t mins is the rainfall duration p a is the recurrence interval and a b and n are the constants dependent on the units employed and the recurrence interval of the storm the rainwater runoffs associated with different recurrence intervals were then calculated according to the drainage criterion gb 50014 2006 the rainwater design flow rate was calculated according to eq 6 6 q s i ψ f where q s ml min is the design flow rate of rainwater ψ is the runoff coefficient i e assumed to be 0 3 for soil road such as farmland or suburb and f cm2 is the catchment area percentage i e assumed to be 5 as the ratio of the bioretention area to the catchment area in order to determine the performance of modified bioretention cells in the case of excessive nutrients contaminated stormwater two different concentrations of synthetic water runoff were used as presented in table 1 the concentration of pollutants in synthetic runoff for normal event was designed to be similar to the agricultural runoff as suggested in the literature ergas et al 2010 lucke and nichols 2015 zhang et al 2010 the experimental conditions for the extreme event were used to evaluate the performance of modified bioretention in the case of sudden high concentration in stormwater 2 4 evaluation of removal efficiency by modified bioretention prior to applying bioretention columns for performance evaluation they were flushed with tap water for three weeks to ensure sufficient settlement and natural compaction as well as allowing the growth of microorganisms especially the anaerobic microorganisms in the saturated zone the sufficient leaching of nutrients and unstable pollutants from the soil could also avoid the interference of data analysis during evaluation experiments the synthetic agricultural runoff was continuously introduced from the storage bucket to the top of bioretention columns using peristaltic pumps parmer masterflex l s with model 7518 10 cole usa at the designated runoff intensity the flow through water was sampled every 30 min and then filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters for the subsequent digestion the filtered solutions were prepared and then digested for ion chromatography to determine the concentrations of no3 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn the removal ratio for different forms of nutrients was calculated by eq 7 7 η c 0 c t c 0 100 where η is the removal ratio c 0 mg l is the nutrients concentrations in the runoff before getting into the bioretention cells and c t mg l is the nutrients concentrations in the outflow 2 5 adsorption isotherms for modified media layers in bioretention the adsorption isotherm of phosphorus was modeled by both the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir isotherm model describes the formation of a monolayer adsorbate on the outer surface of the adsorbent while the freundlich isotherm model represents the characteristics of multiple layers adsorption on the heterogeneous surface dada et al 2012 the general form of the langmuir isotherm model can be described by eq 8 or 9 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 9 1 q e 1 q m 1 q m 1 k l c e where q e mg g is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed per gram at equilibrium q m mg g is the saturated adsorption capacity c e mg l is the adsorbate equilibrium concentration and k l l mg is the langmuir adsorption constant the freundlich isotherm model can be described by eqs 10 and 11 10 q e k f c e 1 n 11 log q e l o g k f 1 n log c e where q e mg g the amount of metal adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium k f is the freundlich isotherm coefficient c e mg l is the adsorbate equilibrium concentration and n is a constant representing the adsorption intensity 2 6 chemical compositions and surface characterization the chemical compositions of all materials were analyzed with x ray fluorescence xrf by the cement and concrete laboratory of chc resources co ltd taiwan the materials before and after the leaching and adsorption tests were characterized by the scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds to evaluate the changes in morphology crystal structure and the chemical compositions of the surface the compositions and distribution of elements on the surface of solid wastes could be determined by eds analysis dass amiour et al 2013 for all analytical tests the materials were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nutrient adsorption capacity using solid wastes table 2 summarizes the chemical compositions of different types of solid wastes determined by the xrf analysis the major components in these solid wastes included cao sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 mgo and na2o especially for ba and eafs with trace amounts of so3 and k2o in contrast the component in shell was mainly cao where the content of calcium carbonate was around 88 4 based on the thermogravimetric analysis the previous studies suggested that the removal efficiency of phosphorus by solid wastes was greatly influenced by the chemical components such as aluminum calcium and iron oxides drizo et al 1999 the as received eafs fa and ba contained a small portion of p2o5 which might potentially result in phosphorus leaching it was noted that the phosphorus leaching potential of these materials was also greatly influenced by the leachable p content yan et al 2016 upon the leaching experiment all these materials were rinsed with tap water for 10 days to simulate the leaching process of the bioretention under actual conditions during these days the conductivity and nutrients leaching amount were determined as shown in fig 2 from fig 2 a it was observed that the electrical conductivity dropped rapidly after the first day and the same trend slowed down after the sixth day this observation indicated that most of the leachable ions were leached from these materials after being washed in the first five days especially in the first day in fig 2 b the rapid leaching of nitrate ions was observed in the first five days for all materials except ba and similarly the leaching of phosphate was observed for all materials the leaching concentration of phosphate from rfs could be up to 50 mg l at the first day fig 2 c the phosphate concentration in leachate for both eafs and fa also was relatively higher i e 50 mg l at the first day and then over 70 mg l at the tenth day compared to ba bofs and shell as a result solid wastes including eafs fa and rfs were not used for subsequent adsorption experiments because of their higher phosphate leaching potential fig 3 shows the results of adsorption experiments for ba bofs and shell indicating that ba could exhibit excellent adsorption efficiency of phosphorus when comparison with other two materials the efficiency of phosphorus adsorption using ba exceeded to 98 regardless the change of the phosphate concentration the ph of the solution and the amount of adsorbent in contrast the efficiency of phosphorus adsorption using bofs and shell was approximately determined as 50 95 and 25 50 respectively the adsorption efficiency of these waste derived adsorbents began to decrease with the increase of phosphorus concentrations in water this might be attributed to the concentrations of phosphorus in water beyond the saturated adsorption capacity of adsorbents also the performance of adsorption and precipitation processes was greatly altered by the ph values of the solution barca et al 2014 the efficiency of phosphate adsorption on these three adsorbents inclined to decrease with the increase of ph in water in particular the adsorption capacity for bofs showed a strongly dependent on the ph of the solution it was noted that a higher ph value would result in more negative charged oh on the surface of active sites of adsorbents and the formation of this new charged layer would significantly repulse the negatively charged species in solution xue et al 2009 such as phosphate the ph would influence the dissolution of ca2 fe3 and al3 from the solid wastes as well as the precipitation of calcium phosphate which was proposed as the main mechanism of phosphate removal barca et al 2014 despite the aforementioned mechanism ba could still maintain high adsorption efficiency as the ph of the solution increased according to the above results ba was selected as substrates for the modified soil media in bioretention systems as it could exhibit the excellent performance in both leaching and adsorption experiments at different ph values adsorbent dosages and phosphorus concentrations sem with the eds analysis fig s3 in the supplementary information were performed and the atomic percentage table s3 in the supplementary information on the selected area of ba was calculated the obtained results from sem eds analyses indicated a significant change on the surface of ba after leaching and adsorption processes compared to fig 4 a the surface of ba after leaching fig 4 b was smoother however after the adsorption process a remarkable change in the surface structure was observed where polyhedral crystal aggregates and or metal phosphate precipitates were formed due to the phosphorus adsorption on the surface of the ba similar findings of the formation of precipitates on the surface of the materials were observed in the previous studies bowden et al 2009 okochi 2013 according to the eds results the major elements on the surface of ba were found to include calcium iron aluminum and silicon fig s3 a it was noted that after the leaching experiments the eds peak intensities of several elements such as aluminum and magnesium in ba were diminished fig s3 b the formation of phosphorus peak in ba after the adsorption experiments indicated that phosphate precipitates were formed on the surface of ba after the adsorption fig s3 c 3 2 effect of rainfall intensity on nutrient retention by modified bioretention based on the above preliminary evaluation of leaching and adsorption performance ba was suggested as the filler media in the modified bioretention cells to determine the effect of rainfall intensities on the modified bioretention systems the chicago storm theory was applied to simulate five different storm intensities as shown in fig 5 the area of each column indicated the total amount of rainfalls introducing into the bioretention cells for every 5 min all columns could exhibit high tp removal efficiency at the initial sampling time fig 6 it was observed that the tp concentration in the effluent was reduced to less than 1 mg l as p the traditional bioretention cell i e the control column exhibited the lowest tp removal efficiency in most cases 50 at the same time the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent was significantly reduced for the sm and smsz columns this indicates that a strongly adsorption and chemical precipitation processes have occurred yan et al 2018 further assessment conveyed that the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent gradually increased as the rainfall time increased this might be attributed to the fact that the rapid reversible adsorption sites would be gradually occupied as the rainfall period increased the adsorbed phosphorus would be slowly relocated to an irreversible adsorption site during each rainfall event hsieh et al 2007 lucas and greenway 2008 it was also identified that the released reversible sites could regain the adsorption capacity for the soil media layer in bioretention cells when next rainfall starts lucas and greenway 2008 despite the gradual reduction in the removal ratio with the increase of sampling time rainfall period the removal ratio of phosphorus in five different rainfall intensities by the sm column remained high i e over 95 5 the bioretention systems with improved media e g sm and smsz could even reach high efficiency over 96 5 when the rainfall recurrence interval was noticed as 2a however the removal ratio of tp in the effluent gradually decreased with the increase of rainfall intensity this could be due to the fact that the hydraulic retention time in bioretention would decrease under a higher intensity rainfall due to a greater volume of runoff within the same period the traditional bioretention with the control column was relatively vulnerable to high rainfall intensity where the removal ratio of tp decreased to 78 if the recurrence interval increased to 30a it thus suggested that the bioretention with ba modified special media should be more reliable and stable even in the extreme weather event with a higher rainfall recurrence interval fig 7 shows the tn removal efficiency using different types of columns the removal efficiency of tn for all columns decreased with the increase of sampling time regardless of rainfall recurrence intervals the bioretention columns with the saturated zone i e sz and smsz exhibited a higher removal ratio over 42 it was observed that the efficiency of tn removal by bioretention columns could even reach 55 when the recurrence interval was found as 5a this enhanced removal of nitrogen could be due to the denitrification process under the anaerobic conditions in the saturated zone as the aforementioned the nitrates could be converted into n2 by denitrification in the deep anaerobic zone and thus removed by the bioretention chen et al 2013 fig 8 shows the no3 concentration in the effluent under different rainfall recurrence intervals in most cases the no3 removal efficiency of the bioretention column seemed to decrease with the increase of sampling time the bioretention columns with the saturated zone i e sz and smsz did not exhibit a higher no3 n removal ratio than that without the saturated zone i e control and sm a suitable aerobic anaerobic environment could enhance the nitrogen cycle in bioretention and promote the growth of ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria li and davis 2014 although the organic nitrogen was continuously ammoniated during denitrification in the saturated zone the nitrification process could convert both nitrite and ammonia into nitrate thereby maintaining the no3 n concentration in the effluent however the tn concentration in the bioretention cells with the saturated zone was greatly reduced fig 7 indicating the significant enhancement of denitrification similar results were observed in the previous studies dietz and clausen 2006 fig 9 shows the tkn removal efficiency of the four different types of bioretention columns and all the columns showed a remarkable tkn removal efficiency the removal efficiency of tkn was normally higher than that of nitrate indicating that the tkn organic n and ammonia n content was effectively converted through ammoniation and nitrification reactions compared with other columns the sz column maintained a stable removal efficiency of tkn under different rainfall recurrence intervals this might be attributed to the reason that the no3 n in the saturated zone was continuously consumed by the denitrification reactions thereby facilitating the conversion of tkn into no3 n in contrast the sm column exhibited relatively lower removal efficiency of tkn fig 9 b the results and findings from this study could provide an insight of large scale engineering demonstration in this study the performance of modified bioretention by simulating an immediate rainfall for 2 h with different intensities was evaluated however the removal of nutrients by bio utilization in modified bioretention systems such as plant uptake and biochemical reactions by microorganisms was not yet studied in details the interaction between adsorption by ba modified media and bioprocesses and their contribution to the removal of nutrients would be important for long term operations longer and or more rainfalls thus our future research will be focused on the effect of long term operations as well as the contributions of different mechanisms e g adsorption and bioconversion on the removal of nutrients in stormwater using ba modified bioretention systems 3 3 effect of nutrient concentration on nutrient retention by modified bioretention fig 10 shows the effect of tp and no3 concentrations normal vs extreme events as presented in table 1 on the removal efficiency of bioretention cells with different columns in general the inflow rainwater with higher nutrient concentrations would result in higher concentrations in the outflow of bioretention davis et al 2006 it was noted that the tp removal efficiency increased in the case of higher concentrations extreme event for both the control and sm columns a higher phosphorus load in fact could represent a larger concentration gradient which in turn promoted the adsorption process between the adsorbate and adsorbent in the solution by enhancing the available chelate sites on the adsorbent the extent of removal of phosphorus was markedly influenced by the ratio of the phosphorus in the solution i e dp and the adsorbed phosphorus rosenquist et al 2010 similarly for the no3 removal all columns except the sm column exhibited excellent removal efficiency in the case of a high concentration of nutrients although the concentration of nutrients in the synthetic rainwater increased the modified bioretention systems could still possess sufficient treatment capacity to handle the excessive concentration of nutrients within a short period fig 11 shows the effect of tkn and tn concentrations on the removal efficiency of bioretention cells with different columns for tkn the removal efficiency in the case of high nutrient concentrations extreme event was higher than that of normal event especially the two columns with submerged zones 80 similar observations were found for the removal of tn in the case of extreme event where the columns with the saturated zone exhibited a higher removal efficiency over 60 according to the study reported by lucke et al 2017 the removal ratio of tn at high nutrients inflow concentrations was about 30 which was higher than that at low nutrients inflow concentrations it was thus noteworthy to mention that the improved bioretention with the smsz column combines the special ba modified media and the saturated zone could enable the simultaneous removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from runoff it was inferred that the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp with the typical nutrient concentration normal event was found to be 58 66 and 97 respectively when the recurrence interval of the rainfall was observed as 2a in the case of the high nutrient concentration extreme event the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp became 70 82 and 82 respectively according to the experimental data the correlation analysis between the rainfall intensity and nutrient removal was performed as presented in table 3 the results indicated that the rainfall intensity could be negatively correlated with the removal efficiency of tp and no3 via the modified bioretention especially for the removal of tp in the runoff the bioretention cell with the control and sm columns exhibited a significant correlation with the coefficients over 0 98 our results could also indicate a strong positive correlation between the tp denoted as p in table 3 and no3 n denoted as n in table 3 removal for the sm column both c2 and c4 in table 3 the bioretention cell using the ba modified special media thus could simultaneously enhance the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen 3 4 isotherms of phosphate adsorption by modified bioretention media in order to provide the basis of design criteria for the modified bioretention media both the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were applied for po4 3 adsorption fig 12 the results indicated that the freundlich model fitted well r 2 0 945 for the adsorption process of phosphate rather than the langmuir model r 2 0 939 this implied that the behavior of po4 3 adsorption by the modified ba based bioretention media was characterized by a multilayer sorption table 4 presents the parameters fitting results of the models for the freundlich model the adsorption energy should exponentially decrease on the ending point of the adsorption centers of an adsorbent rangabhashiyam et al 2014 the freundlich isotherm coefficient k f and n value were 0 34 0 01 mg0 79l0 21g 1 and 4 76 respectively the n value greater than one represented favorable adsorption conditions in other words the modified bioretention systems with ba could exhibited an excellent adsorption affinity for po4 3 which could be feasibly applied for phosphorus removal from rainwater 3 5 implications to excessive nutrients contaminated stormwater management nexus optimization of water food energy elements is one of the core directions for achieving sustainable development in recent years green infrastructure such as bioretention is a network system that could provide ingredients for cities and suburbs to address the challenges in climate change and strengthen the resilience and sustainability of water energy resources the deployment of green infrastructure for water treatment could bring a synergy in optimizing the complex nexus between water and energy elements as wastewater treatment plants are energy intensive especially for stormwater runoff management enhanced removal of nitrogen and phosphorus has been an important research direction in this study we have used solid wastes i e bottom ash as the modified filter media together with the saturated zone to improve the retention and removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by bioretention we have evaluated six different types of solid waste materials by preliminary leaching and adsorption tests and noticed that some of the solid wastes might exhibit negative impacts to the soil and the aquatic environment such as heavy metals leaching industrial solid wastes such as steel slags and fly ashes have been used in water treatment and achieved significant results however the risk of heavy metals e g hg cr zn and pb leaching from these materials needed to be carefully assessed prior to large scale applications it was suggested that an additional pretreatment and or stabilization for industrial solid wastes were required to ensure the safety and sustainability of the environment in addition to industrial solid wastes biomass such as lignocellulosic substrates and woody pellets might be suitable as the modifiers in bioretention systems biomass could be converted as biochars to provide high specific surface area for nutrients adsorption thereby increasing the nutrient retention capacity beusch et al 2019 furthermore the formula of the special media e g the substitution ratios of solid wastes was essential to maximize the performance of nutrients removal by the modified bioretention systems in overall the design of bioretention could also be integrated with spatial planning and landscape development pötz and bleuzé 2012 4 conclusions this study established the enhanced removal of nutrients p and n in a simulated stormwater runoff by a bioretention system amended with the addition of alkaline solid waste in this study bottom ash ba was used as the filter media in bioretention systems to enhance the treatment capacity and the efficiency of removal of nutrients from stormwater the results indicated that the phosphorus removal was greatly enhanced by adding metal rich solid wastes within the filter media of bioretention systems thus the bioretention cell column with ba filler media could exhibit a high phosphorus removal efficiency 90 according to the sem eds analysis phosphate precipitates were formed on the surface of ba after the adsorption rainfall intensity could pose a great influence on the removal of pollutants from bioretention it was inferred that a longer rainfall recurrence interval would reduce the treatment capacity of bioretention systems also the design of combining the modified media layer with the saturated zone in bioretention could effectively improve both the phosphorus and nitrogen removal efficiencies at two years of recurrence interval the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp was found to be about 58 66 and 97 respectively in the normal event in the case of an extreme event i e double concentrations of nutrients the removal efficiency of tn tkn and tp became 70 82 and 82 respectively the behavior of phosphorus removal by modified bioretention was characterized by a multilayer sorption in the freundlich model indicating an excellent adsorption affinity for phosphorus for future research the effect of long term operations and their mechanisms e g adsorption and bioconversion of nutrient retention as well as the roles of modified bioretention in addressing water energy nexus should be priority research directions in the field of stormwater management declaration of interests the

18679,phosphonate is an important phosphorous species in the effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp contributing to eutrophication and interfering with phosphate removal in wwtp it is particularly difficult to determine phosphonates in samples of complex solution chemistry resulting in very limited information on their presence in environmental matrices herein we proposed a sensitive method based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms to determine six quantitatively most important phosphonates even at the ng l level i e 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4

diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid trimethylsilyldiazomethane tmschn2 derivatization of the target phosphonates is pre requisite since it could greatly increase the sensitivity up to 2 3 orders of magnitude over direct analysis of the virgin ones the sample pretreatment methods including ion exchange and solid phase extraction spe the derivatization procedures and the lc ms ms conditions were systematically optimized the limits of quantitation for the six phosphonates in the background of tap water ranged from 1 4 μg l to 57 μg l for direct analysis and from 5 0 ng l to 200 ng l for spe enabled pre concentration analysis respectively the reliability of the proposed method was successfully validated by analysis of authentic water samples collected from one river and three wwtps 0 088 7200 μg l phosphonates with satisfactory recoveries 72 126 to the best of knowledge this is the first report on quantification of phosphonates in environmental samples in china graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphonates methylation trimethylsilyldiazomethane lc ms ms wastewater river water 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limiting factor responsible for water eutrophication rott

to the presence of c p bond phosphonates are usually stable in environment raising increasing concerns for their potential accumulation in aquatic ecosystems and contribution to eutrophication due to transformation into bioavailable orthophosphates ternan et al 1998 davenport et al 2000 knepper and weil 2001 jaworska et al 2002 rott et al 2018a in addition other issues of phosphonates should not be ignored including possible remobilization of toxic metals from sediments gledhill and feijtel 1992 bordas and bourg 1998 nowack 2003 the formation of byproducts of critical concern during natural photo hydrolysis e g glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid grandcoin et al 2017 rott et al 2018a as well as the adverse effect on advanced removal of phosphate to meet more stringent regulations wenger oehn et al 2005 nowack and stone 2006 rott et al 2018a unfortunately very limited data is available on the presence of phosphonates in environmental samples nowack 1997 1998 2002 fürhacker et al 2005 schmidt et al 2014 nowack 1997 1998 determined several phosphonates in wastewater samples of swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps and dtpmp as high as 2 μmol l was detected in the influent of a wwtp surrounded by the textile industry with the average concentration of 0 12 μmol l in effluent in addition ntmp 0 75 μmol l and edtmp 0 15 μmol l were also detected in the wwtp influent schmidt et al 2014 found that the concentration of hedp ranged from 0 3 to 1 6 μg l and dtpmp from 0 1 to 1 3 μg l in six german rivers one of the key challenges for phosphonate analysis relies on the fact that phosphonates are present as anionic species tending to form metal complexes predominantly as ca and mg complexes in natural waters or wastewaters schmidt et al 2014 rott et al 2018a furthermore their low reactivity low volatility high hydrophilicity and lack of uv ir chromophores also hamper the sensitive analysis knepper 2003 rott et al 2017 2018b determined the concentration of a single phosphonate indirectly as the difference between the total p and orthophosphate p the currently available methods for direct analysis of phosphonate are summarized in table 1 most of which can only be applied in synthetic samples instead of environmental samples of complex solution chemistry or have high limits of determination lods taken into account the ionic character of phosphonates most of the available approaches are based on ion chromatographic ic separation followed by various detection tools including uv detection weiβ and hägele 1987 tschäbunin et al 1989a 1989b 1989c vaeth

conductivity detection ecd ma et al 2007 the first method for phosphonate quantification in wwtp samples was proposed by nowack 1997 where the target phosphonates were first transformed into the fe iii complexes for analysis by an ion pair high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with uv detection later to improve the sensitivity the coupling of ic with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ic icp ms was developed ammann 2002 kovačeviča et al 2004 fürhacker et al 2005 suzuki et al 2016 schmidt et al 2014 proposed a new pretreatment method of ic icp ms by transferring the complexed phosphonates into free phosphonic acids with the aid of strongly acidic cation exchanger followed by pre concentration with a weakly basic anion exchanger such improvement could result in lower lods and help discriminate hedp and dtpmp in river water samples unfortunately the specificity of the element detection together with retention times in ic icp ms method which was used for identification of the phosphonates has to be re examined in more complex matrices e g wastewater in this study we aimed at proposing a sensitive method to determine six phosphonates fig 1 of most quantitative importance in environmental samples based on the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms strategy to improve the sensitivity of this method we pre methylated the target phosphonates as inspired by the previous study klinger et al 1997 chen et al 2012 yang et al 2015 yamada et al 2018 this is because the methylated derivatives could greatly enhance the ms response and retention on reversed phase chromatography rpc over the virgin phosphonates or amines klinger et al 1997 chen et al 2012 wasslen et al 2014b yang et al 2015 yamada et al 2018 considering the widely used methylation agent diazomethane is toxic and explosive yang et al 2015 ranz et al 2008 we used trimethylsilyldiazomethane tmschn2 as an alternative for methylation of six phosphonates yamada et al 2018 the experimental conditions for methylation and lc ms ms were optimized and in response to the complicated composition of the environmental samples the pretreatment processes based on ion exchange and solid phase extraction spe were proposed the method performance was systematically evaluated and validated by determining six phosphonates in environmental samples from three wwtps and

effluent and one river water sample in china wwtp1 located in jiangyin city was set up based on the combined process of acidification anaerobic oxic a o air floatation to pre treat industrial wastewater from a printing and dyeing plant where large amounts of various phosphonates are used afterward the effluent is pumped to a centralized wwtp for further treatment wwtp2 employs the combined hydrolysis acidification anaerobic anoxic oxic coagulation process to treat the mixture of printing and dyeing wastewater 40 and domestic wastewater 60 in jiangyin city with the total capacity of 10000 m3 per day wwtp3 uses the a o coagulation process to receive wastewater from a textile factory nanjing city and the effluent is directly discharged into the surrounding river river water sample was collected from jiuxiang river near the xianlin campus of nanjing university nanjing city all the above samples were collected and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before analysis tap water was collected in the laboratory and used directly without further purification 2 3 sample preparation and derivatization after filtration with 0 45 μm membrane approximately 10 ml of the water sample passed through a column packed with strongly acidic polystyrene cation exchanger in the h form dionex onguard ii h 1 cc thermo fisher scientific inc usa a slow flow rate was desired 1 ml min to dissociate the possible cation phosphonate complexes in the samples subsequently the acidified sample was neutralized to approximately ph 7 with naoh for methylation note that spe procedure is required for the authentic samples containing trace phosphonates prior to methylation during the spe procedure a weak anion exchange cartridge was applied to purify and enrich phosphonates from the test samples to improve the sensitivity of the proposed method schmidt et al 2014 strata x aw sorbent cartridges 6 ml 500 mg phenomenex usa were used on a 24 fold vacuum extraction box supelco bellefonte pa usa after the cartridges were pre conditioned with 6 ml of meoh and 6 ml of water consecutively 50 ml of pretreated samples ph 5 5 flew through the column to enrich the target phosphonates afterward the column was rinsed with 3 ml water and the trapped phosphonates were eluted with 8 ml of 8 17 v v mixture of ammonium hydroxide and meoh then the collected eluent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at 40 c followed by the addition of 20 μl is standard solution and meoh in sequence to reach the preset volume of 1 00 ml finally it was filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon syringe filter for derivatization the methylation of six phosphonates in meoh by using tmschn2 are illustrated in fig 1 first 50 μl of the pretreated water sample and 20 μl is standard solution were add to a 1 5 ml brown sample vial and then diluted with meoh to reach the final volume of 1 00 ml for those after spe the sample of 1 00 ml was directly transferred into the sample vial then the tmschn2 solution 2 0 mol l in hexane of 100 μl was added to the vial after vortexing for about 10 s and allowing 2 h methylation at the room temperature 25 c the samples were injected into the lc ms ms system for further analysis 2 4 liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry a dionex ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc system coupled with a high resolution q exactive focus orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific inc germany were used the uhplc system which is controlled by chromeleon 7 2 software consisted of an srd 3600 solvent rack an hpg 3400rs pump a tcc 3000rs column compartment at 25 c and a wps 3000rs autosampler at 25 c the injection volume of 10 μl was used for uhplc analysis the separation of methylation derivatives was performed on a reversed phase zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 100 mm 4 6 mm 3 5 μm agilent usa using a flow rate of 0 500 ml min the mobile phases of 0 1 formic acid fa in water a and 0 1 fa in acetonitrile b were delivered under a gradient program starting with 10 b followed by a gradient of 10 40 b in 10 min 40 10 b in 0 1 min and maintained at 10 b for 3 9 min a column switching step is included in the chromatographic time program where the first 5 min eluent is discharged into the waste collector then the eluent from the uhplc column was directed into the q exactive focus ms ms which was set for parallel reaction monitoring prm in positive ionization mode the ms acquired a targeted ms ms scan at a resolution of 35 000 fwhm at m z 200 the heated electrospray ionization hesi source conditions were described as follows spray voltage at 3 5 kv capillary temperature at 350 c probe heater temperature at 450 c sheath gas at 25 arbitrary units auxiliary gas at 5 arbitrary units and sweep gas at 1 arbitrary units s lens rf level at 50 automatic gain control agc target of 105 with 200 ms maximum injection time was used tune and xcalibur software thermo scientific bremen germany was used to control the ms and process the data 2 5 method validation and quantification sensitivity of the above method was assessed by analyzing lods and limits of quantitation loqs from spiked phosphonate free water samples and standard solutions the lod and loq were determined from the amount of analytes that provides signal to noise ratio of s n 3 and s n 10 respectively since various target analytes were detectable in authentic samples the lods and loqs were available in the background of tap water phosphonate free an internal standard method was applied in the quantitative analysis to automatically correct the ms response and to compensate for injection variations as well the is solution 20 μl of 50 μmol l caffeine solution was spiked prior to lc ms ms analysis for all the samples preliminary experimental results suggests that caffeine if present in environmental water samples would be completely removed during ion exchange linearity was evaluated by the standard calibration assays in triplicate a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the analyte to is peak area ratios as a function of their concentration ratios the response factors obtained from the calibration curve were then applied to calculate the analyte concentrations and the blank sample with is solution only was involved in each sequence accuracy was expressed by the recoveries of the spiking phosphonates in tap water at two levels 1 nmol l and 1000 nmol l the precision of the method used for the lc ms ms determination was calculated by relative standard deviation rsd for five parallel samples of intra and inter day experiment to estimate the matrix effects after spe the matrix matched calibration curves 8 points were set up by spiking target compounds into 1 00 ml tap water extracts matrix effect me was calculated by the equation me slopem slopes 100 where slopem represents that of the matrix matched calibration curves and slopes is for the calibration plot with the solvent calibration solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 methylation of phosphonates six phosphonates used in this study possess ionic and highly polar nature and thus it is challenging to separate them from each other by hplc method schmidt et al 2014 also direct esi ms analysis of phosphonates seemed possible kuhn et al 2017 however its poor sensitivity at mg l levels cannot meet the requirement for analysis of trace phosphonates ng μg l in environmental samples comparatively methylation is an effective pretreatment step to analyze trace phosphonates in water klinger et al 1997 we optimized the methylation conditions using a univariate experimental design the dosage of tmschn2 and meoh the reaction ph temperature and duration the experimental conditions are mentioned as follows 100 μl of tmschn2 95 v v meoh 1 ml reaction ph 3 temperature 25 c and time of 2 h all the optimizations were performed in the mixed solution containing each phosphonates at 1 μmol l and the results are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a shows that the intensity of methylated phosphonates increased as the volume of tmschn2 increased and reached constant at the dosage of 100 μl fig 2b describes the effect of meoh concentration on the derivatization and one can see that 95 v v of meoh or higher could result in a constant methylation efficiency for each phosphonate thus we chose 95 v v of meoh 1 ml for all the derivatization processes the methylation temperature of phosphonic acid with diazomethane or tmschn2 varied case by case chen et al 2012 yang et al 2015 wong et al 2015 yamada et al 2018 in this study effect of reaction temperature on the yield of derivatization was tested fig 2c no significant difference of the methylation efficiency was observed in the range of 25 70 c and thus the reaction was carried out at room temperature 25 c similarly insignificant effect of ph 2 11 was distinguished on the derivatization yield fig 2d and 2 h reaction is sufficient to ensure an acceptable and constant methylation of the target phosphonates fig 2e 3 2 effect of interfering ions on methylation metal cations are ubiquitous in authentic water samples and some of multivalent cations tend to complex phosphonates thus it is necessary to elucidate the influence of metal ions on the methylation reaction for this purpose the mixed solution of six phosphonates each at 1 μmol l were first spiked with every test cation ca2 mg2 cu2 fe3 al3 the ph of the solutions was adjusted to 7 then they were then stored overnight in darkness before derivatization and detection to ensure a complete complexation note that the ion exchange pretreatment was not involved prior to derivatization as shown in fig 3 the presence of mg2 and ca2 both 50 μmol l would impose an adverse effect on the final detection of the target phosphonates besides the presence of cu2 fe3 and al3 at the set concentrations both 10 μmol l to avoid the possible precipitation or coagulation did not exert any significant effect on the analysis results considering the concentration of the added metal ions is much higher than the stoichiometric level for complexation we assume that the presence of multivalent ions may affect other analytical steps instead of methylation however it should be considered how to minimize or even exclude their adverse effect and details are described in the following section 3 5 in addition the effect of anionic species was considered by using chloride and sulfate as the models nacl and na2so4 as seen in fig s2 the analysis of phosphonates was not significantly affected in the presence of nacl 50 mmol l or na2so4 20 mmol l except for dtpmp note that higher ionic strength 2 g l will result in an inaccurate analysis of all the phosphonates fortunately for most authentic samples the concentration of the concerned anions is far below such level 3 3 uhplc ms ms analysis to select the precursor and product ions of methylated phosphonates direct infusion of individual methylated standards was performed at 1 μmol l full ms dd ms2 was carried out in the range m z 100 1000 to record all the esi mass spectra those of intensity threshold higher than 20000 were further fragmented to obtain ms2 ions under normalized collision energy nce of 20 ev the identified methylates mediated by tmschn2 were the same as those from diazomethane klinger et al 1997 and the totally methylated phosphonates were yielded except for hedp which produces tetramethyl derivative because it is difficult to methylate the hydroxyl group binding the central carbon of the p c p structure ranz et al 2008 all the precursor ions for quantification were the protonated molecular ones m h the full ms dd ms2 mode could provide more information of the fragmentation ions which is of great help to identify and confirm the targeted methylates ms2 spectra of the target precursor ions of methylated phosphonates are shown in fig s1 to obtain high selectivity and sensitivity of uhplc q exactive orbitrap ms ms analyses the parallel reaction monitoring prm mode was chosen for data acquisition because another mode i e selected ion monitoring sim mode could be adversely affected by the interference from by products for each analyte two identification ions were used one precursor ion and one product ion the molecular formula theoretical and experimental masses the product ion with the highest intensity and the corresponding nce optimized for six methylated phosphonates are shown in table 2 other instrument parameters including resolution agc and hesi parameters were also optimized and described in the experimental section methylation of phosphonic acid enhanced their chromatographic retention on the reversed phase column and the optimization of the chromatographic conditions was focused on how to separate their methylates from each other several chromatographic parameters were considered including c18 columns packed with different stationary phases and particle sizes various mobile phases and elution modes an eclipse plus c18 column combined with an acidic mobile phase and an elution gradient could successfully separate six methylated phosphonates as for the mobile phase two aqueous solvents were examined 0 1 fa and 10 mmol l ammonium acetate and the use of 0 1 fa could produce better peak shapes and higher intensity in addition acn was chosen as the organic composition of the mobile phase rather than meoh because the low viscosity of acn allows higher flow rate also acn is aprotic and therefore is less likely to create hydrogen bonds with the stationary phase or the analytes yamada et al 2018 a flow rate of 0 500 ml min was optimized to maximize the esi ms sensitivity lc ms ms chromatograms of six methylated phosphonates are depicted in fig 4 note that the eluent in the initial 5 min was deliberately entered into the waste collector with the aid of valve switching since it could remove most of the initially eluting salt ions to avoid their potential blockage of the esi system the relative response of the prm procedure together with the retention time was used as a criterion for target identification caffeine a methylated compound serves as a standard chemical m z 195 0876 in calibration solution of the q exactive system in positive ionization mode here it was chosen as an internal standard klinger et al 1997 under the above optimized chromatographic conditions the retention time of caffeine is approximately 5 8 min 3 4 enhanced ms sensitivity after methylation six phosphonates before negative ion mode and after tmschn2 methylation positive ion mode were analyzed by infusing the standard solutions 1 μmol l via a syringe pump into ms under the conditions listed in table s1 as seen in fig 5 the ms intensity of the methylated phosphonates increased by 2 3 orders of magnitude that of the virgin ones the signal to noise root mean square rms ratio of each analyte is listed in table s2 the methylation by tmschn2 neutralizes the negative charges of the phosphonates fig 1 and as reported elsewhere wasslen et al 2014a the neutralization would increase the sensitivity of esi ms analysis by driving the multiple negatively charged states of phosphonate to a single state of the methylated one during ionization in addition phosphonates do not exhibit any retention on an rpc separation column the above analysis suggested that tmschn2 derivatization could effectively improve the ms intensity and rpc separation efficiency of phosphonates and it is a requisite and promising step for phosphonate determination especially for those at trace levels in environmental samples 3 5 sample pretreatment ion exchange and solid phase extraction ion exchange as discussed above the presence of cations at high levels would impose adverse effect on phosphonate analysis and thus ion exchange seems necessary for samples of high salinity in this study we used several commercial cation exchange columns all in the h form to test their removal of metal cations from samples finally dionex onguard ii h cartridge was selected because of its excellent removal of metal ions with negligible loss of targets solid phase extraction the strata x aw cartridge was utilized to enrich and recover phosphonates in authentic water samples when necessary to optimize the spe conditions the phosphonate standard solutions 20 nmol l were used and the recovery of six phosphonates was chosen to evaluate the extraction efficiency the results in fig s3a suggested that the recovery of phosphonates is ph dependent with the optimal ph of the loading solutions at 5 6 we also examined the elution efficiency by the mixed meoh solution with different contents of ammonium hydroxide 3 15 v v and fig s3b indicated the optimal content was 8 v v or above where 80 of the recovery was achieved fig s3 c shows that 8 ml of eluent was sufficient for phosphonates recovery in summary prior to spe water samples were adjusted to ph 5 5 before loading after sample loading the spe column was first washed with 3 ml h2o and then eluted with 8 ml meoh solution with 8 v v ammonium hydroxide for recovery of the phosphonates 3 6 method performance we systematically evaluated the method performance for different water samples in the presence or absence of spe and the key parameters including sensitivity linearity precision accuracy and the matrix effect were particularly concerned the results are listed in table 3 and table s3 the loqs for the six phosphonates without spe enrichment ranged from 1 4 μg l to 57 μg l as obtained by analyzing the spiked tap water samples methylated after 20 time dilution with meoh this sensitivity is comparable to the diazomethane methylation method proposed by klinger et al 1997 where rotary evaporation was required for pre concentration generally it could meet the analysis requirement of water samples with relatively high concentrations of phosphonates and the spe free operation is desirably facile when the spe procedure was involved at a 50 fold pre concentration loqs achieved in tap water could be lowered to 5 0 ng l to 200 ng l apparently the spe involved analysis could greatly improve the sensitivity for phosphonate analysis of note is that throughout the above procedure no contamination of blanks tap water samples was observed for the six phosphonates quantification of the target phosphonates was carried out on the basis of is calibration curve method with the linearity assessment the optimal linear concentration ranges for each phosphonate varied with each other table s3 overall all the target compounds exhibited satisfactory linearity with the regression coefficients r2 higher than 0 99 for the standard calibration curves 0 2 20 μmol l and higher than 0 98 for the spe involved ones 0 2 20 nmol l the accuracy and precision of the method were evaluated by analyzing the tap water samples spiked with standard solutions at 1 with spe and 1000 nmol l without spe the accuracy was expressed in terms of the recoveries for all the analytes in triplicate analysis the average recoveries ranged from 71 to 105 at 1 nmol l and from 81 to 112 at 1000 nmol l except for dtpmp analysis where the standard addition method was used due to the matrix effect the method precision was determined by the repeatability and within laboratory reproducibility repeatability n 5 was calculated by the intraday precision measurements of spiked tap water samples whereas the within laboratory reproducibility experiments were carried out on five consecutive days satisfactory precisions were obtained with rsd values 10 at 1000 nmol l and 13 at 1 nmol l suggesting the satisfactory precision and stability of the method table s3 the matrix effect for spe involved analysis was also considered the slope ratios between the matrix matched calibration curves and the standard calibration curves for all the target analytes fell in the range of 82 124 suggesting an insignificant matrix effect after purification by strata x aw cartridge in addition to the pre concentration of the spe method it may greatly weaken the adverse effect of the coexisting ions since they cannot be captured by the spe column 3 7 application to environmental samples to further validate the applicability and reliability of the established method to environmental samples three wwtp water samples influent and effluent and one river water sample were analyzed along with the authentic samples the blanks and the spiked samples were also analyzed the results are listed in table 3 and table s4 as observed the spiked phosphonates except dtpmp at high concentration were recovered by 73 120 without spe and those at low concentration were recovered by 72 126 after spe enrichment standard addition method was used for direct analysis of dtpmp because dtpmp recoveries in all the environmental samples are systematically high by a factor of about 3 it may be attributed to the enhanced effect of anionic species in authentic water samples we can see that pbtc hedp and ntmp were commonly detected in wastewater and river water whereas hdtmp is below the detection limit to the best of our knowledge the quantification data for phosphonates in chinese environmental waters has not yet been available collectively we successfully proposed a sensitive method for analysis of trace phosphonates in authentic wate samples however we cannot implement a surrogate for the overall procedure due to the unavailability of the isotope labeled phosphonates and appropriate surrogates and internal standards should be explored in future also a rather complex pre treatment is still required for water samples of relatively low concentrations ng l levels of phosphonates which should also be further considered 4 conclusions in this study a method based on ion exchange and spe pretreatment tmschn2 methylation and uhplc orbitrap ms ms analysis has been established for simultaneous determination of six typical phosphonates the pretreatment unit of ion exchange aimed at screening the interference effect of multivalent cations on methylation and spe would achieve a pre concentration factor of 50 subsequently the introduction of tmschn2 methylation greatly enhanced the ms sensitivity and the rpc retention of phosphonates finally the high resolution q exactive obitrap ms ms enables reliable identification and quantification in complex water samples the loqs for the six phosphonates in the background of tap water ranged from 1 4 μg l to 57 μg l for spe free analysis in the presence of spe procedure loqs could be lowered to 5 0 ng l to 200 ng l the key properties of the method including linearity reproducibility and recovery were satisfactory the applicability of this method was further demonstrated by analysis of several environmental samples from three wwtps and one river in china

18679,phosphonate is an important phosphorous species in the effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp contributing to eutrophication and interfering with phosphate removal in wwtp it is particularly difficult to determine phosphonates in samples of complex solution chemistry resulting in very limited information on their presence in environmental matrices herein we proposed a

diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid trimethylsilyldiazomethane tmschn2 derivatization of the target phosphonates is pre requisite since it could greatly increase the sensitivity up to 2 3 orders of magnitude over direct analysis of the virgin ones the sample pretreatment methods including ion exchange and solid phase extraction spe the derivatization procedures and the lc ms ms

abstract image 1 keywords phosphonates methylation trimethylsilyldiazomethane lc ms ms wastewater river water 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limiting factor responsible for water eutrophication rott et al 2018a and thus advanced p removal from water is urgently desired traditional processes including adsorption and precipitation coagulation could efficiently remove inorganic p but usually work ineffectively for organic p species neft et al 2010 gu et al 2011 rott et al 2018a currently five classes of organic p species have been identified in the aquatic environment nucleic acids nucleotides inositol phosphates phospholipids and phosphonates baldwin 2013 phosphonates are highly water soluble and strongly polar compounds featuring one or more characteristic phosphonic acid groups c po oh 2 nowack 2003 rott et al 2018a they are widely used as chelating agents in the paper and textile industries for water conditioning and household cleaning products rott et al 2018a in 1998 the global phosphonate consumption was 56 000 t a davenport et al 2000 and in 2012 it increased to 94 000 t a 49000 t a in europe epa 2013 based on the consumption data phosphonates of most quantitative

to the presence of c p bond phosphonates are usually stable in environment raising increasing concerns for their potential accumulation in aquatic ecosystems and contribution to eutrophication due to transformation into bioavailable orthophosphates ternan et al 1998 davenport et al 2000 knepper and weil 2001 jaworska et al 2002 rott et al 2018a in addition other issues of phosphonates should not be ignored including possible remobilization of toxic metals from sediments gledhill and feijtel 1992 bordas and bourg 1998 nowack 2003 the formation of byproducts of critical concern during natural photo hydrolysis e g glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid grandcoin et al 2017 rott et al 2018a as well as the adverse effect on advanced removal of phosphate to meet more stringent regulations wenger oehn et al 2005 nowack and stone 2006 rott et al 2018a unfortunately very limited data is available on the presence of phosphonates in environmental samples nowack 1997 1998 2002 fürhacker et al 2005 schmidt et al 2014 nowack 1997 1998 determined several phosphonates in wastewater samples of swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps and dtpmp as high as 2 μmol l was detected in the influent of a wwtp surrounded by the textile industry with the average concentration of 0 12 μmol l in effluent in addition ntmp 0 75 μmol l and edtmp 0 15 μmol l were also detected in the wwtp influent schmidt et al 2014 found that the concentration of hedp ranged from 0 3 to 1 6 μg l and dtpmp from 0 1 to 1 3 μg l in six german rivers one of the key challenges for phosphonate analysis relies on the fact that phosphonates are present as anionic species tending to form metal complexes predominantly as ca and mg complexes in natural waters or wastewaters schmidt et al 2014 rott et al 2018a furthermore their low reactivity low volatility high hydrophilicity and lack of uv ir chromophores also hamper the sensitive analysis knepper 2003 rott et al 2017 2018b determined the concentration of a single phosphonate indirectly as the difference between the total p and orthophosphate p the currently available methods for direct analysis of phosphonate are summarized in table 1 most of which can only be applied in synthetic samples instead of environmental samples of complex solution chemistry or have high limits of determination lods taken into account the ionic character of phosphonates most of the available approaches are based on ion chromatographic ic separation followed by various detection tools including uv detection weiβ and hägele 1987 tschäbunin et al 1989a 1989b 1989c vaeth

conductivity detection ecd ma et al 2007 the first method for phosphonate quantification in wwtp samples was proposed by nowack 1997 where the target phosphonates were first transformed into the fe iii complexes for analysis by an ion pair high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with uv detection later to improve the sensitivity the coupling of ic with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ic icp ms was developed ammann 2002 kovačeviča et al 2004 fürhacker et al 2005 suzuki et al 2016 schmidt et al 2014 proposed a new pretreatment method of ic icp ms by transferring the complexed phosphonates into free phosphonic acids with the aid of strongly acidic cation exchanger followed by pre concentration with a weakly basic anion exchanger such improvement could result in lower lods and help discriminate hedp and dtpmp in river water samples unfortunately the specificity of the element detection together with retention times in ic icp ms method which was used for identification of the phosphonates has to be re examined in more complex matrices e g wastewater in this study we aimed at proposing a sensitive method to determine six phosphonates fig 1 of most quantitative importance in environmental samples based on the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms strategy to improve the sensitivity of this method we pre methylated the target phosphonates as inspired by the previous study klinger et al 1997 chen et al 2012 yang et al 2015 yamada et al 2018 this is because the methylated derivatives could greatly enhance the ms response and retention on reversed phase chromatography rpc over the virgin phosphonates or amines klinger et al 1997 chen et al 2012 wasslen et al 2014b yang et al 2015 yamada et al 2018 considering the widely used methylation agent diazomethane is toxic and explosive yang et al 2015 ranz et al 2008 we used trimethylsilyldiazomethane tmschn2 as an alternative for methylation of six phosphonates yamada et al 2018 the experimental conditions for methylation and lc ms ms were optimized and in response to the complicated composition of the environmental samples the pretreatment processes based on ion exchange and solid phase extraction spe were proposed the method performance was systematically evaluated and validated by determining six phosphonates in environmental samples from three wwtps and one river 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and solutions six phosphonates were obtained as free acids commercially pbtc 50 aqueous solution was provided by matrix scientific co usa solid hedp h2o 95 and

2 0 mol l in hexane was supplied by adamas reagent co ltd china caffeine cayman chemical co usa was selected as internal standard is hplc grade ammonium hydroxide 25 was obtained from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china hplc grade methanol meoh and acetonitrile acn were supplied by merck co germany all other chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and were reagent grade or of higher purity ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was employed throughout the study except for hplc ms grade water merck co germany used for preparation of the mobile phase each standard stock solution of six phosphonates 20 mmol l except for edtmp at 5 0 mmol l and hdtmp at 2 0 mmol l were prepared by dissolving the accurately preset solids or solutions in purified water the stock solutions were stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c and were stable for months the standard solutions ranging from 0 020 to 50 μmol l were prepared by diluting the stock solution with water or meoh the is standard solution 50 μmol l was prepared by dissolving caffeine in meoh and stored at 4 c 2 2 authentic water samples the target samples include three wwtp water samples influent and effluent and one river water sample in china wwtp1 located in jiangyin city was set up based on the combined process of acidification anaerobic oxic a o air floatation to pre treat industrial wastewater from a printing and dyeing plant where large amounts of various phosphonates are used afterward the effluent is pumped to a centralized wwtp for further treatment wwtp2 employs the combined hydrolysis acidification anaerobic anoxic oxic coagulation process to treat the mixture of printing and dyeing wastewater 40 and domestic wastewater 60 in jiangyin city with the total capacity of 10000 m3 per day wwtp3 uses the a o coagulation process to receive wastewater from a textile factory nanjing city and the effluent is directly discharged into the surrounding river river water sample was collected from jiuxiang river near the xianlin campus of nanjing university nanjing city all the above samples were collected and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before analysis tap water was collected in the laboratory and used directly without further purification 2 3 sample preparation and derivatization after filtration with 0 45 μm membrane approximately 10 ml of the water sample passed through a column packed with strongly acidic polystyrene cation exchanger in the h form dionex onguard ii h 1 cc thermo fisher scientific inc usa a slow flow rate was desired 1 ml min to dissociate the possible cation phosphonate complexes in the samples subsequently the acidified sample was neutralized to approximately ph 7 with naoh for methylation note that spe procedure is required for the authentic samples containing trace phosphonates prior to methylation during the spe procedure a weak anion exchange cartridge was applied to purify and enrich phosphonates from the test samples to improve the sensitivity of the proposed method schmidt et al 2014 strata x aw sorbent cartridges 6 ml 500 mg phenomenex usa were used on a 24 fold vacuum extraction box supelco bellefonte pa usa after the cartridges were pre conditioned with 6 ml of meoh and 6 ml of water consecutively 50 ml of pretreated samples ph 5 5 flew through the column to enrich the target phosphonates afterward the column was rinsed with 3 ml water and the trapped phosphonates were eluted with 8 ml of 8 17 v v mixture of ammonium hydroxide and meoh then the collected eluent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at 40 c followed by the addition of 20 μl is standard solution and meoh in sequence to reach the preset volume of 1 00 ml finally it was filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon syringe filter for derivatization the methylation of six phosphonates in meoh by using tmschn2 are illustrated in fig 1 first 50 μl of the pretreated water sample and 20 μl is standard solution were add to a 1 5 ml brown sample vial and then diluted with meoh to reach the final volume of 1 00 ml for those after spe the sample of 1 00 ml was directly transferred into the sample vial then the tmschn2 solution 2 0 mol l in hexane of 100 μl was added to the vial after vortexing for about 10 s and allowing 2 h methylation at the room temperature 25 c the samples were injected into the lc ms ms system for further analysis 2 4 liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry a dionex ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc system coupled with a high resolution q exactive focus orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific inc germany were used the uhplc system which is controlled by chromeleon 7 2 software consisted of an srd 3600 solvent rack an hpg 3400rs pump a tcc 3000rs column compartment at 25 c and a wps 3000rs autosampler at 25 c the injection volume of 10 μl was used for uhplc analysis the separation of methylation derivatives was performed on a reversed phase zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 100 mm 4 6 mm 3 5 μm agilent usa using a flow rate of 0 500 ml min the mobile phases of 0 1 formic acid fa in water a and 0 1 fa in acetonitrile b were delivered under a gradient program starting with 10 b followed by a gradient of 10 40 b in 10 min 40 10 b in 0 1 min and maintained at 10 b for 3 9 min a column switching step is included in the chromatographic time program where the first 5 min eluent is discharged into the waste collector then the eluent from the uhplc column was directed into the q exactive focus ms ms which was set for parallel reaction monitoring prm in positive ionization mode the ms acquired a targeted ms ms scan at a resolution of 35 000 fwhm at m z 200 the heated electrospray ionization hesi source conditions were described as follows spray voltage at 3 5 kv capillary temperature at 350 c probe heater temperature at 450 c sheath gas at 25 arbitrary units auxiliary gas at 5 arbitrary units and sweep gas at 1 arbitrary units s lens rf level at 50 automatic gain control agc target of 105 with 200 ms maximum injection time was used tune and xcalibur software thermo scientific bremen germany was used to control the ms and process the data 2 5 method validation and quantification sensitivity of the above method was assessed by analyzing lods and limits of quantitation loqs from spiked phosphonate free water samples and standard solutions the lod and loq were determined from the amount of analytes that provides signal to noise ratio of s n 3 and s n 10 respectively since various target analytes were detectable in authentic samples the lods and loqs were available in the background of tap water phosphonate free an internal standard method was applied in the quantitative analysis to automatically correct the ms response and to compensate for injection variations as well the is solution 20 μl of 50 μmol l caffeine solution was spiked prior to lc ms ms analysis for all the samples preliminary experimental results suggests that caffeine if present in environmental water samples would be completely removed during ion exchange linearity was evaluated by the standard calibration assays in triplicate a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the analyte to is peak area ratios as a function of their concentration ratios the response factors obtained from the calibration curve were then applied to calculate the analyte concentrations and the blank sample with is solution only was involved in each sequence accuracy was expressed by the recoveries of the spiking phosphonates in tap water at two levels 1 nmol l and 1000 nmol l the precision of the method used for the lc ms ms determination was calculated by relative standard deviation rsd for five parallel samples of intra and inter day experiment to estimate the matrix effects after spe the matrix matched calibration curves 8 points were set up by spiking target compounds into 1 00 ml tap water extracts matrix effect me was calculated by the equation me slopem slopes 100 where slopem represents that of the matrix matched calibration curves and slopes is for the calibration plot with the solvent calibration solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 methylation of phosphonates six phosphonates used in this study possess ionic and highly polar nature and thus it is challenging to separate them from each other by hplc method schmidt et al 2014 also direct esi ms analysis of phosphonates seemed possible kuhn et al 2017 however its poor sensitivity at mg l levels cannot meet the requirement for analysis of trace phosphonates ng μg l in environmental samples comparatively methylation is an effective pretreatment step to analyze trace phosphonates in water klinger et al 1997 we optimized the methylation conditions using a univariate experimental design the dosage of tmschn2 and meoh the reaction ph temperature and duration the experimental conditions are mentioned as follows 100 μl of tmschn2 95 v v meoh 1 ml reaction ph 3 temperature 25 c and time of 2 h all the optimizations were performed in the mixed solution containing each phosphonates at 1 μmol l and the results are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a shows that the intensity of methylated phosphonates increased as the volume of tmschn2 increased and reached constant at the dosage of 100 μl fig 2b describes the effect of meoh concentration on the derivatization and one can see that 95 v v of meoh or higher could result in a constant methylation efficiency for each phosphonate thus we chose 95 v v of meoh 1 ml for all the derivatization processes the methylation temperature of phosphonic acid with diazomethane or tmschn2 varied case by case chen et al 2012 yang et al 2015 wong et al 2015 yamada et al 2018 in this study effect of reaction temperature on the yield of derivatization was tested fig 2c no significant difference of the methylation efficiency was observed in the range of 25 70 c and thus the reaction was carried out at room temperature 25 c similarly insignificant effect of ph 2 11 was distinguished on the derivatization yield fig 2d and 2 h reaction is sufficient to ensure an acceptable and constant methylation of the target phosphonates fig 2e 3 2 effect of interfering ions on methylation metal cations are ubiquitous in authentic water samples and some of multivalent cations tend to complex phosphonates thus it is necessary to elucidate the influence of metal ions on the methylation reaction for this purpose the mixed solution of six phosphonates each at 1 μmol l were first spiked with every test cation ca2 mg2 cu2 fe3 al3 the ph of the solutions was adjusted to 7 then they were then stored overnight in darkness before derivatization and detection to ensure a complete complexation note that the ion exchange pretreatment was not involved prior to derivatization as shown in fig 3 the presence of mg2 and ca2 both 50 μmol l would impose an adverse effect on the final detection of the target phosphonates besides the presence of cu2 fe3 and al3 at the set concentrations both 10 μmol l to avoid the possible precipitation or coagulation did not exert any significant effect on the analysis results considering the concentration of the added metal ions is much higher than the stoichiometric level for complexation we assume that the presence of multivalent ions may affect other analytical steps instead of methylation however it should be considered how to minimize or even exclude their adverse effect and details are described in the following section 3 5 in addition the effect of anionic species was considered by using chloride and sulfate as the models nacl and na2so4 as seen in fig s2 the analysis of phosphonates was not significantly affected in the presence of nacl 50 mmol l or na2so4 20 mmol l except for dtpmp note that higher ionic strength 2 g l will result in an inaccurate analysis of all the phosphonates fortunately for most authentic samples the concentration of the concerned anions is far below such level 3 3 uhplc ms ms analysis to select the precursor and product ions of methylated phosphonates direct infusion of individual methylated standards was performed at 1 μmol l full ms dd ms2 was carried out in the range m z 100 1000 to record all the esi mass spectra those of intensity threshold higher than 20000 were further fragmented to obtain ms2 ions under normalized collision energy nce of 20 ev the identified methylates mediated by tmschn2 were the same as those from diazomethane klinger et al 1997 and the totally methylated phosphonates were yielded except for hedp which produces tetramethyl derivative because it is difficult to methylate the hydroxyl group binding the central carbon of the p c p structure ranz et al 2008 all the precursor ions for quantification were the protonated molecular ones m h the full ms dd ms2 mode could provide more information of the fragmentation ions which is of great help to identify and confirm the targeted methylates ms2 spectra of the target precursor ions of methylated phosphonates are shown in fig s1 to obtain high selectivity and sensitivity of uhplc q exactive orbitrap ms ms analyses the parallel reaction monitoring prm mode was chosen for data acquisition because another mode i e selected ion monitoring sim mode could be adversely affected by the interference from by products for each analyte two identification ions were used one precursor ion and one product ion the molecular formula theoretical and experimental masses the product ion with the highest intensity and the corresponding nce optimized for six methylated phosphonates are shown in table 2 other instrument parameters including resolution agc and hesi parameters were also optimized and described in the experimental section methylation of phosphonic acid enhanced their chromatographic retention on the reversed phase column and the optimization of the chromatographic conditions was focused on how to separate their methylates from each other several chromatographic parameters were considered including c18 columns packed with different stationary phases and particle sizes various mobile phases and elution modes an eclipse plus c18 column combined with an acidic mobile phase and an elution gradient could successfully separate six methylated phosphonates as for the mobile phase two aqueous solvents were examined 0 1 fa and 10 mmol l ammonium acetate and the use of 0 1 fa could produce better peak shapes and higher intensity in addition acn was chosen as the organic composition of the mobile phase rather than meoh because the low viscosity of acn allows higher flow rate also acn is aprotic and therefore is less likely to create hydrogen bonds with the stationary phase or the analytes yamada et al 2018 a flow rate of 0 500 ml min was optimized to maximize the esi ms sensitivity lc ms ms chromatograms of six methylated phosphonates are depicted in fig 4 note that the eluent in the initial 5 min was deliberately entered into the waste collector with the aid of valve switching since it could remove most of the initially eluting salt ions to avoid their potential blockage of the esi system the relative response of the prm procedure together with the retention time was used as a criterion for target identification caffeine a methylated compound serves as a standard chemical m z 195 0876 in calibration solution of the q exactive system in positive ionization mode here it was chosen as an internal standard klinger et al 1997 under the above optimized chromatographic conditions the retention time of caffeine is approximately 5 8 min 3 4 enhanced ms sensitivity after methylation six phosphonates before negative ion mode and after tmschn2 methylation positive ion mode were analyzed by infusing the standard solutions 1 μmol l via a syringe pump into ms under the conditions listed in table s1 as seen in fig 5 the ms intensity of the methylated phosphonates increased by 2 3 orders of magnitude that of the virgin ones the signal to noise root mean square rms ratio of each analyte is listed in table s2 the methylation by tmschn2 neutralizes the negative charges of the phosphonates fig 1 and as reported elsewhere wasslen et al 2014a the neutralization would increase the sensitivity of esi ms analysis by driving the multiple negatively charged states of phosphonate to a single state of the methylated one during ionization in addition phosphonates do not exhibit any retention on an rpc separation column the above analysis suggested that tmschn2 derivatization could effectively improve the ms intensity and rpc separation efficiency of phosphonates and it is a requisite and promising step for phosphonate determination especially for those at trace levels in environmental samples 3 5 sample pretreatment ion exchange and solid phase extraction ion exchange as discussed above the presence of cations at high levels would impose adverse effect on phosphonate analysis and thus ion exchange seems necessary for samples of high salinity in this study we used several commercial cation exchange columns all in the h form to test their removal of metal cations from samples finally dionex onguard ii h cartridge was selected because of its excellent removal of metal ions with negligible loss of targets solid phase extraction the strata x aw cartridge was utilized to enrich and recover phosphonates in authentic water samples when necessary to optimize the spe conditions the phosphonate standard solutions 20 nmol l were used and the recovery of six phosphonates was chosen to evaluate the extraction efficiency the results in fig s3a suggested that the recovery of phosphonates is ph dependent with the optimal ph of the loading solutions at 5 6 we also examined the elution efficiency by the mixed meoh solution with different contents of ammonium hydroxide 3 15 v v and fig s3b indicated the optimal content was 8 v v or above where 80 of the recovery was achieved fig s3 c shows that 8 ml of eluent was sufficient for phosphonates recovery in summary prior to spe water samples were adjusted to ph 5 5 before loading after sample loading the spe column was first washed with 3 ml h2o and then eluted with 8 ml meoh solution with 8 v v ammonium hydroxide for recovery of the phosphonates 3 6 method performance we systematically evaluated the method performance for different water samples in the presence or absence of spe and the key parameters including sensitivity linearity precision accuracy and the matrix effect were particularly concerned the results are listed in table 3 and table s3 the loqs for the six phosphonates without spe enrichment ranged from 1 4 μg l to 57 μg l as obtained by analyzing the spiked tap water samples methylated after 20 time dilution with meoh this sensitivity is comparable to the diazomethane methylation method proposed by klinger et al 1997 where rotary evaporation was required for pre concentration generally it could meet the analysis requirement of water samples with relatively high concentrations of phosphonates and the spe free operation is desirably facile when the spe procedure was involved at a 50 fold pre concentration loqs achieved in tap water could be lowered to 5 0 ng l to 200 ng l apparently the spe involved analysis could greatly improve the sensitivity for phosphonate analysis of note is that throughout the above procedure no contamination of blanks tap water samples was observed for the six phosphonates quantification of the target phosphonates was carried out on the basis of is calibration curve method with the linearity assessment the optimal linear concentration ranges for each phosphonate varied with each other table s3 overall all the target compounds exhibited satisfactory linearity with the regression coefficients r2 higher than 0 99 for the standard calibration curves 0 2 20 μmol l and higher than 0 98 for the spe involved ones 0 2 20 nmol l the accuracy and precision of the method were evaluated by analyzing the tap water samples spiked with standard solutions at 1 with spe and 1000 nmol l without spe the accuracy was expressed in terms of the recoveries for all the analytes in triplicate analysis the average recoveries ranged from 71 to 105 at 1 nmol l and from 81 to 112 at 1000 nmol l except for dtpmp analysis where the standard addition method was used due to the matrix effect the method precision was determined by the repeatability and within laboratory reproducibility repeatability n 5 was calculated by the intraday precision measurements of spiked tap water samples whereas the within laboratory reproducibility experiments were carried out on five consecutive days satisfactory precisions were obtained with rsd values 10 at 1000 nmol l and 13 at 1 nmol l suggesting the satisfactory precision and stability of the method table s3 the matrix effect for spe involved analysis was also considered the slope ratios between the matrix matched calibration curves and the standard calibration curves for all the target analytes fell in the range of 82 124 suggesting an insignificant matrix effect after purification by strata x aw cartridge in addition to the pre concentration of the spe method it may greatly weaken the adverse effect of the coexisting ions since they cannot be captured by the spe column 3 7 application to environmental samples to further validate the applicability and reliability of the established method to environmental samples three wwtp water samples influent and effluent and one river water sample were analyzed along with the authentic samples the blanks and the spiked samples were also analyzed the results are listed in table 3 and table s4 as observed the spiked phosphonates except dtpmp at high concentration were recovered by 73 120 without spe and those at low concentration were recovered by 72 126 after spe enrichment standard addition method was used for direct analysis of dtpmp because dtpmp recoveries in all the environmental samples are systematically high by a factor of about 3 it may be attributed to the enhanced effect of anionic species in authentic water samples we can see that pbtc hedp and ntmp were commonly detected in wastewater and river water whereas hdtmp is below the detection limit to the best of our knowledge the quantification data for phosphonates in chinese environmental waters has not yet been available collectively we successfully proposed a sensitive method for analysis of trace phosphonates in authentic wate samples however we cannot implement a surrogate for the overall procedure due to the unavailability of the isotope labeled phosphonates and appropriate surrogates and internal standards should be explored in future also a rather complex pre treatment is still required for water samples of relatively low concentrations ng l levels of phosphonates which should also be further considered 4 conclusions in this study a method based on ion exchange and spe pretreatment tmschn2 methylation and uhplc orbitrap ms ms analysis has been established for simultaneous determination of six typical phosphonates the pretreatment unit of ion exchange aimed at screening the interference effect of multivalent cations on methylation and spe would achieve a pre concentration factor of 50 subsequently the introduction of tmschn2 methylation greatly enhanced the ms sensitivity and the rpc retention of phosphonates finally the high resolution q exactive obitrap ms ms enables reliable identification and quantification in complex water samples the loqs for the six phosphonates in the background of tap water ranged from 1 4 μg l to 57 μg l for spe free analysis in the presence of spe procedure loqs could be lowered to 5 0 ng l to 200 ng l the key properties of the method including linearity reproducibility and recovery were satisfactory the applicability of this method was further demonstrated by analysis of several environmental samples from three wwtps and one river in china
