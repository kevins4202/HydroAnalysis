18665,water scarcity has become a global issue that has forced many communities to seek alternative water resources the majority of water on the earth s surface comes from the sea seawater has the potential to mitigate water stress after proper treatment in hong kong seawater has been used directly for toilet flushing for more than 50 years and the seawater toilet flushing swtf system serves 80 of the residents however its environmental feasibility remains unknown this study is a pioneer evaluating the environmental performances of the swtf system by comparing swtf with other alternative water resources including desalinated seawater desalinated wastewater effluent centralized wastewater reclamation and on site greywater reclamation systems while the conventional long distance imported water scenario is set as the baseline for comparison this evaluation is first conducted in the southern district and north new territory in hong kong demonstrating swtf is significantly more environmentally friendly than other alternative water resources which is the only alternative water resource application approach with environmental impacts comparable with the conventional long distance imported water scenario on the contrary other alternative water resources application approaches would result in additional environmental impacts seaside distances and effective population density are two major geographical impact factors effecting the environmental impacts of different water systems in these two districts the benefits obtained from swtf in fourteen cities in south china are further investigated it is confirmed that swtf can significantly relieve water stress with the lowest environmental impacts comparing with other alternative options in these cities if alternative water resources must be applied for domestic usage however the assessment from different aspects should be further conducted to compare these alternative water resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater toilet flushing alternative water resources sustainability lca water scarcity 1 introduction during the past decades water scarcity has led to worldwide challenges in urban water supply these challenges are particularly severe in coastal communities where population and economic growth is high such as south china including hong kong in order to tackle water stress problems hong kong has been applying seawater toilet flushing swtf since 1957 wsd 2012 the water consumption for toilet flushing accounts for 29 47 of water use in residential buildings and up to 65 of that in typical commercial buildings lazarova et al 2003 thus the use of alternative water resources for toilet flushing would significantly reduce the need for potable water the seawater supply system in hong kong uses additional treatment and pipelines system that separated from the freshwater distribution consisting of pumping screening disinfection and distribution the pipelines length of swtf is 5 5 times less than freshwater distribution due to the elimination of looped format wsd 2012 the used toilet flushing seawater is discharged into sewage and the mixed wastewater goes into wastewater treatment plant from the experience obtained in hong kong 20 of seawater in wastewater insignificantly affects biological oxygen demand or chemical oxygen demand bod cod removal in biological wastewater treatment plants dsd 2019 although ammonia and nitrogen removal efficiencies for saline wastewater treatment are reduced comparing with freshwater wastewater treatment the effluent quality can still meet the discharge standard dsd 2019 to protect the freshwater ecosystem the treated saline wastewater is discharged back to the ocean swtf tells its own tale that it can save more than 20 of municipal water consumption to relieve water stress reducing chemicals and energy consumption for potable water treatment moreover according to one of our previous study the application of swtf can also facilitate the nutrient recovery from urine with negligible environmental impacts from additional equipment mbaya et al 2016 however the additional resources and energy consumption for individual treatment and pipeline systems will generate more environmental impacts besides the sulphate existed in the seawater will generate hydrogen sulphide h2s under anaerobic condition increasing human toxicity impact considering the coexistence of merits and demerits of swtf the entire environmental sustainability of swtf is unknown comparing with other water resources for toilet flushing as swtf has been successfully serving 80 of the population in hong kong in relieving water stress the practice has the potential to be introduced to the rest of the population in hong kong coastal cities in south china and even worldwide coastal major cities therefore using a systematic method to evaluate their environmental performance and figure out the suitable water resource for water stress cities are deemed necessary before real application life cycle assessment lca is a standardized decision support tool suitable for quantitative evaluation of environmental performance of products or processes lca has proven its strength across a broad range of environmental issues and has been widely performed to inform decisions on water supply the optimization of single sub system technology such as potable water production wastewater reuse and wastewater treatment has been conducted with lca corominas et al 2013 the technique has also been used to assess environmental evaluation in current holistic urban water systems from pumping to wastewater treatment barjoveanu et al 2014 and to compare urban water supply systems to determine the optimal one mo et al 2014 these studies have demonstrated the critical processes needed and the potential pathways to improving water management strategies from environmental perspectives however none of them has assessed the environmental impacts of using seawater directly for toilet flushing one recent study compared the potential application of freshwater seawater and two types of greywater reuse for toilet flushing with eco efficiency analysis and economic analysis which was conducted within building level with only 539 m3 day of total water consumption with 39 of water for toilet flushing lam et al 2017 however the total amount of water consumption for toilet flushing at a city level would be much lower than 39 moreover separated distribution system with considerable energy consumption should be installed for the non potable water which should be also considered in the city scale study therefore the tradeoff among different alternative water resources for toilet flushing should be evaluated at city level to obtain a whole picture in this study an lca is conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of swtf by comparing with other water resources including seawater desalination wastewater desalination centralized wastewater reclamation and on site reclamation with the traditional long distance water transfer applied in hong kong as well as many other major cities serving as the baseline the influential factors on the optimized water resources selection are analysed the objective is to assess the environmental sustainability of swtf and its extensive implementation in water scarcity areas in south china to relieve the stress and reduce environmental impacts as well 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the majority of the water demand in hong kong is met by importing water from dongjiang river with an 85 km tunnel which is both costly and energy intensive to reduce the dependence on freshwater import seawater is used for toilet flushing serving around 80 of hong kong residents the remaining 20 of residents live in four major areas southern district sd of hong kong island sai kung sk north new territories nnt and northwest new territories nwnt table s1 in supplementary information si sd and nnt are selected as the typical cases in this study because their effective population densities 24000 and 12000 persons km2 csd 2012 and seaside distances 0 and 10 km tang et al 2007 are representative among the aforementioned four areas the study areas are also extended to fourteen water stressed coastal cities in south china niwrp 2015 as shown in table s1 2 2 life cycle assessment lca involves four steps as prescribed by iso 14040 iso 2006 1 goal and scope definition 2 life cycle inventory lci analysis 3 life cycle impact assessment 4 interpretation of the results the first three steps are described in following while the results obtained in the fourth step are discussed in the next section 2 2 1 goal and scope definition the goal of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts of swtf and analyzing its extensive application by comparison with other alternative water resources for toilet flushing the conventional one pipe system is taken as basis the functional unit in each water scenario is defined as 1 m3 of water production the water lost due to pipeline leakage and consumption before it reaches wastewater treatment facilities is 15 wsd 2012 fig 1 illustrates each water scenario and the system boundary only the operation phase is evaluated for the existing water components while additional construction phases are also considered for the newly built facilities the demolition phase is excluded from this study as its contribution to the entire life cycle is negligible mo et al 2014 muñoz and fernández alba 2008 2 2 2 life cycle inventory the process and technologies used for water facilities are described in si the technologies selected for this study are based on real hong kong cases or experiences in other cities the foreground data for water treatment plants distribution systems and wastewater treatment plants are directly collected from the existing water facilities in hong kong foreground data for desalination plants centralized and on site wastewater reclamation systems are estimated from the literature bonton et al 2012 cashman et al 2018 elimelech and phillip 2011 foley et al 2010 raluy et al 2005 stokes and horvath 2009 the detailed information is listed in table s4 to table s14 in si only municipal pipelines are considered in this study while the pipes and pumps in buildings are not included in this study the following equation is used to estimate the layout of pipelines under variable population densities maurer et al 2010 1 l a l b p d a 0 8231 p d b 0 8231 l a and l b are the pipe lengths per capita m cap for districts a and b pd a and pd b are the effective population densities persons km2 of districts a and b extrapolation is performed assuming a linear relationship between the consumption of construction materials and the pipe length the pipelines diameter has been proven to be insignificant compared with the affection of pipelines length maurer et al 2010 thus the affection of water flow to pipeline diameter is not considered the introduction of seawater in wastewater increases sulphate concentration which may lead to an increase of h2s in the down stream process to evaluate the worst impact from h2s releasing it is assumed that 100 of sulphate in wastewater can be transformed to h2s the sulphate concentration in wastewater has been reported as high as 504 mg l wang et al 2011 thus the assumed maximum h2s generation in biological wastewater treatment process is 169 mg l the inventory for mixed wastewater treatment process is listed in si the lifetime of freshwater components is assumed to be 50 years the components associated with seawater or membrane technologies are expected to have a lifetime of 20 years as suggested in the literature fritzmann et al 2007 tang et al 2007 wsd 2012 the lifetimes for iron pipelines and plastic pipelines for seawater toilet flushing are considered to be 20 and 60 years respectively ng 2014 the total weight of pipe materials used for unit length with the same diameter is calculated according the reported ratio iron polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc 5420 930 1340 kim et al 2012 their ecoinvent process is illustrated in table s8 in si fuel composition for producing electricity is considered to be 53 hard coal 23 nuclear 22 natural gas and another 2 oil following the current fuel mix ratio in hong kong eb 2014 the fuel mixes in china grid are 70 hard coal combustion 20 oil 6 4 hydro 3 gas and 0 6 nuclear for cities in south china csy 2008 the foreground data i e construction materials chemicals electricity etc are combined with the background database from ecoinvent v3 0 sclci 2016 to estimate environmental impacts the detailed information is shown in si 2 2 3 life cycle impact assessment the faculty version of simapro 8 1 is employed to aggregate the inventory according to iso standard iso 2006 the recipe method is used to calculate the proposed harmonized environmental impacts during the life cycle of the systems six indicators are assessed in this study including climate change cc human toxicity ht photochemical oxidant formation pof ozone depletion od terrestrial acidification ta and particle matter formation pmf cc ht and od are used to predict the swtf benefits obtained in fourteen chosen cities in south china 2 3 uncertainty assessment the uncertainty analysis is carried out based on 10000 iterations of monte carlo simulation each data point in the lci is redefined as a uniformly distributed random variable whose mean is set as its original deterministic value the uncertainties of 20 and 40 are assigned to data obtained from real systems and from the literature 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is conducted based on information in nnt by 10 increase of water demand toilet flushing amount serving population effective population density and energy recovery in wastewater treatment plant and seaside distance on the cc from urban water systems sfa sba dsa and dca moreover 10 of hard coal in the fuel mix for electricity generation is also replaced with natural gas or nuclear power to predict the environmental effects from the application of new energy sources 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of seawater and other alternative water resources for toilet flushing 3 1 1 case study for sd the results of impact assessments and contributions from water components in the six scenarios for sd are presented in fig 2 among the six water supply scenarios sra and doa absolutely generate more environmental impacts than sfa sba dsa and dca sra with seawater desalination shows the highest impacts which are more obvious in the categories of ht od and pmf due to the significant environmental impacts of the desalination reverse osmosis process this result is consistent with the finding that seawater desalination causes more noticeable deterioration in environmental impacts than imported water wastewater desalination and centralized wastewater reclamation fritzmann et al 2007 morillo et al 2014 therefore seawater desalination is not recommended for application in the near future scenario doa with on site wastewater reclamation generates the second highest environment impacts among the six water strategies fig 2a on site membrane bioreactors mbrs are preferred due to the stable operating performance and rigorous effluent quality for recycling purpose verrecht et al 2010 in this scenario 20 of the water demand is supplied by the on site reclamation system which makes it possible to reduce the capacity of downstream facilities by 20 and shut down one fifth of treatment facilitates consequently the environmental impacts from operation phase of sewers and the wastewater treatment plant are approximately equivalent to 80 of those in other scenarios however the energy consumption of the on site mbrs is 4 03 kwh m3 verrecht et al 2010 which creates overwhelming environmental impacts comparing with 0 41 kwh m3 of energy consumption for conventional biological wastewater treatment process among sfa sba and dsa sba is less environmentally friendly than others sba differs from sra in that the seawater desalination is replaced with wastewater effluent desalination the state of the art wastewater desalination consumes around 1 2 2 0 kwh m3 electricity avlonitis et al 2012 which is significantly less than the 3 0 4 0 kwh m3 required in seawater desalination plants elimelech and phillip 2011 the famous examples are newater tortajada et al 2013 in singapore and groundwater replenishment system gwrs chalmers et al 2003 projects in california thus wastewater effluent desalination represents a promising approach to providing more potable water however it still produces more environmental impacts than sfa dsa and dca due to high electricity consumed during desalination process in the dsa scenario additional pipelines are required for seawater distribution however the environmental impacts of pipeline systems in dsa are not that much higher than those in sfa this is in contrast to common expectation that the installation of dual pipe systems would dramatically increase the environmental impacts according to hong kong s experience with swtf the freshwater can be supplied for toilet flushing as backup which allows the reduction of the seawater distribution pipeline system reliability with the branched layout instead of the looped one connective pipes between seawater and freshwater are installed inside buildings to guarantee the reliability of toilet flushing this branched layout dramatically shortens the overall length of seawater distribution pipelines so the environmental impacts of pipelines system in dsa with swtf is not significantly different from other scenarios as shown in fig 2a dca scenario is also dual pipeline systems but it is less environmentally friendly than using swtf due to the environmental impacts from wastewater reclamation process as reported the energy consumed by nanofiltration for treated wastewater polishing for non potable use is around 0 8 1 5 kwh m3 bellona and drewes 2007 mirza 2008 which is higher than that consumed by seawater treatment for swtf in dsa even though h2s emission is overestimated the increased ht is only 0 32 kg 1 4 db eq m3 which can be neglected considering the overall ht result of 13 kg 1 4 db eq m3 in dsa scenario thus dsa with swtf creates the lowest environmental impacts among all the alternative water resources scenarios 3 1 2 case study for nnt the results of impact assessments and contributions from water components in the six water scenarios for nnt are presented in fig 3 the trends are similar to those for sd i e sra and doa produce the largest environmental impacts while sfa dsa and dca yield relatively lower levels of environmentally harmful matters the overall environmental impacts in nnt are about 22 higher than those in sd more specifically the differences are largely due to pipeline systems which yield 10 25 of the impacts in sd and 15 40 of the impacts in nnt in scenario sfa showing as the second contributor among the water components in entire water system these results are slightly less than 28 40 in previous studies amores et al 2013 buckley et al 2011 because the pipeline systems are site specific and highly dependent on the level of regional development maurer et al 2010 as shown in eq 1 the pipeline utilization efficiency increases and the length of pipelines per capita decreases with the growth of effective density the effective population density is 24 000 persons km2 in sd higher than 12 000 persons km2 in nnt thus pipelines in nnt contribute more than in sd moreover nnt is 10 km away from the seaside so seawater should be transferred from the seaside to the living area and treated wastewater effluent should be discharged into the sea to avoid harming the local surface freshwater matrix and ecology and this requires additional pipeline systems therefore the hong kong water supplies department hkwsd proposes to develop centralized reclamation instead of swtf in nnt to avoid the needs for extra pipelines wsd 2012 however as illustrated by the environmental assessment in this study the environmental impacts of dca with centralized reclamation are on average 10 higher than those of dsa with swtf this is because transferring seawater over a distance of 10 km and discharging treated effluent into the sea account for less than 3 of the overall impacts dsa in fig 3b which is lower than the impacts of centralized reclamation treatment in dca given that on average an individual in hong kong uses 94 l of water per day to flush toilets swtf will create around 1030 fewer tons of co2 per year on average than toilet flushing with reclaimed water in nnt 3 2 system optimization sra and doa are excluded from system optimization as they generate extremely large environmental impacts 3 2 1 relative environmental impacts of future energy options electricity consumption contributes over 80 of environmental impacts in the urban water system as shown in figs 2 and 3 so the fuel mixes in electricity will significantly influence their environmental performance the hong kong government proposes two potential energy plans to be implemented by 2023 option 1 and option 2 the fuel composition of option 1 is 30 imported from grid in mainland china 20 nuclear 40 natural gas and 10 hard coal that of option 2 is 60 natural gas 20 nuclear and 20 hard coal using the current fuel mix as the baseline the changes in environmental impacts from switching to the alternative fuel mixes are summarized in fig 4 the figure shows that in all impact categories except od both options 1 and 2 are more environmentally friendly than the current fuel mix strategy the highest reduction is in ht with a 30 55 decrease for the new fuel mixes for pof pmf and ta a 15 30 reduction can be achieved with options 1 and 2 the reduction in cc with the two options is around 15 the impact reduction is mainly due to the smaller contribution of fossil fuel to the fuel mix in both options 1 and 2 however options 1 and 2 generate larger od impacts than the current energy strategy it can also be seen from the figure that the share of natural gas increases from 22 in the current fuel matrix to 40 in option 1 and 60 in option 2 this indicates that an increased consumption of natural gas will produce larger od impacts than an increased consumption of hard coal or nuclear power comparing the two future energy plans option 2 is more environmentally friendly than option 1 except in the od aspect this is due to 30 of electricity is from china grid in option 1 meanwhile the overwhelming contributor in china grid is from hard coal csy 2008 3 2 2 modification of swtf pipelines cast iron pipes are currently used for swtf which are prone to corrosion and reducing the lifetime of pipelines even though the inside of the pipes is painted with anti corrosion oil the frequency of pipe burst in the swtf system is three times higher than that in freshwater systems wsd 2012 in view of this problem plastic pipes are suggested to replace iron pipes for seawater supply i e pvc and pe due to their light weight strong corrosion resistance easy connection at construction sites kim et al 2012 and longer lifetime ng 2014 their environmental impacts are compared and shown in fig 5 the figure indicates that both pe and pvc generate smaller environmental impacts than iron defining the impacts generated by iron as 100 the impacts from pe and pvc are less than 50 across all indicators the most significant reduction is in ht pvc generates only around 20 while pe creates as low as 5 of the impact compared with iron the reduction in pmf is the second greatest with pvc and pe producing only 20 and 10 of the impact respectively even though cc pof od and ta are more severe than ht and pmf a 50 80 reduction in emission can be realized with the replacement of iron pipelines with pe or pvc ones this result demonstrates more preponderant of plastic materials than iron this is because plastic requires 30 70 less energy to produce than metal arena et al 2003 in addition plastic is anticorrosive and can last as long as 60 years serving the swtf system ng 2014 whereas metal can only last 20 years thus pvc and pe generate much less environmental burden than cast iron fig 5 also illustrates that pe has better environmental performance than pvc the greatest environmental benefit of pe comes from its 80 lower ht than pvc pe and pvc emit similar amounts of pof while the levels of cc od ta and pmf associated with pe are 40 50 lower than those associated with pvc therefore pe is recommended as the pipeline material for the swtf system 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the impacts of 10 increase of major geographical information and technique factors in nnt as shown in fig 6 the influences from water demand and toilet flushing amount can be considered as zero which is due to the insignificant contribution from construction process in this study the influence from seaside distance to dsa scenario with swtf is observable but just increases 1 of climate change of the urban water system the sensitivity ratio from energy recovery in wastewater treatment plant is around 0 02 which is normally for onsite electricity deduction the obvious impact from effective population density is observed which mainly affects the climate change from the contribution of pipelines maurer et al 2010 therefore the influence on dual pipe system is slightly higher than single pipelines system the application of new energy resources such as natural gas and nuclear can significantly reduce the environmental impact of entire urban water system which is consistent with the evaluation on the impacts of different fuel mix fig 4 considering that the fuel mix in electricity influences the environmental impacts of all the facilities without specificity to urban water system the effective population density and seaside distance are taken as two major factors for extensive application study 3 4 extensive application 3 4 1 areas in hong kong with freshwater toilet flushing to evaluate the extensive application of potential water resources in hong kong the effects of effective population density and seaside distance are further analysed based on the optimized results in section 3 2 where option 2 and pe pipes are preferred to be chosen for the upgrade in addition ht would be largely reduced but od would deteriorate under the optimized conditions hence ht od and cc as the most typical environmental impact are selected for further analysis and the results are shown in fig 7 the pof ta and pmf results are demonstrated in fig s1 in si obviously the overall environmental impacts are smaller for a higher effective population density because of greater pipeline utilization maurer et al 2010 scenario sba generates a significantly larger environmental burden than scenarios dca sfa and dsa regardless of the effective population density this is especially the case for od the dca scenario generates the second largest environmental burden the results of dsa and sfa are crossed at some points in areas with a low density sfa would be more environmentally friendly than dsa in densely populated areas however dsa would outperform sfa the distance from the seaside has much less effect on the environmental impacts than the effective density the furthest seaside distance evaluated in this study is set at 15 km according to hong kong condition as demonstrated in fig 7 the environmental impacts of dsa increase slowly with seaside distance however dca and sba consistently generate a higher environmental burden than dsa even in the low density areas where the seaside distance is 15 km considering the other two areas sk and nwnt with effective density of 6000 14000 persons km2 and seaside distance of 0 10 km respectively in table s1 swtf is also more favourable for them than other alternatives as indicated in fig 7 two other published works have also studied the application of swtf in comparison with alternative water supply systems but from an economic viewpoint one study compared swtf with centralized reclamation and raw water purchased for toilet flushing in nnt tang et al 2007 it found that centralized reclamation is the most economic option among the three the other study compared swtf centralized reclamation seawater desalination and wastewater desalination for coastal areas ng 2014 it reported that swtf is the cheapest option in coastal areas with an effective population density exceeding 16000 18000 persons km2 these two conclusions differ from those in this study for instance nnt is located 10 km away from the shoreline with an effective population density of 12000 persons km2 so it does not meet the requirement for the application of swtf from the economic perspective but it is feasible from an environmental viewpoint thus several indications can be obtained considering both economic and environmental impacts from previous studies and this study firstly swtf is highly feasible in heavily populated areas i e more than 16000 18000 persons km2 for coastal areas from both economic and environmental viewpoints secondly swtf is obviously more feasible from environmental rather than economic perspectives hence according to the regions situations policymakers should make their suitable decisions fig 7 shows the extensive study results for the other four areas of hong kong that use freshwater for toilet flushing in these areas it is more environmentally friendly to apply dsa with swtf than sba with treated wastewater desalination or dca with wastewater reclamation using other water resources in these areas would save 45 million m3 of freshwater per year comparing to dca and sba swtf can reduce the co2 emission by 4010 1684 and 7600 3411 tons per year respectively 3 4 2 water stressed cities in south china for most cities in china water scarcity is a serious problem and limits city urbanization the results from fig 7 indicate that swtf is a promising way to ease the current water stress as reported by national integrated water resources planning niwrp 2015 fourteen cities in south china are facing water stress problems which are chosen as the potential swtf application areas their basic geographic information and environmental benefits obtained from swtf are illustrated in table 1 based on the sensitivity analysis the effective population density and seaside distance are using for preliminary evaluation of the fourteen cites the biggest two are shanghai and shenzhen accounting to be 50 of the total population in these cities their effective population densities are also relatively higher than other cities except macau the feasibility of swtf application increases with the growth of population density and city scale therefore the water saving amount and co2 emission reduction due to swtf are considerably high in shanghai and shenzhen if all fourteen cities apply swtf it can serve over 6 7 107 persons save around 2 2 109 m3 freshwater per year compared with the second feasible alternative water resources of centralized wastewater reclamation in dca swtf can reduce 2 2 0 9 105 tons co2 eq y of climate change 2 4 0 9 106 tons 1 4 db eq y of human toxicity and 12 8 5 4 kg cfc 11 y of ozone depletion this will dramatically relieve the water stress and decrease environmental impacts however the treatment process should be carefully operated to ensure that the effluent quality can meet the discharge standard if swtf is applied 4 conclusions this study evaluates the environmental impacts of swtf and compares the value with the impacts from other five water resources including imported water seawater desalination treated wastewater desalination centralized reclamation and decentralized reclamation for toilet flushing it further analyses its potential implementation in the areas with freshwater toilet flushing in hong kong and fourteen cities in south china the main conclusions are swtf is the only scenario that is comparable to sfa using the conventional single pipeline system in terms of producing small environmental impacts while environmental performances of other alternative water resources applications such as seawater desalination wastewater effluent desalination and centralized and decentralized wastewater reclamation would result in higher environmental impacts than conventional urban water system the feasibility of swtf application can be significantly impacted by effective population density followed by seaside distance swtf is more feasible in coastal areas or near coastal areas even with low density than other alternative water resources for toilet flushing energy consumption is one of the major reasons of environmental impacts from urban water system most of environmental impacts indicators would be largely decreased when the hard coal in total fuel composition reduces from 20 to 10 environmentally friendly material application should be encouraged the replacement of iron pipe material with pe can further reduce more than 80 of environmental impacts from pipelines materials in swtf system swtf is the most environmentally friendly alternative water resources for the four areas with freshwater toilet flushing in hong kong comparing to centralized desalination and treated wastewater desalination swtf can reduce the co2 emission by 4010 1684 and 7600 3411 tons per year respectively if alternative water resources than conventional water resources are needed in the studied area swtf would be a good choice in terms of environmental impact because it can reduce 2 2 0 9 105 tons y co2 emission comparing with the second best option centralized wastewater reclamation when 2 2e 109 m3 y freshwater can be replaced with other water resources in this study the potential application of swtf is only evaluated in hong kong and fourteen cities in south china the environmental impacts of different water resources application in other water stressed regions would be different due to their geographical conditions moreover the extensive evaluation of the potential application of swtf should include environmental impacts economic assessment ecosystem impacts and technical evaluation on the performance of wastewater treatment plants such as organic carbon and nutrients removal this study only conducted the lca of urban water system with swtf to evaluate the environmental impacts so more efforts should be made to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of swtf application considering the requirement for the improvement of effluent quality in mainland china the impacts of salinity in wastewater on the pollutants removal efficiencies in biological wastewater treatment processes should be extensively investigated before the wide application of swtf the potential hesitation in applying swtf in different cities may still be raised after the extensively investigation on one hand swtf only can be used for toilet flushing which only attributes 20 30 of municipal water consumption excluding industrial water consumption indicating that the swtf may not meet the water requirement in a city suffering from severe water scarcity however based on the environmental performance of swtf it is reasonable to consider to simultaneously use swtf with other alternative water resources in water stressed region which will also be assessed in future study on the other hand the application of swtf in an existing city requires large scale of civil works to install seawater supply pipelines both under the streets and in the buildings it would be more environmentally friend to apply swtf in newly developed regions first acknowledge this work was supported by the hong kong innovation and technology commission grant number itc cnerc14eg03 appendix a supplementary

18665,water scarcity has become a global issue that has forced many communities to seek alternative water resources the majority of water on the earth s surface comes from the sea seawater has the potential to mitigate water stress after proper treatment in hong kong seawater has been used directly for toilet flushing for more than 50 years and the seawater toilet flushing swtf system serves 80 of the residents however its environmental feasibility remains unknown this study is a pioneer evaluating the environmental performances of the swtf system by comparing swtf with other alternative water resources including desalinated seawater desalinated wastewater effluent centralized wastewater reclamation and on site greywater reclamation systems while the conventional long distance imported water scenario is set as the baseline for comparison this evaluation is first conducted in the southern district and north new territory in hong kong demonstrating swtf is significantly more environmentally friendly than other alternative water resources which is the only alternative water resource application approach with environmental impacts comparable with the conventional long distance imported water scenario on the contrary other alternative water resources application approaches would result in additional environmental impacts seaside distances and effective population density are two major geographical impact factors effecting the environmental impacts of different water systems in these two districts the benefits obtained from swtf in fourteen cities in south china are further investigated it is confirmed that swtf can significantly relieve water stress with the lowest environmental impacts comparing with other alternative options in these cities if alternative water resources must be applied for domestic usage however the assessment from different aspects should be further conducted to compare these alternative water resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater toilet flushing alternative water resources sustainability lca water scarcity 1 introduction during the past decades water scarcity has led to worldwide challenges in urban water supply these challenges are particularly severe in coastal communities where population and economic growth is high such as south china including hong kong in order to tackle water stress problems hong kong has been applying seawater toilet flushing swtf since 1957 wsd 2012 the water consumption for toilet flushing accounts for 29 47 of water use in residential buildings and up to 65 of that in typical commercial buildings lazarova et al 2003 thus the use of alternative water resources for toilet flushing would significantly reduce the need for potable water the seawater supply system in hong kong uses additional treatment and pipelines system that separated from the freshwater distribution consisting of pumping screening disinfection and distribution the pipelines length of swtf is 5 5 times less than freshwater distribution due to the elimination of looped format wsd 2012 the used toilet flushing seawater is discharged into sewage and the mixed wastewater goes into wastewater treatment plant from the experience obtained in hong kong 20 of seawater in wastewater insignificantly affects biological oxygen demand or chemical oxygen demand bod cod removal in biological wastewater treatment plants dsd 2019 although ammonia and nitrogen removal efficiencies for saline wastewater treatment are reduced comparing with freshwater wastewater treatment the effluent quality can still meet the discharge standard dsd 2019 to protect the freshwater ecosystem the treated saline wastewater is discharged back to the ocean swtf tells its own tale that it can save more than 20 of municipal water consumption to relieve water stress reducing chemicals and energy consumption for potable water treatment moreover according to one of our previous study the application of swtf can also facilitate the nutrient recovery from urine with negligible environmental impacts from additional equipment mbaya et al 2016 however the additional resources and energy consumption for individual treatment and pipeline systems will generate more environmental impacts besides the sulphate existed in the seawater will generate hydrogen sulphide h2s under anaerobic condition increasing human toxicity impact considering the coexistence of merits and demerits of swtf the entire environmental sustainability of swtf is unknown comparing with other water resources for toilet flushing as swtf has been successfully serving 80 of the population in hong kong in relieving water stress the practice has the potential to be introduced to the rest of the population in hong kong coastal cities in south china and even worldwide coastal major cities therefore using a systematic method to evaluate their environmental performance and figure out the suitable water resource for water stress cities are deemed necessary before real application life cycle assessment lca is a standardized decision support tool suitable for quantitative evaluation of environmental performance of products or processes lca has proven its strength across a broad range of environmental issues and has been widely performed to inform decisions on water supply the optimization of single sub system technology such as potable water production wastewater reuse and wastewater treatment has been conducted with lca corominas et al 2013 the technique has also been used to assess environmental evaluation in current holistic urban water systems from pumping to wastewater treatment barjoveanu et al 2014 and to compare urban water supply systems to determine the optimal one mo et al 2014 these studies have demonstrated the critical processes needed and the potential pathways to improving water management strategies from environmental perspectives however none of them has assessed the environmental impacts of using seawater directly for toilet flushing one recent study compared the potential application of freshwater seawater and two types of greywater reuse for toilet flushing with eco efficiency analysis and economic analysis which was conducted within building level with only 539 m3 day of total water consumption with 39 of water for toilet flushing lam et al 2017 however the total amount of water consumption for toilet flushing at a city level would be much lower than 39 moreover separated distribution system with considerable energy consumption should be installed for the non potable water which should be also considered in the city scale study therefore the tradeoff among different alternative water resources for toilet flushing should be evaluated at city level to obtain a whole picture in this study an lca is conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of swtf by comparing with other water resources including seawater desalination wastewater desalination centralized wastewater reclamation and on site reclamation with the traditional long distance water transfer applied in hong kong as well as many other major cities serving as the baseline the influential factors on the optimized water resources selection are analysed the objective is to assess the environmental sustainability of swtf and its extensive implementation in water scarcity areas in south china to relieve the stress and reduce environmental impacts as well 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the majority of the water demand in hong kong is met by importing water from dongjiang river with an 85 km tunnel which is both costly and energy intensive to reduce the dependence on freshwater import seawater is used for toilet flushing serving around 80 of hong kong residents the remaining 20 of residents live in four major areas southern district sd of hong kong island sai kung sk north new territories nnt and northwest new territories nwnt table s1 in supplementary information si sd and nnt are selected as the typical cases in this study because their effective population densities 24000 and 12000 persons km2 csd 2012 and seaside distances 0 and 10 km tang et al 2007 are representative among the aforementioned four areas the study areas are also extended to fourteen water stressed coastal cities in south china niwrp 2015 as shown in table s1 2 2 life cycle assessment lca involves four steps as prescribed by iso 14040 iso 2006 1 goal and scope definition 2 life cycle inventory lci analysis 3 life cycle impact assessment 4 interpretation of the results the first three steps are described in following while the results obtained in the fourth step are discussed in the next section 2 2 1 goal and scope definition the goal of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts of swtf and analyzing its extensive application by comparison with other alternative water resources for toilet flushing the conventional one pipe system is taken as basis the functional unit in each water scenario is defined as 1 m3 of water production the water lost due to pipeline leakage and consumption before it reaches wastewater treatment facilities is 15 wsd 2012 fig 1 illustrates each water scenario and the system boundary only the operation phase is evaluated for the existing water components while additional construction phases are also considered for the newly built facilities the demolition phase is excluded from this study as its contribution to the entire life cycle is negligible mo et al 2014 muñoz and fernández alba 2008 2 2 2 life cycle inventory the process and technologies used for water facilities are described in si the technologies selected for this study are based on real hong kong cases or experiences in other cities the foreground data for water treatment plants distribution systems and wastewater treatment plants are directly collected from the existing water facilities in hong kong foreground data for desalination plants centralized and on site wastewater reclamation systems are estimated from the literature bonton et al 2012 cashman et al 2018 elimelech and phillip 2011 foley et al 2010 raluy et al 2005 stokes and horvath 2009 the detailed information is listed in table s4 to table s14 in si only municipal pipelines are considered in this study while the pipes and pumps in buildings are not included in this study the following equation is used to estimate the layout of pipelines under variable population densities maurer et al 2010 1 l a l b p d a 0 8231 p d b 0 8231 l a and l b are the pipe lengths per capita m cap for districts a and b pd a and pd b are the effective population densities persons km2 of districts a and b extrapolation is performed assuming a linear relationship between the consumption of construction materials and the pipe length the pipelines diameter has been proven to be insignificant compared with the affection of pipelines length maurer et al 2010 thus the affection of water flow to pipeline diameter is not considered the introduction of seawater in wastewater increases sulphate concentration which may lead to an increase of h2s in the down stream process to evaluate the worst impact from h2s releasing it is assumed that 100 of sulphate in wastewater can be transformed to h2s the sulphate concentration in wastewater has been reported as high as 504 mg l wang et al 2011 thus the assumed maximum h2s generation in biological wastewater treatment process is 169 mg l the inventory for mixed wastewater treatment process is listed in si the lifetime of freshwater components is assumed to be 50 years the components associated with seawater or membrane technologies are expected to have a lifetime of 20 years as suggested in the literature fritzmann et al 2007 tang et al 2007 wsd 2012 the lifetimes for iron pipelines and plastic pipelines for seawater toilet flushing are considered to be 20 and 60 years respectively ng 2014 the total weight of pipe materials used for unit length with the same diameter is calculated according the reported ratio iron polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc 5420 930 1340 kim et al 2012 their ecoinvent process is illustrated in table s8 in si fuel composition for producing electricity is considered to be 53 hard coal 23 nuclear 22 natural gas and another 2 oil following the current fuel mix ratio in hong kong eb 2014 the fuel mixes in china grid are 70 hard coal combustion 20 oil 6 4 hydro 3 gas and 0 6 nuclear for cities in south china csy 2008 the foreground data i e construction materials chemicals electricity etc are combined with the background database from ecoinvent v3 0 sclci 2016 to estimate environmental impacts the detailed information is shown in si 2 2 3 life cycle impact assessment the faculty version of simapro 8 1 is employed to aggregate the inventory according to iso standard iso 2006 the recipe method is used to calculate the proposed harmonized environmental impacts during the life cycle of the systems six indicators are assessed in this study including climate change cc human toxicity ht photochemical oxidant formation pof ozone depletion od terrestrial acidification ta and particle matter formation pmf cc ht and od are used to predict the swtf benefits obtained in fourteen chosen cities in south china 2 3 uncertainty assessment the uncertainty analysis is carried out based on 10000 iterations of monte carlo simulation each data point in the lci is redefined as a uniformly distributed random variable whose mean is set as its original deterministic value the uncertainties of 20 and 40 are assigned to data obtained from real systems and from the literature 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is conducted based on information in nnt by 10 increase of water demand toilet flushing amount serving population effective population density and energy recovery in wastewater treatment plant and seaside distance on the cc from urban water systems sfa sba dsa and dca moreover 10 of hard coal in the fuel mix for electricity generation is also replaced with natural gas or nuclear power to predict the environmental effects from the application of new energy sources 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of seawater and other alternative water resources for toilet flushing 3 1 1 case study for sd the results of impact assessments and contributions from water components in the six scenarios for sd are presented in fig 2 among the six water supply scenarios sra and doa absolutely generate more environmental impacts than sfa sba dsa and dca sra with seawater desalination shows the highest impacts which are more obvious in the categories of ht od and pmf due to the significant environmental impacts of the desalination reverse osmosis process this result is consistent with the finding that seawater desalination causes more noticeable deterioration in environmental impacts than imported water wastewater desalination and centralized wastewater reclamation fritzmann et al 2007 morillo et al 2014 therefore seawater desalination is not recommended for application in the near future scenario doa with on site wastewater reclamation generates the second highest environment impacts among the six water strategies fig 2a on site membrane bioreactors mbrs are preferred due to the stable operating performance and rigorous effluent quality for recycling purpose verrecht et al 2010 in this scenario 20 of the water demand is supplied by the on site reclamation system which makes it possible to reduce the capacity of downstream facilities by 20 and shut down one fifth of treatment facilitates consequently the environmental impacts from operation phase of sewers and the wastewater treatment plant are approximately equivalent to 80 of those in other scenarios however the energy consumption of the on site mbrs is 4 03 kwh m3 verrecht et al 2010 which creates overwhelming environmental impacts comparing with 0 41 kwh m3 of energy consumption for conventional biological wastewater treatment process among sfa sba and dsa sba is less environmentally friendly than others sba differs from sra in that the seawater desalination is replaced with wastewater effluent desalination the state of the art wastewater desalination consumes around 1 2 2 0 kwh m3 electricity avlonitis et al 2012 which is significantly less than the 3 0 4 0 kwh m3 required in seawater desalination plants elimelech and phillip 2011 the famous examples are newater tortajada et al 2013 in singapore and groundwater replenishment system gwrs chalmers et al 2003 projects in california thus wastewater effluent desalination represents a promising approach to providing more potable water however it still produces more environmental impacts than sfa dsa and dca due to high electricity consumed during desalination process in the dsa scenario additional pipelines are required for seawater distribution however the environmental impacts of pipeline systems in dsa are not that much higher than those in sfa this is in contrast to common expectation that the installation of dual pipe systems would dramatically increase the environmental impacts according to hong kong s experience with swtf the freshwater can be supplied for toilet flushing as backup which allows the reduction of the seawater distribution pipeline system reliability with the branched layout instead of the looped one connective pipes between seawater and freshwater are installed inside buildings to guarantee the reliability of toilet flushing this branched layout dramatically shortens the overall length of seawater distribution pipelines so the environmental impacts of pipelines system in dsa with swtf is not significantly different from other scenarios as shown in fig 2a dca scenario is also dual pipeline systems but it is less environmentally friendly than using swtf due to the environmental impacts from wastewater reclamation process as reported the energy consumed by nanofiltration for treated wastewater polishing for non potable use is around 0 8 1 5 kwh m3 bellona and drewes 2007 mirza 2008 which is higher than that consumed by seawater treatment for swtf in dsa even though h2s emission is overestimated the increased ht is only 0 32 kg 1 4 db eq m3 which can be neglected considering the overall ht result of 13 kg 1 4 db eq m3 in dsa scenario thus dsa with swtf creates the lowest environmental impacts among all the alternative water resources scenarios 3 1 2 case study for nnt the results of impact assessments and contributions from water components in the six water scenarios for nnt are presented in fig 3 the trends are similar to those for sd i e sra and doa produce the largest environmental impacts while sfa dsa and dca yield relatively lower levels of environmentally harmful matters the overall environmental impacts in nnt are about 22 higher than those in sd more specifically the differences are largely due to pipeline systems which yield 10 25 of the impacts in sd and 15 40 of the impacts in nnt in scenario sfa showing as the second contributor among the water components in entire water system these results are slightly less than 28 40 in previous studies amores et al 2013 buckley et al 2011 because the pipeline systems are site specific and highly dependent on the level of regional development maurer et al 2010 as shown in eq 1 the pipeline utilization efficiency increases and the length of pipelines per capita decreases with the growth of effective density the effective population density is 24 000 persons km2 in sd higher than 12 000 persons km2 in nnt thus pipelines in nnt contribute more than in sd moreover nnt is 10 km away from the seaside so seawater should be transferred from the seaside to the living area and treated wastewater effluent should be discharged into the sea to avoid harming the local surface freshwater matrix and ecology and this requires additional pipeline systems therefore the hong kong water supplies department hkwsd proposes to develop centralized reclamation instead of swtf in nnt to avoid the needs for extra pipelines wsd 2012 however as illustrated by the environmental assessment in this study the environmental impacts of dca with centralized reclamation are on average 10 higher than those of dsa with swtf this is because transferring seawater over a distance of 10 km and discharging treated effluent into the sea account for less than 3 of the overall impacts dsa in fig 3b which is lower than the impacts of centralized reclamation treatment in dca given that on average an individual in hong kong uses 94 l of water per day to flush toilets swtf will create around 1030 fewer tons of co2 per year on average than toilet flushing with reclaimed water in nnt 3 2 system optimization sra and doa are excluded from system optimization as they generate extremely large environmental impacts 3 2 1 relative environmental impacts of future energy options electricity consumption contributes over 80 of environmental impacts in the urban water system as shown in figs 2 and 3 so the fuel mixes in electricity will significantly influence their environmental performance the hong kong government proposes two potential energy plans to be implemented by 2023 option 1 and option 2 the fuel composition of option 1 is 30 imported from grid in mainland china 20 nuclear 40 natural gas and 10 hard coal that of option 2 is 60 natural gas 20 nuclear and 20 hard coal using the current fuel mix as the baseline the changes in environmental impacts from switching to the alternative fuel mixes are summarized in fig 4 the figure shows that in all impact categories except od both options 1 and 2 are more environmentally friendly than the current fuel mix strategy the highest reduction is in ht with a 30 55 decrease for the new fuel mixes for pof pmf and ta a 15 30 reduction can be achieved with options 1 and 2 the reduction in cc with the two options is around 15 the impact reduction is mainly due to the smaller contribution of fossil fuel to the fuel mix in both options 1 and 2 however options 1 and 2 generate larger od impacts than the current energy strategy it can also be seen from the figure that the share of natural gas increases from 22 in the current fuel matrix to 40 in option 1 and 60 in option 2 this indicates that an increased consumption of natural gas will produce larger od impacts than an increased consumption of hard coal or nuclear power comparing the two future energy plans option 2 is more environmentally friendly than option 1 except in the od aspect this is due to 30 of electricity is from china grid in option 1 meanwhile the overwhelming contributor in china grid is from hard coal csy 2008 3 2 2 modification of swtf pipelines cast iron pipes are currently used for swtf which are prone to corrosion and reducing the lifetime of pipelines even though the inside of the pipes is painted with anti corrosion oil the frequency of pipe burst in the swtf system is three times higher than that in freshwater systems wsd 2012 in view of this problem plastic pipes are suggested to replace iron pipes for seawater supply i e pvc and pe due to their light weight strong corrosion resistance easy connection at construction sites kim et al 2012 and longer lifetime ng 2014 their environmental impacts are compared and shown in fig 5 the figure indicates that both pe and pvc generate smaller environmental impacts than iron defining the impacts generated by iron as 100 the impacts from pe and pvc are less than 50 across all indicators the most significant reduction is in ht pvc generates only around 20 while pe creates as low as 5 of the impact compared with iron the reduction in pmf is the second greatest with pvc and pe producing only 20 and 10 of the impact respectively even though cc pof od and ta are more severe than ht and pmf a 50 80 reduction in emission can be realized with the replacement of iron pipelines with pe or pvc ones this result demonstrates more preponderant of plastic materials than iron this is because plastic requires 30 70 less energy to produce than metal arena et al 2003 in addition plastic is anticorrosive and can last as long as 60 years serving the swtf system ng 2014 whereas metal can only last 20 years thus pvc and pe generate much less environmental burden than cast iron fig 5 also illustrates that pe has better environmental performance than pvc the greatest environmental benefit of pe comes from its 80 lower ht than pvc pe and pvc emit similar amounts of pof while the levels of cc od ta and pmf associated with pe are 40 50 lower than those associated with pvc therefore pe is recommended as the pipeline material for the swtf system 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the impacts of 10 increase of major geographical information and technique factors in nnt as shown in fig 6 the influences from water demand and toilet flushing amount can be considered as zero which is due to the insignificant contribution from construction process in this study the influence from seaside distance to dsa scenario with swtf is observable but just increases 1 of climate change of the urban water system the sensitivity ratio from energy recovery in wastewater treatment plant is around 0 02 which is normally for onsite electricity deduction the obvious impact from effective population density is observed which mainly affects the climate change from the contribution of pipelines maurer et al 2010 therefore the influence on dual pipe system is slightly higher than single pipelines system the application of new energy resources such as natural gas and nuclear can significantly reduce the environmental impact of entire urban water system which is consistent with the evaluation on the impacts of different fuel mix fig 4 considering that the fuel mix in electricity influences the environmental impacts of all the facilities without specificity to urban water system the effective population density and seaside distance are taken as two major factors for extensive application study 3 4 extensive application 3 4 1 areas in hong kong with freshwater toilet flushing to evaluate the extensive application of potential water resources in hong kong the effects of effective population density and seaside distance are further analysed based on the optimized results in section 3 2 where option 2 and pe pipes are preferred to be chosen for the upgrade in addition ht would be largely reduced but od would deteriorate under the optimized conditions hence ht od and cc as the most typical environmental impact are selected for further analysis and the results are shown in fig 7 the pof ta and pmf results are demonstrated in fig s1 in si obviously the overall environmental impacts are smaller for a higher effective population density because of greater pipeline utilization maurer et al 2010 scenario sba generates a significantly larger environmental burden than scenarios dca sfa and dsa regardless of the effective population density this is especially the case for od the dca scenario generates the second largest environmental burden the results of dsa and sfa are crossed at some points in areas with a low density sfa would be more environmentally friendly than dsa in densely populated areas however dsa would outperform sfa the distance from the seaside has much less effect on the environmental impacts than the effective density the furthest seaside distance evaluated in this study is set at 15 km according to hong kong condition as demonstrated in fig 7 the environmental impacts of dsa increase slowly with seaside distance however dca and sba consistently generate a higher environmental burden than dsa even in the low density areas where the seaside distance is 15 km considering the other two areas sk and nwnt with effective density of 6000 14000 persons km2 and seaside distance of 0 10 km respectively in table s1 swtf is also more favourable for them than other alternatives as indicated in fig 7 two other published works have also studied the application of swtf in comparison with alternative water supply systems but from an economic viewpoint one study compared swtf with centralized reclamation and raw water purchased for toilet flushing in nnt tang et al 2007 it found that centralized reclamation is the most economic option among the three the other study compared swtf centralized reclamation seawater desalination and wastewater desalination for coastal areas ng 2014 it reported that swtf is the cheapest option in coastal areas with an effective population density exceeding 16000 18000 persons km2 these two conclusions differ from those in this study for instance nnt is located 10 km away from the shoreline with an effective population density of 12000 persons km2 so it does not meet the requirement for the application of swtf from the economic perspective but it is feasible from an environmental viewpoint thus several indications can be obtained considering both economic and environmental impacts from previous studies and this study firstly swtf is highly feasible in heavily populated areas i e more than 16000 18000 persons km2 for coastal areas from both economic and environmental viewpoints secondly swtf is obviously more feasible from environmental rather than economic perspectives hence according to the regions situations policymakers should make their suitable decisions fig 7 shows the extensive study results for the other four areas of hong kong that use freshwater for toilet flushing in these areas it is more environmentally friendly to apply dsa with swtf than sba with treated wastewater desalination or dca with wastewater reclamation using other water resources in these areas would save 45 million m3 of freshwater per year comparing to dca and sba swtf can reduce the co2 emission by 4010 1684 and 7600 3411 tons per year respectively 3 4 2 water stressed cities in south china for most cities in china water scarcity is a serious problem and limits city urbanization the results from fig 7 indicate that swtf is a promising way to ease the current water stress as reported by national integrated water resources planning niwrp 2015 fourteen cities in south china are facing water stress problems which are chosen as the potential swtf application areas their basic geographic information and environmental benefits obtained from swtf are illustrated in table 1 based on the sensitivity analysis the effective population density and seaside distance are using for preliminary evaluation of the fourteen cites the biggest two are shanghai and shenzhen accounting to be 50 of the total population in these cities their effective population densities are also relatively higher than other cities except macau the feasibility of swtf application increases with the growth of population density and city scale therefore the water saving amount and co2 emission reduction due to swtf are considerably high in shanghai and shenzhen if all fourteen cities apply swtf it can serve over 6 7 107 persons save around 2 2 109 m3 freshwater per year compared with the second feasible alternative water resources of centralized wastewater reclamation in dca swtf can reduce 2 2 0 9 105 tons co2 eq y of climate change 2 4 0 9 106 tons 1 4 db eq y of human toxicity and 12 8 5 4 kg cfc 11 y of ozone depletion this will dramatically relieve the water stress and decrease environmental impacts however the treatment process should be carefully operated to ensure that the effluent quality can meet the discharge standard if swtf is applied 4 conclusions this study evaluates the environmental impacts of swtf and compares the value with the impacts from other five water resources including imported water seawater desalination treated wastewater desalination centralized reclamation and decentralized reclamation for toilet flushing it further analyses its potential implementation in the areas with freshwater toilet flushing in hong kong and fourteen cities in south china the main conclusions are swtf is the only scenario that is comparable to sfa using the conventional single pipeline system in terms of producing small environmental impacts while environmental performances of other alternative water resources applications such as seawater desalination wastewater effluent desalination and centralized and decentralized wastewater reclamation would result in higher environmental impacts than conventional urban water system the feasibility of swtf application can be significantly impacted by effective population density followed by seaside distance swtf is more feasible in coastal areas or near coastal areas even with low density than other alternative water resources for toilet flushing energy consumption is one of the major reasons of environmental impacts from urban water system most of environmental impacts indicators would be largely decreased when the hard coal in total fuel composition reduces from 20 to 10 environmentally friendly material application should be encouraged the replacement of iron pipe material with pe can further reduce more than 80 of environmental impacts from pipelines materials in swtf system swtf is the most environmentally friendly alternative water resources for the four areas with freshwater toilet flushing in hong kong comparing to centralized desalination and treated wastewater desalination swtf can reduce the co2 emission by 4010 1684 and 7600 3411 tons per year respectively if alternative water resources than conventional water resources are needed in the studied area swtf would be a good choice in terms of environmental impact because it can reduce 2 2 0 9 105 tons y co2 emission comparing with the second best option centralized wastewater reclamation when 2 2e 109 m3 y freshwater can be replaced with other water resources in this study the potential application of swtf is only evaluated in hong kong and fourteen cities in south china the environmental impacts of different water resources application in other water stressed regions would be different due to their geographical conditions moreover the extensive evaluation of the potential application of swtf should include environmental impacts economic assessment ecosystem impacts and technical evaluation on the performance of wastewater treatment plants such as organic carbon and nutrients removal this study only conducted the lca of urban water system with swtf to evaluate the environmental impacts so more efforts should be made to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of swtf application considering the requirement for the improvement of effluent quality in mainland china the impacts of salinity in wastewater on the pollutants removal efficiencies in biological wastewater treatment processes should be extensively investigated before the wide application of swtf the potential hesitation in applying swtf in different cities may still be raised after the extensively investigation on one hand swtf only can be used for toilet flushing which only attributes 20 30 of municipal water consumption excluding industrial water consumption indicating that the swtf may not meet the water requirement in a city suffering from severe water scarcity however based on the environmental performance of swtf it is reasonable to consider to simultaneously use swtf with other alternative water resources in water stressed region which will also be assessed in future study on the other hand the application of swtf in an existing city requires large scale of civil works to install seawater supply pipelines both under the streets and in the buildings it would be more environmentally friend to apply swtf in newly developed regions first acknowledge this work was supported by the hong kong innovation and technology commission grant number itc cnerc14eg03 appendix a supplementary

18666,microplastics in food is a relatively new research field with only few studies available so far scientists have been pointing out that some of these studies apply questionable analytical methods nevertheless media often use such results to gain attention of the readers it is therefore of particular significance that only those scientific studies are published clearly presenting valid data on the content of microplastics in food unfortunately the study by zuccarello et al shows very critical aspects regarding analytical methods used and conclusions made the applied procedure is not described and therefore does not allow any assessment by other groups which is indispensable prerequisite of any scientific publication moreover the analytical method used for the identification and quantification of microplastic particles sem edx is not sound and not validated therefore in our opinion the results on the contamination of bottled mineral water with microplastics published by zuccarello et al are more than questionable keywords microplastics bottled mineral water pet bottles water research has recently published an article entitled exposure to microplastics 10 μm associated to plastic bottles mineral water consumption the first quantitative study in this article the authors investigated mineral water in plastic bottles polyethylene terephthalate for contamination with microplastics thereby they found a mean microplastics concentration of about 54 mio particles per litre particles with a diameter between 0 5 μm and 10 μm were analysed by sem edx scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive detector the field of research on microplastics in food is relatively new there are only few studies whose results are partly doubted by scientists due to questionable analytical methods nevertheless media often use such results to gain attention to their readers in recent years this has led to increasing uncertainty among consumers it is therefore of particular significance that only those scientific studies are published clearly presenting valid data on the content of microplastics in food we are concerned as the above mentioned study by zuccarello et al shows very critical aspects regarding analytical methods used and conclusions made 1 methods are not given in the article the methods used for sample preparation and detection of microplastics in the water samples are not described in the article zuccarello et al only refer to a patent for the extraction test and sample preparation this patent however is not available as sem edx is a new method for the analysis of microplastics it is essential to describe the procedure in detail and to demonstrate its validity before the method can be applied for microplastics analysis furthermore the control of possible sample contamination is crucial in the analysis of microplastics the article mentions the analysis of three blank values however no description is given on how these blank samples were performed this would in turn be essential for the evaluation of the results in conclusion without knowledge of the applied method and the experimental details the results of the study of zuccarello et al cannot be traced or verified which is an essential prerequisite of any scientific publication 2 sem edx is not a valid method for microplastics analysis edx is a method determining the elemental composition of materials the description in the article suggests that all particles containing carbon were determined as microplastics mineral water contains numerous particles of inorganic and organic nature other than microplastics also containing carbon the number of microplastic particles would therefore be over estimated in conclusion the study gave no proof that the determined microparticles are microplastics mp 3 the study is not the first study which assesses mps 10 μm the study is not the first that assess es with high accuracy the presence and the quantity of mps 10 μm in mineral water actually in 2018 two studies dealing with the same topic were published in water research schymanski et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 and one review was published welle and franz 2018 none of these articles were considered by zuccarello et al received jan 2019 furthermore mason et al 2018 which was cited by zuccarello et al cited the article of schymanski et al thus zuccarello et al should at least be aware of the study of schymanski et al 2018 in conclusion the study of zuccarello et al does not consider the current literature on this topic of mps in mineral water 4 microplastic concentrations are incredibly high schymanski et al 2018 and oβmann et al 2018 analysed particles in mineral water down to a size of 5 μm and 1 μm resp using the generally accepted technique micro raman spectroscopy anger et al 2018 thereby microplastic concentrations up to 50 52 particles l and 6292 10521 particles l resp were found compared to these concentrations those described by zuccarello et al are extremely high even taking into account that zuccarello et al analysed particles down to 0 5 μm such high particle numbers are difficult to retrace in fig 5 of zuccarello et al the size distribution of the mps is given it is interesting to note that the size range is very small compared to other studies schymanski et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 in all samples the maximum between the smallest and the biggest particle is only 1 μm in sample 7 and 9 the size of the particles is exactly 2 μm the experimental data show that 100 mio particles sample 7 and around 50 mio particles sample 9 are exactly 2 μm in diameter in conclusion there are strong doubts about the credibility of the values reported by zuccarello et al 5 principal component analysis pca used to find correlations zuccarello et al used pca to find correlations between some mineral water or bottle parameters and microplastic concentrations however the authors investigated only ten mineral water bottles such a low number of samples is far too little data for statistical analysis like pca in fig 6 of zuccarello et al pca on distance matrix red vectors display the mineral water and bottle parameters the ten bottles are plotted as points into this vector room the authors mentioned that mps contamination in bottled mineral waters was strongly correlated to the ph of waters but only weakly to plastic density of bottle page 369 in fig 6 bottle 4 is found along the ph vector bottle 1 2 and 9 are found along the plastic density vector so why is one correlation strong and the other one only weak the experimental data do not support such statements in chapter 5 the authors mentioned that this study was the first to investigate the cause of the release of mps in mineral waters we disagree with this statement assuming that the above mentioned correlations are correct the authors found only correlations not the cause in conclusion pca is not a suitable tool for statistical analysis of ten investigated bottle samples 6 poor quality plastics zuccarello et al mentioned that mineral water most contaminated by mps was the sample 7 whose bottles were made macroscopically and microscopically by poor quality plastic but no definition of poor quality given in and therefore no justification for this statement this is misleading to the reader 7 conclusions as an overall conclusion the data presented by zuccarello et al are very questionable and cannot be verified because the methods used are not mentioned this contradicts good scientific practice the peer review process is important to ensure the quality of a scientific articles apparently in this case this process did not lead to the elimination of the above mentioned faults conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

quantification of microplastic particles sem edx is not sound and not validated therefore in our opinion the results on the contamination of bottled mineral water with microplastics published by zuccarello et al are more than questionable keywords microplastics bottled mineral water pet bottles water research has recently published an article entitled exposure to microplastics 10 μm associated to plastic bottles mineral water consumption the first quantitative study in this article the authors investigated mineral water in plastic bottles polyethylene terephthalate for contamination with microplastics thereby they found a mean microplastics concentration of about 54 mio particles per litre particles with a diameter between 0 5 μm and 10 μm were analysed by sem edx scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive detector the field of research on microplastics in food is relatively new there are only few studies whose results are partly doubted by scientists due to questionable analytical methods nevertheless media often use such results to gain attention to their readers in recent years this has led to increasing uncertainty among consumers it is therefore of particular significance that only those scientific studies are published clearly presenting valid data on the content of microplastics in food we are concerned as the above mentioned study by zuccarello et al shows very critical aspects regarding analytical methods used and conclusions made 1 methods are not given in the article the methods used for sample preparation and detection of microplastics in the water samples are not described in the article zuccarello et al only refer to a patent for the extraction test and sample preparation this patent however is not available as sem edx is a new method for the analysis of microplastics it is essential to describe the procedure in detail and to demonstrate its validity before the method can be applied for microplastics analysis furthermore the control of possible sample contamination is crucial in the analysis of microplastics the article mentions the analysis of three blank values however no description is given on how these blank samples were performed this would in turn be essential for the evaluation of the results in conclusion without knowledge of the applied method and the experimental details the results of the study of zuccarello et al cannot be traced or verified which is an essential prerequisite of any scientific publication 2 sem edx is not a valid method for microplastics analysis edx is a method determining the elemental composition of materials the description in the article suggests that all particles containing carbon were determined as microplastics mineral water contains numerous particles of inorganic and organic nature other than microplastics also containing carbon the number of microplastic particles would therefore be over estimated in conclusion the study gave no proof that the determined microparticles are microplastics mp 3 the study is not the first study which assesses mps 10 μm the study is not the first that assess es with high accuracy the presence and the quantity of mps 10 μm in mineral water actually in 2018 two studies dealing with the same topic were published in water research schymanski et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 and one review was published welle and franz 2018 none of these articles were considered by zuccarello et al received jan 2019 furthermore mason et al 2018 which was cited by zuccarello et al cited the article of schymanski et al thus zuccarello et al should at least be aware of the study of schymanski et al 2018 in conclusion the study of zuccarello et al does not consider the current literature on this topic of mps in mineral water 4 microplastic concentrations are incredibly high schymanski et al 2018 and oβmann et al 2018 analysed particles in mineral water down to a size of 5 μm and 1 μm resp using the generally accepted technique micro raman spectroscopy anger et al 2018 thereby microplastic concentrations up to 50 52 particles l and 6292 10521 particles l resp were found compared to these concentrations those described by zuccarello et al are extremely high even taking into account that zuccarello et al analysed particles down to 0 5 μm such high particle numbers are difficult to retrace in fig 5 of zuccarello et al the size distribution of the mps is given it is interesting to note that the size range is very small compared to other studies schymanski et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 in all samples the maximum between the smallest and the biggest particle is only 1 μm in sample 7 and 9 the size of the particles is exactly 2 μm the experimental data show that 100 mio particles sample 7 and around 50 mio particles sample 9 are exactly 2 μm in diameter in conclusion there are strong doubts about the credibility of the values reported by zuccarello et al 5 principal component analysis pca used to find correlations zuccarello et al used pca to find correlations between some mineral water or bottle parameters and microplastic concentrations however the authors investigated only ten mineral water bottles such a low number of samples is far too little data for statistical analysis like pca in fig 6 of zuccarello et al pca on distance matrix red vectors display the mineral water and bottle parameters the ten bottles are plotted as points into this vector room the authors mentioned that mps contamination in bottled mineral waters was strongly correlated to the ph of waters but only weakly to plastic density of bottle page 369 in fig 6 bottle 4 is found along the ph vector bottle 1 2 and 9 are found along the plastic density vector so why is one correlation strong and the other one only weak the experimental data do not support such statements in chapter 5 the authors mentioned that this study was the first to investigate the cause of the release of mps in mineral waters we disagree with this statement assuming that the above mentioned correlations are correct the authors found only correlations not the cause in conclusion pca is not a suitable tool for statistical analysis of ten investigated bottle samples 6 poor quality plastics zuccarello et al mentioned that mineral water most contaminated by mps was the sample 7 whose bottles were made macroscopically and microscopically by poor quality plastic but no definition of poor quality given in and therefore no justification for this statement this is misleading to the reader 7 conclusions as an overall conclusion the data presented by zuccarello et al are very questionable and cannot be verified because the methods used are not mentioned this contradicts good scientific practice the peer review process is important to ensure the quality of a scientific articles apparently in this case this process did not lead to the elimination of the above mentioned faults conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest 
18667,hydrophilic organic micropollutants are commonly detected in source water used for drinking water production effective technologies to remove these micropollutants from water include adsorption onto granular activated carbon in fixed bed filters the rate determining step in adsorption using activated carbon is usually the adsorbate diffusion inside the porous adsorbent the presence of mesopores can facilitate diffusion resulting in higher adsorption rates we used two different types of granular activated carbon with and without mesopores to study the adsorption rate of hydrophilic micropollutants furthermore equilibrium studies were performed to determine the affinity of the selected micropollutants for the activated carbons a pore diffusion model was applied to the kinetic data to obtain pore diffusion coefficients we observed that the adsorption rate is influenced by the molecular size of the micropollutant as well as the granular activated carbon pore size graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrophilic micropollutants activated carbon adsorption kinetics intra particle diffusion pore diffusion 1 introduction anthropogenic organic micropollutants omps like pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals pesticides and their transformation products are often found in surface and groundwater christoffels et al 2016 loos et al 2010 ruff et al 2015 scheurer et al 2009 omps may enter the environment via the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and runoff from agricultural land in the past decades dozens of omps have been detected in water bodies used for drinking water production sjerps et al 2016 ter laak et al 2014 amongst other reasons this is related to the advance of analytical techniques which have become more sensitive and selective reemtsma et al 2016a ternes 2007 due to increasing use of anthropogenic organic chemicals the contamination of surface and drinking water with omps will likely increase in the future polar omps are less efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants as well as in drinking water treatment plants reemtsma et al 2016b screening studies have revealed a relative increase in polar compounds in drinking water samples compared to composition in surface or groundwater sjerps et al 2016 it is often found that the concentration of omps in drinking water exceeds 1 μg l riwa maas 2016 which indicates the need for improving current drinking water treatment technologies adsorption onto activated carbon ac in fixed bed filters is one of the main steps for omp removal during drinking water production from surface water sources stackelberg et al 2007 ternes 2007 ternes et al 2002 although activated carbon is known to be more effective for adsorption of hydrophobic compounds removal of hydrophilic compounds has been also reported nam et al 2014 nguyen et al 2012 technologies involving adsorption onto ac are cost effective and normally no transformation products are formed in contrast to advanced oxidation processes gunten 2018 miklos et al 2018 drawbacks of ac adsorption technologies include the high energy consumption for ac regeneration and slow adsorption kinetics worch 2012 nevertheless adsorption onto activated carbon is still regarded as an effective step to remove omps from wastewater and drinking water katsigiannis et al 2015 activated carbon is a versatile adsorbent due to its affinity for a wide range of compounds and large internal surface area nath and bhakhar 2011 worch 2012 the large surface area of ac originates from the complex internal porous structure formed during the activation process to reach the internal surface area where adsorption takes place the omps must diffuse from the solution into the pores we can distinguish three different compartments in which transport takes place 1 the bulk solution 2 the thin film layer around the ac particle and 3 the inside of the particle the transport in the intra particle compartment is due to surface and pore diffusion in surface diffusion the omp that is adsorbed onto the ac surface is transported along the carbon internal surface whereas in pore diffusion the omp is transported in the liquid phase within the carbon pores adsorption kinetics are determined by film surface and or pore diffusion although the relative contributions are dependent on such parameters as mixing regime adsorbent type and adsorbate properties it is important to note that in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between surface and pore diffusion valderrama et al 2008 the rate limiting step during adsorption of omps onto ac can be identified through modelling approaches accounting for the properties of both adsorbate and adsorbent lower diffusion rates reduce the efficiency of ac filters due to a more dissipated area between loaded and unloaded zones in the filter bed consequently the adsorbate is found in the effluent before the filter bed has been used to its maximum adsorption capacity worch 2012 by modelling the adsorption kinetics of different omps onto activated carbon the apparent diffusion coefficient of the micropollutant in activated carbon can be obtained this information can then be used to model and optimize removal of omps in ac filters in this study we assess the affinity of hydrophilic omps for two different types of granular activated carbon gac with different pore structure and develop a theoretical model based on pore diffusion to describe the adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherms and kinetic experiments were used as input for the model to obtain apparent pore diffusion coefficients of 9 omps of different sizes using 2 gacs with different pore sizes the results provide insight in which of the characteristics of omps and acs affect the adsorption rate 2 diffusion model several models have been presented in literature to describe adsorption kinetics in porous adsorbents some models assume that the transport rate is determined by the adsorption of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent surface they describe the adsorption rate as a chemical reaction ocampo pérez et al 2015 examples of models using this approach are pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models as described by ho and mckay 1998 and blanchard et al 1984 such models usually fit the data well but have limited predictive value since the parameters have no physical meaning lesage et al 2010 on the other hand some models assume that the adsorption rate is determined by diffusion those are more realistic models based on parameters that are related to the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent such as adsorbent porosity and particle radius kyriakopoulos and doulia 2006 these models take into account film diffusion and or intra particle diffusion hung and lin 2006 lee and mckay 2004 valderrama et al 2008 intra particle diffusion can be modelled based on surface and or pore diffusion depending on which process determines the rate in the system studied in some studies pore diffusion is described as the dominant transport mechanism ocampo pérez et al 2012b others find a greater contribution from surface diffusion ocampo perez et al 2011 2010 zhu et al 2016 or conclude that both transport processes are relevant souza et al 2017 in general it is difficult to distinguish between surface and pore diffusion in practice there are no known properties of the adsorbate and the gac nor known conditions of the adsorption process that determine the dominant transport mechanism ocampo pérez et al 2015 found that low adsorption capacity of the carbon towards an adsorbate resulted in a higher relative contribution of pore diffusion to the intraparticle diffusion we assume that pore diffusion will be a relevant diffusion mechanism of hydrophilic compounds in gac given their lower affinity in comparison to hydrophobic compounds we used a pore diffusion model pdm to describe the mass transfer of micropollutants towards the internal surface of activated carbon all omps studied in our experiments are hydrophilic which have in general a lower affinity for ac than hydrophobic micropollutants pore diffusion therefore was expected to be the dominant mass transfer mechanism in the model we consider only pore diffusion for the mass transfer inside the pores comparable models have been reported in literature ocampo pérez et al 2012a 2012b souza et al 2017 in the pdm the ac granules are assumed to be spherical with a constant diameter and homogeneous distribution of adsorption sites to evaluate the transport and concentration

adsorbent particle m the fitting parameter in the model was d p all other parameters were either calculated measured or obtained from the ac supplier ac porosity was calculated based on the ratio between the material apparent density and skeleton density details are given in the supplementary information si 1 the particle radius used was the arithmetic mean of the particle size range 3 75 10 4

transport limitation due to film diffusion can be neglected 3 c p c l for r r p 2 in the center of the particle r 0 the flux is zero 4 c p r 0 for r 0 in order to solve equations 1 4 a mass balance

desorption isotherms at 77 k using a micrometrics tristar 3000 details are given in si s2 the acs differ in micro and mesoporosity table 1 micropores constitute almost the entire internal surface area of cs whereas micropores represent around 68 of the cg internal surface area and the remaining fraction is formed by mesopores granules were sieved to obtain particles with a diameter between 0 5 mm and 1 mm after sieving granules were washed with demineralized water for 1 h dried and stored before the experiments gac was dried overnight at 105 c weighed and boiled in demineralized water to remove entrapped air 3 2 organic micropollutants a mixture of 10 omps was used in this study 1h benzotriazole bta desphenyl chloridazon dpc diclofenac dcf guanylurea gnr hexamethylenetetramine hmta

relevance for drinking water treatment they have recently been found in surface and groundwater in europe at concentrations that might impair drinking water production free of organic contaminants alotaibi et al 2015 buttiglieri et al 2009 riwa maas 2016 ruff et al 2015 3 3 adsorption experiments adsorption isotherm experiments and kinetic experiments were performed by adding a known amount of gac to a glass serum bottle containing a mixture of 10 omps and demineralized water buffered with 10 mm na2hpo4 and 10 mm kh2po4 at ph 7 5 all omps were present in similar molar concentrations the bottles were closed with butyl rubber stoppers and wrapped in aluminium foil to prevent omps photodegradation experiments were conducted in duplicate at 20 c and bottles were mixed at 120 rpm in horizontal position in an orbital shaker the sample volume subtracted from each bottle was 0 5 ml at every sampling point samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm in order to remove gac particles diluted when necessary and stored at 20 c before analyses 3 3 1 isotherm experiments for isotherm experiments 10 different initial concentrations of micropollutants were used ranging from 0 6 to 58 μm for cg or 1 0 120 μm for cs the initial concentration used in the kinetic experiments were within this concentration range section 3 3 2 gac mass and total liquid volume were respectively 0 1 g and 100 ml for cg and 0 05 g and 50 ml for cs equilibrium concentrations were measured at day 8 for cg and day 21 for cs with the exception of diclofenac which was measured at day 21 also for cg ac load at equilibrium was calculated based on the mass balance shown in equation 7 7 q e q c 0 c e q v m a where q e q is the ac load at equilibrium μmol g c 0 is the initial adsorbate concentration μmol l c e q is the adsorbate concentration at equilibirum μmol l v is the liquid volume l and m a is the adsorbent mass g the langmuir model was used to fit the experimental data using a nonlinear optimization method as suggested by tran et al 2017 starting from the linearized form of the model given by equation 8 8 1 q e q 1 q m k l c e q 1 q m 3 3 2 kinetic experiments kinetic experiments

14 and 21 the final volume subtracted from the bottle due to this sampling campaign corresponded to less than 7 of the total liquid volume 3 4 chemical analyses micropollutants were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass mass spectrometry lc hram ms the lc consisted of a ultimate 3000 coupled through a hesi ii electrospray source to a qexactive orbitrap ms thermo scientific san jose ca usa sample volumes of 50 μl were injected onto an atlantis t3 column 100 mm 3 mm 3 μm micropollutants were separated using gradient elution with a flow of 0 3 ml min

column temperature was maintained at 40 c micropollutants were detected in positive ionisation mode using electrospray three different full scan windows were applied 60 160 for pyrazole 700 800 for iopamidol and iopromide and 60 900 for all other micropollutants the following ms conditions were applied spray voltage 3 5 kv sheath and sweep gas flow rates 48 and 2 respectively capillary

solution thermo scientific peak identification and quantification was done with thermo xcalibur version 2 2 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms were performed to study the affinity of the selected omps for both types of activated carbons all micropollutants showed a higher affinity for cs fig 1 as shown in table 3 higher k l values except for met and gnr which showed a higher affinity for cg fig 2 the affinity of omps for cg followed the order dcf iopr bta iop gnr dpc mel met prz affinity of omps for cs followed the order dcf iopr iop bta mel dpc prz gnr k l values for metformin with cs and hexamethylenetetramine with both gacs could not be calculated accurately because hardly any adsorption was observed the maximum adsorption capacity of cs for some micropollutants can be higher than the q m obtained in our experiments given that the omp concentrations applied were too low to reach cs saturation nevertheless together with k l it is justified to use this parameter to describe the distribution of the omps between the adsorbed and dissolved phase in the concentration range used in the kinetic experiments no omp adsorption to butyl rubber stoppers was observed in controls without activated carbon data not shown the higher carbon loading of cs with omps is most likely due to the larger micropore surface area of cs table 1 stronger adsorption occurs in the micropores lu and sorial 2004 due to stronger interactions between the adsorbate and the pore walls li et al 2002 a higher adsorption onto microporous ac compared to micro mesoporous ac has previously been observed by masson et al 2016 pyrazole showed low affinity for cs and almost no adsorption onto cg fig 3 the low removal with both acs is most likely related to the small molecule size mw only 68 in relation to the ac pore size which reduces the strength of the interactions between the molecule and the pore walls gnr hmta and met showed a low affinity for the tested acs this may be related to their non cyclic structure restricting possible interactions of these micropollutants with the adsorbate hmta has a globular structure which restricts the available molecule surface for interaction with the ac met and gnr showed poor removal with activated carbon as reported before scheurer et al 2012 these are the only two positively charged molecules in our study and both showed a higher affinity for cg than for cs this is likely due to electrostatic interactions between these molecules and cg points of zero charge phpzc values ranging between 3 5 and 4 2 have been reported for cg butkovskyi et al 2018 villacañas et al 2006 on the other hand thermally activated carbons produced from coconut shells such as cs have typically phpzc values 9 de ridder et al 2013 dittmar et al 2018 largitte and pasquier 2016 therefore cg most likely has more negatively charged surface groups than cs at neutral ph higher adsorption of cationic compounds compared with neutral and anionic compounds onto chemically activated carbons was also observed by alves et al 2018 all micropollutants studied are hydrophilic and no correlation between the degree of hydrophilicity represented by log d o w and their affinity for the gacs represented by k l was observed an exception to this observation was dcf which had the highest log d o w and highest k l poor or no correlation between log d o w and affinity for gac for hydrophilic compounds is in agreement with what has been previously reported de ridder et al 2010 kovalova et al 2013 nam et al 2014 for hydrophilic compounds relevant interactions between adsorbate and activated carbon surface include pi pi interactions hydrogen bonds de ridder et al 2010 and electrostatic interactions margot et al 2013 omps with aromatic rings for instance bta and dcf can interact with the ac surface via pi pi interactions all omps from this study are capable of forming h bonds with the functional groups of the ac and charged molecules dcf gnr and met are subject to electrostatic attraction or repulsion with charged groups from the ac surface the high affinity of dcf and bta for the acs obtained in this experiment is in agreement with literature as those micropollutants are often reported as highly adsorbable on activated carbon zietzschmann et al 2016 2014 the langmuir affinity constant of dcf with both acs was at least tenfold higher than for the other micropollutants high affinity of dcf for the acs may be related to the higher log d o w of dcf compared to the other micropollutants studied table 2 and to the presence of two aromatic rings in the molecule increasing the possibilities of pi pi interactions bäuerlein et al 2012 iop and iopr showed a relatively high affinity for both acs in our experiments whereas these micropollutants are often reported as weakly adsorbable kennedy et al 2015 margot et al 2013 rossner et al 2009 zietzschmann et al 2014 the divergence between our results and what is often reported in literature for iop and iopr can be explained by the absence of background organic matter in our experiments the presence of dissolved organic carbon in concentrations as low as 1 5 mg l can reduce the adsorption of iop to gac by a factor of 7 compared to the adsorption in demineralized water ahn et al 2015 due to the large size of these micropollutants their removal with ac is more affected by the presence of background organic matter compared with the smaller compounds zietzschmann et al 2015 either due to pore blockage or competition for adsorption sites the difference between cg and cs load q e q for iop and iopr is smaller than for the other micropollutants fig 4 this indicates that not all micropore surface area of cs can be occupied by these molecules due to their large size as predicted based on the molecules diameter table 2 possible interactions between the adsorbates in the mixture have not been taken into account when fitting the langmuir as well as the pore diffusion models to our experimental data we believe this approach can be justified because based on the projected area of each compound table 2 at most only 15 of the gac surface area available was used for adsorption moreover displacement of an adsorbate with lower affinity for the ac by another adsorbate with higher affinity was less than 8 in the kinetic experiments at t 120 h except for the pair guanylurea cs in one of the replicates 18 decrease in adsorbed amount between day 8 and day 21 therefore we conclude that mixtures of omps can be used to determine parameters for single solute isotherm and kinetic models 4 2 adsorption kinetics of omps onto gac in the kinetic adsorption studies the adsorption rate was related to omp molecular size and gac pore size we observed that equilibrium was reached within 24 h for the small molecules bta dpc gnr mel met prz whereas for dcf equilibrium was reached within 24 h for cg and within 120 h for cs for iop and iopr the largest molecules in the study equilibrium was reached within 50 h for cg and 300 h for cs pore diffusion coefficients d p were obtained by fitting the pore diffusion model to the kinetic data for the omp gac pairs table 4 the obtained values of d p are in the same range as previously reported for adsorption with activated carbon lesage et al 2010 ocampo pérez et al 2012a the value for d p was not calculated for prz with cg since almost no adsorption was observed nor for met with cs and hmta with both acs we observed a negative correlation between diffusion coefficients d p and molecular size fig s2 and a positive correlation between d p and the presence of mesopores in gac for bta dpc dcf iop and iopr for these omps the adsorption rate was higher for cg than cs fig 5 fig s3 and fig s4 due to the presence of mesopores in cg table 1 for all micropollutants except for iop and iopr the model curve was calculated using the average initial omp concentration of the experimental duplicates for iop and iopr with cg the difference between the initial concentration of the duplicates was relatively high and thus two model curves were calculated using the initial concentrations of each duplicate due to the faster adsorption of some omps onto cg than cs cg load with those omps was higher than cs in the beginning of the adsorption process despite the omps higher affinity for cs the period during which cg load was higher than cs was proportional to the omp molecular size between 0 5 and 0 75 h for bta and dpc 12 h for dcf and between 25 and 73 h for iop and iopr after this period the cs load with omps was higher than cg as expected based on affinity parameters this is consistent with the hypothesis that the adsorption rate is limited by intra particle diffusion and that mesopores facilitate the adsorbate diffusion into the granule valderrama et al 2008 this was also observed by masson et al 2016 with activated carbon cloths with different mesopore volumes mesoporous acs have been reported to be more suitable for adsorption of bulky molecules liu et al 2006 nakagawa et al 2004 yuan et al 2007 compared to microporous acs due to size exclusion the overall affinity of the largest molecules tested dcf iop and iopr is higher for cs than for cg however as discussed earlier size exclusion effects of iop and iopr with cs can be observed in the isotherms supporting the hypothesis that diffusion of these micropollutants in the micropores was hindered some omps gnr mel met and prz showed no correlation between d p and molecule size prz is the smallest molecule in this study but did not have the highest diffusion coefficient as could be expected based on its molecular weight moreover gnr adsorbed at similar rates onto both acs whereas mel adsorbed faster onto cs fig 6 indicating that the presence of mesopores in cg did not result in a faster adsorption rate of gnr and mel onto this ac no correlation between diffusion coefficient and affinity for the ac represented by k l was observed either the lack of correlation between d p and molecule size or affinity for the ac shows that properties of the omp and or gac other than pore size also influence diffusion rates such as ac chemical surface groups omp molecular shape speciation etc in this study it is not possible to distinguish the influence of mesopores from the effect of adsorbent surface chemistry because the used acs differ in both aspects a similar conclusion was obtained by ocampo pérez et al 2012a in their study no clear trend was obtained when comparing adsorption rates given by second order kinetics model of compounds with different sizes onto gacs with different porosities the model describes the adsorption process after 0 5 h for the smaller molecules and after 24 h for the larger molecules for early stages the model overestimates the adsorbed amount of omp this may indicate that film diffusion limits adsorption rate at the beginning of the adsorption process intra particle diffusion is less relevant at initial stages since adsorption starts at the outer layers of the ac granules this has been described by valderrama et al 2008 for polycyclic aromatic compounds and activated carbon in their study with pahs the initial steps of the adsorption process could not be represented by models considering intra particle diffusion as rate limiting step due to the small thickness of the reacted layer our study shows that this is also valid for smaller polar molecules 4 3 pore diffusion coefficient the pore diffusion coefficient of an adsorbate in ac is related to the adsorbate aqueous diffusion coefficient d as described by equation 9 valderrama et al 2008 9 d p d ε p τ where d is the molecular diffusivity of the adsorbate m2 s and τ is the ac tortuosity factor dimensionless which is a parameter that describes the structure of ac and is used to relate the adsorbate diffusivity in the pore to the diffusivity in free solution d values for diclofenac and metformin have been reported in literature as 8 1 10 10 m2 s cid cerón et al 2016 and 1 23 10 9 m2 s mondal et al 2018 respectively cs and cg tortuosity were calculated based on the reported d values and equation 9 tortuosity values calculated for cg are around 7 and the value for cs based on dcf is around 10 which are higher than tipically reported values in literature for ac ocampo pérez et al 2012a worch 2012 when d values obtained experimentally are not available empirical correlations are applied to calculate the molecular diffusivities one of the most commonly used correlations is described by wilke and chang valderrama et al 2008 wilke and chang 1955 worch 2012 according to equation 10 10 d 7 4 10 8 φ m 0 5 t η b v a 0 6 where φ is an association parameter that represents the effective molecular weight of water with respect to the diffusion process and has the value of 2 6 m is the solvent molecular weight g mol t is temperature k η b is the solution viscosity cp and v a is the adsorbate molecular volume cm3 mol values for v a for the omps were obtained by chemsketch acd labs freeware tortuosity values calculated using the aqueous diffusion obtained with equation 10 are presented in table 4 the calculated values are mostly in the range of values reported for ac except for met and prz and the largest molecules dcf iop and iopr the high tortuosity value obtained for dcf iop and iopr combined with the adsorption kinetic results indicates that their diffusion is hindered in the micropores mainly in the gac cs likely due to the relatively large size of the molecules since tortuosity is a property of ac its values should be constant however this parameter is determined based on the adsorption of an adsorbate onto the ac surface so the interaction between the adsorbate and the ac surface will likely influence the values obtained using experimental data the variation in tortuosity values can also indicate that the intra particle diffusion is not only governed by pore diffusion but surface diffusion might also play a role in determining the adsorption rate however since cg and cs tortuosity and pore diffusion coefficients for the omps are not known it is not possible to determine the relative contribution of surface diffusion to the adsorption rate 5 conclusions the adsorption rate and affinity of omps with two types of activated carbons with different pore sizes was studied to determine the rate limiting step in adsorption the main findings are as follows the choice for the most suitable gac for micropollutant removal from drinking water should take into account not only affinity for the target compounds but also gac pore sizes gacs with mesopores are desirable to prevent that slow kinetics reduce efficiency of a fixed bed ac filter pore diffusion coefficients correlate negatively to adsorbate size for most omps and this correlation is stronger for the largest adsorbates neither molecule size nor adsorption affinity are sufficient to explain the adsorption kinetics of gnl mer met prz diffusion of the largest molecules is hindered in the gac micropores resulting in tortuosity values higher than typically reported for ac micropore surface area correlates with adsorption affinity between omp and gac however size exclusion effects were observed for the largest omps iopamidol and iopromide log d o w is a poor indicator for adsorption affinity for the hydrophilic omps studied adsorption affinity relates to omp molecular structure omps with cyclic structures adsorb to ac to a larger extent than omps with

18667,hydrophilic organic micropollutants are commonly detected in source water used for drinking water production effective technologies to remove these micropollutants from water include adsorption onto granular activated carbon in fixed bed filters the rate determining step in adsorption using activated carbon is usually the adsorbate diffusion inside the porous adsorbent the presence of mesopores can facilitate diffusion resulting in higher adsorption rates we used two different types of granular activated carbon with and without mesopores to study the adsorption rate of hydrophilic micropollutants furthermore equilibrium studies were performed to determine the affinity of the selected micropollutants for the activated carbons a pore diffusion model was applied to the kinetic data to obtain pore diffusion coefficients we observed that the adsorption rate is influenced by the molecular size of the micropollutant as well as the granular activated carbon pore size graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrophilic micropollutants activated carbon adsorption kinetics intra particle diffusion pore diffusion 1 introduction anthropogenic organic micropollutants omps like pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals pesticides and their transformation products are often found in surface and groundwater christoffels et al 2016 loos et al 2010 ruff et al 2015 scheurer et al 2009 omps may enter the environment via the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and runoff from agricultural land in the past decades dozens of omps have been detected in water bodies used for drinking water production sjerps et al 2016 ter laak et al 2014 amongst other reasons this is related to the advance of analytical techniques which have become more sensitive and selective reemtsma et al 2016a ternes 2007 due to increasing use of anthropogenic organic chemicals the contamination of surface and drinking water with omps will likely increase in the future polar omps are less efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants as well as in drinking water treatment plants reemtsma et al 2016b screening studies have revealed a relative increase in polar compounds in drinking water samples compared to composition in surface or groundwater sjerps et al 2016 it is often found that the concentration of omps in drinking water exceeds 1 μg l riwa maas 2016 which indicates the need for improving current drinking water treatment technologies adsorption onto activated carbon ac in fixed bed filters is one of the main steps for omp removal during drinking water production from surface water sources stackelberg et al 2007 ternes 2007 ternes et al 2002 although activated carbon is known to be more effective for adsorption of hydrophobic compounds removal of hydrophilic compounds has been also reported nam et al 2014 nguyen et al 2012 technologies involving adsorption onto ac are cost effective and normally no transformation products are formed in contrast to advanced oxidation processes gunten 2018 miklos et al 2018 drawbacks of ac adsorption technologies include the high energy consumption for ac regeneration and slow adsorption kinetics worch 2012 nevertheless adsorption onto activated carbon is still regarded as an effective step to remove omps from wastewater and drinking water katsigiannis et al 2015 activated carbon is a versatile adsorbent due to its affinity for a wide range of compounds and large internal surface area nath and bhakhar 2011 worch 2012 the large surface area of ac originates from the complex internal porous structure formed during the activation process to reach the internal surface area where adsorption takes place the omps must diffuse from the solution into the pores we can distinguish three different compartments in which transport takes place 1 the bulk solution 2 the thin film layer around the ac particle and 3 the inside of the particle the transport in the intra particle compartment is due to surface and pore diffusion in surface diffusion the omp that is adsorbed onto the ac surface is transported along the carbon internal surface whereas in pore diffusion the omp is transported in the liquid phase within the carbon pores adsorption kinetics are determined by film surface and or pore diffusion although the relative contributions are dependent on such parameters as mixing regime adsorbent type and adsorbate properties it is important to note that in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between surface and pore diffusion valderrama et al 2008 the rate limiting step during adsorption of omps onto ac can be identified through modelling approaches accounting for the properties of both adsorbate and adsorbent lower diffusion rates reduce the efficiency of ac filters due to a more dissipated area between loaded and unloaded zones in the filter bed consequently the adsorbate is found in the effluent before the filter bed has been used to its maximum adsorption capacity worch 2012 by modelling the adsorption kinetics of different omps onto activated carbon the apparent diffusion coefficient of the micropollutant in activated carbon can be obtained this information can then be used to model and optimize removal of omps in ac filters in this study we assess the affinity of hydrophilic omps for two different types of granular activated carbon gac with different pore structure and develop a theoretical model based on pore diffusion to describe the adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherms and kinetic experiments were used as input for the model to obtain apparent pore diffusion coefficients of 9 omps of different sizes using 2 gacs with different pore sizes the results provide insight in which of the characteristics of omps and acs affect the adsorption rate 2 diffusion model several models have been presented in literature to describe adsorption kinetics in porous adsorbents some models assume that the transport rate is determined by the adsorption of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent surface they describe the adsorption rate as a chemical reaction ocampo pérez et al 2015 examples of models using this approach are pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models as described by ho and mckay 1998 and blanchard et al 1984 such models usually fit the data well but have limited predictive value since the parameters have no physical meaning lesage et al 2010 on the other hand some models assume that the adsorption rate is determined by diffusion those are more realistic models based on parameters that are related to the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent such as adsorbent porosity and particle radius kyriakopoulos and doulia 2006 these models take into account film diffusion and or intra particle diffusion hung and lin 2006 lee and mckay 2004 valderrama et al 2008 intra particle diffusion can be modelled based on surface and or pore diffusion depending on which process determines the rate in the system studied in some studies pore diffusion is described as the dominant transport mechanism ocampo pérez et al 2012b others find a greater contribution from surface diffusion ocampo perez et al 2011 2010 zhu et al 2016 or conclude that both transport processes are relevant souza et al 2017 in general it is difficult to distinguish between surface and pore diffusion in practice there are no known properties of the adsorbate and the gac nor known conditions of the adsorption process that determine the dominant transport mechanism ocampo pérez et al 2015 found that low adsorption capacity of the carbon towards an adsorbate resulted in a higher relative contribution of pore diffusion to the intraparticle diffusion we assume that pore diffusion will be a relevant diffusion mechanism of hydrophilic compounds in gac given their lower affinity in comparison to hydrophobic compounds we used a pore diffusion model pdm to describe the mass transfer of micropollutants towards the internal surface of activated carbon all omps studied in our experiments are hydrophilic which have in general a lower affinity for ac than hydrophobic micropollutants pore diffusion therefore was expected to be the dominant mass transfer mechanism in the model we consider only pore diffusion for the mass transfer inside the pores comparable models have been reported in literature ocampo pérez et al 2012a 2012b souza et al 2017 in the pdm the ac granules are assumed to be spherical with a constant diameter and homogeneous distribution of adsorption sites to evaluate the transport and concentration

adsorbent particle m the fitting parameter in the model was d p all other parameters were either calculated measured or obtained from the ac supplier ac porosity was calculated based on the ratio between the material apparent density and skeleton density details are given in the supplementary information si 1 the particle radius used was the arithmetic mean of the particle size range 3 75 10 4

transport limitation due to film diffusion can be neglected 3 c p c l for r r p 2 in the center of the particle r 0 the flux is zero 4 c p r 0 for r 0 in order to solve equations 1 4 a mass balance

of cs whereas micropores represent around 68 of the cg internal surface area and the remaining fraction is formed by mesopores granules were sieved to obtain particles with a diameter between 0 5 mm

remove entrapped air 3 2 organic micropollutants a mixture of 10 omps was used in this study 1h benzotriazole bta desphenyl chloridazon dpc diclofenac dcf guanylurea gnr hexamethylenetetramine hmta

relevance for drinking water treatment they have recently been found in surface and groundwater in europe at concentrations that might impair drinking water production free of organic contaminants alotaibi et al 2015 buttiglieri et al 2009 riwa maas 2016 ruff et al 2015 3 3 adsorption experiments adsorption isotherm experiments and kinetic experiments were performed by adding a known amount of gac to a glass serum bottle containing a mixture of 10 omps and demineralized water buffered with 10 mm na2hpo4 and 10 mm kh2po4 at ph 7 5 all omps were present in similar molar concentrations the bottles were closed with butyl rubber stoppers and wrapped in aluminium foil to prevent omps photodegradation experiments were conducted in duplicate at 20 c and bottles were mixed at 120 rpm in horizontal position in an orbital shaker the sample volume subtracted from each bottle was 0 5 ml at every sampling point samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm in order to remove gac particles diluted when necessary and stored at 20 c before analyses 3 3 1 isotherm experiments for isotherm experiments 10 different initial concentrations of micropollutants were used ranging from 0 6 to 58 μm for cg or 1 0 120 μm for cs the initial concentration used in the kinetic experiments were within this concentration range section 3 3 2 gac mass and total liquid volume were respectively 0 1 g and 100 ml for cg and 0 05 g and 50 ml for cs equilibrium concentrations were measured at day 8 for cg and day 21 for cs with the exception of diclofenac which was measured at day 21 also for cg ac load at equilibrium was calculated based on the mass balance shown in equation 7 7 q e q c 0 c e q v m a where q e q is the ac load at equilibrium μmol g c 0 is the initial adsorbate concentration μmol l c e q is the adsorbate concentration at equilibirum μmol l v is the liquid volume l and m a is the adsorbent mass g the langmuir model was used to fit the experimental data using a nonlinear optimization method as suggested by tran et al 2017 starting from the linearized form of the model given by equation 8 8 1 q e q 1 q m k l c e q 1 q m 3 3 2 kinetic experiments kinetic experiments

14 and 21 the final volume subtracted from the bottle due to this sampling campaign corresponded to less than 7 of the total liquid volume 3 4 chemical analyses micropollutants were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass mass spectrometry lc hram ms the lc consisted of a ultimate 3000 coupled through a hesi ii electrospray source to a qexactive orbitrap ms thermo scientific san jose ca usa sample volumes of 50 μl were injected onto an atlantis t3 column 100 mm 3 mm 3 μm micropollutants were separated using gradient elution with a flow of 0 3 ml min

solution thermo scientific peak identification and quantification was done with thermo xcalibur version 2 2 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms were performed to study the affinity of the selected omps for both types of activated carbons all micropollutants showed a higher affinity for cs fig 1 as shown in table 3 higher k l values except for met and gnr which showed a higher affinity for cg fig 2 the affinity of omps for cg followed the order dcf iopr bta iop gnr dpc mel met prz affinity of omps for cs followed the order dcf iopr iop bta mel dpc prz gnr k l values for metformin with cs and hexamethylenetetramine with both gacs could not be calculated accurately because hardly any adsorption was observed the maximum adsorption capacity of cs for some micropollutants can be higher than the q m obtained in our experiments given that the omp concentrations applied were too low to reach cs saturation nevertheless together with k l it is justified to use this parameter to describe the distribution of the omps between the adsorbed and dissolved phase in the concentration range used in the kinetic experiments no omp adsorption to butyl rubber stoppers was observed in controls without activated carbon data not shown the higher carbon loading of cs with omps is most likely due to the larger micropore surface area of cs table 1 stronger adsorption occurs in the micropores lu and sorial 2004 due to stronger interactions between the adsorbate and the pore walls li et al 2002 a higher adsorption onto microporous ac compared to micro mesoporous ac has previously been observed by masson et al 2016 pyrazole showed low affinity for cs and almost no adsorption onto cg fig 3 the low removal with both acs is most likely related to the small molecule size mw only 68 in relation to the ac pore size which reduces the strength of the interactions between the molecule and the pore walls gnr hmta and met showed a low affinity for the tested acs this may be related to their non cyclic structure restricting possible interactions of these micropollutants with the adsorbate hmta has a globular structure which restricts the available molecule surface for interaction with the ac met and gnr showed poor removal with activated carbon as reported before scheurer et al 2012 these are the only two positively charged molecules in our study and both showed a higher affinity for cg than for cs this is likely due to electrostatic interactions between these molecules and cg points of zero charge phpzc values ranging between 3 5 and 4 2 have been reported for cg butkovskyi et al 2018 villacañas et al 2006 on the other hand thermally activated carbons produced from coconut shells such as cs have typically phpzc values 9 de ridder et al 2013 dittmar et al 2018 largitte and pasquier 2016 therefore cg most likely has more negatively charged surface groups than cs at neutral ph higher adsorption of cationic compounds compared with neutral and anionic compounds onto chemically activated carbons was also observed by alves et al 2018 all micropollutants studied are hydrophilic and no correlation between the degree of hydrophilicity represented by log d o w and their affinity for the gacs represented by k l was observed an exception to this observation was dcf which had the highest log d o w and highest k l poor or no correlation between log d o w and affinity for gac for hydrophilic compounds is in agreement with what has been previously reported de ridder et al 2010 kovalova et al 2013 nam et al 2014 for hydrophilic compounds relevant interactions between adsorbate and activated carbon surface include pi pi interactions hydrogen bonds de ridder et al 2010 and electrostatic interactions margot et al 2013 omps with aromatic rings for instance bta and dcf can interact with the ac surface via pi pi interactions all omps from this study are capable of forming h bonds with the functional groups of the ac and charged molecules dcf gnr and met are subject to electrostatic attraction or repulsion with charged groups from the ac surface the high affinity of dcf and bta for the acs obtained in this experiment is in agreement with literature as those micropollutants are often reported as highly adsorbable on activated carbon zietzschmann et al 2016 2014 the langmuir affinity constant of dcf with both acs was at least tenfold higher than for the other micropollutants high affinity of dcf for the acs may be related to the higher log d o w of dcf compared to the other micropollutants studied table 2 and to the presence of two aromatic rings in the molecule increasing the possibilities of pi pi interactions bäuerlein et al 2012 iop and iopr showed a relatively high affinity for both acs in our experiments whereas these micropollutants are often reported as weakly adsorbable kennedy et al 2015 margot et al 2013 rossner et al 2009 zietzschmann et al 2014 the divergence between our results and what is often reported in literature for iop and iopr can be explained by the absence of background organic matter in our experiments the presence of dissolved organic carbon in concentrations as low as 1 5 mg l can reduce the adsorption of iop to gac by a factor of 7 compared to the adsorption in demineralized water ahn et al 2015 due to the large size of these micropollutants their removal with ac is more affected by the presence of background organic matter compared with the smaller compounds zietzschmann et al 2015 either due to pore blockage or competition for adsorption sites the difference between cg and cs load q e q for iop and iopr is smaller than for the other micropollutants fig 4 this indicates that not all micropore surface area of cs can be occupied by these molecules due to their large size as predicted based on the molecules diameter table 2 possible interactions between the adsorbates in the mixture have not been taken into account when fitting the langmuir as well as the pore diffusion models to our experimental data we believe this approach can be justified because based on the projected area of each compound table 2 at most only 15 of the gac surface area available was used for adsorption moreover displacement of an adsorbate with lower affinity for the ac by another adsorbate with higher affinity was less than 8 in the kinetic experiments at t 120 h except for the pair guanylurea cs in one of the replicates 18 decrease in adsorbed amount between day 8 and day 21 therefore we conclude that mixtures of omps can be used to determine parameters for single solute isotherm and kinetic models 4 2 adsorption kinetics of omps onto gac in the kinetic adsorption studies the adsorption rate was related to omp molecular size and gac pore size we observed that equilibrium was reached within 24 h for the small molecules bta dpc gnr mel met prz whereas for dcf equilibrium was reached within 24 h for cg and within 120 h for cs for iop and iopr the largest molecules in the study equilibrium was reached within 50 h for cg and 300 h for cs pore diffusion coefficients d p were obtained by fitting the pore diffusion model to the kinetic data for the omp gac pairs table 4 the obtained values of d p are in the same range as previously reported for adsorption with activated carbon lesage et al 2010 ocampo pérez et al 2012a the value for d p was not calculated for prz with cg since almost no adsorption was observed nor for met with cs and hmta with both acs we observed a negative correlation between diffusion coefficients d p and molecular size fig s2 and a positive correlation between d p and the presence of mesopores in gac for bta dpc dcf iop and iopr for these omps the adsorption rate was higher for cg than cs fig 5 fig s3 and fig s4 due to the presence of mesopores in cg table 1 for all micropollutants except for iop and iopr the model curve was calculated using the average initial omp concentration of the experimental duplicates for iop and iopr with cg the difference between the initial concentration of the duplicates was relatively high and thus two model curves were calculated using the initial concentrations of each duplicate due to the faster adsorption of some omps onto cg than cs cg load with those omps was higher than cs in the beginning of the adsorption process despite the omps higher affinity for cs the period during which cg load was higher than cs was proportional to the omp molecular size between 0 5 and 0 75 h for bta and dpc 12 h for dcf and between 25 and 73 h for iop and iopr after this period the cs load with omps was higher than cg as expected based on affinity parameters this is consistent with the hypothesis that the adsorption rate is limited by intra particle diffusion and that mesopores facilitate the adsorbate diffusion into the granule valderrama et al 2008 this was also observed by masson et al 2016 with activated carbon cloths with different mesopore volumes mesoporous acs have been reported to be more suitable for adsorption of bulky molecules liu et al 2006 nakagawa et al 2004 yuan et al 2007 compared to microporous acs due to size exclusion the overall affinity of the largest molecules tested dcf iop and iopr is higher for cs than for cg however as discussed earlier size exclusion effects of iop and iopr with cs can be observed in the isotherms supporting the hypothesis that diffusion of these micropollutants in the micropores was hindered some omps gnr mel met and prz showed no correlation between d p and molecule size prz is the smallest molecule in this study but did not have the highest diffusion coefficient as could be expected based on its molecular weight moreover gnr adsorbed at similar rates onto both acs whereas mel adsorbed faster onto cs fig 6 indicating that the presence of mesopores in cg did not result in a faster adsorption rate of gnr and mel onto this ac no correlation between diffusion coefficient and affinity for the ac represented by k l was observed either the lack of correlation between d p and molecule size or affinity for the ac shows that properties of the omp and or gac other than pore size also influence diffusion rates such as ac chemical surface groups omp molecular shape speciation etc in this study it is not possible to distinguish the influence of mesopores from the effect of adsorbent surface chemistry because the used acs differ in both aspects a similar conclusion was obtained by ocampo pérez et al 2012a in their study no clear trend was obtained when comparing adsorption rates given by second order kinetics model of compounds with different sizes onto gacs with different porosities the model describes the adsorption process after 0 5 h for the smaller molecules and after 24 h for the larger molecules for early stages the model overestimates the adsorbed amount of omp this may indicate that film diffusion limits adsorption rate at the beginning of the adsorption process intra particle diffusion is less relevant at initial stages since adsorption starts at the outer layers of the ac granules this has been described by valderrama et al 2008 for polycyclic aromatic compounds and activated carbon in their study with pahs the initial steps of the adsorption process could not be represented by models considering intra particle diffusion as rate limiting step due to the small thickness of the reacted layer our study shows that this is also valid for smaller polar molecules 4 3 pore diffusion coefficient the pore diffusion coefficient of an adsorbate in ac is related to the adsorbate aqueous diffusion coefficient d as described by equation 9 valderrama et al 2008 9 d p d ε p τ where d is the molecular diffusivity of the adsorbate m2 s and τ is the ac tortuosity factor dimensionless which is a parameter that describes the structure of ac and is used to relate the adsorbate diffusivity in the pore to the diffusivity in free solution d values for diclofenac and metformin have been reported in literature as 8 1 10 10 m2 s cid cerón et al 2016 and 1 23 10 9 m2 s mondal et al 2018 respectively cs and cg tortuosity were calculated based on the reported d values and equation 9 tortuosity values calculated for cg are around 7 and the value for cs based on dcf is around 10 which are higher than tipically reported values in literature for ac ocampo pérez et al 2012a worch 2012 when d values obtained experimentally are not available empirical correlations are applied to calculate the molecular diffusivities one of the most commonly used correlations is described by wilke and chang valderrama et al 2008 wilke and chang 1955 worch 2012 according to equation 10 10 d 7 4 10 8 φ m 0 5 t η b v a 0 6 where φ is an association parameter that represents the effective molecular weight of water with respect to the diffusion process and has the value of 2 6 m is the solvent molecular weight g mol t is temperature k η b is the solution viscosity cp and v a is the adsorbate molecular volume cm3 mol values for v a for the omps were obtained by chemsketch acd labs freeware tortuosity values calculated using the aqueous diffusion obtained with equation 10 are presented in table 4 the calculated values are mostly in the range of values reported for ac except for met and prz and the largest molecules dcf iop and iopr the high tortuosity value obtained for dcf iop and iopr combined with the adsorption kinetic results indicates that their diffusion is hindered in the micropores mainly in the gac cs likely due to the relatively large size of the molecules since tortuosity is a property of ac its values should be constant however this parameter is determined based on the adsorption of an adsorbate onto the ac surface so the interaction between the adsorbate and the ac surface will likely influence the values obtained using experimental data the variation in tortuosity values can also indicate that the intra particle diffusion is not only governed by pore diffusion but surface diffusion might also play a role in determining the adsorption rate however since cg and cs tortuosity and pore diffusion coefficients for the omps are not known it is not possible to determine the relative contribution of surface diffusion to the adsorption rate 5 conclusions the adsorption rate and affinity of omps with two types of activated carbons with different pore sizes was studied to determine the rate limiting step in adsorption the main findings are as follows the choice for the most suitable gac for micropollutant removal from drinking water should take into account not only affinity for the target compounds but also gac pore sizes gacs with mesopores are desirable to prevent that slow kinetics reduce efficiency of a fixed bed ac filter pore diffusion coefficients correlate negatively to adsorbate size for most omps and this correlation is stronger for the largest adsorbates neither molecule size nor adsorption affinity are sufficient to explain the adsorption kinetics of gnl mer met prz diffusion of the largest molecules is hindered in the gac micropores resulting in tortuosity values higher than typically reported for

wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been given a renewed sense of urgency organic substances cod in wastewater represent significant amounts of chemical energy and recovering this energy is a more sustainable course of action than destroying it by biological oxidation during the treatment processes in addition there is also a large amount of thermal energy in wastewater which is usually

for drying dewatered sludge it is true that studies focusing on heat recovery from raw wastewater have reported practical problems such as blockage biofouling and corrosion baek et al 2005 cipolla and maglionico 2014 however treated wastewater effluent would be more suitable for the recovery of thermal energy as it is relatively clean at least enough to alleviate the aforementioned problems existing literature heidrich and curtis 2011 mccarty et al 2011 khiewwijit et al 2015 tends to treat chemical energy as the only source of recoverable energy available ignoring the potential use of thermal energy in wastewater to balance energy demand for a carbon neutral operation of wwtps of course in practice the chemical energy in cod cannot be fully converted into utilizable energy electricity and heat via direct anaerobic treatment anaerobic digestion of excess sludge and combined heat and power chp previous studies have revealed that in practice relatively little chemical energy can be obtained from cod a mere 10 14 of the total theoretical chemical energy potential schwarzenbeck et al 2008 mccarty et al 2011 frijns et al 2013 based on these studies a large scale municipal wwtp in beijing was evaluated for both chemical and thermal energy recovery in order to potentially move towards carbon neutral operation hao et al 2015 it was found that only about 13 of the total theoretical chemical energy in the influent of this wwtp as similarly calculated by mccarty et al 2011 could be converted to electricity and heat while at the same time a large amount of thermal energy from the effluent could be utilized to meet the needs of the carbon neutral operation 1 the potential of chemical energy the theoretical chemical energy potential is often calculated from the total cod in the influent assuming it is fully extractable and completely convertible to methane ch4 and then with 100 efficiency into electrical and or thermal energy under these assumptions 1 g cod is stoichiometrically converted into 0 25 g ch4 the net enthalpy δfh of ch4 is 890 5 kj mol ch4 the chemical heat of cod can thus be calculated as 890 5 kj mol 16 g mol 0 25 g ch4 g cod 13 9 kj g cod in which 16 g mol is the molar mass of ch4 an influent cod of 400 mg l would give a theoretical maximal energy electrical equivalent of 13 9 kj g cod 400 g m3 3600 kj kw h 1 54 kw h m3 in practice however it is not possible to extract and convert the full theoretical potential of the chemical energy realistically chemical energy depends not only on the amount of biodegradable cod captured from wastewater but also on the conversion efficiency of chemical energy in the chp unit as well as heat consumption loss for sludge digestion the chemical energy potential has to be derived from detailed wwtps data based on a bnr wwtp an aao process q 600 000 m3 d hao et al 2015 only about 13 0 20 kw h m3 of the theoretical chemical energy 1 54 kw h m³ at cod 400 mg l in the influent of the evaluated wwtp can be converted to electricity and heat a figure that is similar to several other practical derived data 10 14 mentioned above schwarzenbeck et al 2008 mccarty et al 2011 frijns et

drinking water and the climate of the house roest et al 2010 frijns et al 2013 the heat is mostly conserved in sewers and wwtps liu et al 2010 there have been many commercial applications of thermal energy mainly based on direct utilization from raw wastewater cipolla and maglionico 2014 kretschmer et al 2016 this is problematic due to operational difficulties fouling corrosion as well as decreases in the temperature in the wwtp i e decreases in biological activity treated wastewater effluent is therefore the preferred place for heat recovery in northern china the effluent temperatures are 10 16 c in winter and 22 25 c in summer well above the temperature of the receiving water bodies applying wshp techniques is an effective means of recovering heat from the effluent of wwtps for heating or cooling purposes cipolla and maglionico 2014 the theoretical potential of thermal energy can be calculated as follows liu et al 2010 a m δt c 1 where a is the thermal energy kj generated by the heat exchangers wshp m is the mass kg of applied effluent δt is the temperature difference oc between the inlet and outlet of the wshp c is the specific thermal capacity of water 4 18 kj kg oc

was reported by mccarty et al 2011 in practice this thermal energy cannot be extracted fully owing to the limitations of wshp the achievable thermal energy capacity supplied by wshp can be calculated through the coefficient of performance cop the typical value of which is in the range of 3 5 mccarty et al 2011 meggers and leibundgut 2011 chao et al 2012 based on hao et al 2015 the net electrical

theoretical thermal energy in essence the amount of thermal energy that can be recovered is 6 8 times larger than the amount of chemical energy 3 energy balance towards the carbon neutral operation of wwtps the energy balance towards the carbon neutral operation of an evaluated full scale wwtp hao et al 2015 is shown in fig 1 compared to the total energy consumption of 0 37 kw h m³ of the wwtp the practically recovered chemical energy of 0 20 kw h m³ falls short of true carbon neutral operation and chemical energy recovery can only compensate for 53 2 of the total energy consumption a figure that is similar to values about 50 reported by schwarzenbeck et al 2008 mccarty et al 2011 and frijns et al 2013 currently energy neutrality often depends on co digestion of organic waste as in strass austria jank et al 2017 the energy deficit for carbon neutral operation could be compensated for indirectly by using a small amount of the potentially recoverable thermal energy equivalent 9 8 for heating and 14 7 for cooling 4 possibly applied routes of thermal energy since low grade thermal energy recovered from wastewater cannot be used for generating electricity direct application of this energy for heating cooling should be investigated there are several challenges and limitations in recovering thermal energy from effluent among these the distance limited to 3 5 km for supplying heat cold between sources and users is a key barrier much more so than technical limitations governmental subsidies or tax relief related to reducing ghg can also be an important driver in promoting thermal energy recovery in addition large scale applications of thermal energy require the involvement of different municipal authorities however in practice there are also already several applications of thermal energy from wastewater effluent based heating cooling existing or to be found around the world table 1 one potential use of recovered heat could be in agriculture and or horticulture nowadays modern agriculture and horticulture often involves greenhouses neugebauer et al 2015 keeping greenhouses warm requires a large amount of energy and the heat recovered from

funamizu et al 2001 there are many glass and or plastic greenhouses in the netherlands china and elsewhere and thus the heat recovery from effluent could be used profitably in many places alternatively other potential application routes of thermal energy could be heating biogas digesters neugebauer et al 2015 or drying dewatered sludge for direct incineration in power plants this could also be a more effective approach to recovering chemical energy phosphorus and preventing the disposal of excess sludge in summary carbon compounds cod in wastewater contain only a small fraction of the energy which could potentially be recovered in order to achieve carbon neutral operation in wwtps moreover cod has a relatively large exergy content which should if possible preserved for these

18669,the present review provides information on the main organochlorine pesticides ocps widely used in world agriculture in the 1940s 1960s the patterns of their distribution in the environment as well as the toxicity metabolism and degradation are described some data on ocps distribution in components of aquatic ecosystems in different regions of the world and particularly in the far eastern seas of russia the sea of japan east sea the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea is considered for the period 2000 2017 the obtained results are discussed keywords organochlorine pesticides hchs ddts marine ecosystems far eastern seas 1 introduction among persistent organic pollutants pops organochlorine compounds such as primarily organochlorine pesticides ocps metabolites of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane hch previously widely used in industry and agriculture across the world due to their high toxicity and resistance ocps are considered the most hazardous agents in terms of ubiquitous distribution and effects on biota the composition of a technological mixture of hch included various hch isomers with different cycle conformations α hch made up 55 70 β hch 5 14 γ hch 9 13 in addition preparations with a different composition containing 25 and 90 99 γ hch lindane as the active agent were also produced atsdr 2002a zulidov et al 2002 the technological preparation of ddt was based on dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane represented by two main isomers o p ddt and p p ddt which differ in the position of chlorine atoms in the benzene rings and by minor concentrations of other isomers atsdr 2002b tsydenova 2005 the leading criteria in assessing the behavior of ocps are their persistence stability in the environment cumulative properties and consequences in case of bioaccumulation ocps are accumulated up food chains and are capable of biomagnification which can result in serious negative impacts on organisms occupying the top of a trophic pyramid including humans currently the use of such compounds is prohibited in most countries of the northern hemisphere but they continue to be applied in southeast asia grung et al 2015 devi et al 2017 furthermore approximately 45 80 of ocps migrate to other regions of the planet wania and mackay 1996 breivik et al 2004 including the territory of the russian federation chuiko et al 2010 german et al 2010 ivanter and medvedev 2007 mamontova et al 2016 2014 rovinsky et al 1990 etc aquatic ecosystems frequently become the terminal link in the accumulation chain of these compounds the sources of ocp pollution of the marine environment can be leakage from storage sites surface runoff from catchment areas of waterbodies fall with precipitation as well as atmospheric circulation and transport by sea currents in marine ecosystems ocps are accumulated up a food chain and reach maximum values at the highest trophic levels the goal of the review is to summarize the results of recent research 2010 2017 on levels of ocps in marine organisms of various trophic levels in the sea of okhotsk the sea of japan east sea and the bering sea referred to as the the russian far eastern seas for assessing the position of the region in the distribution patterns of pops in the world ocean 2 patterns of ocp distribution in the environment after entering the biosphere pops become involved in various physical and chemical processes their resistance to photochemical chemical and biological decomposition in the atmosphere water phase and soil results in their long term circulation in the environment despite the considered group of pops is characterized by low vapor pressure values they show a noticeable ability to pass into the vapor gas phase i e evaporate into the atmospheric air for instance from the surface of soil water etc and circulate between different components of the environment rovinsky et al 1990 wania et al 1998 wania and mackay 1996 currently pops are distributed ubiquitously as evidenced by the facts of their detection in abiotic and biological samples from various sites of the globe the worldwide distribution of pops is confirmed also by their findings in arctic and antarctic regions geographically remote from the possible sources of emission of these compounds bidleman 1999 macdonald et al 2000 negoita et al 2003 van den brink 1997 the behavior in the environment and the distribution of ocps in various components of natural ecosystems are determined by their physical and chemical properties the extreme persistence of ocps cause them to distribute ubiquitously in the biosphere through the processes of dissolution sorption bioaccumulation and evaporation due to evaporation and wind erosion ocps from soil and waterbodies enter the atmosphere besides they can be involved in repeated evaporation condensation processes and transported over long distances from sources thus causing regional and global contamination of the biosphere the high values of octanol water partition coefficient kow and the low water solubility of the ddt group compounds and hch isomers contribute to the fact that while being in the environment these substances are easily bound by particles of soil bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter in water and air quemerais et al 1994 wu et al 1997 zeng et al 1999 adsorption on solid particles is an important factor for redistribution in the environment rovinsky et al 1990 in waterbodies ocps are sorbed by allochthonous and autochthonous particles and precipitate onto the bottom 3 metabolism and degradation of ocps the main mechanisms of degradation of ocps in the environment can be divided into abiotic photochemical reactions and biotic processes of metabolic decay involving living organisms the photochemical decomposition of ocps molecules of which contain aromatic groups and unsaturated chemical bonds occurs due to the absorption of solar energy in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum the rate of photochemical decay as well as the composition of the final products of this reaction depends on the environment where this process occurs studies showed that after a 48 h uv radiation exposure λ 254 nm approximately 80 of ddt is decomposed and the products detected include dde in the largest amounts ddd and ketones further experiments have shown that ddd is highly resistant to uv light and dde gradually breaks down into a number of compounds atsdr 2002b lindane γ hch is isomerized under uv light into α hch crosby 1983 tinsley 2004 in animals the degree of accumulation of ocps is determined by the ratio of three processes absorption excretion and biotransformation the general trend of metabolism consists in turning exogenous matter into a more polar compound with subsequent binding the resulting product with a highly polar fragment to facilitate its excretion in plants which lack excretory systems exogenous substances or their metabolites are usually conjugated with carbohydrates and deposited in parts that are not related with general metabolism in insects the set of hydrolases is smaller than in mammals therefore they cannot perform rapid neutralization and ocps can accumulate to lethal concentrations stoytcheva 2011 in aquatic organisms accumulation of ddt depends on the lipid content of organs thus the dependence of ddt accumulation can be arranged in the following sequence muscles liver fat many fish and wildlife species go through annual fasting and feeding cycles as a response to changes in their environment and this affects their tissue concentrations of lipophilic ocps tanabe subramanian 2006 tanabe 2007 hch is less persistent than ddt and is more easily subject to microbial degradation studies on model water bodies have shown tanabe and subramanian 2006 vrochinsky et al 1980 that the γ hch concentration in water decreases from 0 50 to 0 27 mg l within a day after introduction in silt increases from 0 to 0 34 mg kg in higher aquatic plants increases from 0 to 2 3 mg kg the accumulation coefficient of γ hch for sediments was 1 3 4 for aquatic plants from 8 to 67 as exemplified by the northwestern pacific ocean α isomer of hch dominates surface waters and zooplankton reaching 55 56 γ isomer amounts to 35 40 the proportion of β isomer is the lowest smaller than 10 tanabe et al 1984 in cephalopods the amount of β isomer is larger and constitutes approximately 20 in tissues of striped dolphin the proportions of the isomers is different β isomer dominates reaching 80 followed by α isomer 10 15 and the level of γ isomer is minimum tanabe et al 1984 the concentration and proportions of hch isomers in the components of the marine environment open and closed waterbodies and living organisms depend on many factors such as physical and chemical properties of water and sediments illumination species specific characteristics of biotransformation processes as well as on the duration of pesticide exposure in the environment the transition of the major part of ocps dissolved in river water into the suspended form occurs in ecosystems of river deltas and estuaries at the river sea interface where the water salinity sharply increases with increasing salinity the solubility of ocps in water reduces and they pass into suspension israel and tsyban 2009 the increased ocp content of organs of riverine and estuarine species compared to that of marine species is associated with this process tanabe 2007 the effects of the above mentioned and many other factors lead to the accumulation of the most stable β form of hch in organisms over time and up food chains tanabe et al 1984 the ratio of concentrations of α and γ isomers of hch is used to estimate the period since the entry of pesticides into the ecosystem a high value of the ratio greater than unity indicates a long presence of hchs in the environment a value below unity i e the dominance of γ isomer is the evidence of fresh influx rovinsky et al 1990 ddt exists in the form of the main product and its metabolites ddd and dde the lifetime of ddt in objects is assessed as the ratio of the concentration of ddt to that of dde a product of its degradation high values of the ddt dde ratio show a recent entry of ddt into the environment a low value means that it has long been in the system and is gradually turning into dde thus concentrations and proportions of isomers and derivatives of ocps in the ecosystem are constantly changing and depend on the physical and chemical properties of water and sediments as well as on the duration of pesticides exposure in the environment 4 toxicity of ocps by the middle of the 20th century the hazard of organochlorine compounds to terrestrial and aquatic organisms was most fully disclosed the danger that insecticides pose to fish and aquatic invertebrates became apparent due to the studies conducted in the 1940s 1950s in the 1960s it was found that the acute toxic effect of these chemicals on the most sensitive aquatic organisms is manifested in a concentration range from 10 3 to 10 12 g l braginsky et al 1980 such a high sensitivity to low concentrations is explained on one hand by the extreme toxicity of these substances and on the other hand by the specific pattern of their impact on vital functions they easily affect any members of arthropods in particular crustaceans that make up the major part of marine and freshwater zooplankton mortality of aquatic organisms of common species reduces the self purification capacity of an ecosystem as the life activity of bacteria algae crustaceans mollusks and other species provides transformation of organic matter in a waterbody ocps can suppress the endocrine system in aquatic animals especially during critical periods of their lifecycle tanabe 2007 by penetrating through the environment or up a food chain ocps can affect the immune system of birds and mammals cause deviations in sex characteristics of some individuals thus changing the sex structure of populations it has been found that most animals containing high concentrations of ocps suffer from tumors tanabe subramanian 2006 according to the report environmental canada 1996 ocps pose a threat to living organisms at three levels genetic population and ecosystem their negative impact on the hormonal and enzyme systems of terrestrial and aquatic species leads to genetic dysfunctions and reduced survivability of individuals by performing an ecotoxicological assessment of the impact of these compounds on marine mammals colborn and smolen 1996 identified 65 epidemiological disturbances including endocrine suppression immunological and reproductive dysfunction neoplasms and population reduction measures to control of environmental pollution require certain sanitary and hygienic standards of permissible levels of harmful chemicals in the air water soil and food their regulation is based on determining the minimum values of pollutants concentrations safe for the human health and the environment the safe levels of ocp content of air water soil and cattle feed are provided in many studies and regulations rovinsky et al 1990 tanabe 2007 etc in russia the hygienic standards of seafood safety for humans and the requirements for manufacturing importing and marketing food products to comply with these standards sanpin 2 3 2 1078 01 2001 establish the highest concentrations of hch and ddt for fish liver as follows 1 0 and 3 0 mg kg wet weight respectively 5 ocps in marine organisms of the far eastern seas 2000 2017 studies of organochlorine compounds in marine ecosystems of the far eastern seas of russia have been carried out fragmentally some data on ocp levels in the sea of japan east sea are provided in the works of a v tkalin with co authors tkalin et al 1997 2000 a more detailed monitoring of ocps in the sea of japan east sea is reported in the works of m d boyarova and o n lukyanova with co authors boyarova 2008 boyarova et al 2004 boyarova and lukyanova 2012 2006 lukyanova 2013 lukyanova et al 2012 2007 recent data on ocp concentrations in ecosystems of the bering sea and the sea of okhotsk are presented in our works lukyanova et al 2018 2016 2015 2014 tsygankov 2016 2012 tsygankov et al 2018 2017 2016a 2016b 2015 2014b 2014a fig 1 for the bering sea accumulation biotransformation and transport of ocps have recently been studied in pacific salmon and marine mammals for the sea of okhotsk in seabirds and pacific salmon table 1 for the sea of japan east sea in mollusks and fish table 2 in the sea of japan east sea mollusks and fish were sampled in some parts of peter the great bay in posyet amur and ussuri bays samples of mammals gray whale and pacific walrus were collected in mechigmen bay off the village of lorino pacific salmon sockeye oncorhynchus nerka and chinook o tshawytscha in the southwestern bering sea off the commander islands and eastern kamchatka furthermore pacific salmon pink o gorbuscha chum o keta sockeye o nerka and chinook o tshawytscha and seabirds fulmar fulmarus glacialis crested auklet aethia cristatella least auklet aethia pusilla slaty backed gull larus schistisagus and fork tailed storm petrel oceanodroma furcata were collected during the tinro center expeditions in the sea of okhotsk off the western coast of the kamchatka peninsula along the western part of the kuril islands in coastal waters and around hokkaido island 5 1 mollusks from the sea of japan east sea organochlorine compounds are well accumulated by filter feeders such as bivalves and therefore these organisms are successfully and widely used as bioindicators for monitoring ocps in natural waters the total ocp content of mussels from different parts of peter the great bay particularly from waters off the city of vladivostok has increased almost 10 times in 2000s years according to tkalin with co authors tkalin et al 1997 in 1996 the total ocp content of soft tissues in the mussel crenomytilus grayanus from amur and ussuri bays amounted to approximately 4 5 ng g wet weight according to our data the total ocp content of the mussels from amur bay in 2004 was 50 0 ng g wet weight from ussuri bay 20 0 ng g wet weight in 1998 the concentration of ocps in soft tissues of the mussels collected in the coastal waters off reineke island did not exceed 0 8 ng g wet weight tkalin et al 2000 in 2004 the level reached 25 8 ng g wet weight the increase in the total ocp content of the mussels both from the inner parts of amur and ussuri bays and from the water off reineke island which is considered a conditionally background area can be an evidence of the continuing economic activity in the south of primorsky krai a high total ocp content 616 ng g wet weight with the absolute predominance of ddt and its metabolites 450 ng g wet weight was found in mussels from posyet bay that may be associated with the influence of the tumen river discharging large amounts of various contaminants into the sea the ocp concentration in the mussels from posyet bay was significantly higher than in those from amur and ussuri bays thus the transboundary transport of pollutants is of great significance in coastal waters of primorsky krai boyarova and lukyanova 2006 currently hch and ddt are still detected in mollusks from different regions of the world ocean the results of our research table 2 fig 2 indicate a lower ocp contamination of peter the great bay compared to that of the coastal zone in the apr countries an analysis of the ratio of ddt and its metabolites and isomers of hch in mollusks organs has shown that in the mussels from posyet bay exposed to the transboundary transport of pollutants the ddt group is dominant as in animals from other coastal zones of asian countries at the same time the total amount of hch isomers in the mussels from peter the great bay was much greater than that in mollusks from other countries tanabe 2000 this may reflect the lower use of lindane in agriculture of asian countries the obtained values of maximum ocp concentrations in the mussels from peter the great bay are relatively low compared to the acute toxicity and ld50 values for humans which constitute 250 400 mg kg body weight ben dyke et al 1970 for ddt and its metabolites and 300 500 mg kg body weight for hch aks et al 1995 in the framework of the asia pacific mussel watch apmw program monitoring the pollution of the marine environment tanabe 2000 based on mussels and oysters as bioindicators was carried out during the period of 1997 2000 ocps were found in all mussel samples from the countries participating in the program cambodia china hong kong india indonesia japan korea malaysia philippines the far east of russia singapore and vietnam tanabe subramanian 2006 significant residual concentrations of ddt and α hch were detected in many samples the total concentrations of hch and ddt isomers and metabolites in soft tissues of mussels from waters of developing countries of asia were higher than in the samples from developed countries for instance the maximum hch content of the mussel perna viridis was 430 ng g lipid weight in india and 20 ng g lipid weight in the republic of korea and japan maximum concentrations of ddt were recorded from hong kong 61000 ng g lipid weight and china 34000 ng g lipid weight whereas in japan they reached only 100 ng g lipid weight in mussels of the genus mytilus the level of ddt in china amounted to 29000 ng g lipid weight monirith et al 2003 in hong kong 8000 ng g lipid weight on the pacific coast of russia 900 ng g lipid weight in india japan korea vietnam singapore malaysia indonesia and cambodia less than 800 ng g lipid weight minh et al 2002 hch in mussels from the above countries did not exceed 120 ng g lipid weight india tanabe 2007 5 2 fish from the sea of japan east sea the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea fish as a link of food chain accumulate persistent organic pollutants in their organs and tissues as a result of the biomagnification process fish are distributed worldwide and in most cases reflect ocp levels in the environment when ocps were studied in muscles of fish from coastal marine waters of primorsky krai the saffron cod caught in posyet bay showed the maximum total concentrations 638 ng g wet weight in muscles of the yellowfin goby from the same bay the amount of ocps was also high and reached 264 ng g wet weight in muscles of the flathead grey mullet from sivuchya cove the pesticide concentration was 88 ng g wet weight in all three species of fish caught in coastal waters of southwestern primorsky krai total ocps were dominated by ddt and its metabolites as in mussels from posyet bay several flounder species were also sampled from most of the study areas sivuchya cove posyet bay amur bay and ussuri bay the maximum ocp concentration 150 ng g wet weight was recorded from muscles of the flounders caught in amur bay in contrast to fish from southern primorsky krai in the flounders of amur bay total hch isomers were dominant 106 9 ng g wet weight and the main γ isomer accounted for 74 in all the fish liver samples from peter the great bay almost all hch isomers and ddt and its metabolites were detected the maximum ocp concentrations were found in the liver of the far eastern smooth flounder from amur bay 379 736 ng g wet weight pacific herring is a commercially valuable target species determination of toxicants in this fish is of particular interest with regards to its safety for human health the total ocp content of meat of the pacific herring caught in peter the great bay was 2 5 ng g wet weight which is by two orders of magnitude lower than in herring from the baltic sea roots 2004 in general the total content of organochlorine pesticides in fish from peter the great bay fits into the range of levels of these substances currently reported for fish from other regions of the world ocean in 2008 ocp content was measured in organs of pacific redfin tribolodon brandtii from the estuaries of the razdolnaya and artemovka rivers the total maximum ocp concentrations with an average of 1700 ng g wet weight were detected in the liver of the redfin from the razdolnaya river estuary in the fish from the artemovka river estuary the total ocp averaged at ca 1000 ng g wet weight in the fish meat the total ocp is much lower than in the liver and does not exceed the standards of sanitary regulations and norms sanpin 2 3 2 1078 01 2001 200 mg kg wet weight in muscles of the fish from the razdolnaya river it constitutes an average of 70 ng g wet weight in the fish from the artemovka 57 ng g wet weight the main pollutants are ddt and dde when comparing the ocp content of organs between estuarine fish species redfin and marine ones far eastern smooth flounder from ussuri and amur bays it can be noted that estuarine fish accumulate ocp to a much greater extent than marine fish which agrees with the known pattern of accumulation and sedimentation of ocps at the boundary of mixing sea and fresh waters the mean ocps content table 1 fig 3 of the pink o gorbuscha chum o keta sockeye o nerka and chinook salmon o tshawytscha from the sea of okhotsk made up 141 5 125 5 1298 and 3177 9 ng g lipid weight respectively a comparison of the total amount of ocps in muscles and liver of all four fish species from the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea did not show any significant difference in mean values between pink and chum salmon but in these species they were significantly lower p 0 05 than in chinook salmon which in turn also had lower values than in sockeye salmon the concentration increases in the following sequence chum pink chinook sockeye the ranges of total ocp concentration e g in muscles were as follows 78 8 174 1 89 3 222 8 265 0 2435 4 and 165 7 3020 1 ng g lipid weight respectively lukyanova et al 2015 2016 tsygankov et al 2016b 2017 a comparison of soft tissues between chum and pink salmon showed significantly p 0 05 larger amounts of pesticides in chum which can be explained both by the greater weight and fat content of this species and by the longer marine life history of its individuals pink salmon has an annual lifecycle and returns to spawn in the following year after the downstream migration of smolts into the sea whereas chum salmon can feed during two to five years the mean body weight of the examined chum salmon was 1863 g the mean weight of pink salmon 1130 g as fish grows and gains weight various pollutants are accumulated in organs along with the build up of lipid reserves the studied pink and chum salmon were collected in waters of the southern kuril islands in early summer during the completion of the spawning migration when organs begin to spend lipid before spawning salmon spend up to 80 of their reserve lipid in this case the specific concentration of toxicant per 1 g lipid increases and can reach values hazardous to the health of fish brett 1995 samples of sockeye and chinook salmon were collected in the western bering sea and in the sea of okhotsk in autumn in october and november when fish feed at sea where they can stay for several years during this time the concentration of toxicants in their organs continuously increases not only in the metabolically active liver but also in muscles thus chinook salmon accumulates 99 of all toxicants during the marine life history phase cullon et al 2009 the mean ocp concentrations in the bering flounder hippoglossoides robustus from the eastern and southern areas of the sea were 99 8 125 4 and 53 6 40 5 ng g lipid weight respectively lukyanova et al 2018 when comparing the ddt and hch concentrations with data for flounder from other regions of the world ocean it should be noted that the concentrations in flounder from the sea of okhotsk were significantly lower than those in flounder from the european coast of the atlantic ocean ferreira et al 2005 de boer et al 2001 and from the american coast of the pacific lefkovitz et al 2001 in these studies flounder were collected mainly in estuarine zones where the level of pollution is high in the authors study flounder were collected in waters of the sea of okhotsk where the influence of coastal pollution sources is absent therefore the obtained data can be considered background for the sea of okhotsk and the entire north pacific among ddt metabolites dde was found to be dominant in muscles of flounder from the sea of okhotsk significant differences have also been noted for hchs hchs are at a low level and often not detected in atlantic fish muscles β hch was found in muscles of all the flounder from the sea of okhotsk which confirms the existence of this pesticide in the sea of okhotsk ecosystem for a long time the total ocps concentration in muscles of salmon and flounder does not exceed sanitary standards of the russian federation which according to sanitary rules and norms sanpin 2 3 2 1078 01 2001 are 200 ng g wet weight for fish the content of pollutants depends on many factors one of which is migration japanese researchers have conducted a number of studies on migratory diaphus theta and ceratoscopelus warmingi and non migratory stenobrachius nannochir and lampanyctus regalis species and come to a conclusion that ocp concentrations in the former up to 180 ng g lipid weight are lower than those in the latter up to 310 ng g lipid weight takahashi et al 2000 tanabe subramanian 2006 tanabe 2007 ueno et al 2003 used skipjack tuna for monitoring coastal waters of japan taiwan island philippines indonesia the seychelles islands brazil and india the maximum ocp content was detected in fish caught in the coastal waters of china 700 ng g lipid weight kajiwara et al 2003 measured concentrations of ocps in five sturgeon species beluga huso huso russian sturgeon acipenser gueldenstaedtii stellate sturgeon acipenser stellatus persian sturgeon acipenser persicus and ship sturgeon acipenser nudiventris from the caspian sea which is the world s largest inland body of water bounded by the territories of russia azerbaijan kazakhstan turkmenistan and iran the maximum contents were recorded from beluga 17700 ng g lipid weight and russian sturgeon 3050 ng g lipid weight pacific salmon are among the most abundant commercial fish the level of organochlorine pollutants in them is distributed in such a way that the high fat species chinook and sockeye salmon contain higher concentrations than the low fat species chum and pink salmon for instance ocps in chinook salmon from the salish sea washington amount to 2420 ng g lipid weight good et al 2014 in sockeye salmon from alaska 1911 ng g lipid weight apeti et al 2013 in chum and pink salmon from alaska 243 and 80 ng g lipid weight respectively gerlach 2013 5 3 biotransport of ocps by pacific salmon the number of salmon migrating to the russian coast varies from year to year but the species structure of the runs keeps stable pink salmon accounts for 60 65 chum 20 25 sockeye 10 12 coho and chinook salmon constitute a small fraction chum and pink salmon form the major part of runs in eastern kamchatka eastern sakhalin the mainland coast of the sea of okhotsk and in the amur river basin shuntov and temnykh 2011 2008 in the even numbered year 2008 the total catch amounted to 258000 t in the record breaking odd numbered year 2009 542000 t in 2010 324000 t the number of fish that reached spawning grounds in certain regions of the far east in 2008 2010 is published in the annual report of the north pacific anadromous fish commission npafc it is the fish that remain at their grounds after spawning and serve as a food supply for many organisms thus connecting the marine and terrestrial food chains or in other words transferring organic matter from the ocean to the land the distribution of salmonids in the ocean mostly follows the location of the water masses characterized by the optimal temperatures from 2 to 4 up to 15 20 c however the migration processes depend on numerous factors such as the season climatic status of the year biological and physiological status of the fish their age presence of food objects et al the presence of the pollutants in the fish body and their concentration may also have a pronounced effect on the spawning behavior and spawning success lukyanova et al 2015 the salmons dominate in the water layer of 0 50 m in the northern pacific ocean the atmospheric precipitation and suspended matter with pollutants also concentrate exactly in this layer the southern margin of the geographic range of salmon 38 40 n adjoins the area of the pacific garbage patch or the pacific trash vortex 35 42 n located between 140 e and 160 w this area carries tons of plastic and other garbage that was transported by the pacific current system the photodecomposition of the plastic is accompanied by the income of the organochlorine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as estrogen like compounds that absorb at the suspended matter and then may be ingested and accumulated by salmonids moore et al 2001 derraik 2002 choy and drazen 2013 the concentration of ocps as an averaged sum of hch dde for males and females was 68 85 ng g wet weight in whole pink salmon and 182 5 ng g wet weight in chum salmon the mean weight of one specimen of pink salmon is 1 3 kg one spawning chum salmon 3 5 kg calculations show that one pink salmon contains up to 90 μg studied pesticides and one chum does up to 640 μg lukyanova et al 2014 thus the total amount of ocps transported e g in 2009 to eastern kamchatka by these two salmon species only constitutes 10 4 kg to the amur river basin more than 13 kg to the mainland coast of the sea of okhotsk 8 1 kg lukyanova et al 2015 in 2008 the influx of studied pesticides with salmon to various regions of the pacific coast of russia ranged from 520 g to 4 kg in 2009 from 470 g to 13 kg in 2010 from 350 g to 7 75 kg within three years the amur basin received the largest amount of pesticides approximately 23 kg the high runs of salmon in recent years provided from 13 to 30 kg ocps transferred to land annually thus the total pesticide content at each spawning ground increases 5 4 seabirds of the sea of okhotsk seabirds can be both intermediate and terminal links in a trophic chain by feeding on living organisms they accumulate toxic pollutants in their organs in the process of biomagnification the mean pesticide content of the northern fulmar fulmarus glacialis crested auklet aethia cristatella pacific gull larus schistisagus grey petrel oceanodroma furcata and auklet crumb aethia pusilla amounted to 5206 8460 4542 2417 and 2804 ng g lipid weight respectively tsygankov et al 2014b 2016a 2017 feeding habits migratory behavior and bird life strategy define peculiarities in the pesticide accumulation the considered seabirds are abundant in subarctic areas of the northern part of the atlantic and the pacific oceans transoceanic migrations are not typical for these species shuntov 1998 the studied bird species from the sea of okhotsk have different sizes and consequently differ in the amount of subcutaneous fat in organs and tissue as ocps are known to concentrate mainly in the subcutaneous fat bigger birds show higher ocp content values table 1 fig 3 pacific gull with its mean body size of 64 cm and fulmar 47 cm contain similar concentrations of ocps in feathers with skin 5962 and 5949 ng g lipid weight respectively in grey petrel which is much smaller 22 cm than the bird species above the pesticide content was 3128 ng g lipid weight accumulation and distribution of pesticides in bird organs can be additionally controlled by other factors also thus in crested auklet having body size of 26 cm the ocp content of feathers with skin made up 15604 ng g lipid weight to identify the causes of the high ocp concentrations in this species further research is required tsygankov et al 2016a 2017 diet of birds is also an important factor in the accumulation of ocps the mean pesticide content of internal organs in birds indicates their different diet spectra the food of fulmar includes organisms characterized by a high coefficient of ocp accumulation fish fish eggs mollusks crustaceans and other invertebrates carrion whale entrails various fatty waste etc resulting in a high pesticide content of its internal organs 5874 ng g lipid weight crested auklet auklet crumb and grey petrel feed on small sized crustaceans marine invertebrates amphipods etc which accumulate pesticides to a lesser degree than the items of fulmar s diet consequently the ocp content of the internal organs in these birds is lower 1730 2804 and 1705 ng g lipid weight respectively ocp content of their organs and tissues also depends on type of feeding and migration patterns thus glaucous gull from the barents sea feeding on fish carrion and eggs of other birds contains 216157 ng g lipid weight in its organism knudsen et al 2007 great skua iceland whose diet consists mainly of fish robbed from other seabirds accumulates pollutants to a level of 55600 ng g lipid weight jorundsdottiro et al 2010 birds of the baffin sea arctic ocean accumulate smaller amounts of ocps due to their remoteness from the potential sources of pollution contaminant patterns in the arctic vary also according to patterns of long range transport for instance northern fulmar feeding on crustaceans fish squid plankton and by chance carrion contains toxicants at a level of 4934 ng g lipid weight black legged kittiwake whose diet is similar to that of fulmar 1323 ng g lipid weight buckman et al 2004 5 5 marine mammals of the bering sea all ocps are highly lipophilic compounds and fat deposits in the subcutaneous layer of marine mammals serve as a storage site for them mammals compared to most other marine organisms live longer and are therefore subject to long term exposure to xenobiotics marine mammals can be considered important species for monitoring long term manifestations of ocps in the marine environment and for this reason used as indicators of global pollution because many of them migrate to large distances and are unlikely to indicate local pollution tanabe subramanian 2006 tanabe 2007 in the organs of gray whale eschrichtius robustus the lipid content ranged from 1 to 4 in muscles and up to 8 in the liver in the organs of pacific walrus odobenus rosmarus divergens the lipid content ranged from 1 to 6 in muscles and up to 10 in the liver tsygankov et al 2015 calculations showed table 1 fig 3 that total ocps in gray whale s fat averaged at 6290 ng g lipid weight in pacific walrus at 26300 ng g lipid weight tsygankov et al 2014a 2017 the different levels of pesticide accumulation in gray whale and pacific walrus from the bering sea indicate mainly the different degrees of contamination of their habitats by these pollutants besides whales have very poor ability to biotransform pollutants whereas seal have a better ability of great importance is also the degree of puberty of individuals the species studied by us have similar habitats the fat content of the organs does not vary significantly between them keeping within 8 10 and the substantial differences in pesticide level may be associated with a reproductive cycle stage or feeding habits the food of gray whales mainly include bottom crustaceans and other small sized benthic organisms inhabiting the surface and deeper layers of soft sediments infauna burdin et al 2009 swartz 2018 the major part of walrus diet is comprised of benthic invertebrates bivalves some shrimp species lobsters polychaete worms and priapulids octopuses and holothurians as well as some fish species furthermore walruses can sometimes prey on seals there are documented cases of their attacks on ringed seals and harp seal pups burdin et al 2009 lydersen 2018 the species comprising the diet of walrus accumulate more pesticides in their body than the items of gray whale s food since the coefficients of accumulation of pollutants for mollusks and fishes are higher than those for crustaceans based on this fact we can conclude that the dietary factor is determinative for the differences in bioaccumulation of pesticides between whales and walruses tsygankov et al 2015 2017 marine mammals have a long lifecycle and high concentrations of pesticides are found in their organs however levels of pollutants in females and males differ substantially in general ocp concentrations are comparable in immature males and females and increase before puberty subsequently the concentration in males continues to increase while in females it reaches a plateau or slightly decreases tanabe subramanian 2006 higher ocp concentrations in female dall s porpoises were recorded in the cases of the absence of ovulation 120000 ng g lipid weight compared to animals with a normal reproductive cycle 3000 ng g lipid weight kajiwara et al 2002 in addition to the age related tendency dietary habits are also of great importance in the accumulation of ocps by marine mammals fish eaters generally accumulate them to higher concentrations than animals that feed on crustaceans tanabe subramanian 2006 tsygankov et al 2014a thus in finless porpoise feeding mostly on crustaceans and cephalopods the ocp content amounted to 48000 ng g lipid weight park et al 2010 in killer whale from canada and usa a predator characterized by a wide diet spectrum fish pinnipeds etc the concentration of ocps was 161300 ng g lipid weight krahn et al 2007 in spotted seal preying mainly on fish the level of toxicants reached 381400 ng g lipid weight trukhin and boyarova 2013 6 conclusions this work is a stage of the research on ocp accumulation by members of various links of the food chain such as mollusks fish seabirds and marine mammals in the far eastern seas of russia in marine organisms collected from the sea of japan east sea the bering sea and the sea of okhotsk organochlorine pesticides have been detected in all the studied samples the presence of organochlorine pesticides ocps in the environment and their accumulation up food chains poses a serious threat to the health of organisms on the highest trophic levels which are frequently predatory animals and birds when studying representatives of different links of the food chain of marine organisms in the far eastern seas it can be noted that ocps are most actively accumulated in marine mammals and birds occupying the top of the trophic pyramid the results of mollusks fish seabirds and marine mammals research indicate a lower ocps contamination of peter the great bay the sea of japan east sea the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea compared to that of the coastal zone of countries in the asia pacific region the data about ocps concentration in mollusks and flounder can be considered background for the far eastern seas of russia and the entire north pacific acknowledgment this work was supported by the russian science foundation agreement no 18 14 00120 
18669,the present review provides information on the main organochlorine pesticides ocps widely used in world agriculture in the 1940s 1960s the patterns of their distribution in the environment as well as the toxicity metabolism and degradation are described some data on ocps distribution in components of aquatic ecosystems in different regions of the world and particularly in the far eastern seas of russia the sea of japan east sea the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea is considered for the period 2000 2017 the obtained results are discussed keywords organochlorine pesticides hchs ddts marine ecosystems far eastern seas 1 introduction among persistent organic pollutants pops organochlorine compounds such as primarily organochlorine pesticides ocps metabolites of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane hch previously widely used in industry and agriculture across the world due to their high toxicity and resistance ocps are considered the most hazardous agents in terms of ubiquitous distribution and effects on biota the composition of a technological mixture of hch included various hch isomers with different cycle conformations α hch made up 55 70 β hch 5 14 γ hch 9 13 in addition preparations with a different composition containing 25 and 90 99 γ hch lindane as the active agent were also produced atsdr 2002a zulidov et al 2002 the technological preparation of ddt was based on dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane represented by two main isomers o p ddt and p p ddt which differ in the position of chlorine atoms in the benzene rings and by minor concentrations of other isomers atsdr 2002b tsydenova 2005 the leading criteria in assessing the behavior of ocps are their persistence stability in the environment cumulative properties and consequences in case of bioaccumulation ocps are accumulated up food chains and are capable of biomagnification which can result in serious negative impacts on organisms occupying the top of a trophic pyramid including humans currently the use of such compounds is prohibited in most countries of the northern hemisphere but they continue to be applied in southeast asia grung et al 2015 devi et al 2017 furthermore approximately 45 80 of ocps migrate to other regions of the planet wania and mackay 1996 breivik et al 2004 including the territory of the russian federation chuiko et al 2010 german et al 2010 ivanter and medvedev 2007 mamontova et al 2016 2014 rovinsky et al 1990 etc aquatic ecosystems frequently become the terminal link in the accumulation chain of these compounds the sources of ocp pollution of the marine environment can be leakage from storage sites surface runoff from catchment areas of waterbodies fall with precipitation as well as atmospheric circulation and transport by sea currents in marine ecosystems ocps are accumulated up a food chain and reach maximum values at the highest trophic levels the goal of the review is to summarize the results of recent research 2010 2017 on levels of ocps in marine organisms of various trophic levels in the sea of okhotsk the sea of japan east sea and the bering sea referred to as the the russian far eastern seas for assessing the position of the region in the distribution patterns of pops in the world ocean 2 patterns of ocp distribution in the environment after entering the biosphere pops become involved in various physical and chemical processes their resistance to photochemical chemical and biological decomposition in the atmosphere water phase and soil results in their long term circulation in the environment despite the considered group of pops is characterized by low vapor pressure values they show a noticeable ability to pass into the vapor gas phase i e evaporate into the atmospheric air for instance from the surface of soil water etc and circulate between different components of the environment rovinsky et al 1990 wania et al 1998 wania and mackay 1996 currently pops are distributed ubiquitously as evidenced by the facts of their detection in abiotic and biological samples from various sites of the globe the worldwide distribution of pops is confirmed also by their findings in arctic and antarctic regions geographically remote from the possible sources of emission of these compounds bidleman 1999 macdonald et al 2000 negoita et al 2003 van den brink 1997 the behavior in the environment and the distribution of ocps in various components of natural ecosystems are determined by their physical and chemical properties the extreme persistence of ocps cause them to distribute ubiquitously in the biosphere through the processes of dissolution sorption bioaccumulation and evaporation due to evaporation and wind erosion ocps from soil and waterbodies enter the atmosphere besides they can be involved in repeated evaporation condensation processes and transported over long distances from sources thus causing regional and global contamination of the biosphere the high values of octanol water partition coefficient kow and the low water solubility of the ddt group compounds and hch isomers contribute to the fact that while being in the environment these substances are easily bound by particles of soil bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter in water and air quemerais et al 1994 wu et al 1997 zeng et al 1999 adsorption on solid particles is an important factor for redistribution in the environment rovinsky et al 1990 in waterbodies ocps are sorbed by allochthonous and autochthonous particles and precipitate onto the bottom 3 metabolism and degradation of ocps the main mechanisms of degradation of ocps in the environment can be divided into abiotic photochemical reactions and biotic processes of metabolic decay involving living organisms the photochemical decomposition of ocps molecules of which contain aromatic groups and unsaturated chemical bonds occurs due to the absorption of solar energy in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum the rate of photochemical decay as well as the composition of the final products of this reaction depends on the environment where this process occurs studies showed that after a 48 h uv radiation exposure λ 254 nm approximately 80 of ddt is decomposed and the products detected include dde in the largest amounts ddd and ketones further experiments have shown that ddd is highly resistant to uv light and dde gradually breaks down into a number of compounds atsdr 2002b lindane γ hch is isomerized under uv light into α hch crosby 1983 tinsley 2004 in animals the degree of accumulation of ocps is determined by the ratio of three processes absorption excretion and biotransformation the general trend of metabolism consists in turning exogenous matter into a more polar compound with subsequent binding the resulting product with a highly polar fragment to facilitate its excretion in plants which lack excretory systems exogenous substances or their metabolites are usually conjugated with carbohydrates and deposited in parts that are not related with general metabolism in insects the set of hydrolases is smaller than in mammals therefore they cannot perform rapid neutralization and ocps can accumulate to lethal concentrations stoytcheva 2011 in aquatic organisms accumulation of ddt depends on the lipid content of organs thus the dependence of ddt accumulation can be arranged in the following sequence muscles liver fat many fish and wildlife species go through annual fasting and feeding cycles as a response to changes in their environment and this affects their tissue concentrations of lipophilic ocps tanabe subramanian 2006 tanabe 2007 hch is less persistent than ddt and is more easily subject to microbial degradation studies on model water bodies have shown tanabe and subramanian 2006 vrochinsky et al 1980 that the γ hch concentration in water decreases from 0 50 to 0 27 mg l within a day after introduction in silt increases from 0 to 0 34 mg kg in higher aquatic plants increases from 0 to 2 3 mg kg the accumulation coefficient of γ hch for sediments was 1 3 4 for aquatic plants from 8 to 67 as exemplified by the northwestern pacific ocean α isomer of hch dominates surface waters and zooplankton reaching 55 56 γ isomer amounts to 35 40 the proportion of β isomer is the lowest smaller than 10 tanabe et al 1984 in cephalopods the amount of β isomer is larger and constitutes approximately 20 in tissues of striped dolphin the proportions of the isomers is different β isomer dominates reaching 80 followed by α isomer 10 15 and the level of γ isomer is minimum tanabe et al 1984 the concentration and proportions of hch isomers in the components of the marine environment open and closed waterbodies and living organisms depend on many factors such as physical and chemical properties of water and sediments illumination species specific characteristics of biotransformation processes as well as on the duration of pesticide exposure in the environment the transition of the major part of ocps dissolved in river water into the suspended form occurs in ecosystems of river deltas and estuaries at the river sea interface where the water salinity sharply increases with increasing salinity the solubility of ocps in water reduces and they pass into suspension israel and tsyban 2009 the increased ocp content of organs of riverine and estuarine species compared to that of marine species is associated with this process tanabe 2007 the effects of the above mentioned and many other factors lead to the accumulation of the most stable β form of hch in organisms over time and up food chains tanabe et al 1984 the ratio of concentrations of α and γ isomers of hch is used to estimate the period since the entry of pesticides into the ecosystem a high value of the ratio greater than unity indicates a long presence of hchs in the environment a value below unity i e the dominance of γ isomer is the evidence of fresh influx rovinsky et al 1990 ddt exists in the form of the main product and its metabolites ddd and dde the lifetime of ddt in objects is assessed as the ratio of the concentration of ddt to that of dde a product of its degradation high values of the ddt dde ratio show a recent entry of ddt into the environment a low value means that it has long been in the system and is gradually turning into dde thus concentrations and proportions of isomers and derivatives of ocps in the ecosystem are constantly changing and depend on the physical and chemical properties of water and sediments as well as on the duration of pesticides exposure in the environment 4 toxicity of ocps by the middle of the 20th century the hazard of organochlorine compounds to terrestrial and aquatic organisms was most fully disclosed the danger that insecticides pose to fish and aquatic invertebrates became apparent due to the studies conducted in the 1940s 1950s in the 1960s it was found that the acute toxic effect of these chemicals on the most sensitive aquatic organisms is manifested in a concentration range from 10 3 to 10 12 g l braginsky et al 1980 such a high sensitivity to low concentrations is explained on one hand by the extreme toxicity of these substances and on the other hand by the specific pattern of their impact on vital functions they easily affect any members of arthropods in particular crustaceans that make up the major part of marine and freshwater zooplankton mortality of aquatic organisms of common species reduces the self purification capacity of an ecosystem as the life activity of bacteria algae crustaceans mollusks and other species provides transformation of organic matter in a waterbody ocps can suppress the endocrine system in aquatic animals especially during critical periods of their lifecycle tanabe 2007 by penetrating through the environment or up a food chain ocps can affect the immune system of birds and mammals cause deviations in sex characteristics of some individuals thus changing the sex structure of populations it has been found that most animals containing high concentrations of ocps suffer from tumors tanabe subramanian 2006 according to the report environmental canada 1996 ocps pose a threat to living organisms at three levels genetic population and ecosystem their negative impact on the hormonal and enzyme systems of terrestrial and aquatic species leads to genetic dysfunctions and reduced survivability of individuals by performing an ecotoxicological assessment of the impact of these compounds on marine mammals colborn and smolen 1996 identified 65 epidemiological disturbances including endocrine suppression immunological and reproductive dysfunction neoplasms and population reduction measures to control of environmental pollution require certain sanitary and hygienic standards of permissible levels of harmful chemicals in the air water soil and food their regulation is based on determining the minimum values of pollutants concentrations safe for the human health and the environment the safe levels of ocp content of air water soil and cattle feed are provided in many studies and regulations rovinsky et al 1990 tanabe 2007 etc in russia the hygienic standards of seafood safety for humans and the requirements for manufacturing importing and marketing food products to comply with these standards sanpin 2 3 2 1078 01 2001 establish the highest concentrations of hch and ddt for fish liver as follows 1 0 and 3 0 mg kg wet weight respectively 5 ocps in marine organisms of the far eastern seas 2000 2017 studies of organochlorine compounds in marine ecosystems of the far eastern seas of russia have been carried out fragmentally some data on ocp levels in the sea of japan east sea are provided in the works of a v tkalin with co authors tkalin et al 1997 2000 a more detailed monitoring of ocps in the sea of japan east sea is reported in the works of m d boyarova and o n lukyanova with co authors boyarova 2008 boyarova et al 2004 boyarova and lukyanova 2012 2006 lukyanova 2013 lukyanova et al 2012 2007 recent data on ocp concentrations in ecosystems of the bering sea and the sea of okhotsk are presented in our works lukyanova et al 2018 2016 2015 2014 tsygankov 2016 2012 tsygankov et al 2018 2017 2016a 2016b 2015 2014b 2014a fig 1 for the bering sea accumulation biotransformation and transport of ocps have recently been studied in pacific salmon and marine mammals for the sea of okhotsk in seabirds and pacific salmon table 1 for the sea of japan east sea in mollusks and fish table 2 in the sea of japan east sea mollusks and fish were sampled in some parts of peter the great bay in posyet amur and ussuri bays samples of mammals gray whale and pacific walrus were collected in mechigmen bay off the village of lorino pacific salmon sockeye oncorhynchus nerka and chinook o tshawytscha in the southwestern bering sea off the commander islands and eastern kamchatka furthermore pacific salmon pink o gorbuscha chum o keta sockeye o nerka and chinook o tshawytscha and seabirds fulmar fulmarus glacialis crested auklet aethia cristatella least auklet aethia pusilla slaty backed gull larus schistisagus and fork tailed storm petrel oceanodroma furcata were collected during the tinro center expeditions in the sea of okhotsk off the western coast of the kamchatka peninsula along the western part of the kuril islands in coastal waters and around hokkaido island 5 1 mollusks from the sea of japan east sea organochlorine compounds are well accumulated by filter feeders such as bivalves and therefore these organisms are successfully and widely used as bioindicators for monitoring ocps in natural waters the total ocp content of mussels from different parts of peter the great bay particularly from waters off the city of vladivostok has increased almost 10 times in 2000s years according to tkalin with co authors tkalin et al 1997 in 1996 the total ocp content of soft tissues in the mussel crenomytilus grayanus from amur and ussuri bays amounted to approximately 4 5 ng g wet weight according to our data the total ocp content of the mussels from amur bay in 2004 was 50 0 ng g wet weight from ussuri bay 20 0 ng g wet weight in 1998 the concentration of ocps in soft tissues of the mussels collected in the coastal waters off reineke island did not exceed 0 8 ng g wet weight tkalin et al 2000 in 2004 the level reached 25 8 ng g wet weight the increase in the total ocp content of the mussels both from the inner parts of amur and ussuri bays and from the water off reineke island which is considered a conditionally background area can be an evidence of the continuing economic activity in the south of primorsky krai a high total ocp content 616 ng g wet weight with the absolute predominance of ddt and its metabolites 450 ng g wet weight was found in mussels from posyet bay that may be associated with the influence of the tumen river discharging large amounts of various contaminants into the sea the ocp concentration in the mussels from posyet bay was significantly higher than in those from amur and ussuri bays thus the transboundary transport of pollutants is of great significance in coastal waters of primorsky krai boyarova and lukyanova 2006 currently hch and ddt are still detected in mollusks from different regions of the world ocean the results of our research table 2 fig 2 indicate a lower ocp contamination of peter the great bay compared to that of the coastal zone in the apr countries an analysis of the ratio of ddt and its metabolites and isomers of hch in mollusks organs has shown that in the mussels from posyet bay exposed to the transboundary transport of pollutants the ddt group is dominant as in animals from other coastal zones of asian countries at the same time the total amount of hch isomers in the mussels from peter the great bay was much greater than that in mollusks from other countries tanabe 2000 this may reflect the lower use of lindane in agriculture of asian countries the obtained values of maximum ocp concentrations in the mussels from peter the great bay are relatively low compared to the acute toxicity and ld50 values for humans which constitute 250 400 mg kg body weight ben dyke et al 1970 for ddt and its metabolites and 300 500 mg kg body weight for hch aks et al 1995 in the framework of the asia pacific mussel watch apmw program monitoring the pollution of the marine environment tanabe 2000 based on mussels and oysters as bioindicators was carried out during the period of 1997 2000 ocps were found in all mussel samples from the countries participating in the program cambodia china hong kong india indonesia japan korea malaysia philippines the far east of russia singapore and vietnam tanabe subramanian 2006 significant residual concentrations of ddt and α hch were detected in many samples the total concentrations of hch and ddt isomers and metabolites in soft tissues of mussels from waters of developing countries of asia were higher than in the samples from developed countries for instance the maximum hch content of the mussel perna viridis was 430 ng g lipid weight in india and 20 ng g lipid weight in the republic of korea and japan maximum concentrations of ddt were recorded from hong kong 61000 ng g lipid weight and china 34000 ng g lipid weight whereas in japan they reached only 100 ng g lipid weight in mussels of the genus mytilus the level of ddt in china amounted to 29000 ng g lipid weight monirith et al 2003 in hong kong 8000 ng g lipid weight on the pacific coast of russia 900 ng g lipid weight in india japan korea vietnam singapore malaysia indonesia and cambodia less than 800 ng g lipid weight minh et al 2002 hch in mussels from the above countries did not exceed 120 ng g lipid weight india tanabe 2007 5 2 fish from the sea of japan east sea the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea fish as a link of food chain accumulate persistent organic pollutants in their organs and tissues as a result of the biomagnification process fish are distributed worldwide and in most cases reflect ocp levels in the environment when ocps were studied in muscles of fish from coastal marine waters of primorsky krai the saffron cod caught in posyet bay showed the maximum total concentrations 638 ng g wet weight in muscles of the yellowfin goby from the same bay the amount of ocps was also high and reached 264 ng g wet weight in muscles of the flathead grey mullet from sivuchya cove the pesticide concentration was 88 ng g wet weight in all three species of fish caught in coastal waters of southwestern primorsky krai total ocps were dominated by ddt and its metabolites as in mussels from posyet bay several flounder species were also sampled from most of the study areas sivuchya cove posyet bay amur bay and ussuri bay the maximum ocp concentration 150 ng g wet weight was recorded from muscles of the flounders caught in amur bay in contrast to fish from southern primorsky krai in the flounders of amur bay total hch isomers were dominant 106 9 ng g wet weight and the main γ isomer accounted for 74 in all the fish liver samples from peter the great bay almost all hch isomers and ddt and its metabolites were detected the maximum ocp concentrations were found in the liver of the far eastern smooth flounder from amur bay 379 736 ng g wet weight pacific herring is a commercially valuable target species determination of toxicants in this fish is of particular interest with regards to its safety for human health the total ocp content of meat of the pacific herring caught in peter the great bay was 2 5 ng g wet weight which is by two orders of magnitude lower than in herring from the baltic sea roots 2004 in general the total content of organochlorine pesticides in fish from peter the great bay fits into the range of levels of these substances currently reported for fish from other regions of the world ocean in 2008 ocp content was measured in organs of pacific redfin tribolodon brandtii from the estuaries of the razdolnaya and artemovka rivers the total maximum ocp concentrations with an average of 1700 ng g wet weight were detected in the liver of the redfin from the razdolnaya river estuary in the fish from the artemovka river estuary the total ocp averaged at ca 1000 ng g wet weight in the fish meat the total ocp is much lower than in the liver and does not exceed the standards of sanitary regulations and norms sanpin 2 3 2 1078 01 2001 200 mg kg wet weight in muscles of the fish from the razdolnaya river it constitutes an average of 70 ng g wet weight in the fish from the artemovka 57 ng g wet weight the main pollutants are ddt and dde when comparing the ocp content of organs between estuarine fish species redfin and marine ones far eastern smooth flounder from ussuri and amur bays it can be noted that estuarine fish accumulate ocp to a much greater extent than marine fish which agrees with the known pattern of accumulation and sedimentation of ocps at the boundary of mixing sea and fresh waters the mean ocps content table 1 fig 3 of the pink o gorbuscha chum o keta sockeye o nerka and chinook salmon o tshawytscha from the sea of okhotsk made up 141 5 125 5 1298 and 3177 9 ng g lipid weight respectively a comparison of the total amount of ocps in muscles and liver of all four fish species from the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea did not show any significant difference in mean values between pink and chum salmon but in these species they were significantly lower p 0 05 than in chinook salmon which in turn also had lower values than in sockeye salmon the concentration increases in the following sequence chum pink chinook sockeye the ranges of total ocp concentration e g in muscles were as follows 78 8 174 1 89 3 222 8 265 0 2435 4 and 165 7 3020 1 ng g lipid weight respectively lukyanova et al 2015 2016 tsygankov et al 2016b 2017 a comparison of soft tissues between chum and pink salmon showed significantly p 0 05 larger amounts of pesticides in chum which can be explained both by the greater weight and fat content of this species and by the longer marine life history of its individuals pink salmon has an annual lifecycle and returns to spawn in the following year after the downstream migration of smolts into the sea whereas chum salmon can feed during two to five years the mean body weight of the examined chum salmon was 1863 g the mean weight of pink salmon 1130 g as fish grows and gains weight various pollutants are accumulated in organs along with the build up of lipid reserves the studied pink and chum salmon were collected in waters of the southern kuril islands in early summer during the completion of the spawning migration when organs begin to spend lipid before spawning salmon spend up to 80 of their reserve lipid in this case the specific concentration of toxicant per 1 g lipid increases and can reach values hazardous to the health of fish brett 1995 samples of sockeye and chinook salmon were collected in the western bering sea and in the sea of okhotsk in autumn in october and november when fish feed at sea where they can stay for several years during this time the concentration of toxicants in their organs continuously increases not only in the metabolically active liver but also in muscles thus chinook salmon accumulates 99 of all toxicants during the marine life history phase cullon et al 2009 the mean ocp concentrations in the bering flounder hippoglossoides robustus from the eastern and southern areas of the sea were 99 8 125 4 and 53 6 40 5 ng g lipid weight respectively lukyanova et al 2018 when comparing the ddt and hch concentrations with data for flounder from other regions of the world ocean it should be noted that the concentrations in flounder from the sea of okhotsk were significantly lower than those in flounder from the european coast of the atlantic ocean ferreira et al 2005 de boer et al 2001 and from the american coast of the pacific lefkovitz et al 2001 in these studies flounder were collected mainly in estuarine zones where the level of pollution is high in the authors study flounder were collected in waters of the sea of okhotsk where the influence of coastal pollution sources is absent therefore the obtained data can be considered background for the sea of okhotsk and the entire north pacific among ddt metabolites dde was found to be dominant in muscles of flounder from the sea of okhotsk significant differences have also been noted for hchs hchs are at a low level and often not detected in atlantic fish muscles β hch was found in muscles of all the flounder from the sea of okhotsk which confirms the existence of this pesticide in the sea of okhotsk ecosystem for a long time the total ocps concentration in muscles of salmon and flounder does not exceed sanitary standards of the russian federation which according to sanitary rules and norms sanpin 2 3 2 1078 01 2001 are 200 ng g wet weight for fish the content of pollutants depends on many factors one of which is migration japanese researchers have conducted a number of studies on migratory diaphus theta and ceratoscopelus warmingi and non migratory stenobrachius nannochir and lampanyctus regalis species and come to a conclusion that ocp concentrations in the former up to 180 ng g lipid weight are lower than those in the latter up to 310 ng g lipid weight takahashi et al 2000 tanabe subramanian 2006 tanabe 2007 ueno et al 2003 used skipjack tuna for monitoring coastal waters of japan taiwan island philippines indonesia the seychelles islands brazil and india the maximum ocp content was detected in fish caught in the coastal waters of china 700 ng g lipid weight kajiwara et al 2003 measured concentrations of ocps in five sturgeon species beluga huso huso russian sturgeon acipenser gueldenstaedtii stellate sturgeon acipenser stellatus persian sturgeon acipenser persicus and ship sturgeon acipenser nudiventris from the caspian sea which is the world s largest inland body of water bounded by the territories of russia azerbaijan kazakhstan turkmenistan and iran the maximum contents were recorded from beluga 17700 ng g lipid weight and russian sturgeon 3050 ng g lipid weight pacific salmon are among the most abundant commercial fish the level of organochlorine pollutants in them is distributed in such a way that the high fat species chinook and sockeye salmon contain higher concentrations than the low fat species chum and pink salmon for instance ocps in chinook salmon from the salish sea washington amount to 2420 ng g lipid weight good et al 2014 in sockeye salmon from alaska 1911 ng g lipid weight apeti et al 2013 in chum and pink salmon from alaska 243 and 80 ng g lipid weight respectively gerlach 2013 5 3 biotransport of ocps by pacific salmon the number of salmon migrating to the russian coast varies from year to year but the species structure of the runs keeps stable pink salmon accounts for 60 65 chum 20 25 sockeye 10 12 coho and chinook salmon constitute a small fraction chum and pink salmon form the major part of runs in eastern kamchatka eastern sakhalin the mainland coast of the sea of okhotsk and in the amur river basin shuntov and temnykh 2011 2008 in the even numbered year 2008 the total catch amounted to 258000 t in the record breaking odd numbered year 2009 542000 t in 2010 324000 t the number of fish that reached spawning grounds in certain regions of the far east in 2008 2010 is published in the annual report of the north pacific anadromous fish commission npafc it is the fish that remain at their grounds after spawning and serve as a food supply for many organisms thus connecting the marine and terrestrial food chains or in other words transferring organic matter from the ocean to the land the distribution of salmonids in the ocean mostly follows the location of the water masses characterized by the optimal temperatures from 2 to 4 up to 15 20 c however the migration processes depend on numerous factors such as the season climatic status of the year biological and physiological status of the fish their age presence of food objects et al the presence of the pollutants in the fish body and their concentration may also have a pronounced effect on the spawning behavior and spawning success lukyanova et al 2015 the salmons dominate in the water layer of 0 50 m in the northern pacific ocean the atmospheric precipitation and suspended matter with pollutants also concentrate exactly in this layer the southern margin of the geographic range of salmon 38 40 n adjoins the area of the pacific garbage patch or the pacific trash vortex 35 42 n located between 140 e and 160 w this area carries tons of plastic and other garbage that was transported by the pacific current system the photodecomposition of the plastic is accompanied by the income of the organochlorine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as estrogen like compounds that absorb at the suspended matter and then may be ingested and accumulated by salmonids moore et al 2001 derraik 2002 choy and drazen 2013 the concentration of ocps as an averaged sum of hch dde for males and females was 68 85 ng g wet weight in whole pink salmon and 182 5 ng g wet weight in chum salmon the mean weight of one specimen of pink salmon is 1 3 kg one spawning chum salmon 3 5 kg calculations show that one pink salmon contains up to 90 μg studied pesticides and one chum does up to 640 μg lukyanova et al 2014 thus the total amount of ocps transported e g in 2009 to eastern kamchatka by these two salmon species only constitutes 10 4 kg to the amur river basin more than 13 kg to the mainland coast of the sea of okhotsk 8 1 kg lukyanova et al 2015 in 2008 the influx of studied pesticides with salmon to various regions of the pacific coast of russia ranged from 520 g to 4 kg in 2009 from 470 g to 13 kg in 2010 from 350 g to 7 75 kg within three years the amur basin received the largest amount of pesticides approximately 23 kg the high runs of salmon in recent years provided from 13 to 30 kg ocps transferred to land annually thus the total pesticide content at each spawning ground increases 5 4 seabirds of the sea of okhotsk seabirds can be both intermediate and terminal links in a trophic chain by feeding on living organisms they accumulate toxic pollutants in their organs in the process of biomagnification the mean pesticide content of the northern fulmar fulmarus glacialis crested auklet aethia cristatella pacific gull larus schistisagus grey petrel oceanodroma furcata and auklet crumb aethia pusilla amounted to 5206 8460 4542 2417 and 2804 ng g lipid weight respectively tsygankov et al 2014b 2016a 2017 feeding habits migratory behavior and bird life strategy define peculiarities in the pesticide accumulation the considered seabirds are abundant in subarctic areas of the northern part of the atlantic and the pacific oceans transoceanic migrations are not typical for these species shuntov 1998 the studied bird species from the sea of okhotsk have different sizes and consequently differ in the amount of subcutaneous fat in organs and tissue as ocps are known to concentrate mainly in the subcutaneous fat bigger birds show higher ocp content values table 1 fig 3 pacific gull with its mean body size of 64 cm and fulmar 47 cm contain similar concentrations of ocps in feathers with skin 5962 and 5949 ng g lipid weight respectively in grey petrel which is much smaller 22 cm than the bird species above the pesticide content was 3128 ng g lipid weight accumulation and distribution of pesticides in bird organs can be additionally controlled by other factors also thus in crested auklet having body size of 26 cm the ocp content of feathers with skin made up 15604 ng g lipid weight to identify the causes of the high ocp concentrations in this species further research is required tsygankov et al 2016a 2017 diet of birds is also an important factor in the accumulation of ocps the mean pesticide content of internal organs in birds indicates their different diet spectra the food of fulmar includes organisms characterized by a high coefficient of ocp accumulation fish fish eggs mollusks crustaceans and other invertebrates carrion whale entrails various fatty waste etc resulting in a high pesticide content of its internal organs 5874 ng g lipid weight crested auklet auklet crumb and grey petrel feed on small sized crustaceans marine invertebrates amphipods etc which accumulate pesticides to a lesser degree than the items of fulmar s diet consequently the ocp content of the internal organs in these birds is lower 1730 2804 and 1705 ng g lipid weight respectively ocp content of their organs and tissues also depends on type of feeding and migration patterns thus glaucous gull from the barents sea feeding on fish carrion and eggs of other birds contains 216157 ng g lipid weight in its organism knudsen et al 2007 great skua iceland whose diet consists mainly of fish robbed from other seabirds accumulates pollutants to a level of 55600 ng g lipid weight jorundsdottiro et al 2010 birds of the baffin sea arctic ocean accumulate smaller amounts of ocps due to their remoteness from the potential sources of pollution contaminant patterns in the arctic vary also according to patterns of long range transport for instance northern fulmar feeding on crustaceans fish squid plankton and by chance carrion contains toxicants at a level of 4934 ng g lipid weight black legged kittiwake whose diet is similar to that of fulmar 1323 ng g lipid weight buckman et al 2004 5 5 marine mammals of the bering sea all ocps are highly lipophilic compounds and fat deposits in the subcutaneous layer of marine mammals serve as a storage site for them mammals compared to most other marine organisms live longer and are therefore subject to long term exposure to xenobiotics marine mammals can be considered important species for monitoring long term manifestations of ocps in the marine environment and for this reason used as indicators of global pollution because many of them migrate to large distances and are unlikely to indicate local pollution tanabe subramanian 2006 tanabe 2007 in the organs of gray whale eschrichtius robustus the lipid content ranged from 1 to 4 in muscles and up to 8 in the liver in the organs of pacific walrus odobenus rosmarus divergens the lipid content ranged from 1 to 6 in muscles and up to 10 in the liver tsygankov et al 2015 calculations showed table 1 fig 3 that total ocps in gray whale s fat averaged at 6290 ng g lipid weight in pacific walrus at 26300 ng g lipid weight tsygankov et al 2014a 2017 the different levels of pesticide accumulation in gray whale and pacific walrus from the bering sea indicate mainly the different degrees of contamination of their habitats by these pollutants besides whales have very poor ability to biotransform pollutants whereas seal have a better ability of great importance is also the degree of puberty of individuals the species studied by us have similar habitats the fat content of the organs does not vary significantly between them keeping within 8 10 and the substantial differences in pesticide level may be associated with a reproductive cycle stage or feeding habits the food of gray whales mainly include bottom crustaceans and other small sized benthic organisms inhabiting the surface and deeper layers of soft sediments infauna burdin et al 2009 swartz 2018 the major part of walrus diet is comprised of benthic invertebrates bivalves some shrimp species lobsters polychaete worms and priapulids octopuses and holothurians as well as some fish species furthermore walruses can sometimes prey on seals there are documented cases of their attacks on ringed seals and harp seal pups burdin et al 2009 lydersen 2018 the species comprising the diet of walrus accumulate more pesticides in their body than the items of gray whale s food since the coefficients of accumulation of pollutants for mollusks and fishes are higher than those for crustaceans based on this fact we can conclude that the dietary factor is determinative for the differences in bioaccumulation of pesticides between whales and walruses tsygankov et al 2015 2017 marine mammals have a long lifecycle and high concentrations of pesticides are found in their organs however levels of pollutants in females and males differ substantially in general ocp concentrations are comparable in immature males and females and increase before puberty subsequently the concentration in males continues to increase while in females it reaches a plateau or slightly decreases tanabe subramanian 2006 higher ocp concentrations in female dall s porpoises were recorded in the cases of the absence of ovulation 120000 ng g lipid weight compared to animals with a normal reproductive cycle 3000 ng g lipid weight kajiwara et al 2002 in addition to the age related tendency dietary habits are also of great importance in the accumulation of ocps by marine mammals fish eaters generally accumulate them to higher concentrations than animals that feed on crustaceans tanabe subramanian 2006 tsygankov et al 2014a thus in finless porpoise feeding mostly on crustaceans and cephalopods the ocp content amounted to 48000 ng g lipid weight park et al 2010 in killer whale from canada and usa a predator characterized by a wide diet spectrum fish pinnipeds etc the concentration of ocps was 161300 ng g lipid weight krahn et al 2007 in spotted seal preying mainly on fish the level of toxicants reached 381400 ng g lipid weight trukhin and boyarova 2013 6 conclusions this work is a stage of the research on ocp accumulation by members of various links of the food chain such as mollusks fish seabirds and marine mammals in the far eastern seas of russia in marine organisms collected from the sea of japan east sea the bering sea and the sea of okhotsk organochlorine pesticides have been detected in all the studied samples the presence of organochlorine pesticides ocps in the environment and their accumulation up food chains poses a serious threat to the health of organisms on the highest trophic levels which are frequently predatory animals and birds when studying representatives of different links of the food chain of marine organisms in the far eastern seas it can be noted that ocps are most actively accumulated in marine mammals and birds occupying the top of the trophic pyramid the results of mollusks fish seabirds and marine mammals research indicate a lower ocps contamination of peter the great bay the sea of japan east sea the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea compared to that of the coastal zone of countries in the asia pacific region the data about ocps concentration in mollusks and flounder can be considered background for the far eastern seas of russia and the entire north pacific acknowledgment this work was supported by the russian
