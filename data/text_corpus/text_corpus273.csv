1365,back diffusion of groundwater contaminants from low permeability k zones can be a major factor controlling the time to reach cleanup goals in downgradient monitor wells we identify the aquifer and contaminant characteristics that have the greatest influence on the time toom after complete source removal for contaminant concentrations to decline by 1 2 and 3 orders of magnitude t1 t2 and t3 two aquifer configurations are evaluated a layered geometry lg with finite thickness low k layers and b boundary geometry bg with thick semi infinite low k boundaries a semi analytical modeling approach muskus and falta 2018 is used to simulate the concentration decline following source removal for a range of conditions and generate 21 000 independent values of t1 t2 and t3 linear regression is applied to interpret this large dataset and develop simple relationships to estimate toom from three characteristic parameters the mass residence time tm diffusion time td and ratio of low k to high k mass storage γ tm is most important predictor of t1 t2 and t3 for both geometries and is equal to the combined high and low k contaminant mass divided by the mass flux at the end of the loading period tl for lg t3 is strongly influenced by td rlld 2 4d where rl is the low k retardation factor ld is the half thickness of the embedded low k layers and d is the effective diffusion coefficient for bg t3 is strongly influenced by γ contaminant decay in low k zones can significantly reduce cleanup times when λltd 0 01 where λl is the effective first order decay rate in the low k zone the 1st damköhler da equal to tm td provides a useful indicator of the relative importance of back diffusion on toom back diffusion impacts are greatest on t3 when 0 01 da 0 1 then decrease with increasing da back diffusion has less impacts on t2 with limited influence on t1 the results are summarized in a simple conceptual model to aid in evaluating the impact of back diffusion on the time for concentrations to decline by 1 3 oom graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords back diffusion cleanup time sensitivity parameters damköhler 1 introduction diffusion can have major impacts on contaminant transport in unconsolidated sedimentary formations when the darcy velocity in low permeability k zones is very small as a groundwater plume advances downgradient through high k zones dissolved contaminants are transported by molecular diffusion into low k zones slowing the downgradient migration of the contaminant plume however once the contaminant source is greatly reduced contaminants diffuse out of low k zones slowing the cleanup rate in the high k zone grisak and pickens 1980 this process termed back diffusion can greatly extend cleanup times following source removal especially for chlorinated solvents where large reductions in contaminant concentrations are required to meet remediation goals the impacts of back diffusion on aquifer cleanup times have been documented in several detailed field studies mackay et al 2000 demonstrated that back diffusion from an underlying clayey aquitard increased the groundwater cleanup time for a pump and treat system enclosed within a sheet pile test cell model predictions based on diffusion of contaminant within the aquitard were consistent with measured concentration profiles liu and ball 2002 at a dnapl site in connecticut chapman and parker 2005 reported that trichloroethylene tce concentrations in downgradient wells declined by roughly 1 order of magnitude oom when the upgradient source area was isolated with sheet piling however after this initial decline tce concentrations appeared to plateau or decline more slowly consistent with back diffusion from an underlying aquitard numerical simulations indicate that back diffusion will cause tce concentrations in downgradient wells to remain above target cleanup levels for centuries parker et al 2008 showed that back diffusion of tce from the thin low k beds will significantly delay groundwater cleanup at a well characterized tce site in florida following complete source isolation with an innovative hydraulic capture system the physics of back diffusion and impacts on aquifer cleanup have been examined in several well controlled laboratory experiments doner 2008 measured the impacts of back diffusion on aquifer cleanup rate in a 1 07 m long laboratory tank containing a continuous sand body with suspended clay zones a bromide and fluorescein tracer solution was flushed through the tank for 22 days followed by clean water for 100 days the lower diffusion coefficient for fluorescein 5 5e 10 m2 s compared to bromide 20 1e 10 m2 s resulted in more extensive tailing of the fluorescein break through curve yang et al 2015 measured diffusion driven solute transport between a high k sand and thin low k layers of varying thickness 1 5 2 and 6 cm in 0 28 m long laboratory tank experiments with rapid flushing of the high k layer 0 65 pore volumes day mass flux from the low k layer to the high k layer was well described by analytical solutions using the method of images tatti et al 2018 measured back diffusion rates in a 0 68 m laboratory tank containing low k lenses in a continuous high k aquifer increasing the solute transport velocity from 5 to 20 m d increased diffusive flux by more rapidly removing the solute from the high k zone near the low k interface the effects of back diffusion on cleanup time can be evaluated using existing analytical sale et al 2008 farhat et al 2012 and numerical models chapman et al 2012 demonstrate that high resolution numerical models can accurately simulate the back diffusion process and predict concentration changes over 3 oom in heterogeneous sand tank experiments doner 2008 when the source condition and low k zone geometry is accurately incorporated in the models however the high concentration gradients near the high low k interface require a fine vertical discretization to accurately simulate back diffusion farhat et al 2020 muskus and falta 2018 develop a semi analytical modeling approach to simulate the effects of diffusion in low k zones on solute concentrations in the more transmissive zones contaminant concentration profiles in extensive low k aquitards and finite thickness embedded low k zones are represented with a fitting function that is adjusted at each timestep the resulting diffusion fluxes are added to the numerical model as linear concentration dependent source sink terms eliminating the need for fine discretization of the low k region greatly reducing computation time simulation results closely match results from laboratory experiments with layered systems yang et al 2015 and irregularly shaped low k lenses doner 2008 fine grid numerical simulations and analytical solutions for diffusion in fractured rock and with parent daughter decay reactions muskus and falta 2018 halloran and hunkeler 2020 recognize that the interplay between advection diffusion sorption and degradation processes will control plume persistence and use a high resolution numerical model to examine the impact of simultaneously varying five key input parameters layer thickness aquifer k retardation factor decay rate λ and diffusion coefficient dm requiring 288 model runs for three different aquifer geometries to aid in interpreting this large and complex dataset results are presented in a series of color maps and reduced dimension variables for key performance metrics visual evaluation of these results indicates that back diffusion impacts on cleanup time are greatest in thin confined high k zones with lower groundwater velocity larger dm and lower λ in summary physically based analytical and numerical models can reproduce the results of controlled laboratory experiments and well characterized field investigations of back diffusion the underlying physics indicate that aquifer cleanup times will be controlled by the physical characteristics of both the higher and lower permeability zones hydraulic gradient i permeability k porosity θ and layer geometry chemical properties of the contaminant and aquifer material molecular diffusion coefficient dm effective tortuosity τ linear equilibrium retardation factor r and effective first order decay rate λ and site characteristics contaminant loading period tl contaminant source concentration cs remediation goals and distance to the monitoring or compliance point x generating accurate estimates for each of these parameters is an overwhelming challenge at most remediation sites to effectively apply these models for site management we must identify the model input parameters that have the greatest impact on simulation results and prioritize characterization resources on those key parameters here we identify the aquifer contaminant and site characteristics that have the greatest impact on the time after complete source removal toom for contaminant concentrations at a specified compliance point to decline by 1 2 and 3 orders of magnitude oom we vary all key input parameters influencing back diffusion over realistic ranges for unconsolidated sedimentary formations generating a large database of toom values statistical analysis of this database provides insights into the dominant processes influencing cleanup time after source removal we demonstrate that toom is strongly correlated with characteristic scaling parameters and can be estimated using simple regression models we identify the aquifer and contaminant characteristics that have the greatest impact on toom and the conditions when individual processes are most important these results can guide site characterization efforts and aid in interpreting model output for a broad range of site conditions and contaminants 2 approach numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the effects of diffusive mass transfer between high and low k zones on the time to reach varying cleanup levels for a range of site conditions cleanup time toom is calculated as the time after complete source elimination for contaminant concentrations to decline by 1 2 and 3 orders of magnitude t1 t2 and t3 in downgradient monitor wells the contaminant source concentration is assumed to be constant for a loading period tl then completely removed causing the concentration entering the downgradient aquifer to immediately drop to zero oom reductions are calculated based on the contaminant concentration at the well at the time the source is eliminated for example if the concentration in a monitoring well was 5000 μg l when the source was eliminated then t3 is the time required for the concentration to decline to 5 μg l a factor of 1000 reduction or 3 ooms the variation in high k zone contaminant concentrations with time is determined using the modeling approach developed by muskus and falta 2018 and incorporated in remchlor md falta et al 2018 advection dispersion linear equilibrium sorption and 1st order decay in the mobile zone are simulated with a finite difference solution to the advection dispersion equation diffusion fluxes for each cell are calculated using the semi analytical approach developed by muskus and falta 2018 groundwater velocity in the low k zone is zero in all simulations mass transfer between the high and low k zones occurs by molecular diffusion with an effective diffusion coefficient d d τ d m where dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient in ground water at the ambient temperature and τ is the tortuosity coefficient in all simulations dm 9 1e 10 m2 s 0 029 m2 yr a representative value for trichloroethylene falta et al 2018 d is lower than dm due to increased diffusion distance along tortuous diffusion paths and increased viscosity in narrow pores grathwohl 1998 τ is commonly reported to vary between 0 2 and 0 5 grathwohl 1998 carey et al 2016 however values less than 0 1 have been reported for soils with 25 clay ayral and demond 2014 two aquifer geometries are evaluated fig 1 a layered geometry lg and b boundary geometry bg for lg the embedded low k layers are sufficiently thin such that the average contaminant concentration in the low k zone approaches the average high k zone concentration by the end of the loading period for bg the semi infinite low k boundaries are sufficiently thick that solutes diffusing into this zone do not reach the layer boundary within the simulation period for the bg the homogeneous aquifer has a thickness b and is bounded on one side by a semi infinite boundary monitor wells located a distance x downgradient of the source represent the vertically averaged concentration in the high k zone ch 2 1 typical simulation results fig 2a shows a typical contaminant break through curve btc in a monitor well located 100 m downgradient of the source for the boundary geometry bg for this example the high k aquifer is 3 m thick k 0 02 cm s and the monitor well has a 3 m long screen 1d results δx 1 m are compared with vertically averaged concentrations from two dimensional 2d vertical profile simulations δx 1 m δz 0 1 m with two different values of vertical dispersivity αv the normalized contaminant concentration ch cs is equal to the average contaminant concentration in the high k zone ch divided by the source concentration cs all other parameters are for the base case condition presented in table 1 for both the 1d and 2d simulations fig 2a ch cs increases rapidly reaching 1 within a few years remains high for the 50 yr loading period and then rapidly declines once the source is eliminated similar to simulation results by chapman and parker 2005 at 60 yr 10 yr after source removal there is a slope break in the ch cs curve and contaminant concentrations begin to decline more slowly in this example ch cs declined by 1 oom at 56 yr 2 oom at 95 yr and 3 oom at 255 yr so t1 6 yr t2 45 yr and t3 205 yr in most simulations t1 occurs before the slope break and is controlled by advective flushing of the high k zone while t3 generally occurs after the slope break and is influenced by both the advective flux in the high k zone and the diffusive flux out of the low k zone t2 may occur before or after the slope break depending on aquifer and site characteristics one dimensional 1d simulation results δx 1 m closely match vertically averaged concentrations in 2d simulations with vertical dispersivity αv 0 001 m normalized root mean square error nrmse 8 9 and αv 0 01 m nrmse 4 1 t1 t2 and t3 differ by 1 8 and 6 between the 1d simulation and 2d simulation with αv 0 001 m fig 2b shows concentration profiles for αv 0 01 and 0 001 m at t 100 yr and x 100 m concentrations are highest immediately adjoining the low k boundary then decrease rapidly with distance when αv 0 01 m most contaminant mass is within 2 m of the low k boundary these results illustrate that 1d simulation results closely approximate 2d results when essentially all contaminants released from the low k boundary remain within the screened interval of the monitoring well i e b monitor well screened interval increasing the aquifer thickness to greater than 3 m reduces the vertically averaged concentration by dilution with uncontaminated water in the sensitivity analyses 1d simulations with a maximum aquifer thickness of 3 m are used to reduce computation times 2 2 sensitivity analysis database model input parameters evaluated in the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 1 a base case set of simulations is first conducted where kh x f nl and b are varied to reflect the effects of aquifer geometry on toom generating 840 individual values of t1 t2 and t3 each base case simulation is then repeated for each value of θh θl rh rl τ tl and λl shown in table 1 when the toom is greater than the 1000 yr simulation period these values are excluded resulting in a total of 21 000 individual values of t1 t2 and t3 for use in the regression analyses statistical moments for parameters in the dataset without decay λl 0 are summarized in tables s 1 for lg and s 2 for bg many of the key indicator parameters are log normally distributed and so ln transformed values are also presented for bg preliminary results showed that toom values are identical for an aquifer of thickness b with one low k boundary and an aquifer of thickness 2b with two low k boundaries so the number of boundaries is not varied the bg aquifer thickness b is varied from 0 5 to 3 m for lg the parameters x f and nl are varied to reflect the effect of aquifer geometry on toom for lg the aquifer thickness b is constant at 3 0 m equivalent to the length of common monitor well screens the lg aquifer contains nl low k layers of thickness 2ld b 1 f nl where f is the volume fraction of the high k zone so low k layer thickness varies between 0 075 and 2 7 m for both lg and bg x and kh were varied to cover a broad ranges of site conditions so the datasets also include some extreme values for example the high k zone non reactive travel time tt to the monitoring or compliance point varies from 0 1 to 21 yr while this range is physically plausible it is unlikely that a compliance point would be established 0 1 or 21 yr travel time away from the source by including some extreme values in the dataset we ensure the regression relationships accurately reflect model behavior for a broad range of conditions for both lg and bg a fifty year loading period tl is selected for the base case which is equivalent to a spill occurring in 1970 with complete 100 source removal in 2020 in the sensitivity analysis tl values of 25 and 100 yr are also evaluated the transverse dispersivity equal to zero in all simulations to eliminate the effects of transverse dispersion the longitudinal dispersivity αl is constant at 1 m allowing limited longitudinal dispersion zech et al 2015 2 3 scaling parameters to assist with interpretation of the modeling results we identify a set of scaling parameters for a unit width aquifer based on the geometry of the high and low k zones distance from the source to the monitoring point x high k porosity θh low k porosity θl high k retardation factor rh and low k retardation factor rl characteristic time scales include the high k travel time tt hydraulic retention time th mass retention time tm and loading period tl tt th and tm in years are defined as t t pv h q t h pv h pv l q t m r h pv h r l pv l q based on the high k pore volume pvh low k pore volume pvl and volumetric discharge per unit width through the aquifer q characteristic scaling ratios include the ratio of low k to high k zone thickness α ratio of low k to high k pore volume β and ratio of low k to high k contaminant mass storage γ defined at the end of the loading period tl for lg the characteristic diffusion length ld is equal to half the low k layer thickness and is independent of time allowing us to calculate a characteristic diffusion time td where td rlld 2 4d for the bg the volume of the contaminated low k zone will increase over time as contaminants diffuse deeper into the semi infinite low k boundary so ld will increase with tl for bg we define td tl and l d mass stored in low k boundary at end of loading period t l source concentration r l θ l width x in supporting information fig s 1 we show that for tl 0 75 rhtt ld can be estimated using the relationship ld 4 73 tl 0 75 rhtt d rl 0 5 the 1st damköhler number is a dimensionless parameter used to relate reaction rates to transport rates in this work we define da as tm td characteristic time and length scales for lg and bg are defined in table 2 box whisker plots showing the distribution of the scaling parameters for lg and bg datasets without decay λl 0 are shown in fig 3 for lg median advection times tt th tm vary from 2 to 8 yr while median cleanup times vary from 12 yr for t1 to 37 yr for t3 the relatively narrow range between the median 1 and 3 oom cleanup time implies that mass transfer is often relatively rapid for the layered geometry which is consistent with the relatively short median diffusion time td of 1 4 yr median advection times tt th tm for bg vary from 2 to 8 yr similar to the embedded geometry however median cleanup times for bg are much more variable ranging from 5 yr for t1 to 217 yr for t3 the large difference between 1 and 3 oom cleanup times for bg implies that diffusive mass transfer is often slow relative to advection the largest difference between the lg and bg datasets is for td for lg td varied from 0 02 to 227 yr causing da tm td to vary by 5 oom for bg td varied from 25 to 100 yr causing da to vary over a narrower range 0 004 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 base case simulations fig 4 shows selected results from the remchlor md simulations for the base case conditions for lg and bg toom is a function of the hydraulic retention time th and diffusion length ld for lg and a function of the th and b for bg note that for the base case conditions rh rl 1 so tm th for both lg and bg the data points for each curve are individual simulation results for x between 25 and 150 m and kh between 0 01 and 0 1 cm s for constant values of ld and b the points plot on a smooth curve indicating x and kh are not important predictors of toom for the base case lg the time to 1 oom cleanup t1 varies approximately linearly with th and is relatively insensitive to ld indicating diffusive transport between high and low k zones is not the primary control on cleanup time for the 1st oom reduction t2 and t3 also vary with th but are more sensitive to ld indicating the diffusive transport becomes more important when larger oom reductions are required for larger th t2 and t3 are linear functions of th implying advective transport controls cleanup time however for smaller th t2 and t3 increase much more rapidly with th consistent with solute diffusion between high and low k zones influencing cleanup time for the base case bg t1 t2 and t3 are primarily controlled by th and to a lesser extent b similar to the layered geometry t1 increases approximately linearly with th indicating cleanup is controlled by advective transport t2 and t3 increase approximately in proportion to the square root of th and increase with smaller values of b as diffusive flux from the low k boundary becomes more significant relative to advective flux in the high k zone 3 2 parameter sensitivity the results presented above illustrate that cleanup time is due to complex interactions between advective and diffusive transport processes traditional sensitivity analyses where a single parameter is varied while all others remain constant may not reveal the complex interactions that can occur to provide a more robust evaluation of parameter sensitivity the distribution of toom values for the base case is compared with toom distributions for each value of θh θl rh rl τ tl and λl to aid in interpreting these results box whisker plots are presented showing the median value 25 75 quartiles and 5 95 limits of the toom distribution for several important parameters fig 5 for presentation in fig 5 toom values greater than 1000 yr are entered as 1000 yr in general the time to reach 1 oom cleanup t1 is relatively insensitive to most model parameters for both lg and bg this is likely due to the relatively minor impacts of back diffusion on t1 in contrast model parameters have a much greater impact on t3 since t3 is much more strongly influenced by back diffusion t3 is often much greater for bg than lg indicating back diffusion is a much more important process in aquifers with thick low k boundaries increasing contaminant loading period tl results in variable impacts on cleanup time for lg increasing tl results in minor increases in t1 t2 and t3 for bg increasing tl results in substantial increases in t3 but variable impacts on t1 and t2 for bg longer tl results in greater penetration of contaminants into the low k boundary and increases the duration of back diffusion for lg the characteristic diffusion time td is often less than tl so further increases in tl do not have a substantial impact on the toom distributions changes in tortuosity τ have a complex relationship with toom for the base case simulations τ 0 7 and d 0 02 m2 yr reducing τ to 0 07 reduces d to 0 002 m2 yr increasing td for lg by 3 16 100 5 in some lg cases an increase in td can shift the process from advection dominated to diffusion dominated increasing toom for bg reducing τ by a factor of 10 reduces ld by a factor of 3 16 which leads to a reduction in the mass stored in the low k boundary reducing cleanup time changes in the low k retardation factor rl can also have unexpected impacts on toom for lg increasing rl corresponds with an increase in t1 t2 and t3 with the largest impact on t3 however for bg increasing rl corresponds with more modest increases in t1 t2 and t3 with the least impact on t3 the limited impact on t3 is related to the reduced diffusion length ld with larger rl changes in the low k porosity θl have a more consistent impact on toom increasing θl increases the mass stored in low k zones for lg increasing t1 t2 and t3 for bg increasing θl results in an increase in t3 but has very limited impacts on t1 increases in the low k contaminant decay rate λl for lg result in minor reductions in t1 with somewhat greater reductions for t2 and t3 for bg increasing λl has minor impacts on t1 greater impacts on t2 and can result in very large reductions in t3 especially for λl 1 yr the much greater impact of λl on t3 for lg is due to the much greater impact of back diffusion on cleanup time for this geometry 3 3 scaling parameter analysis results from the base case simulations and sensitivity analysis show that back diffusion has a much greater impact on t3 than t1 and the ratio t3 t1 is large when back diffusion has a major influence on toom in fig 6 t3 t1 is plotted versus the first damköhler number da for both lg and bg with no decay λl 0 note that at an individual site td is constant so da increases linearly with distance from the source the ratio t3 t1 is very sensitive to da varying over 2 oom in a small number of bg cases near the source when velocity is high da 0 01 t3 t1 is reduced indicating limited impacts of back diffusion with increased travel time lower kh and or larger x t3 t1 increases reaching a maximum in the range 0 01 da 0 1 for both lg and bg for lg t3 t1 declines as da increases eventually approaching 1 for very large da a similar pattern appears to occur for bg however the range of da in the bg dataset is much smaller so it is not possible to determine if t3 t1 continues to decline for large values of da a correlation analysis was conducted to identify relationships between different scaling parameters and toom table 3 shows correlation coefficients r between ln toom and scaling parameters for both geometries with no decay λl 0 for lg ln t1 is strongly correlated with ln tm and weakly correlated with ln td implying that t1 is primarily controlled by advective flushing for lg the correlation between ln tm and ln t2 and ln t3 is reduced while the correlation with ln td increases indicating diffusion is a more important influence on cleanup time for large oom reductions for bg ln toom is strongly correlated with ln tm for 1 2 and 3 oom indicating the advective flux is a major influence for all cleanup levels ln td is a poor predictor of ln toom for bg possibly due to the relatively limited range of td considered here 25 to 100 yr note that ln γ is a better predictor of ln toom and γ is a function of td for bg ln da is strongly correlated with ln toom because it is strongly correlated with tm r 0 99 the impact of tm on cleanup time is illustrated in fig 7 where toom is plotted versus tm and toom tm is plotted versus da for both lg and bg with no decay λl 0 the strong correlation between toom and tm is evident for both lg and bg by dividing toom by tm we eliminate the primary impact of advective flushing and can look for secondary impacts of diffusion limited mass transfer for lg the ratio of toom tm varies with da and can be separated into three regions when da is very large 100 diffusive mass transfer from the low k zone to the high k zone is rapid relative to advection t1 tm t2 tm and t3 tm all decline to less than 1 5 similar to values predicted by the advection dispersion equation ade with αl 1 m ade results not shown when da 0 1 t1 tm and t2 tm are highly variable and small values occur under certain conditions we hypothesize that for small da the average concentration in the high k zone approaches zero the low k concentration gradient and diffusive flux reach a maximum and further increases in the advective flux only dilutes contaminants released from the low k zone reducing time to reach 1 and 2 oom reductions between the extreme behavior observed for very high and very low da cleanup time is influenced by both advection in the high k zone and diffusion in the low k zone the maximum values of t2 tm and t3 tm occur for da 0 01 then decrease as da increases as discussed below it is not possible to fit a single function to the full range of da for bg td tl so td varies over a relatively narrow range 25 to 100 yr and da is generally less than 1 t1 tm generally varies between 0 3 and 3 and does not correlate with da t3 tm may be low for very small da reaches a maximum near da 0 01 then decreases steadily with increasing da when da 0 01 t3 can occur before the break in slope shown in fig 2 when cleanup time is controlled by advective flushing only when da 0 01 t3 is always in the slowly declining portion of the flush out curve after the slope break when cleanup time is influenced by both the advective flux in the high k zone and the diffusive flux out of the low k zone in the database t2 occurs before the slope break in about 15 of the simulations resulting in low values of t2 tm for the remainder of the database where t2 occurs after the break in slope t2 tm is higher and more variable 3 4 regression analysis a regression analysis is performed using jmp pro sall et al 2017 to identify the independent variables that have the greatest influence on cleanup time and develop simplified relationships to aid in interpreting both field characterization and simulation results preliminary analyses indicate that most of the model input parameters are correlated with cleanup time p 0 01 and their inclusion in the regression model would improve precision however interpreting a complex regression model with multiple sometimes poorly characterized inputs can be challenging in this work regression models are developed with the minimum number of inputs that provide an acceptable estimate of cleanup time acceptable is judged against the typical uncertainty in aquifer characteristics at remediation sites toom can be estimated using eq 1a for the lg and eq 1b for bg 1a ln t oom c 1 c 2 ln t m c 3 ln t d 1b ln t oom c 1 c 2 ln t m c 3 ln γ where tm is the mass residence time td is the diffusion time and γ is the ratio of the low k to high k contaminant mass ordinary linear regression estimates of c1 to c3 are presented in table 4 for the lg and bg also included in table 4 are the standard error of the estimate se for each coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and the 90 confidence interval ci of the ratio tregress tremchlor it is not possible to fit a single relationship to the full range of da for lg lg regression coefficients are presented for t1 for da 1 and for t2 with da 0 1 by limiting regression dataset to da greater than the threshold we eliminate data points close to the source where back diffusion does not exert a major influence on cleanup time and t1 and t2 are less than 10 yr cleanup times calculated with remchlor md and eq 1 regress toom for lg and bg are compared in fig 8 eq 1 explains 97 99 in of the variation in ln toom for lg and 93 94 of the variation for bg 90 of the regression estimates are within a factor of 2 of the remchlor md results of t1 t2 and t3 for both lg and bg for lg eq 1 may overestimate t1 for da 1 and t2 for da 0 1 note that in eq 1 tm td and γ reflect the collective influence of dm τ kh x f nl b θh θl rh and rl on toom interestingly the impact of contaminant loading time tl is different between the two considered low k geometries for bg tl is incorporated in the tm and γ terms for lg addition of tl improved r2 by less than 0 0005 and tl was not included in the final regression model the limited impact of tl on cleanup time is not surprising since the median value of td is 1 4 yr for lg when tl td the high k and low k layers will approach equilibrium and changes in tl will have little impact on toom ln tt and ln th are also correlated with ln toom table 3 and regression equations could be developed based on these time parameters however tm provides the best prediction when there are significant variations in θ and r note that when rh rl 1 tm th the impacts of tm and td on toom are illustrated in fig 9a for lg downgradient from the source where da is within the allowable range for the regression equations toom is calculated with eq 1a for td 0 03 1 4 and 45 yr which correspond to the 5 50 and 95 percentile values of td in the database t1 is not plotted for td 45 yr because da 1 and the regression equation for t1 is less accurate in this region downgradient of the source tm 5 yr t1 t2 and t3 increase nearly linearly with tm order of magnitude increases in td result in substantial increases in t2 and t3 similar to results observed for the base case simulations fig 4 for the bg fig 9b shows plots of toom versus tm generated with eq 1b for γ 0 3 1 5 and 6 8 which correspond to the 5 50 and 95 percentile values of γ in the dataset similar to the base case results fig 4 t1 increases linearly with tm and is relatively insensitive to γ t3 increases much more rapidly with tm and is more sensitive to γ resulting in very long cleanup times for large values of γ cleanup times increase when contaminants diffuse deep into the low k boundary prior to source removal long tl large d low rl or when q is small these results are consistent with numerical simulation results by halloran and hunkeler 2020 who found that diffusive mass transport with low k zones had the greatest impact on concentrations in monitor wells when darcy velocity and b are small or d is large 3 5 decay in low k zones sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of variations in the 1st order decay rate in the low k zone λl on toom λl was varied between 0 001 and 1 per yr half life between 690 and 0 69 yr the cleanup time ratio for decay ctrλ is used to evaluate the impact of λl on toom while keeping all other parameters identical 2 ctr λ t oom for λ l 0 t oom for λ l 0 sensitivity analysis results reveal that reductions in ctrλ are a function of λltd fig 10 shows ctrλ plotted versus λltd for lg and bg for both lg and bg decay has minor impact on toom when λltd 0 01 under certain conditions the impacts of degradation on ctrλ can be estimated with the relationship ln ctrλ c4 c5 ln λltd ordinary linear regression estimates for c4 and c5 and goodness of fit statistics are presented in table 5 for t3 both lg and bg and t2 lg only the regressions provide reasonably precise estimates of ln ctrλ rmse 0 24 0 26 for t2 and t3 when λltd 0 01 for t1 both lg and bg and t2 bg only the regressions provided a relatively poor fit to the data and coefficients are not included in table 5 contaminant decay in low permeability zones can occur through both biotic and abiotic processes based on compound specific isotope analysis λl values for tce degradation were reported to vary between 0 03 and 8 75 yr in an aquitard in borden ontario canada wanner et al 2016 and between 0 1 and 0 15 yr in a thin clayey aquitard in florence sc usa wanner et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 reported λl values between 0 0002 and 0 04 yr for abiotic reduction of tce in low k unconsolidated sediments with higher rates in sediments with more organic carbon and reduced iron given typical values for td in lg and bg systems reported decay rates are sufficient to substantially reduce cleanup times in many systems 3 6 regression model evaluation chapman and parker 2013 present results from high resolution numerical simulations of forward and back diffusion for conditions equivalent to the lg and bg geometry for different values of rl λl and x fig 11 presents a comparison of t1 t2 and t3 values from chapman and parker 2013 and this work toom values were estimated using eq 1 for da within allowable ranges when λl 0 cleanup times were adjusted for decay using eq 2 overall the regression equations provide reasonably accurate estimates of toom for both geometries with r2 0 80 and normalized rmse 0 44 for pooled data the regression equations appear to slightly over estimate t3 for bg and underestimate t3 for lg however all regression estimates are within a factor of two of the chapman and parker values additional testing is needed to evaluate the regression model performance for a wider range of conditions 3 7 field examples results developed above are applied to two intensively characterized field sites where tce was released to the subsurface resulting in extensive contaminant plumes following source area isolation tce concentrations decline at both sites but more slowly than would be predicted based on advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption 3 7 1 low k layered geometry parker et al 2008 document the impacts of thin low k layers on cleanup time in a series of monitor wells located 40 m downgradient from where a tce plume was intercepted by a groundwater extraction treatment and reinjection system most contamination is present in a sandy zone containing thin low k clay layers porosity and linear equilibrium retardation factors were reported to be 0 35 and 1 6 for the high k zone and 0 4 and 3 9 for the low k zone respectively parker et al 2008 the non reactive transport velocity in the high k zone vh was estimated to range between 29 and 117 m yr based on a mass balance analysis and slug test results parker et al 2008 in our analysis the screened interval of the monitor well is represented as a 3 m thick heterogeneous aquifer with one 0 5 m thick embedded low k layer f 0 83 ld 0 25 m assuming d 0 009 m2 yr the characteristic diffusion time td is 6 9 yr the relatively large td is due to the high value of rl slowing mass transfer at 40 m downgradient tm is between 0 7 and 2 9 yr and da is between 0 1 and 0 4 estimated cleanup times based on eq 1 are t1 2 to 6 yr t2 8 to 21 yr and t3 19 to 42 yr monitoring results presented by parker et al 2008 and geosyntec 2020 show that tce gradually declined in monitor wells located 40 m downgradient of the groundwater reinjection system reaching 1 oom cleanup levels in 2 to 10 yr and 2 oom in 9 to over 18 yr consistent with eq 1 estimates these wells have not yet reached the 3 oom cleanup level so it is not possible to directly compare t3 estimates uncertainty in toom is primarily due to uncertainty in the groundwater velocity and low k retardation factor 3 7 2 low k boundary geometry chapman and parker 2005 document the results of back diffusion on aquifer cleanup time in a minimally heterogeneous aquifer underlain by a 20 m thick clayey silt aquitard the tce source area was isolated with a sheet piling barrier approximately 42 yr after the initial release porosity and linear retardation factor were reported to be 0 35 and 1 2 for the high k zone and 0 43 and 1 2 for the low k aquitard respectively non reactive travel time tt to two monitor wells mw 01 and mw 54 located 330 m downgradient was estimated to be 1 6 yr based on lab permeameter testing slug tests and borehole dilution tests within the sheet pile enclosure tce had migrated almost 3 m into the aquitard with the 50 break through point at approximately 1 2 m below the aquitard interface the measured profiles matched simulation results with d 0 009 m2 yr chapman and parker 2005 assuming a loading period tl of 42 yr and d 0 009 m2 yr the estimated value of ld is 1 2 m similar to the 50 break through point observed by chapman and parker 2005 for mw 01 which has a 1 5 m long well screen b 1 5 m γ 0 8 tm 3 8 yr da 0 09 t1 3 yr t2 13 yr and t3 119 yr for mw 54 which has a 3 m well screen b 3 0 m γ 0 4 tm 2 9 yr da 0 07 t1 2 5 yr t2 8 yr and t3 83 yr monitoring results reported by chapman and parker 2005 show tce concentrations declined by about 1 oom in 3 yr after source isolation followed by a slower tailing period where concentrations were stable or declined very slowly which is generally consistent with the eq 1 estimates neither well mw 01 or mw 54 had reached 2 or 3 oom cleanup levels so it is not possible to directly compare cleanup time estimates the greatest source of uncertainty in the eq 1 estimates is the variation in tce concentration over time prior to source isolation monitoring and modeling results by chapman and parker 2005 indicate that tce concentrations were highest shortly after the initial release then declined over time as the source area was depleted by natural flushing in our analysis the source concentration is assumed constant for the entire loading period so estimated concentrations will decline more rapidly than in the field 4 conceptual model and conclusions a simplified conceptual model cm is proposed to aid site managers in evaluating the impact of back diffusion in unconsolidated sedimentary formations on the time after complete source removal for contaminant concentrations in monitor wells to decline by 1 2 and 3 oom toom while models that simulate the underlying physical processes can provide quantitative estimates of toom implementation of these models requires significant resources for site characterization high resolution model development calibration and interpretation of simulation results our cm allows site managers to quickly evaluate if back diffusion substantially increases cleanup time at their site by how much and what site characterization information is most important for estimating cleanup time in the cm the contaminated aquifer is represented by three key parameters 1 mass residence time tm 2 diffusion time td 3 ratio of low k to high k contaminant mass storage γ tm is equal to the total contaminant mass stored in high and low k zones divided by the downgradient mass flux for the layered geometry lg td is calculated as td rl ld 2 4d where rl is the low k retardation factor ld is half the thickness of the low k layers and d is the effective diffusion coefficient for the boundary geometry bg td tl ld 4 73 tl 0 75 tt d rl 0 5 and γ rl θl ld rh θh b all parameters are calculated at the end of the contaminant loading period tl toom is influenced by both advection in the high k zone and diffusion out of the low k zone more rapid advective flushing smaller tm reduces the contaminant concentration in the high k zone increasing the concentration gradient and diffusive mass flux out of the low k region reducing t3 more rapid diffusion lower td increases advective flushing efficiency reducing t3 the 1st damköhler da is equal to tm td and provides a useful indicator of the relative importance of back diffusion on toom back diffusion has the greatest impacts on t3 when 0 01 da 0 1 with t3 tm varying generally between 20 and 100 then decreases with increasing da back diffusion has less impacts on t2 with limited influence on t1 when da is very large diffusion is fast relative to advection back diffusion does not substantially increase cleanup time and toom calculated with remchlor md approach values calculated with the traditional advection dispersion equation ade our simplified cm has important similarities with the power law model for source area treatment parker and park 2004 falta et al 2005 c t c 0 m t m 0 γ where ct is the time dependent average contaminant concentration leaving the source zone c0 is the initial concentration leaving the source zone mt is the time dependent mass in the source zone m0 is the initial mass in the source zone and the exponent γ is a fitting parameter that determines the shape of the discharge vs mass curve when γ 1 or da is large effluent concentrations remain high until most contaminant mass is removed similar to conventional ade behavior when γ 1 or da is small effluent concentrations drop rapidly at first while substantial contaminant mass remains then decline more slowly resulting in extensive tailing of the flush out curve when γ 1 or da 1 effluent concentrations decline in proportion to the mass removed similar to a continuously stirred tank reactor the cm allows some generalizations about the effects of back diffusion on cleanup time for lg and bg 1 back diffusion has limited impacts on t1 2 for lg td is commonly smaller than tm da 1 mass transfer between low k and high k zones is more rapid than advective flushing and back diffusion will have less impacts on cleanup time 3 for lg tm is a function of the total discharge q per unit width through the aquifer and does not require precise estimates of the high k fraction f of the aquifer 4 for bg td tl td is commonly greater than tm da 1 and back diffusion may greatly increase t3 parameters that increase γ larger tl larger d smaller b will increase t3 5 contaminant decay in low k zones can substantially reduce cleanup times when λltd is large however decay will have minimal impact on toom when λltd 0 01 given typical values for td in lg and bg systems previously reported decay rates are sufficient to substantially reduce t3 the cm has several important limitations that need to be considered when applying this approach to a specific site 1 the cm was developed based on 1d simulations using remchlor md falta et al 2018 and all results are subject to the limitations of this approach 2 the regression equations are developed to estimate the time to reach 1 2 and 3 oom reductions in the vertically averaged concentrations in monitor wells when vertical dispersivity is low concentrations immediately adjoining low k zones will be higher and longer time periods may be required to reduce concentrations near low k interfaces 3 the parameter ranges used to generate the lg and bg datasets are intended to cover a broad range of conditions that may occur in unconsolidated sedimentary formations and so the datasets include some extreme values that may not be representative of typical site conditions toom estimates at the extreme limits of the datasets will be less reliable 4 in layered aquifers the lg regression equations are most accurate for td 0 5tl when layer td 2tl toom is more accurately estimated using the bg regressions for td between 0 5tl and 2tl behavior is intermediate between lg and bg 5 in all simulations the contaminant concentration discharging from the source area was constant for the loading period tl then was reduced to zero yang et al 2016 showed that gradual changes in contaminant source strength over time influence back diffusion rates with greater diffusive flux for rapidly depleting sources 6 in this cm groundwater velocity in low k zones is assumed to be zero however under certain conditions slow advection through low k zones can substantially increase mass transfer between high and low k zones li et al 1994 guswa and freyberg 2000 potentially reducing cleanup times research is needed to better understand when slow advection

1365,back diffusion of groundwater contaminants from low permeability k zones can be a major factor controlling the time to reach cleanup goals in downgradient monitor wells we identify the aquifer and contaminant characteristics that have the greatest influence on the time toom after complete source removal for contaminant concentrations to decline by 1 2 and 3 orders of magnitude t1 t2 and t3 two aquifer configurations are evaluated a layered geometry lg with finite thickness low k layers and b boundary geometry bg with thick semi infinite low k boundaries a semi analytical modeling approach muskus and falta 2018 is used to simulate the concentration decline following source removal for a range of conditions and generate 21 000 independent values of t1 t2 and t3 linear regression is applied to interpret this large dataset and develop simple relationships to estimate toom from three characteristic parameters the mass residence time tm diffusion time td and ratio of low k to high k mass storage γ tm is most important predictor of t1 t2 and t3 for both geometries and is equal to the combined high and low k contaminant mass divided by the mass flux at the end of the loading period tl for lg t3 is strongly influenced by td rlld 2 4d where rl is the low k retardation factor ld is the half thickness of the embedded low k layers and d is the effective diffusion coefficient for bg t3 is strongly influenced by γ contaminant decay in low k zones can significantly reduce cleanup times when λltd 0 01 where λl is the effective first order decay rate in the low k zone the 1st damköhler da equal to tm td provides a useful indicator of the relative importance of back diffusion on toom back diffusion impacts are greatest on t3 when 0 01 da 0 1 then decrease with increasing da back diffusion has less impacts on t2 with limited influence on t1 the results are summarized in a simple conceptual model to aid in evaluating the impact of back diffusion on the time for concentrations to decline by 1 3 oom graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords back diffusion cleanup time sensitivity parameters damköhler 1 introduction diffusion can have major impacts on contaminant transport in unconsolidated sedimentary formations when the darcy velocity in low permeability k zones is very small as a groundwater plume advances downgradient through high k zones dissolved contaminants are transported by molecular diffusion into low k zones slowing the downgradient migration of the contaminant plume however once the contaminant source is greatly reduced contaminants diffuse out of low k zones slowing the cleanup rate in the high k zone grisak and pickens 1980 this process termed back diffusion can greatly extend cleanup times following source removal especially for chlorinated solvents where large reductions in contaminant concentrations are required to meet remediation goals the impacts of back diffusion on aquifer cleanup times have been documented in several detailed field studies mackay et al 2000 demonstrated that back diffusion from an underlying clayey aquitard increased the groundwater cleanup time for a pump and treat system enclosed within a sheet pile test cell model predictions based on diffusion of contaminant within the aquitard were consistent with measured concentration profiles liu and ball 2002 at a dnapl site in connecticut chapman and parker 2005 reported that trichloroethylene tce concentrations in downgradient wells declined by roughly 1 order of magnitude oom when the upgradient source area was isolated with sheet piling however after this initial decline tce concentrations appeared to plateau or decline more slowly consistent with back diffusion from an underlying aquitard numerical simulations indicate that back diffusion will cause tce concentrations in downgradient wells to remain above target cleanup levels for centuries parker et al 2008 showed that back diffusion of tce from the thin low k beds will significantly delay groundwater cleanup at a well characterized tce site in florida following complete source isolation with an innovative hydraulic capture system the physics of back diffusion and impacts on aquifer cleanup have been examined in several well controlled laboratory experiments doner 2008 measured the impacts of back diffusion on aquifer cleanup rate in a 1 07 m long laboratory tank containing a continuous sand body with suspended clay zones a bromide and fluorescein tracer solution was flushed through the tank for 22 days followed by clean water for 100 days the lower diffusion coefficient for fluorescein 5 5e 10 m2 s compared to bromide 20 1e 10 m2 s resulted in more extensive tailing of the fluorescein break through curve yang et al 2015 measured diffusion driven solute transport between a high k sand and thin low k layers of varying thickness 1 5 2 and 6 cm in 0 28 m long laboratory tank experiments with rapid flushing of the high k layer 0 65 pore volumes day mass flux from the low k layer to the high k layer was well described by analytical solutions using the method of images tatti et al 2018 measured back diffusion rates in a 0 68 m laboratory tank containing low k lenses in a continuous high k aquifer increasing the solute transport velocity from 5 to 20 m d increased diffusive flux by more rapidly removing the solute from the high k zone near the low k interface the effects of back diffusion on cleanup time can be evaluated using existing analytical sale et al 2008 farhat et al 2012 and numerical models chapman et al 2012 demonstrate that high resolution numerical models can accurately simulate the back diffusion process and predict concentration changes over 3 oom in heterogeneous sand tank experiments doner 2008 when the source condition and low k zone geometry is accurately incorporated in the models however the high concentration gradients near the high low k interface require a fine vertical discretization to accurately simulate back diffusion farhat et al 2020 muskus and falta 2018 develop a semi analytical modeling approach to simulate the effects of diffusion in low k zones on solute concentrations in the more transmissive zones contaminant concentration profiles in extensive low k aquitards and finite thickness embedded low k zones are represented with a fitting function that is adjusted at each timestep the resulting diffusion fluxes are added to the numerical model as linear concentration dependent source sink terms eliminating the need for fine discretization of the low k region greatly reducing computation time simulation results closely match results from laboratory experiments with layered systems yang et al 2015 and irregularly shaped low k lenses doner 2008 fine grid numerical simulations and analytical solutions for diffusion in fractured rock and with parent daughter decay reactions muskus and falta 2018 halloran and hunkeler 2020 recognize that the interplay between advection diffusion sorption and degradation processes will control plume persistence and use a high resolution numerical model to examine the impact of simultaneously varying five key input parameters layer thickness aquifer k retardation factor decay rate λ and diffusion coefficient dm requiring 288 model runs for three different aquifer geometries to aid in interpreting this large and complex dataset results are presented in a series of color maps and reduced dimension variables for key performance metrics visual evaluation of these results indicates that back diffusion impacts on cleanup time are greatest in thin confined high k zones with lower groundwater velocity larger dm and lower λ in summary physically based analytical and numerical models can reproduce the results of controlled laboratory experiments and well characterized field investigations of back diffusion the underlying physics indicate that aquifer cleanup times will be controlled by the physical characteristics of both the higher and lower permeability zones hydraulic gradient i permeability k porosity θ and layer geometry chemical properties of the contaminant and aquifer material molecular diffusion coefficient dm effective tortuosity τ linear equilibrium retardation factor r and effective first order decay rate λ and site characteristics contaminant loading period tl contaminant source concentration cs remediation goals and distance to the monitoring or compliance point x generating accurate estimates for each of these parameters is an overwhelming challenge at most remediation sites to effectively apply these models for site management we must identify the model input parameters that have the greatest impact on simulation results and prioritize characterization resources on those key parameters here we identify the aquifer contaminant and site characteristics that have the greatest impact on the time after complete source removal toom for contaminant concentrations at a specified compliance point to decline by 1 2 and 3 orders of magnitude oom we vary all key input parameters influencing back diffusion over realistic ranges for unconsolidated sedimentary formations generating a large database of toom values statistical analysis of this database provides insights into the dominant processes influencing cleanup time after source removal we demonstrate that toom is strongly correlated with characteristic scaling parameters and can be estimated using simple regression models we identify the aquifer and contaminant characteristics that have the greatest impact on toom and the conditions when individual processes are most important these results can guide site characterization efforts and aid in interpreting model output for a broad range of site conditions and contaminants 2 approach numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the effects of diffusive mass transfer between high and low k zones on the time to reach varying cleanup levels for a range of site conditions cleanup time toom is calculated as the time after complete source elimination for contaminant concentrations to decline by 1 2 and 3 orders of magnitude t1 t2 and t3 in downgradient monitor wells the contaminant source concentration is assumed to be constant for a loading period tl then completely removed causing the concentration entering the downgradient aquifer to immediately drop to zero oom reductions are calculated based on the contaminant concentration at the well at the time the source is eliminated for example if the concentration in a monitoring well was 5000 μg l when the source was eliminated then t3 is the time required for the concentration to decline to 5 μg l a factor of 1000 reduction or 3 ooms the variation in high k zone contaminant concentrations with time is determined using the modeling approach developed by muskus and falta 2018 and incorporated in remchlor md falta et al 2018 advection dispersion linear equilibrium sorption and 1st order decay in the mobile zone are simulated with a finite difference solution to the advection dispersion equation diffusion fluxes for each cell are calculated using the semi analytical approach developed by muskus and falta 2018 groundwater velocity in the low k zone is zero in all simulations mass transfer between the high and low k zones occurs by molecular diffusion with an effective diffusion coefficient d d τ d m where dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient in ground water at the ambient temperature and τ is the tortuosity coefficient in all simulations dm 9 1e 10 m2 s 0 029 m2 yr a representative value for trichloroethylene falta et al 2018 d is lower than dm due to increased diffusion distance along tortuous diffusion paths and increased viscosity in narrow pores grathwohl 1998 τ is commonly reported to vary between 0 2 and 0 5 grathwohl 1998 carey et al 2016 however values less than 0 1 have been reported for soils with 25 clay ayral and demond 2014 two aquifer geometries are evaluated fig 1 a layered geometry lg and b boundary geometry bg for lg the embedded low k layers are sufficiently thin such that the average contaminant concentration in the low k zone approaches the average high k zone concentration by the end of the loading period for bg the semi infinite low k boundaries are sufficiently thick that solutes diffusing into this zone do not reach the layer boundary within the simulation period for the bg the homogeneous aquifer has a thickness b and is bounded on one side by a semi infinite boundary monitor wells located a distance x downgradient of the source represent the vertically averaged concentration in the high k zone ch 2 1 typical simulation results fig 2a shows a typical contaminant break through curve btc in a monitor well located 100 m downgradient of the source for the boundary geometry bg for this example the high k aquifer is 3 m thick k 0 02 cm s and the monitor well has a 3 m long screen 1d results δx 1 m are compared with vertically averaged concentrations from two dimensional 2d vertical profile simulations δx 1 m δz 0 1 m with two different values of vertical dispersivity αv the normalized contaminant concentration ch cs is equal to the average contaminant concentration in the high k zone ch divided by the source concentration cs all other parameters are for the base case condition presented in table 1 for both the 1d and 2d simulations fig 2a ch cs increases rapidly reaching 1 within a few years remains high for the 50 yr loading period and then rapidly declines once the source is eliminated similar to simulation results by chapman and parker 2005 at 60 yr 10 yr after source removal there is a slope break in the ch cs curve and contaminant concentrations begin to decline more slowly in this example ch cs declined by 1 oom at 56 yr 2 oom at 95 yr and 3 oom at 255 yr so t1 6 yr t2 45 yr and t3 205 yr in most simulations t1 occurs before the slope break and is controlled by advective flushing of the high k zone while t3 generally occurs after the slope break and is influenced by both the advective flux in the high k zone and the diffusive flux out of the low k zone t2 may occur before or after the slope break depending on aquifer and site characteristics one dimensional 1d simulation results δx 1 m closely match vertically averaged concentrations in 2d simulations with vertical dispersivity αv 0 001 m normalized root mean square error nrmse 8 9 and αv 0 01 m nrmse 4 1 t1 t2 and t3 differ by 1 8 and 6 between the 1d simulation and 2d simulation with αv 0 001 m fig 2b shows concentration profiles for αv 0 01 and 0 001 m at t 100 yr and x 100 m concentrations are highest immediately adjoining the low k boundary then decrease rapidly with distance when αv 0 01 m most contaminant mass is within 2 m of the low k boundary these results illustrate that 1d simulation results closely approximate 2d results when essentially all contaminants released from the low k boundary remain within the screened interval of the monitoring well i e b monitor well screened interval increasing the aquifer thickness to greater than 3 m reduces the vertically averaged concentration by dilution with uncontaminated water in the sensitivity analyses 1d simulations with a maximum aquifer thickness of 3 m are used to reduce computation times 2 2 sensitivity analysis database model input parameters evaluated in the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 1 a base case set of simulations is first conducted where kh x f nl and b are varied to reflect the effects of aquifer geometry on toom generating 840 individual values of t1 t2 and t3 each base case simulation is then repeated for each value of θh θl rh rl τ tl and λl shown in table 1 when the toom is greater than the 1000 yr simulation period these values are excluded resulting in a total of 21 000 individual values of t1 t2 and t3 for use in the regression analyses statistical moments for parameters in the dataset without decay λl 0 are summarized in tables s 1 for lg and s 2 for bg many of the key indicator parameters are log normally distributed and so ln transformed values are also presented for bg preliminary results showed that toom values are identical for an aquifer of thickness b with one low k boundary and an aquifer of thickness 2b with two low k boundaries so the number of boundaries is not varied the bg aquifer thickness b is varied from 0 5 to 3 m for lg the parameters x f and nl are varied to reflect the effect of aquifer geometry on toom for lg the aquifer thickness b is constant at 3 0 m equivalent to the length of common monitor well screens the lg aquifer contains nl low k layers of thickness 2ld b 1 f nl where f is the volume fraction of the high k zone so low k layer thickness varies between 0 075 and 2 7 m for both lg and bg x and kh were varied to cover a broad ranges of site conditions so the datasets also include some extreme values for example the high k zone non reactive travel time tt to the monitoring or compliance point varies from 0 1 to 21 yr while this range is physically plausible it is unlikely that a compliance point would be established 0 1 or 21 yr travel time away from the source by including some extreme values in the dataset we ensure the regression relationships accurately reflect model behavior for a broad range of conditions for both lg and bg a fifty year loading period tl is selected for the base case which is equivalent to a spill occurring in 1970 with complete 100 source removal in 2020 in the sensitivity analysis tl values of 25 and 100 yr are also evaluated the transverse dispersivity equal to zero in all simulations to eliminate the effects of transverse dispersion the longitudinal dispersivity αl is constant at 1 m allowing limited longitudinal dispersion zech et al 2015 2 3 scaling parameters to assist with interpretation of the modeling results we identify a set of scaling parameters for a unit width aquifer based on the geometry of the high and low k zones distance from the source to the monitoring point x high k porosity θh low k porosity θl high k retardation factor rh and low k retardation factor rl characteristic time scales include the high k travel time tt hydraulic retention time th mass retention time tm and loading period tl tt th and tm in years are defined as t t pv h q t h pv h pv l q t m r h pv h r l pv l q based on the high k pore volume pvh low k pore volume pvl and volumetric discharge per unit width through the aquifer q characteristic scaling ratios include the ratio of low k to high k zone thickness α ratio of low k to high k pore volume β and ratio of low k to high k contaminant mass storage γ defined at the end of the loading period tl for lg the characteristic diffusion length ld is equal to half the low k layer thickness and is independent of time allowing us to calculate a characteristic diffusion time td where td rlld 2 4d for the bg the volume of the contaminated low k zone will increase over time as contaminants diffuse deeper into the semi infinite low k boundary so ld will increase with tl for bg we define td tl and l d mass stored in low k boundary at end of loading period t l source concentration r l θ l width x in supporting information fig s 1 we show that for tl 0 75 rhtt ld can be estimated using the relationship ld 4 73 tl 0 75 rhtt d rl 0 5 the 1st damköhler number is a dimensionless parameter used to relate reaction rates to transport rates in this work we define da as tm td characteristic time and length scales for lg and bg are defined in table 2 box whisker plots showing the distribution of the scaling parameters for lg and bg datasets without decay λl 0 are shown in fig 3 for lg median advection times tt th tm vary from 2 to 8 yr while median cleanup times vary from 12 yr for t1 to 37 yr for t3 the relatively narrow range between the median 1 and 3 oom cleanup time implies that mass transfer is often relatively rapid for the layered geometry which is consistent with the relatively short median diffusion time td of 1 4 yr median advection times tt th tm for bg vary from 2 to 8 yr similar to the embedded geometry however median cleanup times for bg are much more variable ranging from 5 yr for t1 to 217 yr for t3 the large difference between 1 and 3 oom cleanup times for bg implies that diffusive mass transfer is often slow relative to advection the largest difference between the lg and bg datasets is for td for lg td varied from 0 02 to 227 yr causing da tm td to vary by 5 oom for bg td varied from 25 to 100 yr causing da to vary over a narrower range 0 004 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 base case simulations fig 4 shows selected results from the remchlor md simulations for the base case conditions for lg and bg toom is a function of the hydraulic retention time th and diffusion length ld for lg and a function of the th and b for bg note that for the base case conditions rh rl 1 so tm th for both lg and bg the data points for each curve are individual simulation results for x between 25 and 150 m and kh between 0 01 and 0 1 cm s for constant values of ld and b the points plot on a smooth curve indicating x and kh are not important predictors of toom for the base case lg the time to 1 oom cleanup t1 varies approximately linearly with th and is relatively insensitive to ld indicating diffusive transport between high and low k zones is not the primary control on cleanup time for the 1st oom reduction t2 and t3 also vary with th but are more sensitive to ld indicating the diffusive transport becomes more important when larger oom reductions are required for larger th t2 and t3 are linear functions of th implying advective transport controls cleanup time however for smaller th t2 and t3 increase much more rapidly with th consistent with solute diffusion between high and low k zones influencing cleanup time for the base case bg t1 t2 and t3 are primarily controlled by th and to a lesser extent b similar to the layered geometry t1 increases approximately linearly with th indicating cleanup is controlled by advective transport t2 and t3 increase approximately in proportion to the square root of th and increase with smaller values of b as diffusive flux from the low k boundary becomes more significant relative to advective flux in the high k zone 3 2 parameter sensitivity the results presented above illustrate that cleanup time is due to complex interactions between advective and diffusive transport processes traditional sensitivity analyses where a single parameter is varied while all others remain constant may not reveal the complex interactions that can occur to provide a more robust evaluation of parameter sensitivity the distribution of toom values for the base case is compared with toom distributions for each value of θh θl rh rl τ tl and λl to aid in interpreting these results box whisker plots are presented showing the median value 25 75 quartiles and 5 95 limits of the toom distribution for several important parameters fig 5 for presentation in fig 5 toom values greater than 1000 yr are entered as 1000 yr in general the time to reach 1 oom cleanup t1 is relatively insensitive to most model parameters for both lg and bg this is likely due to the relatively minor impacts of back diffusion on t1 in contrast model parameters have a much greater impact on t3 since t3 is much more strongly influenced by back diffusion t3 is often much greater for bg than lg indicating back diffusion is a much more important process in aquifers with thick low k boundaries increasing contaminant loading period tl results in variable impacts on cleanup time for lg increasing tl results in minor increases in t1 t2 and t3 for bg increasing tl results in substantial increases in t3 but variable impacts on t1 and t2 for bg longer tl results in greater penetration of contaminants into the low k boundary and increases the duration of back diffusion for lg the characteristic diffusion time td is often less than tl so further increases in tl do not have a substantial impact on the toom distributions changes in tortuosity τ have a complex relationship with toom for the base case simulations τ 0 7 and d 0 02 m2 yr reducing τ to 0 07 reduces d to 0 002 m2 yr increasing td for lg by 3 16 100 5 in some lg cases an increase in td can shift the process from advection dominated to diffusion dominated increasing toom for bg reducing τ by a factor of 10 reduces ld by a factor of 3 16 which leads to a reduction in the mass stored in the low k boundary reducing cleanup time changes in the low k retardation factor rl can also have unexpected impacts on toom for lg increasing rl corresponds with an increase in t1 t2 and t3 with the largest impact on t3 however for bg increasing rl corresponds with more modest increases in t1 t2 and t3 with the least impact on t3 the limited impact on t3 is related to the reduced diffusion length ld with larger rl changes in the low k porosity θl have a more consistent impact on toom increasing θl increases the mass stored in low k zones for lg increasing t1 t2 and t3 for bg increasing θl results in an increase in t3 but has very limited impacts on t1 increases in the low k contaminant decay rate λl for lg result in minor reductions in t1 with somewhat greater reductions for t2 and t3 for bg increasing λl has minor impacts on t1 greater impacts on t2 and can result in very large reductions in t3 especially for λl 1 yr the much greater impact of λl on t3 for lg is due to the much greater impact of back diffusion on cleanup time for this geometry 3 3 scaling parameter analysis results from the base case simulations and sensitivity analysis show that back diffusion has a much greater impact on t3 than t1 and the ratio t3 t1 is large when back diffusion has a major influence on toom in fig 6 t3 t1 is plotted versus the first damköhler number da for both lg and bg with no decay λl 0 note that at an individual site td is constant so da increases linearly with distance from the source the ratio t3 t1 is very sensitive to da varying over 2 oom in a small number of bg cases near the source when velocity is high da 0 01 t3 t1 is reduced indicating limited impacts of back diffusion with increased travel time lower kh and or larger x t3 t1 increases reaching a maximum in the range 0 01 da 0 1 for both lg and bg for lg t3 t1 declines as da increases eventually approaching 1 for very large da a similar pattern appears to occur for bg however the range of da in the bg dataset is much smaller so it is not possible to determine if t3 t1 continues to decline for large values of da a correlation analysis was conducted to identify relationships between different scaling parameters and toom table 3 shows correlation coefficients r between ln toom and scaling parameters for both geometries with no decay λl 0 for lg ln t1 is strongly correlated with ln tm and weakly correlated with ln td implying that t1 is primarily controlled by advective flushing for lg the correlation between ln tm and ln t2 and ln t3 is reduced while the correlation with ln td increases indicating diffusion is a more important influence on cleanup time for large oom reductions for bg ln toom is strongly correlated with ln tm for 1 2 and 3 oom indicating the advective flux is a major influence for all cleanup levels ln td is a poor predictor of ln toom for bg possibly due to the relatively limited range of td considered here 25 to 100 yr note that ln γ is a better predictor of ln toom and γ is a function of td for bg ln da is strongly correlated with ln toom because it is strongly correlated with tm r 0 99 the impact of tm on cleanup time is illustrated in fig 7 where toom is plotted versus tm and toom tm is plotted versus da for both lg and bg with no decay λl 0 the strong correlation between toom and tm is evident for both lg and bg by dividing toom by tm we eliminate the primary impact of advective flushing and can look for secondary impacts of diffusion limited mass transfer for lg the ratio of toom tm varies with da and can be separated into three regions when da is very large 100 diffusive mass transfer from the low k zone to the high k zone is rapid relative to advection t1 tm t2 tm and t3 tm all decline to less than 1 5 similar to values predicted by the advection dispersion equation ade with αl 1 m ade results not shown when da 0 1 t1 tm and t2 tm are highly variable and small values occur under certain conditions we hypothesize that for small da the average concentration in the high k zone approaches zero the low k concentration gradient and diffusive flux reach a maximum and further increases in the advective flux only dilutes contaminants released from the low k zone reducing time to reach 1 and 2 oom reductions between the extreme behavior observed for very high and very low da cleanup time is influenced by both advection in the high k zone and diffusion in the low k zone the maximum values of t2 tm and t3 tm occur for da 0 01 then decrease as da increases as discussed below it is not possible to fit a single function to the full range of da for bg td tl so td varies over a relatively narrow range 25 to 100 yr and da is generally less than 1 t1 tm generally varies between 0 3 and 3 and does not correlate with da t3 tm may be low for very small da reaches a maximum near da 0 01 then decreases steadily with increasing da when da 0 01 t3 can occur before the break in slope shown in fig 2 when cleanup time is controlled by advective flushing only when da 0 01 t3 is always in the slowly declining portion of the flush out curve after the slope break when cleanup time is influenced by both the advective flux in the high k zone and the diffusive flux out of the low k zone in the database t2 occurs before the slope break in about 15 of the simulations resulting in low values of t2 tm for the remainder of the database where t2 occurs after the break in slope t2 tm is higher and more variable 3 4 regression analysis a regression analysis is performed using jmp pro sall et al 2017 to identify the independent variables that have the greatest influence on cleanup time and develop simplified relationships to aid in interpreting both field characterization and simulation results preliminary analyses indicate that most of the model input parameters are correlated with cleanup time p 0 01 and their inclusion in the regression model would improve precision however interpreting a complex regression model with multiple sometimes poorly characterized inputs can be challenging in this work regression models are developed with the minimum number of inputs that provide an acceptable estimate of cleanup time acceptable is judged against the typical uncertainty in aquifer characteristics at remediation sites toom can be estimated using eq 1a for the lg and eq 1b for bg 1a ln t oom c 1 c 2 ln t m c 3 ln t d 1b ln t oom c 1 c 2 ln t m c 3 ln γ where tm is the mass residence time td is the diffusion time and γ is the ratio of the low k to high k contaminant mass ordinary linear regression estimates of c1 to c3 are presented in table 4 for the lg and bg also included in table 4 are the standard error of the estimate se for each coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and the 90 confidence interval ci of the ratio tregress tremchlor it is not possible to fit a single relationship to the full range of da for lg lg regression coefficients are presented for t1 for da 1 and for t2 with da 0 1 by limiting regression dataset to da greater than the threshold we eliminate data points close to the source where back diffusion does not exert a major influence on cleanup time and t1 and t2 are less than 10 yr cleanup times calculated with remchlor md and eq 1 regress toom for lg and bg are compared in fig 8 eq 1 explains 97 99 in of the variation in ln toom for lg and 93 94 of the variation for bg 90 of the regression estimates are within a factor of 2 of the remchlor md results of t1 t2 and t3 for both lg and bg for lg eq 1 may overestimate t1 for da 1 and t2 for da 0 1 note that in eq 1 tm td and γ reflect the collective influence of dm τ kh x f nl b θh θl rh and rl on toom interestingly the impact of contaminant loading time tl is different between the two considered low k geometries for bg tl is incorporated in the tm and γ terms for lg addition of tl improved r2 by less than 0 0005 and tl was not included in the final regression model the limited impact of tl on cleanup time is not surprising since the median value of td is 1 4 yr for lg when tl td the high k and low k layers will approach equilibrium and changes in tl will have little impact on toom ln tt and ln th are also correlated with ln toom table 3 and regression equations could be developed based on these time parameters however tm provides the best prediction when there are significant variations in θ and r note that when rh rl 1 tm th the impacts of tm and td on toom are illustrated in fig 9a for lg downgradient from the source where da is within the allowable range for the regression equations toom is calculated with eq 1a for td 0 03 1 4 and 45 yr which correspond to the 5 50 and 95 percentile values of td in the database t1 is not plotted for td 45 yr because da 1 and the regression equation for t1 is less accurate in this region downgradient of the source tm 5 yr t1 t2 and t3 increase nearly linearly with tm order of magnitude increases in td result in substantial increases in t2 and t3 similar to results observed for the base case simulations fig 4 for the bg fig 9b shows plots of toom versus tm generated with eq 1b for γ 0 3 1 5 and 6 8 which correspond to the 5 50 and 95 percentile values of γ in the dataset similar to the base case results fig 4 t1 increases linearly with tm and is relatively insensitive to γ t3 increases much more rapidly with tm and is more sensitive to γ resulting in very long cleanup times for large values of γ cleanup times increase when contaminants diffuse deep into the low k boundary prior to source removal long tl large d low rl or when q is small these results are consistent with numerical simulation results by halloran and hunkeler 2020 who found that diffusive mass transport with low k zones had the greatest impact on concentrations in monitor wells when darcy velocity and b are small or d is large 3 5 decay in low k zones sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of variations in the 1st order decay rate in the low k zone λl on toom λl was varied between 0 001 and 1 per yr half life between 690 and 0 69 yr the cleanup time ratio for decay ctrλ is used to evaluate the impact of λl on toom while keeping all other parameters identical 2 ctr λ t oom for λ l 0 t oom for λ l 0 sensitivity analysis results reveal that reductions in ctrλ are a function of λltd fig 10 shows ctrλ plotted versus λltd for lg and bg for both lg and bg decay has minor impact on toom when λltd 0 01 under certain conditions the impacts of degradation on ctrλ can be estimated with the relationship ln ctrλ c4 c5 ln λltd ordinary linear regression estimates for c4 and c5 and goodness of fit statistics are presented in table 5 for t3 both lg and bg and t2 lg only the regressions provide reasonably precise estimates of ln ctrλ rmse 0 24 0 26 for t2 and t3 when λltd 0 01 for t1 both lg and bg and t2 bg only the regressions provided a relatively poor fit to the data and coefficients are not included in table 5 contaminant decay in low permeability zones can occur through both biotic and abiotic processes based on compound specific isotope analysis λl values for tce degradation were reported to vary between 0 03 and 8 75 yr in an aquitard in borden ontario canada wanner et al 2016 and between 0 1 and 0 15 yr in a thin clayey aquitard in florence sc usa wanner et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 reported λl values between 0 0002 and 0 04 yr for abiotic reduction of tce in low k unconsolidated sediments with higher rates in sediments with more organic carbon and reduced iron given typical values for td in lg and bg systems reported decay rates are sufficient to substantially reduce cleanup times in many systems 3 6 regression model evaluation chapman and parker 2013 present results from high resolution numerical simulations of forward and back diffusion for conditions equivalent to the lg and bg geometry for different values of rl λl and x fig 11 presents a comparison of t1 t2 and t3 values from chapman and parker 2013 and this work toom values were estimated using eq 1 for da within allowable ranges when λl 0 cleanup times were adjusted for decay using eq 2 overall the regression equations provide reasonably accurate estimates of toom for both geometries with r2 0 80 and normalized rmse 0 44 for pooled data the regression equations appear to slightly over estimate t3 for bg and underestimate t3 for lg however all regression estimates are within a factor of two of the chapman and parker values additional testing is needed to evaluate the regression model performance for a wider range of conditions 3 7 field examples results developed above are applied to two intensively characterized field sites where tce was released to the subsurface resulting in extensive contaminant plumes following source area isolation tce concentrations decline at both sites but more slowly than would be predicted based on advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption 3 7 1 low k layered geometry parker et al 2008 document the impacts of thin low k layers on cleanup time in a series of monitor wells located 40 m downgradient from where a tce plume was intercepted by a groundwater extraction treatment and reinjection system most contamination is present in a sandy zone containing thin low k clay layers porosity and linear equilibrium retardation factors were reported to be 0 35 and 1 6 for the high k zone and 0 4 and 3 9 for the low k zone respectively parker et al 2008 the non reactive transport velocity in the high k zone vh was estimated to range between 29 and 117 m yr based on a mass balance analysis and slug test results parker et al 2008 in our analysis the screened interval of the monitor well is represented as a 3 m thick heterogeneous aquifer with one 0 5 m thick embedded low k layer f 0 83 ld 0 25 m assuming d 0 009 m2 yr the characteristic diffusion time td is 6 9 yr the relatively large td is due to the high value of rl slowing mass transfer at 40 m downgradient tm is between 0 7 and 2 9 yr and da is between 0 1 and 0 4 estimated cleanup times based on eq 1 are t1 2 to 6 yr t2 8 to 21 yr and t3 19 to 42 yr monitoring results presented by parker et al 2008 and geosyntec 2020 show that tce gradually declined in monitor wells located 40 m downgradient of the groundwater reinjection system reaching 1 oom cleanup levels in 2 to 10 yr and 2 oom in 9 to over 18 yr consistent with eq 1 estimates these wells have not yet reached the 3 oom cleanup level so it is not possible to directly compare t3 estimates uncertainty in toom is primarily due to uncertainty in the groundwater velocity and low k retardation factor 3 7 2 low k boundary geometry chapman and parker 2005 document the results of back diffusion on aquifer cleanup time in a minimally heterogeneous aquifer underlain by a 20 m thick clayey silt aquitard the tce source area was isolated with a sheet piling barrier approximately 42 yr after the initial release porosity and linear retardation factor were reported to be 0 35 and 1 2 for the high k zone and 0 43 and 1 2 for the low k aquitard respectively non reactive travel time tt to two monitor wells mw 01 and mw 54 located 330 m downgradient was estimated to be 1 6 yr based on lab permeameter testing slug tests and borehole dilution tests within the sheet pile enclosure tce had migrated almost 3 m into the aquitard with the 50 break through point at approximately 1 2 m below the aquitard interface the measured profiles matched simulation results with d 0 009 m2 yr chapman and parker 2005 assuming a loading period tl of 42 yr and d 0 009 m2 yr the estimated value of ld is 1 2 m similar to the 50 break through point observed by chapman and parker 2005 for mw 01 which has a 1 5 m long well screen b 1 5 m γ 0 8 tm 3 8 yr da 0 09 t1 3 yr t2 13 yr and t3 119 yr for mw 54 which has a 3 m well screen b 3 0 m γ 0 4 tm 2 9 yr da 0 07 t1 2 5 yr t2 8 yr and t3 83 yr monitoring results reported by chapman and parker 2005 show tce concentrations declined by about 1 oom in 3 yr after source isolation followed by a slower tailing period where concentrations were stable or declined very slowly which is generally consistent with the eq 1 estimates neither well mw 01 or mw 54 had reached 2 or 3 oom cleanup levels so it is not possible to directly compare cleanup time estimates the greatest source of uncertainty in the eq 1 estimates is the variation in tce concentration over time prior to source isolation monitoring and modeling results by chapman and parker 2005 indicate that tce concentrations were highest shortly after the initial release then declined over time as the source area was depleted by natural flushing in our analysis the source concentration is assumed constant for the entire loading period so estimated concentrations will decline more rapidly than in the field 4 conceptual model and conclusions a simplified conceptual model cm is proposed to aid site managers in evaluating the impact of back diffusion in unconsolidated sedimentary formations on the time after complete source removal for contaminant concentrations in monitor wells to decline by 1 2 and 3 oom toom while models that simulate the underlying physical processes can provide quantitative estimates of toom implementation of these models requires significant resources for site characterization high resolution model development calibration and interpretation of simulation results our cm allows site managers to quickly evaluate if back diffusion substantially increases cleanup time at their site by how much and what site characterization information is most important for estimating cleanup time in the cm the contaminated aquifer is represented by three key parameters 1 mass residence time tm 2 diffusion time td 3 ratio of low k to high k contaminant mass storage γ tm is equal to the total contaminant mass stored in high and low k zones divided by the downgradient mass flux for the layered geometry lg td is calculated as td rl ld 2 4d where rl is the low k retardation factor ld is half the thickness of the low k layers and d is the effective diffusion coefficient for the boundary geometry bg td tl ld 4 73 tl 0 75 tt d rl 0 5 and γ rl θl ld rh θh b all parameters are calculated at the end of the contaminant loading period tl toom is influenced by both advection in the high k zone and diffusion out of the low k zone more rapid advective flushing smaller tm reduces the contaminant concentration in the high k zone increasing the concentration gradient and diffusive mass flux out of the low k region reducing t3 more rapid diffusion lower td increases advective flushing efficiency reducing t3 the 1st damköhler da is equal to tm td and provides a useful indicator of the relative importance of back diffusion on toom back diffusion has the greatest impacts on t3 when 0 01 da 0 1 with t3 tm varying generally between 20 and 100 then decreases with increasing da back diffusion has less impacts on t2 with limited influence on t1 when da is very large diffusion is fast relative to advection back diffusion does not substantially increase cleanup time and toom calculated with remchlor md approach values calculated with the traditional advection dispersion equation ade our simplified cm has important similarities with the power law model for source area treatment parker and park 2004 falta et al 2005 c t c 0 m t m 0 γ where ct is the time dependent average contaminant concentration leaving the source zone c0 is the initial concentration leaving the source zone mt is the time dependent mass in the source zone m0 is the initial mass in the source zone and the exponent γ is a fitting parameter that determines the shape of the discharge vs mass curve when γ 1 or da is large effluent concentrations remain high until most contaminant mass is removed similar to conventional ade behavior when γ 1 or da is small effluent concentrations drop rapidly at first while substantial contaminant mass remains then decline more slowly resulting in extensive tailing of the flush out curve when γ 1 or da 1 effluent concentrations decline in proportion to the mass removed similar to a continuously stirred tank reactor the cm allows some generalizations about the effects of back diffusion on cleanup time for lg and bg 1 back diffusion has limited impacts on t1 2 for lg td is commonly smaller than tm da 1 mass transfer between low k and high k zones is more rapid than advective flushing and back diffusion will have less impacts on cleanup time 3 for lg tm is a function of the total discharge q per unit width through the aquifer and does not require precise estimates of the high k fraction f of the aquifer 4 for bg td tl td is commonly greater than tm da 1 and back diffusion may greatly increase t3 parameters that increase γ larger tl larger d smaller b will increase t3 5 contaminant decay in low k zones can substantially reduce cleanup times when λltd is large however decay will have minimal impact on toom when λltd 0 01 given typical values for td in lg and bg systems previously reported decay rates are sufficient to substantially reduce t3 the cm has several important limitations that need to be considered when applying this approach to a specific site 1 the cm was developed based on 1d simulations using remchlor md falta et al 2018 and all results are subject to the limitations of this approach 2 the regression equations are developed to estimate the time to reach 1 2 and 3 oom reductions in the vertically averaged concentrations in monitor wells when vertical dispersivity is low concentrations immediately adjoining low k zones will be higher and longer time periods may be required to reduce concentrations near low k interfaces 3 the parameter ranges used to generate the lg and bg datasets are intended to cover a broad range of conditions that may occur in unconsolidated sedimentary formations and so the datasets include some extreme values that may not be representative of typical site conditions toom estimates at the extreme limits of the datasets will be less reliable 4 in layered aquifers the lg regression equations are most accurate for td 0 5tl when layer td 2tl toom is more accurately estimated using the bg regressions for td between 0 5tl and 2tl behavior is intermediate between lg and bg 5 in all simulations the contaminant concentration discharging from the source area was constant for the loading period tl then was reduced to zero yang et al 2016 showed that gradual changes in contaminant source strength over time influence back diffusion rates with greater diffusive flux for rapidly depleting sources 6 in this cm groundwater velocity in low k zones is assumed to be zero however under certain conditions slow advection through low k zones can substantially increase mass transfer between high and low k zones li et al 1994 guswa and freyberg 2000 potentially reducing cleanup times research is needed to better understand when slow advection

1366,wetlands have been proven to be efficient and cost effective ecological treatment systems for municipal and domestic wastewater it is essential to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics and the related contaminant transport process to optimize the treatment efficiency in free water surface wetlands thirty six tracer experiments were conducted under different water depths and wetland configurations such as installing static obstacles and dynamic disturbances the particle image velocimetry and a novel color concentration transform method were developed to reveal spatiotemporal flow velocity and residence time distribution the flow fields are categorized into short circuiting circulation flow dead zones and the corresponding contaminant transport phenomena are flow advection shear dispersion and eddy diffusion the flow circulation dominates the formation of the dead zone and decreases contaminant dissipation the flow path could have effectively meandered and the dead zone and short circuiting could be reduced by increasing the length of the obstacles the improved flow field is close to the plug flow indicating enhanced hydraulic performance and treatment efficiency the dynamic disturbance reflects the movement of fish in wetlands and provides momentum flux to promote the dissipation of pollutants in the circulation field and dead zone alleviating the deterioration of water quality caused by pollutant accumulation the findings of this study may provide a critical reference for the optimal design of wetlands keywords contaminant transport hydrodynamics residence time distribution flow circulation constructed wetlands tracer experiments 1 introduction emerging pollutants resulting from a point source and diffuse pollution are present in the aquatic environment causing adverse effects on human and ecological health delgado et al 2020 free water surface constructed wetlands fws cws are engineered systems that can potentially treat wastewater treatment through physical chemical biological processes and the associated microbial assemblages vymazal 2010 fws cws also provide a critical component of the urban matrix and play an essential role in the restoration of ecological environments liao et al 2020 the wastewater treatment efficiency of fws cws is related to their hydraulic performance kadlec and knight 1996 su et al 2009 in the past research on the hydraulic efficiency of fws cws mainly analyzed the phenomenon of dead zones and preferential flow in the flow field using field measurements holland et al 2004 shih et al 2017 flume experiments shih et al 2016 and mathematical modeling su et al 2009 shih et al 2013 chang et al 2016 sabokrouhiyeh et al 2017 shih and wang 2020 these studies reported that the density and extent of obstacles were positively correlated with hydraulic efficiency uniform flow and high hydraulic performance are attributable to dominant phenomena in the flow field such as advection dispersion and vortex diffusion fischer 1967 shih and wang 2020 one of the causal factors of the poor performance of fws cws as water pollution control facilities is unsatisfactory hydraulic control reed et al 1995 the overall effectiveness of dead zones and preferential flow influence residence time which reflects the duration of the retention of water and pollutants in wetlands thackston et al 1987 persson et al 1999 in general dead zones and preferential flow are never desirable in a treatment wetland because flow separation and flow circulation occur and the treatment area is significantly lost persson et al 1999 su et al 2009 this phenomenon may reduce the hydraulic residence time in a wetland and induce large isolated stagnant areas for only tangentially available to the inlet contaminant thus decreasing the treatment efficiency min and wise 2009 rengers et al 2016 however the degree of influence of the circulation phenomenon on the hydraulic performance and pollution removal efficiency of wetlands has rarely been considered and discussions on the elimination or reduction of the circulation phenomenon in fws cws are unclear this study hypothesizes that the occurrence and the dimension and strength of flow circulation would significantly influence the hydraulic performance and treatment efficiency of wetlands we focus on the characteristics of circulation and the transport process of pollutants from the perspective of hydrodynamics and explain the role of optimal design in improving hydraulic performance and treatment efficiency in addition flow separation induces flow circulation which is challenging to investigate and simulate in the field and mathematical models respectively a flume experiment was established to reflect the hydrological phenomena of the flow circulation field the primary aim of this study was to investigate spatial and temporal variations in flow velocity and contaminant concentration in order to confirm the hypothesis for this purpose flume experiments were conducted using particle image velocimetry for flow field visualization and a photographic technique for tracer concentration we performed tracer experiments to compare a wetland with various configurations of emergent obstructions static facility and vibrant disturbance dynamic facility the impact of the strength and location of flow circulation on the retention time hydraulic performance and wastewater treatment efficiency and the corresponding improvement measures are analyzed and discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 flume experiments the flume experiment is a small scale representation of a prototype and is often used to represent hydraulic flow situations chanson 2004 both the boundary conditions and flow field must be scaled appropriately viscous force is typically dominant owing to the low flow velocity and low reynolds number in wetlands the reynolds similarity was thus utilized to scale down the prototype of a constructed wetland the geometric similarity represents the ratios of model dimensions to prototype dimensions as shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 l m l p λ l 2 a m a p l m 2 l p 2 λ l 2 where l m is the length of the model m l p is the length of the prototype m a m is the area of the model m2 a p is the area of the prototype m2 and λ l is a scaling factor for length kinematic similarity refers to the ratios of model flow parameters to prototype flow parameters as shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 v m v p λ v l m t m l p t p λ l λ t 4 q m q p λ q l m 3 t m l p 3 t p λ l 3 λ t where v m is the velocity of the model fluid m s 1 v p is the velocity of the prototype fluid m s 1 q m is the discharge of the model m3 s 1 q p is the discharge of the prototype m3 s 1 l m is the length of the model m l p is the length of the prototype m t m and t p represent the time period measured during the model experiments and prototype surveys s and λ l λ t λ v and λ q are scaling factors for length time velocity and discharge the combination of geometric and kinematic similarities yields the model to prototype ratios of length time velocity and discharge reynolds number was used to evaluate dynamic similarity in this study equivalence in reynolds number was achieved between the on site constructed wetland prototype and experimental flume model as shown in eq 5 5 re m ρvl μ m ρvl μ p re p where re m is the reynolds number of the model fluid re p is the reynolds number of the prototype fluid ρ m is the density of the model fluid kg m 3 ρ p is the density of the prototype fluid kg m 3 v m is the velocity of the model fluid m s 1 v p is the velocity of the prototype fluid m s 1 l m is the length of the model m l p is the length of the prototype m μ m is the dynamic viscosity of the model fluid n s m 2 and μ p is the dynamic viscosity of the prototype fluid n s m 2 because the fluid in both the model and prototype is water μ m μ p and ρ m ρ p all geometric and kinematic parameters were set to be equivalent and the corresponding angles of the prototype wetland and experimental flume were the same the prototype was measured based on the size with length 60 m and width 40 m of the free water surface constructed wetland in guandu natural park in taiwan the flume experiment of this study uses a 2 4 m long and 1 6 m wide flume the configuration of inlet and outlet locations remained the same in the flume experiment and in the fws cws in guandu nature park which is corner influent to corner effluent the constructed wetland of guandu natural park includes various water quality treatment units including a sedimentation basin fws cws horizontal subsurface flow cws oxidation ponds and a terminal deep water pool the flume experiment in this study was aimed at the fws cw in guandu natural park the the model to prototype ratio in length λl which is 1 25 was calculated based on the prototype and model dimensions the model to prototype ratio in velocity can be obtained as 1 λl from eq 5 which is 25 the model to prototype ratios in time and flow discharge thus can be determined as λl 2 and λl from eqs 3 and 4 which are 1 625 and 1 25 the steady flow rate was controlled as 37 6 m3d 1 by facilitating a fixed head water tank in the flume inlet the water depths ranged from 4 cm to 12 cm in different scenarios for simulating shallow water and deep water wetlands the water levels were controlled by changing the height of a tailwater weir in the flume outlet there are four different configurations c0 as an empty pool that acts as a reference c1 configured with two short obstacles c2 configured with two long obstacles and c3 representing two short obstacles plus vibrant disturbance as shown in fig 1 the obstacles were all emergent and a robotic fish induced the vibrant disturbance with dimensions of 7 5 cm 2 cm 3 5 cm the robotic fish was fixed at a specific location the appearance of the robotic fish has a fish shape with a tail fin that can swing continuously for more than one hour with a 3 13 s move frequency the performance in the exchange mechanism on contaminant transport is similar to the effect of stirring bars tracer experiments and particle tracking experiments were carried out in each experimental configuration 2 2 particle image velocimetry in this study homemade shredded paper with a size of approximately 4 2 mm was used for particle image velocimetry piv during the investigation process recording was started and the shredded paper was evenly distributed in the flow field to reflect surface flow velocity we used an iphone version 10 to observe and capture the experimental videos and disassembled each video into several images at the frequency of outputting a photo every 0 1 s then known coordinates of four points marked on the flume were used to connect the pixel positions of four points on each abstracted image an orthophoto can be obtained using projective transformation hartley 1999 we adopted pivlab software version 2 01 to continuously capture ten images of the instantaneous flow field for analysis for each orthophoto particles were evenly distributed to observe the entire flow field the relevant parameters of each image were set according to the suggestion of thielicke and stamhuis 2014 the interrogation area ia was set to 32 32 pixels whereas the searching area sa was set to 64 64 pixels after applying the fourier transform fft scheme the images were paired to observe five flow fields and then averaged to obtain an average flow field the surface flow velocity calculated using the piv method was verified against the average flow velocity measured using the volume flow rate method at the entrance in this study the assumption of the logarithmic distribution of laminar flow velocity was applied to establish the relationship between average velocity and surface velocity as shown in eq 6 substitute y by h in eq 6 to obtain the surface velocity and average flow velocity by depth integration the ratio of surface velocity divided by average velocity can be acquired as 1 50 chow 1959 6 u y ρg μ s hy y 2 2 where ρ is the density of water g is acceleration due to gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity of water s is the bed slope h is the water depth and y is a variable from the bottom to a certain position on the water surface 2 3 color concentration transform rhodamine wt was used as the tracer the recording was started while the investigation was in progress and 20 ml 2133 000 ppb of tracer was input into the entrance at the same time the color concentration transform cct method was used to obtain the entire concentration field and calculate the curve of residence time distribution rtd at the exit of the flume we corrected experimental image distortion and exposure by referring to the testing procedure of forrer et al 2000 the same correction method as that of the piv experiments was used for image geometry correction for corrections of inhomogeneous illumination and white balance the red green and blue rgb color gamut of the original image was converted to the hue saturation and value hsv scale we calculated the exposure value of each pixel to obtain the average exposure of an image and then averaged the exposure of all images to obtain the total exposure the exposure value of each pixel in each image can be converted according to eq 7 after the correction piecewise regression was used to convert the experimental tracer image into a concentration distribution map following eq 8 this polynomial regression equation takes the quadratic term forrer et al 2000 persson 2005 7 v v v v i where v is the exposure value of the original pixel v i is the average exposure of each image v is the average exposure of all images and v is the exposure of the pixel after correction 8 logc a b r c g d b e r 2 f g 2 g b 2 h r g i r b j g b where a to j are the undetermined coefficients r is the exposure value of red g is the exposure value of green b is the exposure value of blue and c is the regressed concentration of the tracer under the rgb scheme ppb please see the details in tables a1 and a2 2 4 hydraulic performance indices the mean residence time and nominal residence time are shown in eqs 9 and 10 using which the effective volume ratio can be calculated eq 11 hydraulic efficiency additionally considers the peak time of rtd as shown in eq 12 9 t m 0 tc t dt 0 c t dt 10 t n v q 11 e v t m t n 12 λ t m t p t n 2 where c t represents the recorded tracer concentration and v and q indicate the water volume contained in the flume and flow discharge determined at the inlet t m t n and t p represent the mean residence time nominal residence time and peak time of an rtd respectively the total recorded time t end was set as three times of t m to avoid tail effects bodin et al 2012 hydraulic performance can be categorized as good satisfactory and poor when λ 0 75 0 5 λ 0 75 and λ 0 5 respectively persson et al 1999 2 5 flow mixing indices in this study the physical meaning of the mixing effect was derived to classify the short circuiting area circulation area and dead zone area as shown in eq 13 variations in concentration σ u 2 can be calculated at each monitoring point in the flow field using cct to describe the characteristics of the dynamic concentration the higher the value of σ u 2 the greater the mixing effect is 13 σ u 2 m 2 m 1 2 where m 1 is the first moment of a standardized rtd curve at each monitoring point and equals 0 ϕc ϕ dϕ m 2 is the second moment of a standardized rtd curve and equals 0 ϕ m 1 2 c ϕ dϕ in addition this study adopted the recommendations of shih and wang 2020 and liu et al 2020 to use the flow uniformity index short circuiting index and mixed index in order to analyze the variation delay and dissipation of the concentration field caused by the circulation effect as shown in eqs 14 and 15 14 φ 1 21 λ 0 29 15 m o 1 t 10 t 90 where φ and mo 1 indicate the degree of flow uniformity and the ratio of preferential flowing time divided by travel time t 10 and t 90 are the times for 10 and 90 of the added tracer to exit the system respectively in this study t 10 was set as the short circuit index when t 10 0 3 short circuiting is insignificant farjood et al 2015 and when φ 0 60 the flow velocity field has good uniformity shih and wang 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 velocity field and concentration field the experimental results of piv and cct were verified we observed the average flow velocity at the inlet and compared it with the surface flow velocity measured by piv the ratio of the surface velocity divided by the average velocity was approximately 1 4 1 6 as shown in fig 2a the results conformed to the logarithmic distribution assumption that the surface velocity is approximately 1 5 times the average velocity chow 1959 therefore this logarithmic relationship can be used to convert surface velocity to average velocity meanwhile eight known tracer concentrations were utilized to validate the estimated concentrations through the cct relational expressions established in this study the results showed that the root mean square error rmse was approximately 266 53 ppb and the average relative error was around 4 as indicated in fig 2b this suggests that the cct method can effectively convert the instantaneous color images into a spatial variation of tracer concentration twenty four samples of different known concentrations and ten samples of clean water were separately photographed at each water depth for each color we took grids of 100 100 pixels of varying densities and averaged them to obtain the rgb value according to the known density as shown in fig 2c the relationships between the known concentrations and the values of r g and b were regressed using exponential power and linear relationships the most remarkable correlation was selected as the conversion relationship between color and tracer concentration this method eliminates the problem of light source interference at low concentrations aeby et al 2001 morris and mooney 2004 and the lower limit of concentration detection can be as small as approximately 200 ppb the rtds of each experiment monitored at the outlet is shown in fig a1 the flow fields under different configurations obtained using piv are shown in fig 3 and fig a2 the ranges of reynolds number were lower than 3500 in most areas revealing laminar and transitional flow conditions chow 1959 as shown in fig 4 and fig a3 the results revealed the occurrence of flow circulations of various sizes regardless of the type of configuration the circulations occurred most frequently near the entrance and exit and in areas behind the obstacles su et al 2009 indicated that the flow circulation occurs in a low velocity zone resulting from flow separation this study discovered a similar result the flow circulation resulted in a dead zone caused by flow separation that usually occurred on both sides of the short circuiting besides the main flow path connecting the inlet and outlet called preferential flow and short circuiting could be observed the c0 experiment revealed a large circulation in the absence of static and dynamic disturbances the short circuiting in c1 was more meandering than that in c0 with a longer main flow path increasing residence time on the two sides of the short circuiting circulations formed due to the velocity gradient the sizes of these circulations were found to be much smaller than those in c0 the obstacles in the c2 experiment had a more elongated and curvilinear configuration than those in c1 the design was proved to create a meandering flow path and increase residence time significantly as the obstacles in c2 were longer than those in c1 and the formed circulation was smaller the flow field of c2 was the closest to plug flow the obstacle in c3 had a configuration similar to that in c1 with an additional set of dynamic disturbances causing minor changes in the surface flow velocity the concentration field under each experimental configuration is illustrated in figs 5 to 8 the results showed that the tracer was rapidly transmitted along with the short circuiting and split upon encountering the obstacles and the fixed boundary of the flume one part of the tracer continued to move towards the outlet and the others returned to the flow field to form a circulation this process was mainly affected by flow advection which led to fast pollutant transmission eddy currents were observed on both sides of the short circuiting and part of the tracer gradually moved into the circulation this process was primarily affected by eddy diffusion and the transmission speed decreased finally the tracer slowly moved to the dead zone in the flume center and remained there and its transport was affected by the dual effects of slow advection and molecular diffusion with the continuous inflow of follow up clean water into the flume low concentration and high concentration spots gradually formed at the short circuiting and dead zone respectively this phenomenon reveals that the tracer is slowly carried out of the wetland as a result of the concentration gradient in the dead zone and the surrounding flow circulation the large circulation and dead zone areas were found in c0 consequently the tracer required a longer time to dissipate after entering the dead zone the results of c1 and c2 revealed that the obstacles could disintegrate the large circulation to smaller circulations the tracer required much less time to dissipate in the dead zone in c2 than in c1 the results of c3 revealed the formation of a local eddy current near the dynamic disturbance such a current might change the efficiency of pollutant removal by providing extended momentum flux with the dominant mechanism changing from slow advection and molecular diffusion to eddy diffusion the dissipation rate increased and residence time decreased we suggest that the dynamic disturbance has a limited effect on changing surface flow velocity but it causes an apparent shift in the concentration distribution the calculation results of the variance distribution of the concentration field representing the mixing effect are shown in fig 9 the average residence time peak concentration time and ended concentration time distribution of the concentration field are shown in figs a4 to a6 the short circuiting flow was observed in areas with σ 2 greater than 1 5 mainly near the entrance these areas are affected by advection with faster contaminant transport and shorter residence time than other areas shih and wang 2020 the pollutant was transferred rapidly with the movement of water and therefore had a short residence time circulation was observed in areas with σ 2 between 0 5 and 1 5 both eddy diffusion and dispersion effects dominated these areas the average residence time and t90 were longer than those of the short circuiting zone the dead zone was found in areas with σ 2 less than 0 5 considering the low magnitude and low spatial gradient of flow velocity in such areas the dominant effect on contaminant transport was molecular diffusion the average residence time and peak concentration time were the longest in the dead zone compared with the short circuiting and flow circulation zones 3 2 residence time and hydraulic performance the results of the hydraulic residence time and performance of each experiment are shown in fig 10 and table a3 tracer experiments revealed several peak values of tracer concentration indicative of varied flow paths particularly in the presence of emergent vegetation and obstacles min and wise 2009 shih et al 2017 in the presence of vegetation previous mathematical models could not provide accurate tracer response curves because they did not take into account dispersion effects li and xie 2011 shih et al 2016 the c0 experiment showed that both t n and t m increased with water depth but t p and λ did not change significantly the effective volume ratio e v slightly increased with increasing water depth and its change was affected by the tailwater effect we found that the hydraulic performance of c0 was negligible and needed to be improved the t m and t p values of c1 were significantly higher than those of c0 after installing the short obstacles hydraulic performance could also be enhanced considerably with extended residence time and uniform flow velocity shih and wang 2020 the long obstacle of c2 resulted in the longest t p and highest hydraulic performance compared with c1 and c0 in c3 a source of vibrant disturbances was added under the same configuration as c1 in the presence of disturbances t m was found to decrease with increasing water depth this result proved that the disturbances could reduce the residence time indicating the contaminant s increased dissipation rate persson 2000 suggested that short circuiting was an enormous barrier to successfully designing and managing constructed wetlands we investigated the influence of short circuiting and circulation on the hydraulic residence times t m and t p the high velocity area ratio beyond the threshold is calculated and found to be correlated with hydraulic performance the values of t m and t p in c0 were the smallest among all configurations although circulation can extend the tracer s residence time most of the tracer rapidly flowed out of the constructed wetland due to short circuiting the addition of obstacles in c1 and c2 can meander the flow path weakening the short circuiting effect and increasing the residence time reflected by a significant difference in t m we found that the mixing effect of c2 was less evident than that of c1 indicating the advantage of improving flow uniformity c1 had a more prolonged tail effect due to the influence of circulating flow a similar plug flow was observed in c2 and the circulation phenomenon was less obvious indicating that the mixing effect was not as apparent as that of c1 the changes in t p observed in c3 showed that increasing disturbance has little impact on the meandering flow path however the changes in t m revealed a trend of gradual decrease with increasing water depth we suggest that disturbances can change the contaminant transport phenomenon in the local flow field as the water depth increases and flow velocity decreases this effect becomes more evident 3 3 influence of circulation and short circuiting on hydraulic performance the short circuiting and mixing effects that occur in the flow field under different configurations would reduce the uniformity of the flow field shih and wang 2020 these phenomena will also affect the hydraulic performance and pollutant reduction efficiency of the constructed wetland as shown in fig 11 noticeable short circuiting and mixing effects were observed in c0 in contrast smaller circulation and dead zone areas and decreased short circuiting and mixing effects were observed in c1 owing to the two short obstacles the flow uniformity in c1 was significantly higher than that in c0 with the lengthening of the obstacles in c2 the circulation and dead zone areas were further reduced where the related flow uniformity increased shih and wang 2020 proposed a negative correlation between the size of the dead zone and hydraulic efficiency that is the larger the dead zone area the lower the hydraulic efficiency our results revealed that c0 had the largest dead zone which mainly occurred in and around the circulation whereas c2 had the smallest dead zone the corresponding hydraulic efficiency showed the opposite result which also confirms previous research findings shih et al 2016 chang et al 2016 chang et al 2016 suggested that circulations mostly appear behind obstacles and the position of flow separation as the number of obstacles is increased the circulation becomes less noticeable the findings indicate that obstacles can effectively prevent the formation of circulation making the flow condition similar to plug flow the circulation phenomenon was found to be pronounced in this study lengthening the residence time of the tracer in the central dead zone this may be the main reason for the low hydraulic efficiency found in this study furthermore the robotic fish in c3 generated a local vortex effect after inducing vibrant disturbance although the difference in flow velocity was limited the change in the concentration field was significant we discovered that the tracer near the disturbance source entered the dead zone directly from the circulation area indicating the enhancing effect of the disturbance on contaminant dispersion therefore the mixed index in c3 changed significantly compared with that in c0 and c1 whereas the short circuiting index showed no noticeable change pollutants affected by the disturbance were dissipated from the dead zone weakening the mixing effect we suggest that the dynamic disturbance presented in this study provides an alternative solution towards mitigating the problem of contaminant accumulation in constructed wetlands 3 4 influence of circulation and short circuiting on treatment efficiency contaminant transportation is described as the combined effects of advection dispersion and reaction the advection term represents the effects of flow velocity while the dispersion term represents diffusion and shear flow dispersion fischer et al 1979 contaminant transport and wastewater treatment are affected by surface hydrodynamics and mass exchanges with distinct zones bottacin busolin et al 2011 the efficiency of pollutant treatment is mainly affected by flow field patterns and contaminant transport under different configurations wahl et al 2010 previous studies have indicated that short circuiting flow circulation and dead zones may induce the water quality degradation of wetlands holland et al 2004 dierberg et al 2005 bracho et al 2006 shih and wang 2020 chang et al 2016 have shown that the addition of emergent obstacles can effectively increase residence time t m and t p according to the first order decay model the treatment ratio of pollutants increases with increasing residence time shih et al 2013 as flow circulation extends the residence time of pollutants the removal ratio is expected to be higher however pollutants entering the circulation may be transferred to the dead zone where the flow velocity is low at the center and the material transport effect is poor changes in residence time hydraulic performance and pollutant removal efficiency caused by circulation and short circuiting were discussed accordingly a transect line was taken from the flume to illustrate a flow velocity profile and a velocity gradient profile every point extracted from about 25 cm departs and 10 points in a total of a transect line draw the concentration response curve as shown in fig 12 the transport process of the tracer in the flume was affected by the combined effects of advection eddy diffusion and dispersion to understand the relationship between different internal flow field characteristics and contaminant transport behavior we found that after inputting the tracer at the entrance the advection effect mainly affects the spatiotemporal changes of the concentration field at point 10 in c0 points 3 7 and 10 in c1 and c2 the tracer was mainly affected by advection effects and transports along with the current in addition the first point of c0 c1 and c2 were located at the edge of the circulation near the entrance in the recirculation part a contaminant transport phenomenon similar to that of the preferential flow dominated by advection was observed moreover with the apparent short circuiting and flow circulation the hydraulic performance was poor in c0 corresponding to its treatment efficiency most of the pollutants flowed out of the wetland without sufficient residence time in addition some contaminants would accumulate in the circulation area and dead zone area which may lead to eutrophication braskerud 2002 coveney et al 2002 jiang et al 2007 su et al 2009 from the perspective of the contaminant transport process short circuiting strengthens the effect of advection on pollutants with faster water flow shih and wang 2020 our results show that part of the water flow forms a circulation after the flow separation indicating the dominance of eddy diffusion in the contaminant transport process installing the obstacles in c1 and c2 effectively decreased the short circuiting the flow circulation and mixing effects could be further increased in c2 revealing that the higher hydraulic performance was achieved in c2 compared to c1 the obstacles were found to meander the flow path and decrease the area of the central dead zone the tracer that was initially affected by the advection effect quickly moved out of the dead zone but remained in the wetland for a longer time improving the treatment efficiency in addition the dead zone area at the center of the circulation was reduced and the problem of pollutant accumulation was therefore less likely to occur both c1 and c2 achieved higher treatment efficiency than c0 attributable to the weakened short circuiting effect the collection of pollutants indicated that the treatment efficiency of c1 was lower than that of c2 although the hydraulic performance decreased with increasing water depth in c3 the mixing effect became less evident the results suggest that the dynamic disturbance introduced in c3 is a potential solution to the cumulative problems associated with the configuration of c1 the low flow velocity and small flow velocity gradient in the dead zone induce the phenomenon of slow advection and partial diffusion during contaminant transport consequently the flow field becomes non uniform and material dissipation is impeded which decreases the hydraulic efficiency index the addition of obstacles can effectively meander the flow path and reduce the dead zone area with such improvements this method can bring the flow field closer to plug flow improving hydraulic efficiency in addition dynamic disturbance imitating fish movement can be applied to the wetland the presence of using the robotic fish helps to increase momentum and energy exchange on contaminant transport such disturbances can promote pollutant dispersion in the circulation field or dead zone reducing water quality deterioration due to pollutant accumulation we suggest that future studies consider a reasonable size to represent a real fish and compare it to aquatic animals in a real world system at the beginning of the wetland design the possible dead zones and short circuiting can be calculated through the flume experiment emergent plants and diverse bed topography can be created as static obstacles suggested in this study to reduce short circuiting occurrences the movement of fish and other aquatic animals can reflect the dynamic disturbance function suggested in this study therefore we suggest controlling their activity area mainly concentrated in the circulation areas and dead zones to increase the exchange and reduction of pollutants the vegetated zones may enhance wastewater treatment efficiency through the emergent macrophytes and suggest an essential land water interface for lateral connectivity providing material and energy cycling and biological dispersal functions besides with the increasing interest in the co benefits of free water surface wetlands in recent decades everard and mcinnes 2013 vymazal 2013 emergent plants could be constructed as land tied islands or floating islands high diversity of habitat features with various water depths flow velocities and bed topographies could be created with flexible arrangements of this vegetation and the corresponding matrix concerning the local and regional landscapes this would contribute to the wetland biodiversity ma et al 2010 4 conclusions this study focused on the hydraulic performance of different types of flow characteristics mainly the dead zone short circuiting and flow circulation of constructed wetlands several flume experiments were performed with varying water depths configurations of obstacles and dynamic disturbances to create various flow fields and the related contaminant dynamics imaging techniques were developed to visualize changes in flow velocity and tracer concentration the results showed a system error of approximately 7 10 indicating that this research s imaging technique can provide sufficient accuracy the results show the advantage of overcoming the difficulties of obtaining full range and time varying experimental data on flow velocity and concentration fields the proposed analysis method could successfully reflect the influence of different obstacle configurations and vibrant disturbance on the contaminant transport process obstacles represent islands or watery vegetation in constructed wetlands and vibrant disturbance indicates the impacts of aquatic animals the experimental results of tracer transport prove that the circulation phenomenon is related to the formation of a dead zone obstacles can extend the flow path increase residence time reduce short circuiting mitigate flow circulation and increase mixing effects such effects positively contribute to the improvement of hydraulic efficiency and pollutant removal efficiency and the benefits of expanded obstacle length become more pronounced over time the dynamic disturbance was induced with a robotic fish to reflect aquatic animals influence on the velocity and concentration fields the dynamic disturbance imitating fish movement could cause local eddy currents thereby effectively increasing the dissipation rate the application of dynamic disturbance may be a solution to the problem of pollutant accumulation in constructed wetlands author contributions shang shu

1366,wetlands have been proven to be efficient and cost effective ecological treatment systems for municipal and domestic wastewater it is essential to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics and the related contaminant transport process to optimize the treatment efficiency in free water surface wetlands thirty six tracer experiments were conducted under different water depths and wetland configurations such as installing static obstacles and dynamic disturbances the particle image velocimetry and a novel color concentration transform method were developed to reveal spatiotemporal flow velocity and residence time distribution the flow fields are categorized into short circuiting circulation flow dead zones and the corresponding contaminant transport phenomena are flow advection shear dispersion and eddy diffusion the flow circulation dominates the formation of the dead zone and decreases contaminant dissipation the flow path could have effectively meandered and the dead zone and short circuiting could be reduced by increasing the length of the obstacles the improved flow field is close to the plug flow indicating enhanced hydraulic performance and treatment efficiency the dynamic disturbance reflects the movement of fish in wetlands and provides momentum flux to promote the dissipation of pollutants in the circulation field and dead zone alleviating the deterioration of water quality caused by pollutant accumulation the findings of this study may provide a critical reference for the optimal design of wetlands keywords contaminant transport hydrodynamics residence time distribution flow circulation constructed wetlands tracer experiments 1 introduction emerging pollutants resulting from a point source and diffuse pollution are present in the aquatic environment causing adverse effects on human and ecological health delgado et al 2020 free water surface constructed wetlands fws cws are engineered systems that can potentially treat wastewater treatment through physical chemical biological processes and the associated microbial assemblages vymazal 2010 fws cws also provide a critical component of the urban matrix and play an essential role in the restoration of ecological environments liao et al 2020 the wastewater treatment efficiency of fws cws is related to their hydraulic performance kadlec and knight 1996 su et al 2009 in the past research on the hydraulic efficiency of fws cws mainly analyzed the phenomenon of dead zones and preferential flow in the flow field using field measurements holland et al 2004 shih et al 2017 flume experiments shih et al 2016 and mathematical modeling su et al 2009 shih et al 2013 chang et al 2016 sabokrouhiyeh et al 2017 shih and wang 2020 these studies reported that the density and extent of obstacles were positively correlated with hydraulic efficiency uniform flow and high hydraulic performance are attributable to dominant phenomena in the flow field such as advection dispersion and vortex diffusion fischer 1967 shih and wang 2020 one of the causal factors of the poor performance of fws cws as water pollution control facilities is unsatisfactory hydraulic control reed et al 1995 the overall effectiveness of dead zones and preferential flow influence residence time which reflects the duration of the retention of water and pollutants in wetlands thackston et al 1987 persson et al 1999 in general dead zones and preferential flow are never desirable in a treatment wetland because flow separation and flow circulation occur and the treatment area is significantly lost persson et al 1999 su et al 2009 this phenomenon may reduce the hydraulic residence time in a wetland and induce large isolated stagnant areas for only tangentially available to the inlet contaminant thus decreasing the treatment efficiency min and wise 2009 rengers et al 2016 however the degree of influence of the circulation phenomenon on the hydraulic performance and pollution removal efficiency of wetlands has rarely been considered and discussions on the elimination or reduction of the circulation phenomenon in fws cws are unclear this study hypothesizes that the occurrence and the dimension and strength of flow circulation would significantly influence the hydraulic performance and treatment efficiency of wetlands we focus on the characteristics of circulation and the transport process of pollutants from the perspective of hydrodynamics and explain the role of optimal design in improving hydraulic performance and treatment efficiency in addition flow separation induces flow circulation which is challenging to investigate and simulate in the field and mathematical models respectively a flume experiment was established to reflect the hydrological phenomena of the flow circulation field the primary aim of this study was to investigate spatial and temporal variations in flow velocity and contaminant concentration in order to confirm the hypothesis for this purpose flume experiments were conducted using particle image velocimetry for flow field visualization and a photographic technique for tracer concentration we performed tracer experiments to compare a wetland with various configurations of emergent obstructions static facility and vibrant disturbance dynamic facility the impact of the strength and location of flow circulation on the retention time hydraulic performance and wastewater treatment efficiency and the corresponding improvement measures are analyzed and discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 flume experiments the flume experiment is a small scale representation of a prototype and is often used to represent hydraulic flow situations chanson 2004 both the boundary conditions and flow field must be scaled appropriately viscous force is typically dominant owing to the low flow velocity and low reynolds number in wetlands the reynolds similarity was thus utilized to scale down the prototype of a constructed wetland the geometric similarity represents the ratios of model dimensions to prototype dimensions as shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 l m l p λ l 2 a m a p l m 2 l p 2 λ l 2 where l m is the length of the model m l p is the length of the prototype m a m is the area of the model m2 a p is the area of the prototype m2 and λ l is a scaling factor for length kinematic similarity refers to the ratios of model flow parameters to prototype flow parameters as shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 v m v p λ v l m t m l p t p λ l λ t 4 q m q p λ q l m 3 t m l p 3 t p λ l 3 λ t where v m is the velocity of the model fluid m s 1 v p is the velocity of the prototype fluid m s 1 q m is the discharge of the model m3 s 1 q p is the discharge of the prototype m3 s 1 l m is the length of the model m l p is the length of the prototype m t m and t p represent the time period measured during the model experiments and prototype surveys s and λ l λ t λ v and λ q are scaling factors for length time velocity and discharge the combination of geometric and kinematic similarities yields the model to prototype ratios of length time velocity and discharge reynolds number was used to evaluate dynamic similarity in this study equivalence in reynolds number was achieved between the on site constructed wetland prototype and experimental flume model as shown in eq 5 5 re m ρvl μ m ρvl μ p re p where re m is the reynolds number of the model fluid re p is the reynolds number of the prototype fluid ρ m is the density of the model fluid kg m 3 ρ p is the density of the prototype fluid kg m 3 v m is the velocity of the model fluid m s 1 v p is the velocity of the prototype fluid m s 1 l m is the length of the model m l p is the length of the prototype m μ m is the dynamic viscosity of the model fluid n s m 2 and μ p is the dynamic viscosity of the prototype fluid n s m 2 because the fluid in both the model and prototype is water μ m μ p and ρ m ρ p all geometric and kinematic parameters were set to be equivalent and the corresponding angles of the prototype wetland and experimental flume were the same the prototype was measured based on the size with length 60 m and width 40 m of the free water surface constructed wetland in guandu natural park in taiwan the flume experiment of this study uses a 2 4 m long and 1 6 m wide flume the configuration of inlet and outlet locations remained the same in the flume experiment and in the fws cws in guandu nature park which is corner influent to corner effluent the constructed wetland of guandu natural park includes various water quality treatment units including a sedimentation basin fws cws horizontal subsurface flow cws oxidation ponds and a terminal deep water pool the flume experiment in this study was aimed at the fws cw in guandu natural park the the model to prototype ratio in length λl which is 1 25 was calculated based on the prototype and model dimensions the model to prototype ratio in velocity can be obtained as 1 λl from eq 5 which is 25 the model to prototype ratios in time and flow discharge thus can be determined as λl 2 and λl from eqs 3 and 4 which are 1 625 and 1 25 the steady flow rate was controlled as 37 6 m3d 1 by facilitating a fixed head water tank in the flume inlet the water depths ranged from 4 cm to 12 cm in different scenarios for simulating shallow water and deep water wetlands the water levels were controlled by changing the height of a tailwater weir in the flume outlet there are four different configurations c0 as an empty pool that acts as a reference c1 configured with two short obstacles c2 configured with two long obstacles and c3 representing two short obstacles plus vibrant disturbance as shown in fig 1 the obstacles were all emergent and a robotic fish induced the vibrant disturbance with dimensions of 7 5 cm 2 cm 3 5 cm the robotic fish was fixed at a specific location the appearance of the robotic fish has a fish shape with a tail fin that can swing continuously for more than one hour with a 3 13 s move frequency the performance in the exchange mechanism on contaminant transport is similar to the effect of stirring bars tracer experiments and particle tracking experiments were carried out in each experimental configuration 2 2 particle image velocimetry in this study homemade shredded paper with a size of approximately 4 2 mm was used for particle image velocimetry piv during the investigation process recording was started and the shredded paper was evenly distributed in the flow field to reflect surface flow velocity we used an iphone version 10 to observe and capture the experimental videos and disassembled each video into several images at the frequency of outputting a photo every 0 1 s then known coordinates of four points marked on the flume were used to connect the pixel positions of four points on each abstracted image an orthophoto can be obtained using projective transformation hartley 1999 we adopted pivlab software version 2 01 to continuously capture ten images of the instantaneous flow field for analysis for each orthophoto particles were evenly distributed to observe the entire flow field the relevant parameters of each image were set according to the suggestion of thielicke and stamhuis 2014 the interrogation area ia was set to 32 32 pixels whereas the searching area sa was set to 64 64 pixels after applying the fourier transform fft scheme the images were paired to observe five flow fields and then averaged to obtain an average flow field the surface flow velocity calculated using the piv method was verified against the average flow velocity measured using the volume flow rate method at the entrance in this study the assumption of the logarithmic distribution of laminar flow velocity was applied to establish the relationship between average velocity and surface velocity as shown in eq 6 substitute y by h in eq 6 to obtain the surface velocity and average flow velocity by depth integration the ratio of surface velocity divided by average velocity can be acquired as 1 50 chow 1959 6 u y ρg μ s hy y 2 2 where ρ is the density of water g is acceleration due to gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity of water s is the bed slope h is the water depth and y is a variable from the bottom to a certain position on the water surface 2 3 color concentration transform rhodamine wt was used as the tracer the recording was started while the investigation was in progress and 20 ml 2133 000 ppb of tracer was input into the entrance at the same time the color concentration transform cct method was used to obtain the entire concentration field and calculate the curve of residence time distribution rtd at the exit of the flume we corrected experimental image distortion and exposure by referring to the testing procedure of forrer et al 2000 the same correction method as that of the piv experiments was used for image geometry correction for corrections of inhomogeneous illumination and white balance the red green and blue rgb color gamut of the original image was converted to the hue saturation and value hsv scale we calculated the exposure value of each pixel to obtain the average exposure of an image and then averaged the exposure of all images to obtain the total exposure the exposure value of each pixel in each image can be converted according to eq 7 after the correction piecewise regression was used to convert the experimental tracer image into a concentration distribution map following eq 8 this polynomial regression equation takes the quadratic term forrer et al 2000 persson 2005 7 v v v v i where v is the exposure value of the original pixel v i is the average exposure of each image v is the average exposure of all images and v is the exposure of the pixel after correction 8 logc a b r c g d b

regressed concentration of the tracer under the rgb scheme ppb please see the details in tables a1 and a2 2 4 hydraulic performance indices the mean residence time and nominal residence time are shown in eqs 9 and 10 using which the effective volume ratio can be calculated eq 11 hydraulic efficiency additionally considers the peak time of rtd as shown in eq 12 9 t m 0 tc t dt 0 c t dt 10 t n v q 11 e v t m t n 12 λ t m t p t n 2 where c t represents the recorded tracer concentration and v and q indicate the water volume contained in the flume and flow discharge determined at the inlet t m t n and t p represent the mean residence time nominal residence time and peak time of an rtd respectively the total recorded time t end was set as three times of t m to avoid tail effects bodin et al 2012 hydraulic performance can be categorized as good satisfactory and poor when λ 0 75 0 5 λ 0 75 and λ 0 5 respectively persson et al 1999 2 5 flow mixing indices in this study the physical meaning of the mixing effect was derived to classify the short circuiting area circulation area and dead zone area as shown in eq 13 variations in concentration σ u 2 can be calculated at each monitoring point in the flow field using cct to describe the characteristics of the dynamic concentration the higher the value of σ u 2 the greater the mixing effect is 13 σ u 2 m 2 m 1 2 where m 1 is the first moment of a standardized rtd curve at each monitoring point and equals 0 ϕc ϕ dϕ m 2 is the second moment of a standardized rtd curve and equals 0 ϕ m 1 2 c ϕ dϕ in addition this study adopted the recommendations of shih and wang 2020 and liu et al 2020 to use the flow uniformity index short circuiting index and mixed index in order to analyze the variation delay and dissipation of the concentration field caused by the circulation effect as shown in eqs 14 and 15 14 φ 1 21 λ 0 29 15 m o 1 t 10 t 90 where φ and mo 1 indicate the degree of flow uniformity and the ratio of preferential flowing time divided by travel time t 10 and t 90 are the times for 10 and 90 of the added tracer to exit the system respectively in this study t 10 was set as the short circuit index when t 10 0 3 short circuiting is insignificant farjood et al 2015 and when φ 0 60 the flow velocity field has good uniformity shih and wang 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 velocity field and concentration field the experimental results of piv and cct were verified we observed the average flow velocity at the inlet and compared it with the surface flow velocity measured by piv the ratio of the surface velocity divided by the average velocity was approximately 1 4 1 6 as shown in fig 2a the results conformed to the logarithmic distribution assumption that the surface velocity is approximately 1 5 times the average velocity chow 1959 therefore this logarithmic relationship can be used to convert surface velocity to average velocity meanwhile eight known tracer concentrations were utilized to validate the estimated concentrations through the cct relational expressions established in this study the results showed that the root mean square error rmse was approximately 266 53 ppb and the average relative error was around 4 as indicated in fig 2b this suggests that the cct method can effectively convert the instantaneous color images into a spatial variation of tracer concentration twenty four samples of different known concentrations and ten samples of clean water were separately photographed at each water depth for each color we took grids of 100 100 pixels of varying densities and averaged them to obtain the rgb value according to the known density as shown in fig 2c the relationships between the known concentrations and the values of r g and b were regressed using exponential power and linear relationships the most remarkable correlation was selected as the conversion relationship between color and tracer concentration this method eliminates the problem of light source interference at low concentrations aeby et al 2001 morris and mooney 2004 and the lower limit of concentration detection can be as small as approximately 200 ppb the rtds of each experiment monitored at the outlet is shown in fig a1 the flow fields under different configurations obtained using piv are shown in fig 3 and fig a2 the ranges of reynolds number were lower than 3500 in most areas revealing laminar and transitional flow conditions chow 1959 as shown in fig 4 and fig a3 the results revealed the occurrence of flow circulations of various sizes regardless of the type of configuration the circulations occurred most frequently near the entrance and exit and in areas behind the obstacles su et al 2009 indicated that the flow circulation occurs in a low velocity zone resulting from flow separation this study discovered a similar result the flow circulation resulted in a dead zone caused by flow separation that usually occurred on both sides of the short circuiting besides the main flow path connecting the inlet and outlet called preferential flow and short circuiting could be observed the c0 experiment revealed a large circulation in the absence of static and dynamic disturbances the short circuiting in c1 was more meandering than that in c0 with a longer main flow path increasing residence time on the two sides of the short circuiting circulations formed due to the velocity gradient the sizes of these circulations were found to be much smaller than those in c0 the obstacles in the c2 experiment had a more elongated and curvilinear configuration than those in c1 the design was proved to create a meandering flow path and increase residence time significantly as the obstacles in c2 were longer than those in c1 and the formed circulation was smaller the flow field of c2 was the closest to plug flow the obstacle in c3 had a configuration similar to that in c1 with an additional set of dynamic disturbances causing minor changes in the surface flow velocity the concentration field under each experimental configuration is illustrated in figs 5 to 8 the results showed that the tracer was rapidly transmitted along with the short circuiting and split upon encountering the obstacles and the fixed boundary of the flume one part of the tracer continued to move towards the outlet and the others returned to the flow field to form a circulation this process was mainly affected by flow advection which led to fast pollutant transmission eddy currents were observed on both sides of the short circuiting and part of the tracer gradually moved into the circulation this process was primarily affected by eddy diffusion and the transmission speed decreased finally the tracer slowly moved to the dead zone in the flume center and remained there and its transport was affected by the dual effects of slow advection and molecular diffusion with the continuous inflow of follow up clean water into the flume low concentration and high concentration spots gradually formed at the short circuiting and dead zone respectively this phenomenon reveals that the tracer is slowly carried out of the wetland as a result of the concentration gradient in the dead zone and the surrounding flow circulation the large circulation and dead zone areas were found in c0 consequently the tracer required a longer time to dissipate after entering the dead zone the results of c1 and c2 revealed that the obstacles could disintegrate the large circulation to smaller circulations the tracer required much less time to dissipate in the dead zone in c2 than in c1 the results of c3 revealed the formation of a local eddy current near the dynamic disturbance such a current might change the efficiency of pollutant removal by providing extended momentum flux with the dominant mechanism changing from slow advection and molecular diffusion to eddy diffusion the dissipation rate increased and residence time decreased we suggest that the dynamic disturbance has a limited effect on changing surface flow velocity but it causes an apparent shift in the concentration distribution the calculation results of the variance distribution of the concentration field representing the mixing effect are shown in fig 9 the average residence time peak concentration time and ended concentration time distribution of the concentration field are shown in figs a4 to a6 the short circuiting flow was observed in areas with σ 2 greater than 1 5 mainly near the entrance these areas are affected by advection with faster contaminant transport and shorter residence time than other areas shih and wang 2020 the pollutant was transferred rapidly with the movement of water and therefore had a short residence time circulation was observed in areas with σ 2 between 0 5 and 1 5 both eddy diffusion and dispersion effects dominated these areas the average residence time and t90 were longer than those of the short circuiting zone the dead zone was found in areas with σ 2 less than 0 5 considering the low magnitude and low spatial gradient of flow velocity in such areas the dominant effect on contaminant transport was molecular diffusion the average residence time and peak concentration time were the longest in the dead zone compared with the short circuiting and flow circulation zones 3 2 residence time and hydraulic performance the results of the hydraulic residence time and performance of each experiment are shown in fig 10 and table a3 tracer experiments revealed several peak values of tracer concentration indicative of varied flow paths particularly in the presence of emergent vegetation and obstacles min and wise 2009 shih et al 2017 in the presence of vegetation previous mathematical models could not provide accurate tracer response curves because they did not take into account dispersion effects li and xie 2011 shih et al 2016 the c0 experiment showed that both t n and t m increased with water depth but t p and λ did not change significantly the effective volume ratio e v slightly increased with increasing water depth and its change was affected by the tailwater effect we found that the hydraulic performance of c0 was negligible and needed to be improved the t m and t p values of c1 were significantly higher than those of c0 after installing the short obstacles hydraulic performance could also be enhanced considerably with extended residence time and uniform flow velocity shih and wang 2020 the long obstacle of c2 resulted in the longest t p and highest hydraulic performance compared with c1 and c0 in c3 a source of vibrant disturbances was added under the same configuration as c1 in the presence of disturbances t m was found to decrease with increasing water depth this result proved that the disturbances could reduce the residence time indicating the contaminant s increased dissipation rate persson 2000 suggested that short circuiting was an enormous barrier to successfully designing and managing constructed wetlands we investigated the influence of short circuiting and circulation on the hydraulic residence times t m and t p the high velocity area ratio beyond the threshold is calculated and found to be correlated with hydraulic performance the values of t m and t p in c0 were the smallest among all configurations although circulation can extend the tracer s residence time most of the tracer rapidly flowed out of the constructed wetland due to short circuiting the addition of obstacles in c1 and c2 can meander the flow path weakening the short circuiting effect and increasing the residence time reflected by a significant difference in t m we found that the mixing effect of c2 was less evident than that of c1 indicating the advantage of improving flow uniformity c1 had a more prolonged tail effect due to the influence of circulating flow a similar plug flow was observed in c2 and the circulation phenomenon was less obvious indicating that the mixing effect was not as apparent as that of c1 the changes in t p observed in c3 showed that increasing disturbance has little impact on the meandering flow path however the changes in t m revealed a trend of gradual decrease with increasing water depth we suggest that disturbances can change the contaminant transport phenomenon in the local flow field as the water depth increases and flow velocity decreases this effect becomes more evident 3 3 influence of circulation and short circuiting on hydraulic performance the short circuiting and mixing effects that occur in the flow field under different configurations would reduce the uniformity of the flow field shih and wang 2020 these phenomena will also affect the hydraulic performance and pollutant reduction efficiency of the constructed wetland as shown in fig 11 noticeable short circuiting and mixing effects were observed in c0 in contrast smaller circulation and dead zone areas and decreased short circuiting and mixing effects were observed in c1 owing to the two short obstacles the flow uniformity in c1 was significantly higher than that in c0 with the lengthening of the obstacles in c2 the circulation and dead zone areas were further reduced where the related flow uniformity increased shih and wang 2020 proposed a negative correlation between the size of the dead zone and hydraulic efficiency that is the larger the dead zone area the lower the hydraulic efficiency our results revealed that c0 had the largest dead zone which mainly occurred in and around the circulation whereas c2 had the smallest dead zone the corresponding hydraulic efficiency showed the opposite result which also confirms previous research findings shih et al 2016 chang et al 2016 chang et al 2016 suggested that circulations mostly appear behind obstacles and the position of flow separation as the number of obstacles is increased the circulation becomes less noticeable the findings indicate that obstacles can effectively prevent the formation of circulation making the flow condition similar to plug flow the circulation phenomenon was found to be pronounced in this study lengthening the residence time of the tracer in the central dead zone this may be the main reason for the low hydraulic efficiency found in this study furthermore the robotic fish in c3 generated a local vortex effect after inducing vibrant disturbance although the difference in flow velocity was limited the change in the concentration field was significant we discovered that the tracer near the disturbance source entered the dead zone directly from the circulation area indicating the enhancing effect of the disturbance on contaminant dispersion therefore the mixed index in c3 changed significantly compared with that in c0 and c1 whereas the short circuiting index showed no noticeable change pollutants affected by the disturbance were dissipated from the dead zone weakening the mixing effect we suggest that the dynamic disturbance presented in this study provides an alternative solution towards mitigating the problem of contaminant accumulation in constructed wetlands 3 4 influence of circulation and short circuiting on treatment efficiency contaminant transportation is described as the combined effects of advection dispersion and reaction the advection term represents the effects of flow velocity while the dispersion term represents diffusion and shear flow dispersion fischer et al 1979 contaminant transport and wastewater treatment are affected by surface hydrodynamics and mass exchanges with distinct zones bottacin busolin et al 2011 the efficiency of pollutant treatment is mainly affected by flow field patterns and contaminant transport under different configurations wahl et al 2010 previous studies have indicated that short circuiting flow circulation and dead zones may induce the water quality degradation of wetlands holland et al 2004 dierberg et al 2005 bracho et al 2006 shih and wang 2020 chang et al 2016 have shown that the addition of emergent obstacles can effectively increase residence time t m and t p according to the first order decay model the treatment ratio of pollutants increases with increasing residence time shih et al 2013 as flow circulation extends the residence time of pollutants the removal ratio is expected to be higher however pollutants entering the circulation may be transferred to the dead zone where the flow velocity is low at the center and the material transport effect is poor changes in residence time hydraulic performance and pollutant removal efficiency caused by circulation and short circuiting were discussed accordingly a transect line was taken from the flume to illustrate a flow velocity profile and a velocity gradient profile every point extracted from about 25 cm departs and 10 points in a total of a transect line draw the concentration response curve as shown in fig 12 the transport process of the tracer in the flume was affected by the combined effects of advection eddy diffusion and dispersion to understand the relationship between different internal flow field characteristics and contaminant transport behavior we found that after inputting the tracer at the entrance the advection effect mainly affects the spatiotemporal changes of the concentration field at point 10 in c0 points 3 7 and 10 in c1 and c2 the tracer was mainly affected by advection effects and transports along with the current in addition the first point of c0 c1 and c2 were located at the edge of the circulation near the entrance in the recirculation part a contaminant transport phenomenon similar to that of the preferential flow dominated by advection was observed moreover with the apparent short circuiting and flow circulation the hydraulic performance was poor in c0 corresponding to its treatment efficiency most of the pollutants flowed out of the wetland without sufficient residence time in addition some contaminants would accumulate in the circulation area and dead zone area which may lead to eutrophication braskerud 2002 coveney et al 2002 jiang et al 2007 su et al 2009 from the perspective of the contaminant transport process short circuiting strengthens the effect of advection on pollutants with faster water flow shih and wang 2020 our results show that part of the water flow forms a circulation after the flow separation indicating the dominance of eddy diffusion in the contaminant transport process installing the obstacles in c1 and c2 effectively decreased the short circuiting the flow circulation and mixing effects could be further increased in c2 revealing that the higher hydraulic performance was achieved in c2 compared to c1 the obstacles were found to meander the flow path and decrease the area of the central dead zone the tracer that was initially affected by the advection effect quickly moved out of the dead zone but remained in the wetland for a longer time improving the treatment efficiency in addition the dead zone area at the center of the circulation was reduced and the problem of pollutant accumulation was therefore less likely to occur both c1 and c2 achieved higher treatment efficiency than c0 attributable to the weakened short circuiting effect the collection of pollutants indicated that the treatment efficiency of c1 was lower than that of c2 although the hydraulic performance decreased with increasing water depth in c3 the mixing effect became less evident the results suggest that the dynamic disturbance introduced in c3 is a potential solution to the cumulative problems associated with the configuration of c1 the low flow velocity and small flow velocity gradient in the dead zone induce the phenomenon of slow advection and partial diffusion during contaminant transport consequently the flow field becomes non uniform and material dissipation is impeded which decreases the hydraulic efficiency index the addition of obstacles can effectively meander the flow path and reduce the dead zone area with such improvements this method can bring the flow field closer to plug flow improving hydraulic efficiency in addition dynamic disturbance imitating fish movement can be applied to the wetland the presence of using the robotic fish helps to increase momentum and energy exchange on contaminant transport such disturbances can promote pollutant dispersion in the circulation field or dead zone reducing water quality deterioration due to pollutant accumulation we suggest that future studies consider a reasonable size to represent a real fish and compare it to aquatic animals in a real world system at the beginning of the wetland design the possible dead zones and short circuiting can be calculated through the flume experiment emergent plants and diverse bed topography can be created as static obstacles suggested in this study to reduce short circuiting occurrences the movement of fish and other aquatic animals can reflect the dynamic disturbance function suggested in this study therefore we suggest controlling their activity area mainly concentrated in the circulation areas and dead zones to increase the exchange and reduction of pollutants the vegetated zones may enhance wastewater treatment efficiency through the emergent macrophytes and suggest an essential land water interface for lateral connectivity providing material and energy cycling and biological dispersal functions besides with the increasing interest in the co benefits of free water surface wetlands in recent decades everard and mcinnes 2013 vymazal 2013 emergent plants could be constructed as land tied islands or floating islands high diversity of habitat features with various water depths flow velocities and bed topographies could be created with flexible arrangements of this vegetation and the corresponding matrix concerning the local and regional landscapes this would contribute to the wetland biodiversity ma et al 2010 4 conclusions this study focused on the hydraulic performance of different types of flow characteristics mainly the dead zone short circuiting and flow circulation of constructed wetlands several flume experiments were performed with varying water depths configurations of obstacles and dynamic disturbances to create various flow fields and the related contaminant dynamics imaging techniques were developed to visualize changes in flow velocity and tracer concentration the results showed a system error of approximately 7 10 indicating that this research s imaging technique can provide sufficient accuracy the results show the advantage of overcoming the difficulties of obtaining full range and time varying experimental data on flow velocity and concentration fields the proposed analysis method could successfully reflect the influence of different obstacle configurations and vibrant disturbance on the contaminant transport process obstacles represent islands or watery vegetation in constructed wetlands and vibrant disturbance indicates the impacts of aquatic animals the experimental results of tracer transport prove that the circulation phenomenon is related to the formation of a dead zone obstacles can extend the flow path increase residence time reduce short circuiting mitigate flow circulation and increase mixing effects such effects positively contribute to the improvement of hydraulic efficiency and pollutant removal efficiency and the benefits of expanded obstacle length become more pronounced over time the dynamic disturbance was induced with a robotic fish to reflect aquatic animals influence on the velocity and concentration fields the dynamic disturbance imitating fish movement could cause local eddy currents thereby effectively increasing the dissipation rate the application of dynamic disturbance may be a solution to the problem of pollutant accumulation in constructed wetlands author contributions shang shu

1367,there are few studies analyzing tracer experiments conducted in rock fractures at large scales 50 m and fewer still which have succeeded in simulating experimental data without the use of parameters which increase decrease with increasing scale of observation i e scaling or effective parameters to explore the use of effective parameters at large scales a numerical model is used to examine the results of a divergent tracer experiment conducted in sparsely fractured rock where five observation points ranged over distances from 30 to 125 m the experiment was conducted in what was first interpreted as a single horizontal fracture traceable using geological and hydraulic evidence over that range in distance initial simulations were conducted using measured values of porosity fracture aperture and regional hydraulic gradient but were not successful in matching the field data at all measured locations multiple fits of equal quality at each observation point however were obtained with models using effective parameters such as increasing porosity with scale to represent heterogeneity additional fits were achieved by physically representing the same heterogeneity with different conceptual models such as added horizontal and vertical fractures this illustrates the non uniqueness that arises in the interpretation of a divergent tracer experiment with multiple observation well distances using the models predictions at distances beyond the measured domain were then generated these showed that the choice of conceptual model significantly impacted simulated arrival times and concentrations at distances of only 75 175 m larger than the experimental scale in particular predictions made with effective parameters provided estimates that were less conservative i e under predicting concentrations than those made by directly adding heterogeneity to the numerical model keywords discrete fractures tracer experiment aqueous solute transport numerical modelling non uniqueness effective parameters 1 introduction to better understand and predict solute transport in fractured media forced gradient tracer experiments are often conducted breakthrough of tracers at monitoring wells near the injection point can be used to observe and characterize transport pathways and velocities in fractures becker and shapiro 2000 berkowitz 2002 hadermann and heer 1996 neuman 2005 novakowski et al 2004 robert et al 2012 sidle et al 1998 numerical or analytical simulation of breakthrough curves is often used both to evaluate and refine a conceptual model of the site and to constrain estimates of parameters such as dispersivity fracture aperture and matrix porosity becker and shapiro 2000 chen et al 2011 day lewis et al 2006 lapcevic et al 1999 jørgensen et al 1998 nordqvist et al 2012 tracer experiments using a variety of configurations have been conducted extensively in fractured rock at scales of 50 m cvetkovic et al 2010 d alessandro et al 1997 gelhar et al 1992 haggerty et al 2000 kosakowski et al 2001 mckay et al 1993 novakowski and lapcevic 1994 novakowski et al 2004 paillet et al 2012 reimus et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 the successful simulation of many of these experiments using simple advection dispersion models with the incorporation of important processes such as matrix diffusion or dispersion due to aperture heterogeneity has greatly improved the understanding of transport through fractured rock at these local scales bodin et al 2003 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2015 novakowski et al 2007 to predict contaminant migration in a field setting however it is important to understand and accurately assess transport in fractures at larger scales 50 m in this study an experiment greater than 50 m in scale is considered to be large scale due to the scarcity of tracer experiments conducted at distances larger than this for example in a review study by zhou et al 2007 only six of the approximately 40 fractured rock experiments were reported at scales above 50 m many of the studies in which large scale transport has been modelled use parameters with a measured basis but do not compare the modelled predictions to experimental transport data e g blessent et al 2011 cvetkovic and frampton 2012 hadgu et al 2017 joyce et al 2014 maloszewski and zuber 1985 pedretti and bianchi 2018 while some large scale experiments have been successfully modelled with just the advection dispersion equation and a term to account for matrix diffusion e g nordqvist et al 2012 other previously conducted multi scale experiments reported in the literature have either failed to fit a model to the data or have required that matrix porosity or hydraulic conductivity change with increasing scale of observation guimerà and carrera 2000 guihéneuf et al 2017 illman 2006 kurtzman et al 2007 novakowski and lapcevic 1994 sekhar and suresh kumar 2006 shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 scale effects have been attributed to a range of different processes including enhancement of diffusion to the presence of less conductive fractures connected to a primary fracture zhou et al 2007 advective mass transfer between high and low conductivity fractures shapiro 2001 and tortuosity in the flow path introduced by aperture variability novakowski and lapcevic 1994 lapcevic et al 1999 there has been little research however into the suitability of effective or scaling parameters which are here defined as parameters which increase or decrease with scale of observation for modelling transport at scales greater than those under which measurements have been taken as various processes can be used to explain scale effects in the results from tracer experiments the potential for non uniqueness in the interpretation of large scale transport through fractured rock is clearly significant non uniqueness in tracer experiments has been recognized widely becker and shapiro 2003 berkowitz et al 2006 divine and mcdonnell 2005 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 johnston et al 2009 sánchez vila and carrera j 2004 weatherill et al 2006 in a study of the effect of heterogeneity in fracture networks for example johnston et al 2009 demonstrated that the fracture geometry i e choice of orientation spacing and interconnections has a significant impact on solute breakthrough and that different fracture geometries can produce similar breakthrough profiles this latter effect was also identified in a theoretical study conducted using stochastic event synchrony yosri et al 2021 who demonstrated non uniqueness in interconnected pathways within a two dimensional fracture network based on analysis of synthetic breakthrough curves at approximately 30 nodes in the domain others have shown that a unique conceptual model cannot be found when interpreting multiple types of tracer experiments each conducted using one observation well e g becker and shapiro 2003 it remains unclear however if the use of breakthrough curves collected from multiple different locations at increasing scales in a tracer experiment could assist in improving the uniqueness of the solution for example by finding a single conceptual model to fit to all breakthrough data at all measured locations the primary objective of this study is to investigate the use of effective parameters in simulating large scale transport in discrete fractures through the analysis of a tracer experiment conducted over a range of observation scales between 30 and 125 m comparisons of predicted tracer concentrations between models using effective parameters and models which more closely represent the possible heterogeneity present in this experiment are made to determine if a scaling parameter can provide useful predictions and how successfully various processes such as tortuosity in the flow path are represented by a scale effect the second objective of this paper is to demonstrate the issues associated with non uniqueness inherent in interpreting divergent tracer experiments with multiple observation wells at large scales the experiment analyzed for this study was previously conducted in a dolostone aquifer at the smithville site in southern ontario canada 2 materials and methods to conduct this study the results of a large scale tracer experiment conducted previously were simulated in the following a description is provided of the site at which the tracer experiment was conducted the method employed for the experiment and the procedure used for the simulations the simulations were conducted using a three dimensional control volume finite element model hydrogeosphere which is based on the standard advection dispersion equation and which represents the fractures as discrete features brunner and simmons 2012 therrien and sudicky 1996 2 1 site description the tracer experiment analyzed in this study was conducted at a site north of the town of smithville in south eastern ontario canada fig 1 in the period of 1978 1985 the site housed pcb wastes from nearby municipalities novakowski et al 1999 following the discovery of pcbs in the subsurface in the 1980s at this site extensive investigations have been made to characterize the site hydrogeology these efforts as well as the experiment simulated for this research were conducted by previous authors novakowski et al 1999 moore 2008 and what follows is a short summation of the site geology and experimental method the surface geology at this site consists of approximately ten to fifteen meters of overburden glacial clay till beneath the overburden lies the lockport formation which is a silurian aged fractured dolostone liberty 1981 this formation is further subdivided into four units including the gasport goat island vinemount and eramosa members zanini et al 2000 the uppermost of these the eramosa is the unit in which the experiment was conducted this dolostone is characterized by dark grey to black colour laminations and vuggy features golder associates ltd 1995 novakowski and lapcevic 1988 the groundwater flow regime in the upper eramosa is dominated by a few conductive horizontal bedding plane fractures with large apertures 500 μm corresponding to transmissivities of greater than 10 5 m2 s zanini et al 2000 as measured using in situ constant head test methods at 0 5 m spacings novakowski et al 2007 apertures were obtained from the measured transmissivities using the cubic law snow 1965 these fractures are believed to be laterally connected over hundreds of meters novakowski et al 1999 evidence for this is provided by the low regional gradient the high transmissivity features which can be correlated over multiple boreholes and the appearance of the tracer across distances of over 100 m during experiments vertical fracture sets having five separate orientations also penetrate the unit the average spacing of the vertical fractures is 0 77 m based on direct measurement of fracture spacing in core from inclined boreholes the transmissivities of the vertical fractures which were also measured using constant head tests at 0 5 m spacing conducted in the inclined boreholes are mostly within a range of 10 9 to 10 6 m2 s however there are several with transmissivities on the order of 10 5 10 4 m2 s which may represent important features gartner lee ltd 1996 measured the heights of vertical fractures on faces at a nearby quarry and concluded that most are less than one m in length fractures with a length of greater than one m have a spacing of 5 20 m depending on the face the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix is far lower than that of the horizontal fractures with most measurements falling between 10 9 10 7 m s the porosity of the matrix was measured using gravimetric methods which involved weighing wet samples and then oven dried discs 5 20 mm in thickness collected from core based on 342 measurements the range was determined to be between 1 and 20 novakowski et al 1999 most values however were between 5 and 7 5 as determined from an interquartile range a regional horizontal hydraulic gradient was estimated at the site using measurements of hydraulic head in multi level piezometers and point dilution experiments conducted on site a mean gradient was calculated at a magnitude of approximately 0 0001 with groundwater flow oriented to the south east novakowski et al 2006 from hydraulic head observations made at four multi level piezometers surrounding the test site there is little to no indication of recharge or vertical flow between units of the wells constructed at the smithville site six were used for the tracer experiment these include a set of five wells which form a cluster and all lie within 30 40 m of one another approximately 100 m to the northwest of bh64 fig 1 the tracer experiment was conducted in a divergent fashion with injection at bh56 and subsequent breakthrough observed at the downstream wells all the wells were completed as open holes at the time of the experiment with isolation of the fracture used for the experiment conducted using straddle packer systems 2 2 tracer experiment to conduct the experiment a straddle packer system having a 0 5 m spacing was first used to isolate a test interval in each observation well the selected fracture for the experiment was the middle of three highly transmissive features identified in the upper eramosa that were hydraulically connected between the cluster of wells and bh64 fig 2 this fracture was located at a depth of approximately 14 5 m below ground surface elevation 180 masl and had a variable hydraulic aperture calculated from the constant head tests between 450 and 900 μm at the beginning of the experiment water was injected into the fracture in bh56 at a rate of 4 1 0 2 l min for 24 h prior to tracer addition this was done to achieve steady flow conditions once steady flow conditions were reached based on measurement of injection head in the surrounding wells which changed 1 over an hour or more a solution containing 1 g l of lissamine ff fluorescent dye and 1 5 g l of a kbr salt was then injected for 2 5 min at a rate of 4 1 l min lissamine ff was selected due to its relative resistance to retardation novakowski et al 2004 smart and laidlaw 1977 except for conditions where organic matter is prevalent such as in peat lissamine loses less than 10 of its mass to retardation smart and laidlaw 1977 as the fraction of organic carbon foc in the lockport formation at the smithville site was measured to be only 0 0011 substantial amounts of retardation were considered unlikely even over large transport distances the foc was measured using a leco cr12 carbon analyzer with crushed core samples once the injection of the tracer solution was complete the pumping continued in the injection well with clean water at steady conditions for the duration of the full observation period at each of the five observation wells packers with 0 5 m spacing were used to isolate the high transmissivity feature of interest fig 2 and samples were collected using a downhole bladder pump and 6 mm diameter tubing samples were not collected from other depths in the observation boreholes and thus the extent of tracer spreading in the vertical directions is unknown initially the samples were collected at half hour intervals and the sampling frequency was decreased at later times the total duration of the experiment was 668 h the samples were then analyzed for dye concentration with a fluorometer and for kbr concentration using an ion specific electrode 2 3 simulations a eularian discrete fracture approach was chosen for this study as it allows for full representation of the complex geology at the smithville site and with the exception of dispersivity uses only parameters which are measurable physical properties appendix a provides the governing equations as they were used for the simulations presented herein 2 3 1 initial simulation initially a simple steady state model for flow in a single fracture connected across the domain was generated referred to as the single fracture model a 500 500 0 5 m domain was used with the fracture located at 0 25 m height the size of the domain was chosen such that interactions between the distribution of hydraulic head solute and the boundaries would not influence the results while the domain is small vertically no effects on the transport solution were observed when expanded the injection well bh56 with a pumping rate of 4 1 l min was placed at the center of the domain the model accounts for wellbore mixing in the injection well the measured regional hydraulic gradient was applied across the domain by using a constant head boundary at two edges of the domain the other four edges were set as no flow boundaries the spatial and time discretization was a key component of this modelling study due to the potential inaccuracies caused by inadequate grid spacing and inappropriate time steps the approach taken to ensure accuracy is described in supplementary material part a for the simulation of the tracer experiment the initial concentration of lissamine in the domain was set as 0 g l at the beginning of the simulation a solute pulse corresponding to that of the experiment was injected into bh56 only the lissamine tracer was analyzed in this study as breakthrough was not observed for bromide due to the lack of the resolution of the ion electrode ion chromatography would not have helped as the kbr concentrations were indistinguishable from that of the background even at the closest observation well the relevant matrix and fracture parameters used in this initial model are summarized in table 1 fracture aperture hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and porosity are averages estimated from the various hydraulic tests hydraulic head measurements and core measurements discussed previously the free water diffusion coefficient is consistent with that used by novakowski et al 2004 the value of longitudinal dispersivity was set equal for the matrix and fracture and changed with the scale of observation with the smaller value used at wells in the cluster and the larger value at bh64 transverse dispersivity was always set to 1 10 the longitudinal value using this model breakthrough was simulated at each of the observation wells and then an analytical solution for mixing was incorporated to account for possible effects of formation water mixing with the observation well water palmer 1988 note that in this initial exercise separate simulations were used for each observation well to allow for the scaling of parameters e g dispersivity with distance where required other parameters were kept identical between the simulations at different observation wells initially to attempt to fit the modelled breakthrough curves to the measured concentrations the values of several parameters were varied over the complete range of measurement in a rudimentary sensitivity analysis the fracture aperture was varied between 400 and 1000 μm the matrix hydraulic conductivity between 10 10 and 10 7 m s the matrix porosity between 1 and 20 and the hydraulic gradient between 0 00005 and 0 0002 dispersivity was also varied from 0 1 m to 100 m in this paper fits between the simulations and the measured data were achieved manually and evaluated visually 2 3 2 simulations exploring processes and properties as will be discussed further in the results the matching of the initial model to all the measured breakthrough curves was not possible with a common set of hydrogeological parameters in this case effective porosities or apertures which increased or decreased respectively with observation scale were necessary to determine if fits could be obtained without the use of effective parameters a variety of conceptual models with increased heterogeneity were investigated through the comparison of the measured breakthrough curves to simulated curves produced by the numerical implementation of each model table 2 provides a summary of the processes and properties investigated and a brief description of the model attributes used using the initial model matrix porosity and fracture aperture were identified as the parameters which could have a great enough influence on transport at distances of over 100 m to fit the breakthrough curves therefore variations in the aperture the number of fractures and the possibility of high porosity regions were the focus when developing possible conceptual models to represent transport at the smithville site sections 3 1 3 2 and 4 2 in table 2 the resulting conceptual models that were simulated in this study are shown in fig 3 each of these is considered plausible based on what is known about heterogeneity within the eramosa dolostone note that the possibility of small amounts of non reversible adsorption or decay was considered in all of the conceptual models in this paper as the observed tail of the breakthrough at bh64 was otherwise impossible to explain section 1 1 table 2 the justification for this decay constant is further discussed in the results in the conceptual model shown in fig 3a section 3 1 table 2 the single fracture model was modified by adding a second horizontal fracture with an aperture of 250 μm to the domain fractures of this size are supported by the constant head tests this was connected to the primary fracture through vertical fractures with apertures of 500 μm where vertical fractures were added to the model domain the horizontal discretization was adjusted to use a small block size 700 μm near the fracture and to gradually coarsen away from the fracture to a maximum block size of 0 5 m this was done to avoid the effects of numerical dispersion the spacing of the vertical fractures in the model was 10 m it is hypothesized that these could represent longer highly transmissive vertical fractures with sparse spacing based on observations made by gartner lee ltd 1996 as discussed previously support for this is provided by the attribution of several transmissivities between 10 5 and 10 4 m2 s to vertical fractures as well as the observation of longer 1 m fractures in quarry faces in fig 3b the heterogeneity in aperture observed from constant head test interpretations was added to the initial model section 3 2 table 2 this was done by manually adding two regions of low aperture 100 μm one 10 m in length and the other 26 m to the domain while this is an extremely simplistic and likely somewhat unrealistic representation of aperture heterogeneity the goal of this was simply to test if aperture heterogeneity in some form could explain the observed breakthrough curves random generation of spatially correlated aperture fields using a gaussian distribution was also considered in this study section 3 2 2 table 2 but due to the lack of measurements for correlation length and aperture variance and the lack of success in fitting with these fields this was not pursued further see lapcevic et al 1999 for an example of the data necessary in this rock type note that for 3b only one reduced aperture region is shown due to the scale of the fig 30 m distance the second region was added at approximately 50 m distance from the injection well in the third conceptual model simulated in this study fig 3c regions with enhanced matrix porosities of 35 40 were added section 4 2 table 2 these regions were 4 m in length and had a spacing of 10 m these enhanced porosity regions are used in this study to represent highly fractured zones which contain numerous 10 fractures with very low 100 μm aperture a comparison between representing a highly fractured zone discretely with numerous 100 μm aperture fractures and with simply increasing the porosity surrounding the fracture showed no difference in the breakthrough curves up to 300 m from the injection well representing the fractured zone with an enhanced porosity significantly reduced the computation effort required to simulate transport support for this conceptual model is provided by core from smithville multiple zones with broken core and numerous fractures within a 50 cm length are observed in the core however the length and quantity of these regions is not well known it is plausible that they are related to fracture intersections finally fig 3d shows a model in which two of the conceptual models 3a and 3c were combined to create fractured regions surrounding the intersections of longer vertical and horizontal fractures in this model the broken regions were reduced to 2 m in length for each model in fig 3 the presented parameter values i e vertical fracture apertures closure region sizes spacings of enhanced porosity regions etc were determined from visual evaluation of the quality of fit between simulated concentrations and measured breakthrough curves the matrix porosity and the aperture of the predominant fracture s were also varied within the range of measured values to optimize the fit of the simulated curves to the observed only a single value of each parameter was used for each simulation to create a model with parameters consistent across the entire domain the one exception to this was longitudinal dispersivity which was increased with scale of observation from approximately 0 5 m at 40 m distance to between 6 and 10 m at 126 m distance from the injection well this is in line with what was observed by gelhar et al 1992 and the transverse dispersivity was set as 1 10 of the longitudinal ando et al 2003 marsily 1986 the scale effect in dispersivity was significantly reduced in the conceptual model 3d with a dispersivity of 0 4 m at 40 m distance and 0 8 at 126 m finally the last step in the analysis for this paper was to generate predictions at distances of 200 and 300 m from the injection well using the conceptual models which were interpreted to be capable of simulating the observed breakthroughs in all wells section 5 table 2 predictions were also made using effective parameter models further distances were not tested due to computational limits e g some models had in excess of 20 million nodes when observing 300 m distances which led to failures in convergence effective parameter predictions were generated using two methods in one the porosity or aperture of the corresponding effective parameter models which fit the breakthrough curve at bh64 were increased with scale of observation according to a power rule given by θ 2 37 r 0 395 where θ represents the porosity of the matrix domain and r is the radial distance from the injection well the power rule agrees with what has been observed in other studies zhou et al 2007 the second method involved using the same parameter values that were successful at bh64 to make predictions at further distances unscaled the resulting curves were then compared to one another as well as to predictions made using the effective parameter models which achieved fits 3 results and discussion this section describes the initial attempt at fitting the measured data using a single fracture and subsequent attempts at incorporating various configurations of heterogeneity in the fracture and rock matrix for much of the analysis two observation wells bh64 and bh58 are the focus these were chosen as they are representative of two different scales at a distance of 38 m from the injection well bh58 is illustrative of medium scales 50 m while bh64 which is 126 m from the injection well represents large scale transport 100 m note that for the other three wells in the cluster the observed breakthrough curves were similar to that of bh58 and although not presented in a figure simulation results were also compared to the measured data at these wells for corroboration of each model these results are provided in the supplementary material part b non uniqueness of the transport solution and the use of effective parameters are also discussed in this section using the results of predicted breakthrough curves at 200 m and 300 m from the injection well from the basic sensitivity analysis the effects of varying some of the components of the system such as the hydraulic gradient could be ruled out with little effort due to a small regional gradient 10 4 and the involvement of an injection well the resultant gradient was dominated by the presence of the well and thus spatial or temporal changes in the regional gradient did not have a significant effect on transport other parameters such as matrix hydraulic conductivity and a retardation factor for reversible adsorption were also determined to be insignificant to fitting the measured breakthrough curve either because they had little effect on the breakthrough or because it was not possible to develop a spatially consistent fit by varying them 3 1 single fracture model the breakthrough curves for bh58 and bh64 generated by the initial single fracture model are presented in fig 4 using the values shown in table 1 as is evident the fit between measured and simulated curves is poor especially for the peak of the curve and for late times at bh64 where there is approximately an order of magnitude difference between the peak of the simulated and measured curves there was uncertainty regarding the parameters used for the single fracture model above for example the full range of measured porosity values was 1 20 indicating more natural complexity in the porosity distribution than used in this simulation in addition as the porosity measurements were conducted at a small scale there was uncertainty regarding what constituted a representative value there was also uncertainty in the aperture used as there were only five measurements which were conducted at a small scale 0 5 m interval constant head tests and showed significant variability 450 900 μm it was unlikely that a single value calculated from the arithmetic average is representative of the system the variation of parameters discussed in the methodology section was used to address these uncertainties and it was concluded that whichever parameter values were chosen a single fit with spatially consistent parameters could not be found with this simple model as an example the effect of variation of fracture aperture is shown in fig 4 3 2 model based on effective parameters while the single fracture model was unable to simulate the breakthrough accurately at all observation points it was observed that a model that made use of effective parameters could do so fig 5 two sets of simulations were generated that involved fitting each breakthrough curve at the site individually by scaling a single parameter table 3 one set of fits was produced by decreasing aperture with increasing observation scale as discussed previously this type of effective parameter has been used in past studies to represent increasingly tortuous transport pathways with scale lapcevic et al 1999 in a similar fashion to scaling fracture aperture it was possible to achieve fits to the measured data by increasing the matrix porosity of the simulation such that at bh64 θ was over a factor of two larger than the mean porosity measured from core effective diffusion parameters larger than lab measured values have been used in past studies to represent processes such as mass exchange between high and low transmissivity fractures shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 notably zhou et al 2007 determined that the scale effect increased with observation distance i e larger differences between the effective diffusion coefficients and the lab measured values with increasing distance note that while fits could be achieved using these effective parameters their use does not offer any explanation regarding the transport processes that occur during the tracer experiment furthermore as they vary with scale of observation making predictions about transport at scales larger than measured will result in significant uncertainty this is especially true as there is no evidence that the change in effective parameters at each site follows a determinable trend therefore a model which better simulated the processes influencing transport was desired 3 3 fits from different conceptual models of heterogeneity through the use of vertical interconnections between multiple horizontal fractures fig 3a a fit between the measured and simulated data was obtained at all five observation wells using spatially consistent parameters based on field and laboratory measurements fig 6 this configuration had the effect of adding tortuosity to the flow path by allowing solute to disperse through the system through diffusion in the vertical fractures from the primary fracture to the second horizontal fracture the parameters used for this model with the exception of dispersivity were identical at bh58 bh59 bh55 and bh64 the observed breakthrough curve at bh57 was anomalous in that it was best fit with a model using a 150 μm smaller aperture for the secondary horizontal fracture this could be explained by bh57 being slightly offset from the other wells in the cluster and thus the tracer may have encountered a slightly different configuration of fractures than that of the path to bh58 and bh64 the potential importance of fracture interconnections has been recognized in previous studies berkowitz 2002 guihéneuf et al 2017 kang et al 2015 for example a network of vertical fractures which intersected horizontal fractures has been used in the past to model a tracer experiment conducted in a fractured chalk aquifer kurtzman et al 2007 in that case the authors were unable to completely simulate the measured breakthrough curves but did conclude that the model which included both horizontal and vertical fractures was best able to explain the data as shown in fig 6 fits to the measured data at all five observation wells were also obtained by adding heterogeneity to the aperture of the single fracture model fig 3b this is evidence of non uniqueness in the interpretation of this experiment while fractures are often represented as smooth parallel plates reality is better represented by bottlenecks of low aperture combined with adjacent higher aperture pathways which create preferential and tortuous pathways for transport within the fracture plane de dreuzy et al 2012 odén et al 2008 tsang and neretnieks 1998 zheng et al 2008 adding heterogeneity to the aperture created increasingly tortuous flow paths with increasing scale that resulted in effectively identical curves to those produced by transport through multiple horizontal and vertical fractures significant variability in the aperture was measured at the site indicating that heterogeneity in the aperture may have had an impact on transport a third set of model fits using spatially consistent values was achieved through the addition of highly fractured zones represented by an increased matrix porosity fig 3c with this set of simulations the small fractures within the fractured zones allowed for an enhancement of matrix diffusion along flow paths which resulted in enough mass loss to achieve fits note that heterogeneity of the primary matrix porosity alone was unable to explain the difference between observed and simulated breakthrough curves because average porosities far larger than the measured average of 5 7 5 were required to simulate the observed breakthrough past studies have recognized the potential importance of matrix diffusion processes at large scales feenstra et al 1984 freeze and cherry 1979 grisak and pickens 1980 several papers have also discussed various explanations for enhanced diffusion gwo et al 2005 lu et al 2011 maloszewski and zuber 1993 nordqvist et al 2012 shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 as previously discussed zhou et al 2007 and shapiro 2001 suggested that enhanced diffusion caused by numerous small non transmissive fractures connected to larger more transmissive features could be important these papers however represented this enhanced diffusion through the use of a scaling parameter as opposed to creating distinct regions of dense fracturing within the model it is further possible that other explanations not considered in this paper may exist for enhancing matrix exchange for example transport mechanisms such as advective mass transfer or enhanced diffusion caused by accelerated fluid movement within the fracture wu et al 2010 could play a role in explaining transport within the upper eramosa and were not directly tested in this study simulations with a combination of two conceptual models fig 3d were also fit to the observed data the quality of the fit at bh64 was not as close to the measured breakthrough as the other configurations but still matched the peak and tail well fig 6 the addition of aperture heterogeneity may have helped with the quality of the fit but this was not possible in this study due to the computational effort required to discretize such a complex domain although only one combination of conceptual models was tested in this paper it is entirely plausible that other configurations of heterogeneity could also explain the tracer breakthrough concentrations note that the preceding fits were only possible by adding dye loss which was represented in this study using first order decay the effect of the decay constant on the fit achieved at bh64 is illustrated in fig 7 without the use of a decay constant the falling limb of the concentration curve was always overestimated by the model no matter what the combination of parameters note that adding decay alone to the single fracture model was unable to achieve a fit and that heterogeneity in the model was still required to explain transport within this system the range of values used for the decay constant was between 4 5 10 7 and 8 10 7 s 1 for all simulations in this study these values were determined from fitting the four conceptual models to the measured breakthrough curves while there has been little study into quantifying decay constants for lissamine the use of such was considered here as there is some evidence for the loss of small amounts of lissamine especially over experiments lasting weeks holden and burt 2002 smart and laidlaw 1977 one explanation for fluorescent dye loss is a small degree of non reversible adsorption smart and laidlaw 1977 which would appear like a decay process while lissamine as previously mentioned is resistant to adsorption and the organic content of the dolostone was low even adsorption of 5 10 of the dye mass could noticeably affect the breakthrough curve over large distances alternatively dye loss due to horizontal or vertical spreading of solute along the fracture network to regions outside the measurement domain is plausible finally the loss could be due to photochemical decay during the sampling and measurement of dye or due to biodegradation both during the test and after sampling bottrell et al 2010 field et al 1995 smart and laidlaw 1977 3 4 non uniqueness with parameters to compound the issue of non uniqueness in modelling transport in this study it was also possible to achieve multiple fits of equal quality within each conceptual model through the variation of matrix porosity dispersivity and fracture aperture fig 8 while even small changes to individual parameters resulted in significant effects on the breakthrough curves e g a 200 μm change to aperture results in the peak concentration increasing by more than a third at bh64 at the scales relevant to this study multiple combinations of these parameters could be used to achieve very similar results thus constraining the values of the measured parameters using the model was not possible at this site variation of other parameters related to the fracture network within each conceptual model such as the fracture spacing indicated further uncertainty in the precise configuration of fractures present for example in the vertical fracture model fig 3a variations of spacing between the horizontal fractures of less than 50 cm could be accounted by very small 50 μm alterations to the primary fracture aperture this only served to further add to the non uniqueness of the solution 3 5 scaling up predictions to illustrate the impact engendered by non uniqueness predictions of breakthrough curves at distances of 200 and 300 m from the injection source fig 9 were generated using the models which accurately simulated the measured breakthrough at all observation wells at 300 m from the injection source there is more than a factor of four difference in concentration between the lowest estimate and the highest estimate of the four models that tested conceptual models of heterogeneity there is also a difference in the arrival times for these curves and these differences grow with distance fig 9a versus 9b given even greater travel distance the arrival times are likely to be even more substantially different this suggests that although there are some similarities in the predictions from the different conceptual models of heterogeneity especially at late times the choice of model used could result in significantly different estimates of breakthrough times and peak concentrations at unmeasured larger scale locations note that fig 9 likely does not depict the full range of equally probable models but merely some representative examples from this study thus the possible range of estimates could be even larger than what is presented at both 200 m and 300 m from the injection source the predictions made using an effective parameter fig 9b were also divergent from those made by the four conceptual models while there is some overlap between the predictions from conceptual models and those using effective parameters it was observed that the latter estimates tend to be less conservative with lower peak concentrations by a factor of four and later arrival times by as much as 50 in particular predictions from each effective parameter were much lower than those from a model which more closely represented the same heterogeneity in the numerical model for example while the effective porosity and the model with highly fractured zones represent the same enhancement of matrix diffusion at larger scales the effective model predicts breakthrough 150 h later at 300 m distance because of this caution should be used when applying effective parameters to represent increasing heterogeneity with scale or to make predictions of transport in fractured rock at scales larger than measured 4 conclusions and recommendations in this study a control volume finite element model was used to simulate breakthrough curves obtained from a previously conducted divergent tracer experiment performed at a scale of approximately 40 125 m in potential discrete fractures in dolostone at a site in southern ontario the purpose of this analysis was to better understand how appropriate the use of effective scaling parameters can be in simulating transport in fractured settings the issues of non uniqueness in obtaining transport solutions from divergent tracer experiments with multiple observation wells and how this non uniqueness influences predictions at scales greater than measured were also explored the methodology involved the development of an initial single fracture model using properties estimated from field tests and then testing a range of conceptual models and effective parameter models to achieve a fit between the model and all of the measured breakthrough curves i e each model fit all data predictions of breakthrough at 200 m and 300 m were then made using these models and the resulting curves compared the following conclusions are drawn from this study a sensitivity analysis indicated that matrix porosity the number of fractures and the aperture of fractures were the most influential parameters in this study multiple configurations of fracture and matrix heterogeneity were found to achieve acceptable fits between the measured breakthrough curves and the simulations in particular the addition of vertical fractures aperture heterogeneity highly fractured zones and a combination of the vertical fractures and fractured zones each provided viable simulations to the measured concentrations the parameters used in each simulation agreed with the measured range of values and were spatially consistent over the domain non uniqueness of the transport solution is clearly present when simulating transport at large scales fits between simulated and measured breakthrough curves could also be achieved using effective parameters in a manner consistent with previous studies predictions at 200 m and 300 m from the injection well indicated that the different configurations of aperture and matrix porosity heterogeneity produce dissimilar outputs suggesting that the choice in the model of heterogeneity at this site is important the predictions at 200 300 m distance also suggest that effective parameters are a less conservative choice in the attempt to make accurate predictions when modelling transport at larger scale as they tended to significantly under predict concentrations relative to models which represent fracture and matrix heterogeneity in the numerical model the present study was confined to transport primarily through a large isolated fracture as there were indications however of the possible influence of multiple fractures both vertical and horizontal even in a what was thought to be a single fracture experiment a larger experimental scale encompassing a broader fracture network may resolve some of the uncertainties presented in this paper experiments using additional tracers with different diffusion properties or a different flow configuration could also be useful in resolving issues of non uniqueness in the interpretation of tracer experiments overall despite the difficulty in doing so more large scale experiments in fractured rock are clearly required to further understand transport processes in these settings finally the predictions we have shown at larger scale have significant implications with estimating the uncertainty with the timing and concentration of plume arrival at receptors that are present further downstream at a contaminated site the uncertainty with where a contaminant mass may reside i e matrix versus fractures will also likely grow with travel distance and time both of these issues require further exploration through numerical analysis credit author statement matt howroyd conceptualization software investigation methodology writing original draft kent

1367,there are few studies analyzing tracer experiments conducted in rock fractures at large scales 50 m and fewer still which have succeeded in simulating experimental data without the use of parameters which increase decrease with increasing scale of observation i e scaling or effective parameters to explore the use of effective parameters at large scales a numerical model is used to examine the results of a divergent tracer experiment conducted in sparsely fractured rock where five observation points ranged over distances from 30 to 125 m the experiment was conducted in what was first interpreted as a single horizontal fracture traceable using geological and hydraulic evidence over that range in distance initial simulations were conducted using measured values of porosity fracture aperture and regional hydraulic gradient but were not successful in matching the field data at all measured locations multiple fits of equal quality at each observation point however were obtained with models using effective parameters such as increasing porosity with scale to represent heterogeneity additional fits were achieved by physically representing the same heterogeneity with different conceptual models such as added horizontal and vertical fractures this illustrates the non uniqueness that arises in the interpretation of a divergent tracer experiment with multiple observation well distances using the models predictions at distances beyond the measured domain were then generated these showed that the choice of conceptual model significantly impacted simulated arrival times and concentrations at distances of only 75 175 m larger than the experimental scale in particular predictions made with effective parameters provided estimates that were less conservative i e under predicting concentrations than those made by directly adding heterogeneity to the numerical model keywords discrete fractures tracer experiment aqueous solute transport

2007 the successful simulation of many of these experiments using simple advection dispersion models with the incorporation of important processes such as matrix diffusion or dispersion due to aperture heterogeneity has greatly improved the understanding of transport through fractured rock at these local scales bodin et al 2003 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2015 novakowski et al 2007 to predict contaminant migration in a field setting however it is important to understand and accurately assess transport in fractures at larger scales 50 m in this study an experiment greater than 50 m in scale is considered to be large scale due to the scarcity of tracer experiments conducted at distances larger than this for example in a review study by zhou et al 2007 only six of the approximately 40 fractured rock experiments were reported at scales above 50 m many of the studies in which large scale transport has been modelled use parameters with a measured basis but do not compare the modelled predictions to experimental transport data e g blessent et al 2011 cvetkovic and frampton 2012 hadgu et al 2017 joyce et al 2014 maloszewski and zuber 1985 pedretti and bianchi 2018 while some large scale experiments have been successfully modelled with just the advection dispersion equation and a term to account for matrix diffusion e g nordqvist et al 2012 other previously conducted multi scale experiments reported in the literature have either failed to fit a model to the data or have required that matrix porosity or hydraulic conductivity change with increasing scale of observation guimerà and carrera 2000 guihéneuf et al 2017 illman 2006 kurtzman et al 2007 novakowski and lapcevic 1994 sekhar and suresh kumar 2006 shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 scale effects have been attributed to a range of different processes including enhancement of diffusion to the presence of less conductive fractures connected to a primary fracture zhou et al 2007 advective mass transfer between high and low conductivity fractures shapiro 2001 and tortuosity in the flow path introduced by aperture variability novakowski and lapcevic 1994 lapcevic et al 1999 there has been little research however into the suitability of effective or scaling parameters which are here defined as parameters which increase or decrease with scale of observation for modelling transport at scales greater than those under which measurements have been taken as various processes can be used to explain scale effects in the results from tracer experiments the potential for non uniqueness in the interpretation of large scale transport through fractured rock is clearly significant non uniqueness in tracer experiments has been recognized widely becker and shapiro 2003 berkowitz et al 2006 divine and mcdonnell 2005 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 johnston et al 2009 sánchez vila and carrera j 2004 weatherill et al 2006 in a study of the effect of heterogeneity in fracture networks for example johnston et al 2009 demonstrated that the fracture geometry i e choice of orientation spacing and interconnections has a significant impact on solute breakthrough and that different fracture geometries can produce similar breakthrough profiles this latter effect was also identified in a theoretical study conducted using stochastic event synchrony yosri et al 2021 who demonstrated non uniqueness in interconnected pathways within a two dimensional fracture network based on analysis of synthetic breakthrough curves at approximately 30 nodes in the domain others have shown that a unique conceptual model cannot be found when interpreting multiple types of tracer experiments each conducted using one observation well e g becker and shapiro 2003 it remains unclear however if the use of breakthrough curves collected from multiple different locations at increasing scales in a tracer experiment could assist in improving the uniqueness of the solution for example by finding a single conceptual model to fit to all breakthrough data at all measured locations the primary objective of this study is to investigate the use of effective parameters in simulating large scale transport in discrete fractures through the analysis of a tracer experiment conducted over a range of observation scales between 30 and 125 m comparisons of predicted tracer concentrations between models using effective parameters and models which more closely represent the possible heterogeneity present in this experiment are made to determine if a scaling parameter can provide useful predictions and how successfully various processes such as tortuosity in the flow path are represented by a scale effect the second objective of this paper is to demonstrate the issues associated with non uniqueness inherent in interpreting divergent tracer experiments with multiple observation wells at large scales the experiment analyzed for this study was previously conducted in a dolostone aquifer at the smithville site in southern ontario canada 2 materials and methods to conduct this study the results of a large scale tracer experiment conducted previously were simulated

extensive investigations have been made to characterize the site hydrogeology these efforts as well as the experiment simulated for this research were conducted by previous authors novakowski et al 1999 moore 2008 and what follows is a short summation of the site geology and experimental method the surface geology at this site consists of approximately ten to fifteen meters of overburden glacial clay till beneath the overburden lies the lockport formation which is a silurian aged fractured dolostone liberty 1981 this formation is further subdivided into four units including the gasport goat island vinemount and eramosa members zanini et al 2000 the uppermost of these the eramosa is the unit in which the experiment was conducted this dolostone is characterized by dark grey to black colour laminations and vuggy features golder associates ltd 1995 novakowski and lapcevic 1988 the groundwater flow regime in the upper eramosa is dominated by a few conductive horizontal bedding plane fractures with large apertures 500 μm corresponding to transmissivities of greater than 10 5 m2 s zanini et al 2000 as measured using in situ constant head test methods at 0 5 m spacings novakowski et al 2007 apertures were obtained from the measured transmissivities using the cubic law snow 1965 these fractures are believed to be laterally connected over hundreds of meters novakowski et al 1999 evidence for this is provided by the low regional gradient the high transmissivity features which can be correlated over multiple boreholes and the appearance of the tracer across distances of over 100 m during experiments vertical fracture sets having five separate orientations also penetrate the unit the average spacing of the vertical fractures is 0 77 m based on direct measurement of fracture spacing in core from inclined boreholes the transmissivities of the vertical fractures which were also measured using constant head tests at 0 5 m spacing conducted in the inclined boreholes are mostly within a range of 10 9 to 10 6 m2 s however there are several with transmissivities on the order of 10 5 10 4 m2 s which may represent important features gartner lee ltd 1996 measured the heights of vertical fractures on faces at a nearby quarry and concluded that most are less than one m in length fractures with a length of greater than one m have a spacing of 5 20 m depending on the face the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix is far lower than that of the horizontal fractures with most measurements falling between 10 9 10 7 m s the porosity of the matrix was measured using gravimetric methods which involved weighing wet samples and then oven dried discs 5 20 mm in thickness collected from core based on 342 measurements the range was determined to be between 1 and 20 novakowski et al 1999 most values however were between 5 and 7 5 as determined from an interquartile range a regional horizontal hydraulic gradient was estimated at the site using measurements of hydraulic head in multi level piezometers and point dilution experiments conducted on site a mean gradient was calculated at a magnitude of approximately 0 0001 with groundwater flow oriented to the south east novakowski et al 2006 from hydraulic head observations made at four multi level piezometers surrounding the test site there is little to no indication of recharge or vertical flow between units of the wells constructed at the smithville site six were used for the tracer experiment these include a set of five wells which form a cluster and all lie within 30 40 m of one another approximately 100 m to the northwest of bh64 fig 1 the tracer experiment was conducted in a divergent fashion with injection at bh56 and subsequent breakthrough observed at the downstream wells all the wells were completed as open holes at the time of the experiment with isolation of the fracture used for the experiment conducted using straddle packer systems 2 2 tracer experiment to conduct the experiment a straddle packer system having a 0 5 m spacing was first used to isolate a test interval in each observation well the selected fracture for the experiment was the middle of three highly transmissive features identified in the upper eramosa that were hydraulically connected between the cluster of wells and bh64 fig 2 this fracture was located at a depth of approximately 14 5 m below ground surface elevation 180 masl and had a variable hydraulic aperture calculated from the constant head tests between 450 and 900 μm at the beginning of the experiment water was injected into the fracture in bh56 at a rate of 4 1 0 2 l min for 24 h prior to tracer addition this was done to achieve steady flow conditions once steady flow conditions were reached based on measurement of injection head in the surrounding wells which changed 1 over an hour or more a solution containing 1 g l of lissamine ff fluorescent dye and 1 5 g l of a kbr salt was then injected for 2 5 min at a rate of 4 1 l min lissamine ff was selected due to its relative resistance to retardation novakowski et al 2004 smart and laidlaw 1977 except for conditions where organic matter is prevalent such as in peat lissamine loses less than 10 of its mass to retardation smart and laidlaw 1977 as the fraction of organic carbon foc in the lockport formation at the smithville site was measured to be only 0 0011 substantial amounts of retardation were considered unlikely even over large transport distances the foc was measured using a leco cr12 carbon analyzer with crushed core samples once the injection of the tracer solution was complete the pumping continued in the injection well with clean water at steady conditions for the duration of the full observation period at each of the five observation wells packers with 0 5 m spacing were used to isolate the high transmissivity feature of interest fig 2 and samples were collected using a downhole bladder pump and 6 mm diameter tubing samples were not collected from other depths in the observation boreholes and thus the extent of tracer spreading in the vertical directions is unknown initially the samples were collected at half hour intervals and the sampling frequency was decreased at later times the total duration of the experiment was 668 h the samples were then analyzed for dye concentration with a fluorometer and for kbr concentration using an ion specific electrode 2 3 simulations a eularian discrete fracture approach was chosen for this study as it allows for full representation of the complex geology at the smithville site and with the exception of dispersivity uses only parameters which are measurable physical properties appendix a provides the governing equations as they were used for the simulations presented herein 2 3 1 initial simulation initially a simple steady state model for flow in a single fracture connected across the domain was generated referred to as the single fracture model a 500 500 0 5 m domain was used with the fracture located at 0 25 m height the size of the domain was chosen such that interactions between the distribution of hydraulic head solute and the boundaries would not influence the results while the domain is small vertically no effects on the transport solution were observed when expanded the injection well bh56 with a pumping rate of 4 1 l min was placed at the center of the domain the model accounts for wellbore mixing in the injection well the measured regional hydraulic gradient was applied across the domain by using a constant head boundary at two edges of the domain the other four edges were set as no flow boundaries the spatial and time discretization was a key component of this modelling study due to the potential inaccuracies caused by inadequate grid spacing and inappropriate time steps the approach taken to ensure accuracy is described in supplementary material part a for the simulation of the tracer experiment the initial concentration of lissamine in the domain was set as 0 g l at the beginning of the simulation a solute pulse corresponding to that of the experiment was injected into bh56 only the lissamine tracer was analyzed in this study as breakthrough was not observed for bromide due to the lack of the resolution of the ion electrode ion chromatography would not have helped as the kbr concentrations were indistinguishable from that of the background even at the closest observation well the relevant matrix and fracture parameters used in this initial model are summarized in table 1 fracture aperture hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and porosity are averages estimated from the various hydraulic tests hydraulic head measurements and core measurements discussed previously the free water diffusion coefficient is consistent with that used by novakowski et al 2004 the value of longitudinal dispersivity was set equal for the matrix and fracture and changed with the scale of observation with the smaller value used at wells in the cluster and the larger value at bh64 transverse dispersivity was always set to 1 10 the longitudinal value using this model breakthrough was simulated at each of the observation wells and then an analytical solution for mixing was incorporated to account for possible effects of formation water mixing with the observation well water palmer 1988 note that in this initial exercise separate simulations were used for each observation well to allow for the scaling of parameters e g dispersivity with distance where required other parameters were kept identical between the simulations at different observation wells initially to attempt to fit the modelled breakthrough curves to the measured concentrations the values of several parameters were varied over the complete range of measurement in a rudimentary sensitivity analysis the fracture aperture was varied between 400 and 1000 μm the matrix hydraulic conductivity between 10 10 and 10 7 m s the matrix porosity between 1 and 20 and the hydraulic gradient between 0 00005 and 0 0002 dispersivity was also varied from 0 1 m to 100 m in this paper fits between the simulations and the measured data were achieved manually and evaluated visually 2 3 2 simulations exploring processes and properties as will be discussed further in the results the matching of the initial model to all the measured breakthrough curves was not possible with a common set of hydrogeological parameters in this case effective porosities or apertures which increased or decreased respectively with observation scale were necessary to determine if fits could be obtained without the use of effective parameters a variety of conceptual models with increased heterogeneity were investigated through the comparison of the measured breakthrough curves to simulated curves produced by the numerical implementation of each model table 2 provides a summary of the processes and properties investigated and a brief description of the model attributes used using the initial model matrix porosity and fracture aperture were identified as the parameters which could have a great enough influence on transport at distances of over 100 m to fit the breakthrough curves therefore variations in the aperture the number of fractures and the possibility of high porosity regions were the focus when developing possible conceptual models to represent transport at the smithville site sections 3 1 3 2 and 4 2 in table 2 the resulting conceptual models that were simulated in this study are shown in fig 3 each of these is considered plausible based on what is known about heterogeneity within the eramosa dolostone note that the possibility of small amounts of non reversible adsorption or decay was considered in all of the conceptual models in this paper as the observed tail of the breakthrough at bh64 was otherwise impossible to explain section 1 1 table 2 the justification for this decay constant is further discussed in the results in the conceptual model shown in fig 3a section 3 1 table 2 the single fracture model was modified by adding a second horizontal fracture with an aperture of 250 μm to the domain fractures of this size are supported by the constant head tests this was connected to the primary fracture through vertical fractures with apertures of 500 μm where vertical fractures were added to the model domain the horizontal discretization was adjusted to use a small block size 700 μm near the fracture and to gradually coarsen away from the fracture to a maximum block size of 0 5 m this was done to avoid the effects of numerical dispersion the spacing of the vertical fractures in the model was 10 m it is hypothesized that these could represent longer highly transmissive vertical fractures with sparse spacing based on observations made by gartner lee ltd 1996 as discussed previously support for this is provided by the attribution of several transmissivities between 10 5 and 10 4 m2 s to vertical fractures as well as the observation of longer 1 m fractures in quarry faces in fig 3b the heterogeneity in aperture observed from constant head test interpretations was added to the initial model section 3 2 table 2 this was done by manually adding two regions of low aperture 100 μm one 10 m in length and the other 26 m to the domain while this is an extremely simplistic and likely somewhat unrealistic representation of aperture heterogeneity the goal of this was simply to test if aperture heterogeneity in some form could explain the observed breakthrough curves random generation of spatially correlated aperture fields using a gaussian distribution was also considered in this study section 3 2 2 table 2 but due to the lack of measurements for correlation length and aperture variance and the lack of success in fitting with these fields this was not pursued further see lapcevic et al 1999 for an example of the data necessary in this rock type note that for 3b only one reduced aperture region is shown due to the scale of the fig 30 m distance the second region was added at approximately 50 m distance from the injection well in the third conceptual model simulated in this study fig 3c regions with enhanced matrix porosities of 35 40 were added section 4 2 table 2 these regions were 4 m in length and had a spacing of 10 m these enhanced porosity regions are used in this study to represent highly fractured zones which contain numerous 10 fractures with very low 100 μm aperture a comparison between representing a highly fractured zone discretely with numerous 100 μm aperture fractures and with simply increasing the porosity surrounding the fracture showed no difference in the breakthrough curves up to 300 m from the injection well representing the fractured zone with an enhanced porosity significantly reduced the computation effort required to simulate transport support for this conceptual model is provided by core from smithville multiple zones with broken core and numerous fractures within a 50 cm length are observed in the core however the length and quantity of these regions is not well known it is plausible that they are related to fracture intersections finally fig 3d shows a model in which two of the conceptual models 3a and 3c were combined to create fractured regions surrounding the intersections of longer vertical and horizontal fractures in this model the broken regions were reduced to 2 m in length for each model in fig 3 the presented parameter values i e vertical fracture apertures closure region sizes spacings of enhanced porosity regions etc were determined from visual evaluation of the quality of fit between simulated concentrations and measured breakthrough curves the matrix porosity and the aperture of the predominant fracture s were also varied within the range of measured values to optimize the fit of the simulated curves to the observed only a single value of each parameter was used for each simulation to create a model with parameters consistent across the entire domain the one exception to this was longitudinal dispersivity which was increased with scale of observation from approximately 0 5 m at 40 m distance to between 6 and 10 m at 126 m distance from the injection well this is in line with what was observed by gelhar et al 1992 and the transverse dispersivity was set as 1 10 of the longitudinal ando et al 2003 marsily 1986 the scale effect in dispersivity was significantly reduced in the conceptual model 3d with a dispersivity of 0 4 m at 40 m distance and 0 8 at 126 m finally the last step in the analysis for this paper was to generate predictions at distances of 200 and 300 m from the injection well using the conceptual models which were interpreted to be capable of simulating the observed breakthroughs in all wells section 5 table 2 predictions were also made using effective parameter models further distances were not tested due to computational limits e g some models had in excess of 20 million nodes when observing 300 m distances which led to failures in convergence effective parameter predictions were generated using two methods in one the porosity or aperture of the corresponding effective parameter models which fit the breakthrough curve at bh64 were increased with scale of observation according to a power rule given by θ 2 37 r 0 395 where θ represents the porosity of the matrix domain and r is the radial distance from the injection well the power rule agrees with what has been observed in other studies zhou et al 2007 the second method involved using the same parameter values that were successful at bh64 to make predictions at further distances unscaled the resulting curves were then compared to one another as well as to predictions made using the effective parameter models which achieved fits 3 results and discussion this section describes the initial attempt at fitting the measured data using a single fracture and subsequent attempts at incorporating various configurations of heterogeneity in the fracture and rock matrix for much of the analysis two observation wells bh64 and bh58 are the focus these were chosen as they are representative of two different scales at a distance of 38 m from the injection well bh58 is illustrative of medium scales 50 m while bh64 which is 126 m from the injection well represents large scale transport 100 m note that for the other three wells in the cluster the observed breakthrough curves were similar to that of bh58 and although not presented in a figure simulation results were also compared to the measured data at these wells for corroboration of each model these results are provided in the supplementary material part b non uniqueness of the transport solution and the use of effective parameters are also discussed in this section using the results of predicted breakthrough curves at 200 m and 300 m from the injection well from the basic sensitivity analysis the effects of varying some of the components of the system such as the hydraulic gradient could be ruled out with little effort due to a small regional gradient 10 4 and the involvement of an injection well the resultant gradient was dominated by the presence of the well and thus spatial or temporal changes in the regional gradient did not have a significant effect on transport other parameters such as matrix hydraulic conductivity and a retardation factor for reversible adsorption were also determined to be insignificant to fitting the measured breakthrough curve either because they had little effect on the breakthrough or because it was not possible to develop a spatially consistent fit by varying them 3 1 single fracture model the breakthrough curves for bh58 and bh64 generated by the initial single fracture model are presented in fig 4 using the values shown in table 1 as is evident the fit between measured and simulated curves is poor especially for the peak of the curve and for late times at bh64 where there is approximately an order of magnitude difference between the peak of the simulated and measured curves there was uncertainty regarding the parameters used for the single fracture model above for example the full range of measured porosity values was 1 20 indicating more natural complexity in the porosity distribution than used in this simulation in addition as the porosity measurements were conducted at a small scale there was uncertainty regarding what constituted a representative value there was also uncertainty in the aperture used as there were only five measurements which were conducted at a small scale 0 5 m interval constant head tests and showed significant variability 450 900 μm it was unlikely that a single value calculated from the arithmetic average is representative of the system the variation of parameters discussed in the methodology section was used to address these uncertainties and it was concluded that whichever parameter values were chosen a single fit with spatially consistent parameters could not be found with this simple model as an example the effect of variation of fracture aperture is shown in fig 4 3 2 model based on effective parameters while the single fracture model was unable to simulate the breakthrough accurately at all observation points it was observed that a model that made use of effective parameters could do so fig 5 two sets of simulations were generated that involved fitting each breakthrough curve at the site individually by scaling a single parameter table 3 one set of fits was produced by decreasing aperture with increasing observation scale as discussed previously this type of effective parameter has been used in past studies to represent increasingly tortuous transport pathways with scale lapcevic et al 1999 in a similar fashion to scaling fracture aperture it was possible to achieve fits to the measured data by increasing the matrix porosity of the simulation such that at bh64 θ was over a factor of two larger than the mean porosity measured from core effective diffusion parameters larger than lab measured values have been used in past studies to represent processes such as mass exchange between high and low transmissivity fractures shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 notably zhou et al 2007 determined that the scale effect increased with observation distance i e larger differences between the effective diffusion coefficients and the lab measured values with increasing distance note that while fits could be achieved using these effective parameters their use does not offer any explanation regarding the transport processes that occur during the tracer experiment furthermore as they vary with scale of observation making predictions about transport at scales larger than measured will result in significant uncertainty this is especially true as there is no evidence that the change in effective parameters at each site follows a determinable trend therefore a model which better simulated the processes influencing transport was desired 3 3 fits from different conceptual models of heterogeneity through the use of vertical interconnections between multiple horizontal fractures fig 3a a fit between the measured and simulated data was obtained at all five observation wells using spatially consistent parameters based on field and laboratory measurements fig 6 this configuration had the effect of adding tortuosity to the flow path by allowing solute to disperse through the system through diffusion in the vertical fractures from the primary fracture to the second horizontal fracture the parameters used for this model with the exception of dispersivity were identical at bh58 bh59 bh55 and bh64 the observed breakthrough curve at bh57 was anomalous in that it was best fit with a model using a 150 μm smaller aperture for the secondary horizontal fracture this could be explained by bh57 being slightly offset from the other wells in the cluster and thus the tracer may have encountered a slightly different configuration of fractures than that of the path to bh58 and bh64 the potential importance of fracture interconnections has been recognized in previous studies berkowitz 2002 guihéneuf et al 2017 kang et al 2015 for example a network of vertical fractures which intersected horizontal fractures has been used in the past to model a tracer experiment conducted in a fractured chalk aquifer kurtzman et al 2007 in that case the authors were unable to completely simulate the measured breakthrough curves but did conclude that the model which included both horizontal and vertical fractures was best able to explain the data as shown in fig 6 fits to the measured data at all five observation wells were also obtained by adding heterogeneity to the aperture of the single fracture model fig 3b this is evidence of non uniqueness in the interpretation of this experiment while fractures are often represented as smooth parallel plates reality is better represented by bottlenecks of low aperture combined with adjacent higher aperture pathways which create preferential and tortuous pathways for transport within the fracture plane de dreuzy et al 2012 odén et al 2008 tsang and neretnieks 1998 zheng et al 2008 adding heterogeneity to the aperture created increasingly tortuous flow paths with increasing scale that resulted in effectively identical curves to those produced by transport through multiple horizontal and vertical fractures significant variability in the aperture was measured at the site indicating that heterogeneity in the aperture may have had an impact on transport a third set of model fits using spatially consistent values was achieved through the addition of highly fractured zones represented by an increased matrix porosity fig 3c with this set of simulations the small fractures within the fractured zones allowed for an enhancement of matrix diffusion along flow paths which resulted in enough mass loss to achieve fits note that heterogeneity of the primary matrix porosity alone was unable to explain the difference between observed and simulated breakthrough curves because average porosities far larger than the measured average of 5 7 5 were required to simulate the observed breakthrough past studies have recognized the potential importance of matrix diffusion processes at large scales feenstra et al 1984 freeze and cherry 1979 grisak and pickens 1980 several papers have also discussed various explanations for enhanced diffusion gwo et al 2005 lu et al 2011 maloszewski and zuber 1993 nordqvist et al 2012 shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 as previously discussed zhou et al 2007 and shapiro 2001 suggested that enhanced diffusion caused by numerous small non transmissive fractures connected to larger more transmissive features could be important these papers however represented this enhanced diffusion through the use of a scaling parameter as opposed to creating distinct regions of dense fracturing within the model it is further possible that other explanations not considered in this paper may exist for enhancing matrix exchange for example transport mechanisms such as advective mass transfer or enhanced diffusion caused by accelerated fluid movement within the fracture wu et al 2010 could play a role in explaining transport within the upper eramosa and were not directly tested in this study simulations with a combination of two conceptual models fig 3d were also fit to the observed data the quality of the fit at bh64 was not as close to the measured breakthrough as the other configurations but still matched the peak and tail well fig 6 the addition of aperture heterogeneity may have helped with the quality of the fit but this was not possible in this study due to the computational effort required to discretize such a complex domain although only one combination of conceptual models was tested in this paper it is entirely plausible that other configurations of heterogeneity could also explain the tracer breakthrough concentrations note that the preceding fits were only possible by adding dye loss which was represented in this study using first order decay the effect of the decay constant on the fit achieved at bh64 is illustrated in fig 7 without the use of a decay constant the falling limb of the concentration curve was always overestimated by the model no matter what the combination of parameters note that adding decay alone to the single fracture model was unable to achieve a fit and that heterogeneity in the model was still required to explain transport within this system the range of values used for the decay constant was between 4 5 10 7 and 8 10 7 s 1 for all simulations in this study these values were determined from fitting the four conceptual models to the measured breakthrough curves while there has been little study into quantifying decay constants for lissamine the use of such was considered here as there is some evidence for the loss of small amounts of lissamine especially over experiments lasting weeks holden and burt 2002 smart and laidlaw 1977 one explanation for fluorescent dye loss is a small degree of non reversible adsorption smart and laidlaw 1977 which would appear like a decay process while lissamine as previously mentioned is resistant to adsorption and the organic content of the dolostone was low even adsorption of 5 10 of the dye mass could noticeably affect the breakthrough curve over large distances alternatively dye loss due to horizontal or vertical spreading of solute along the fracture network to regions outside the measurement domain is plausible finally the loss could be due to photochemical decay during the sampling and measurement of dye or due to biodegradation both during the test and after sampling bottrell et al 2010 field et al 1995 smart and laidlaw 1977 3 4 non uniqueness with parameters to compound the issue of non uniqueness in modelling transport in this study it was also possible to achieve multiple fits of equal quality within each conceptual model through the variation of matrix porosity dispersivity and fracture aperture fig 8 while even small changes to individual parameters resulted in significant effects on the breakthrough curves e g a 200 μm change to aperture results in the peak concentration increasing by more than a third at bh64 at the scales relevant to this study multiple combinations of these parameters could be used to achieve very similar results thus constraining the values of the measured parameters using the model was not possible at this site variation of other parameters related to the fracture network within each conceptual model such as the fracture spacing indicated further uncertainty in the precise configuration of fractures present for example in the vertical fracture model fig 3a variations of spacing between the horizontal fractures of less than 50 cm could be accounted by very small 50 μm alterations to the primary fracture aperture this only served to further add to the non uniqueness of the solution 3 5 scaling up predictions to illustrate the impact engendered by non uniqueness predictions of breakthrough curves at distances of 200 and 300 m from the injection source fig 9 were generated using the models which accurately simulated the measured breakthrough at all observation wells at 300 m from the injection source there is more than a factor of four difference in concentration between the lowest estimate and the highest estimate of the four models that tested conceptual models of heterogeneity there is also a difference in the arrival times for these curves and these differences grow with distance fig 9a versus 9b given even greater travel distance the arrival times are likely to be even more substantially different this suggests that although there are some similarities in the predictions from the different conceptual models of heterogeneity especially at late times the choice of model used could result in significantly different estimates of breakthrough times and peak concentrations at unmeasured larger scale locations note that fig 9 likely does not depict the full range of equally probable models but merely some representative examples from this study thus the possible range of estimates could be even larger than what is presented at both 200 m and 300 m from the injection source the predictions made using an effective parameter fig 9b were also divergent from those made by the four conceptual models while there is some overlap between the predictions from conceptual models and those using effective parameters it was observed that the latter estimates tend to be less conservative with lower peak concentrations by a factor of four and later arrival times by as much as 50 in particular predictions from each effective parameter were much lower than those from a model which more closely represented the same heterogeneity in the numerical model for example while the effective porosity and the model with highly fractured zones represent the same enhancement of matrix diffusion at larger scales the effective model predicts breakthrough 150 h later at 300 m distance because of this caution should be used when applying effective parameters to represent increasing heterogeneity with scale or to make predictions of transport in fractured rock at scales larger than measured 4 conclusions and recommendations in this study a control volume finite element model was used to simulate breakthrough curves obtained from a previously conducted divergent tracer experiment performed at a scale of approximately 40 125 m in potential discrete fractures in dolostone at a site in southern ontario the purpose of this analysis was to better understand how appropriate the use of effective scaling parameters can be in simulating transport in fractured settings the issues of non uniqueness in obtaining transport solutions from divergent tracer experiments with multiple observation wells and how this non uniqueness influences predictions at scales greater than measured were also explored the methodology involved the development of an initial single fracture model using properties estimated from field tests and then testing a range of conceptual models and effective parameter models to achieve a fit between the model and all of the measured breakthrough curves i e each model fit all data predictions of breakthrough at 200 m and 300 m were then made using these models and the resulting curves compared the following conclusions are drawn from this study a sensitivity analysis indicated that matrix porosity the number of fractures and the aperture of fractures were the most influential parameters in this study multiple configurations of fracture and matrix heterogeneity were found to achieve acceptable fits between the measured breakthrough curves and the simulations in particular the addition of vertical fractures aperture heterogeneity highly fractured zones and a combination of the vertical fractures and fractured zones each provided viable simulations to the measured concentrations the parameters used in each simulation agreed with the measured range of values and were spatially consistent over the domain non uniqueness of the transport solution is clearly present when simulating transport at large scales fits between simulated and measured breakthrough curves could also be achieved using effective parameters in a manner consistent with previous studies predictions at 200 m and 300 m from the injection well indicated that the different configurations of aperture and matrix porosity heterogeneity produce dissimilar outputs suggesting that the choice in the model of heterogeneity at this site is important the predictions at 200 300 m distance also suggest that effective parameters are a less conservative choice in the attempt to make accurate predictions when modelling transport at larger scale as they tended to significantly under predict concentrations relative to models which represent fracture and matrix heterogeneity in the numerical model the present study was confined to transport primarily through a large isolated fracture as there were indications however of the possible influence of multiple fractures both vertical and horizontal even in a what was thought to be a single fracture experiment a larger experimental scale encompassing a broader fracture network may resolve some of the uncertainties presented in this paper experiments using additional tracers with different diffusion properties or a different flow configuration could also be useful in resolving issues of non uniqueness in the interpretation of tracer experiments overall despite the difficulty in doing so more large scale experiments in fractured rock are clearly required to further understand transport processes in these settings finally the predictions we have shown at larger scale have significant implications with estimating the uncertainty with the timing and concentration of plume arrival at receptors that are present further downstream at a contaminated site the uncertainty with where a contaminant mass may reside i e matrix versus fractures will also likely grow with travel distance and time both of these issues require further exploration through numerical analysis credit author statement matt howroyd conceptualization software investigation methodology writing original draft kent

groundwater which serves as an important drinking water source in many regions this study aims to identify the source and key hydrogeochemical processes for iodine accumulation and mobility in the groundwaters of the northern jiangsu yishusi plain combined hydrogeochemical and statistical analyses specifically random forest modeling and factor analysis were used to explore the mechanisms affecting the spatial distribution of iodine the concentration of iodine in the investigated groundwaters was found to vary widely and to range between 4 8 and 4750 μg l with 48 9 of the total samples 674 exceeding the threshold value of 100 μg l for toxic exposure as defined by the chinese high iodine standard guideline high iodine concentrations are shown to mainly occur in the marine plain and the shallow aquifer associated with the floodplains of the old yellow river the marine or lagoons facies sediments were identified as the most plausible iodine source in addition mixing of groundwater with paleo seawater might also have played a role in the coastal area in contrast the flood sediments of the old yellow river are shown to be an unlikely source however they serve as a cover layer that favored the development of reducing hydrogeochemical conditions that can trigger iodine mobilization via the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and the degradation of organic matter slow

80 and 150 μg l who 2003 according to the latest high iodine standard issued by the national health commission of the people s republic of china gb t 19380 2016 water with iodine concentration exceeding 100 μg l is classified as high iodine water in the last 20 years high iodine groundwater has been reported in many regions around the world such as denmark japan and china a close association between ied and high iodine groundwaters has been demonstrated andersen et al 2009 sayess et al 2021 teng et al 2006 voutchkova et al 2017 yin et al 2014 zhao et al 1998 regions with high iodine levels in china are mostly concentrated along old yellow river channels in the coastal area of the bohai sea arid inland basins the yangtze river delta the yellow river delta and the pearl river delta teng et al 2006 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 1998 among those affected by iodine exposure over 90 are located in the north china plain ncp and the north jiangsu plain njp shen et al 2007 zhao et al 1998 these are large areas and therefore the potential human health hazard is significant while the mechanisms controlling the formation of high iodine groundwaters in coastal areas have not been thoroughly studied in comparison with other areas affected by iodine enriched groundwater coastal aquifers provide unique geological and hydrogeological conditions for example in coastal aquifers groundwater quality is affected by mixing of groundwaters with paleo seawater furthermore multiple marine transgression regression may have caused the presence of iodine enriched marine sediments in coastal aquifers in the absence of previous studies investigating the interplay of processes controlling iodine release and fate in coastal aquifers it is important to study the relevant hydrochemical conditions and geochemical process at the watershed scale in the njp agricultural activities rely heavily on groundwater especially in the rural areas where it serves as the primary drinking water source and as a source for irrigation there shallow groundwater is generally used for irrigation water while deep groundwater has become the main source of drinking water zhang et al 2010 however over the decades the excessive exploitation of deep groundwater resources has caused serious land subsidence in this area zhu et al 2015 therefore a large number of these deep wells have in the meantime been sealed to suppress ground subsidence while purified surface water has become an increasingly important alternative water source however the higher cost of the purified water has caused many villagers in the study region to install shallow wells 3 15 m bgl for their domestic water needs which typically includes washing irrigation water to grow vegetables and rice as well as drinking water this means that the risk level of excess iodine exposure has increased and the current very fragmented understanding of the source and controlling factor of iodine needs urgent improvement the presence of iodine in aquifer systems has often been ascribed to the decomposition of iodine bearing organic matter in marine facies sediments here one hypothesized reaction pathway is that the decomposition of iodine bearing organic matter occurs in conjunction with the reductive dissolution of iron oxides francois 1987 lu et al 2015 in some instances the correlation between iodine selected redox sensitive groundwater constituents i e fe mn hco3 and dissolved organic carbon doc has been employed to identify this process li et al 2014 qian et al 2017 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2010b however a large number of epidemiological investigations for the jiangsu yellow river flood plains show that iodine concentrations are strongly associated with the depositional patterns of the yellow river flood plain e g andersen et al 2009 zhao et al 1998 although the studies of andersen et al 2009 and zhao et al 1998 demonstrated the importance of the prevailing redox conditions the sources of iodine in groundwater were with two exceptions lu et al 2014 not yet further investigated attributed the observed elevated iodine concentrations to the decomposition of organic matter while they thought that the presence of paleo seawater and marine transgression processes could have also played an important role lu et al 2014 on the other hand emphasized the contribution of iodine released from soil organic matter in the vadose zone factor analysis fa a variable based method is a widely used tool in geosciences including hydrogeochemistry to identify key factors and processes controlling the origin and fate of pollutants in groundwater e g adhikari and mal 2019 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017 olmez et al 1994 wei et al 2018 the main objective of this method is to describe the correlation between multiple water chemistry indicators to identify the interdependence of the original water chemistry variable correlation matrix using several synthesis factors each synthesis factor is a linear combination of multiple related original variables of water chemistry the interpretation of the synthesis factors is based on a prior understanding of hydrogeochemical processes the results obtained through factor analysis are not sensitive to whether the dataset is subject to a normal distribution while being greatly affected by outlier data dragon 2006 stetzenbach et al 2001 random forest rf is another machine learning technique that has rapidly emerged over the last 10 years as a highly valuable tool in the field of hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry in this period it has been increasingly applied to predict the large scale distribution of geogenic groundwater contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride podgorski and berg 2020 podgorski et al 2018 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 tesoriero et al 2017 previous studies on groundwater with high iodine have usually focused on a small scale and there is globally still a lack of analysis of geogenic high iodine groundwaters in large scale watersheds in this new study we use both fa and rf as complementary techniques to i investigate the occurrence and spatial distribution patterns of iodine in the coastal aquifers of the north jiangsu plain njp and ii explore potential iodine sources as well as geochemical processes and other factors that control its current and future distribution within our study area our study provides a template on how to identify the factors controlling high iodine in groundwaters and in obtaining a mechanistic understanding of its distribution in the coastal area deriving such an understanding is crucial for making optimal water management decisions in affected areas 2 material and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 general setting the north jiangsu yishusi plain njyp a sub basin of the njp is located in eastern china between 33 30 35 20 n and 118 15 120 24 extending over an area of 17 676 km3 it is bounded by the yellow sea to the east the sulu mountain uplift to the northwest and by abandoned yellow river arms to the south fig 1 the annual average rainfall is about 700 950 mm which mainly occurs over the summer period and decreases from the ocean towards the inland the main surface water systems are the shanhou river xinyi river and guan river while the old yellow river drains the plain near its south eastern boundary 2 1 2 geological and hydrogeological setting in the njyp sediments were deposited during the neogene and quaternary respectively while archean to proterozoic gneiss serves as the bedrock due to the regional uplift of the basement the bedrock outcrops in the northwest sulu mountain and the neogene sediment outcrops in the western area near the suqian city the thickness of sediments increases from the piedmont towards the coast while the lithology changes towards finer deposits in the flood plain surface sediments were deposited during old yellow river flood events since the holocene zhang et al 2016 these surface sediments mainly developed from the alluvial loam and silt in the fluvial lacustrine deposit in the eastern coastal areas coastal saline soils developed from marine clay and silts tang et al 1978 those soils are widely distributed and are rich in halogen elements such as fluorine bromine and iodine the surface soils 0 50 cm within the study area are largely impacted by a wide variety of human activities according to the sedimentary environment terrain and the characteristics of groundwater flow that occurs from the western piedmont plain towards the eastern coast of the yellow sea the study area can be divided into five hydrogeological units fig 1 i piedmont alluvial plain ii piedmont alluvial marine plain iii midstream alluvial marine plain iv marine plain and v old yellow river flood plain the old yellow river floodplain zones can be further divided into two sub areas i e an upstream floodplain area and a downstream floodplain area depending on the distance from the coastline the study area contains five main aquifers fig 2c the pliocene aquifer n the early q1 middle q2 and late q3 pleistocene aquifers and the holocene aquifer q4 based on their hydraulic connections and estimated groundwater residence times they can be separated into either shallow q4 and q3 or deep aquifers n q1 and q2 the shallow aquifer is mainly composed of gray and gray yellow silts and fine sand from marine or interactive marine and terrestrial depositions yue 2017 in the western area e g near suqian city the thickness of the holocene aquifer is limited to only 5 m while successively increasing to 30 m in the coastal zone except for the piedmont areas the groundwater levels within the shallow aquifer range between 1 and 5 m the shallow groundwater sections are mostly recharged from atmospheric precipitation and lateral runoff from the upstream piedmont areas fu 2015 furthermore groundwater dynamics are also affected by evapotranspiration by mixing with seawater at the groundwater marine interface zone and human exploitation li et al 2017 as a result of the influence of two transgressions during the late pleistocene the tds of the groundwater increases from low to high from the west towards the east the eastern coastal areas are brackish or saline water with a tds 1 g l among the deep aquifers the middle pleistocene aquifer q2 mainly received depositions of estuarine and lacustrine sediments in the form of grayish yellow and grayish white sands the underlying pleistocene q1 aquifer developed from the terrestrial facies rivers and lakes deposits mainly gray gray yellow gravel and medium to coarse sand as a result of the long term pumping groundwater levels in q1 have locally decreased by 10 30 m zhu et al 2015 the neogene aquifer n formation contains gravel and coarse sands with riverbed facies and flood plain facies ge et al 2017 due to the regional uplift of the basement the entire deep aquifer system including n q1 and q2 is absent in the north area of the jinping mountain under pre development conditions the deep aquifers were recharged by lateral runoff while discharging to the ocean however over the last 30 years groundwater extraction has increased substantially and thus become the main sink in the deep aquifer s water budget windows in the aquitards that usually separate q2 and q3 allow for an increased vertical leakage under the excess groundwater extractions in the deep aquifer 2 2 methods 2 2 1 sample collection and analysis in total our analysis is based on 674 hydrogeochemical compositions of those 132 groundwater and 3 seawater samples were collected during our field campaigns in march 2017 and october 2018 in addition 539 samples were collected earlier 537 groundwater and 2 seawater samples by the jiangsu provincial institute of geological survey jsgs and included in our data set these additional data were collected during multiple sampling campaigns in 2008 2009 lu et al 2014 and 2014 2017 fu 2015 yue and su 2016 all samples from our recent field campaign were filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane in the field into polythene bottles that were thoroughly prewashed with deionized water the samples

multiparameter instrument ysi prodss alkalinity hco3 and co3 2 was determined using the gran titration method within 24 h of sampling anions were analyzed by ion chromatography ic dx 120 dionex

using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7900 with average errors 5 all the above analyses were performed in the laboratory of basin hydrology and wetland eco restoration at the china university of geosciences wuhan the shallow groundwater samples provided by jsgs were mainly obtained from dug wells while samples from the confined aquifer were collected from screened dedicated monitoring boreholes and local drinking water wells the dataset includes the complete set of analytes required by the water quality survey guidelines i e ca2 na mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 no2 nh4 mn fe f br iodine and ph also as ba and sr were analyzed for a few locations in the marine plain all hydrogeochemical analyses of these samples were performed at the nanjing mineral resources supervision and testing center of the ministry of land and resources of the jiangsu province only samples with a charge balance error 5 were used 2 2 2 factor analysis in total 20 variables contained

kmo testing criteria james et al 2015 and the factors were extracted using a principal component analysis pca method the varimax method was employed as the method of factor rotation james et al 2015 penfold et al 1966 all data analysis was performed with spss version 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa 2 2 3 methodology of random forest model to complement the fa we also used rf to explore the key factors that are responsible for or related to the iodine enrichment in the groundwaters of our study area rf relies on classification and regression trees cart as initially proposed by breiman 2001 it generates a large number of trees by bootstrapping samples from the original dataset each tree is then trained using a randomized subset of the predictors rf does not overfit the model to the dataset since the classification error of one tree can be overcome by the whole forest ghimire et al 2010 a large number of trees reduce generalization errors breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 the out of bag oob error a method of measuring prediction error on each training sample can be used to perform a cross validation accuracy it can also evaluate the relationship between covariates and dependent variables and calculate the relative importance of covariates cutler et al 2007 kubosova et al 2010 moreover an advantage of the rf is that it can explore the nonlinear complex relationship between the predictor variables and the dependent variable in contrast to fa and a distinct advantage of this method rf allows the incorporation of additional categorical variables that can provide information about the deposition environment and mineral characteristics such as hydrogeological unit into the model calculation to determine the most important variable group and then to reveal the relationship between the high low iodine classification and the hydrogeochemical dataset considered as independent predictor variables rf modeling included all variables that were thought to potentially have a significant impact on distinguishing high versus low iodine classification by minimizing the oob error cutler et al 2007 genuer et al 2010 james et al 2015 also the area under the roc curve auc serves as an indicator of the goodness of model fitting ranging from 0 5 to 1 su et al 2018 the greater the auc value the better the performance of the model at fitting the data an auc value of 0 5 corresponds to a random guess any model achieving an auc of 0 5 0 69 is considered to fit poorly any auc in the range 0 7 0 79 to correspond to a moderate fit while any auc in the range 0 8 1 suggests that a model fits well vilar del hoyo et al 2011 all calculations in the present study were performed with the randomforest package in r version 3 6 2 as the occurrence of iodine in coastal groundwater can be strongly affected by the prevailing redox environment as well as the geochemical interactions of the groundwater with marine sediments 16 variables were selected as predictor variables these predictors included a group for major ions ca2 na mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 and a group for redox sensitive groundwater constituents no3 no2 nh4 mn fe ph and br which often reflects the effect from marine sediment or interaction of groundwater and seawater also since the depth and the hu can reflect the sedimentary environment and thus groundwater compositions they were selected as predictor variables to quantify the magnitude of their impact on hydrogeochemical conditions total iodine i served as the dependent variable and was divided into two classes i e low iodine 100 μg l and high iodine 100 μg l for a total of 669 groundwater samples with 262 samples were 100 μg l iodine 39 16 and 407 samples equal to or 100 μg l iodine 60 84 3 results 3 1 iodine in groundwater the measured iodine concentrations in the groundwaters of the study area vary over three orders of magnitude ranging between 4 8 and 4750 μg l among the samples 48 9 exceeded the chinese guideline value of 100 μg l gb t 19380 2016 as fig 3 shows high iodine groundwater 100 μg l is mainly found in shallow aquifer sections usually at a depth of 50 m below this depth iodine concentrations are distinctly lower iodine concentrations are relatively stable below a depth of 120 m fluctuating around an average value of 100 μg l the lateral distribution of iodine within the shallow groundwater system is shown in fig 4a generally iodine concentrations gradually increase along the main groundwater flow direction from the upstream piedmont areas in the northwest towards the downstream coastal plain areas high iodine groundwater can be found in both the upstream flood plain as well as in the eastern coastal area most noteworthy all samples showing iodine concentration above 500 μg l were collected in the eastern coastal area including both marine and downstream floodplain in the deep aquifer high iodine concentrations were mainly located in the eastern study area fig 4b in contrast to the shallow aquifer in the early and middle pleistocene deep aquifers there is no clear trend of increasing concentrations along the main groundwater flow direction 3 2 water chemistry associated with high iodine waters in the shallow aquifer fig 5a high iodine concentrations are found to be closely associated with hco3 na and clna type groundwaters which are typically found in the eastern marine plain and the downstream floodplain in contrast samples collected from the upstream floodplain with high iodine concentrations were associated with hco3 ca mg which gradually transforms along the main groundwater flow direction towards hco3 na type groundwater fig 5a seawater samples i e cl na type water show relatively low iodine concentrations ranging from 35 to 75 μg l consistent with previously reported data chance et al 2014 fuge and johnson 2015 küpper et al 2011 levy et al 2018 whitehead 1984 the high iodine groundwater samples in the deep aquifer fig 5b are mainly associated with hco3 na type and cl na type salty groundwater in the downstream coastal area higher iodine 500 μg l were only found in cl na type groundwater fig 6 illustrates that iodide i is likely to be the dominating species within the high iodine groundwaters in this study area samples with 500 μg l iodine are found in relatively low eh conditions while there is no obvious correlation between iodine and ph 3 3 factor analysis results the first five varimax rotated factors were extracted according to the kaiser criterion table 1 they were found to account for 74 80 of the total observed variance the high positive loading of cl so4 2 mg2 na br sr in factor 1 explains the greatest amount of variance with 26 20 the combination of these species that account for most of the variability in the hydrogeochemical composition is indicative of the origin of the groundwater samples fig 7 high loading of mg2 and br demonstrates a connection to marine origins sr with a loading of 0 61 seems to suggest the occurrence of intensive water sediment interaction because sr is usually released from continental sediments and therefore increasing towards the downstream sections of groundwater basins langmuir 1997 factor 2 accounts for 16 87 of the variance the highest loading of nh4 ba as fe are found in this group above 0 85 and iodine is also found with a related high loading of 0 58 this may suggest that high iodine groundwaters are related to reducing environments fig 7 factor 3 is characterized by high positive loadings on hco3 and doc accounting for 9 49 of the variance increased hco3 groundwater concentrations occur in areas of elevated doc concentration probably associated with enhanced doc mineralization rather than the dissolution of carbonates such as calcite and dolomite factor 4 amounts to 9 17 of the variance factor 4 includes ca2 with a relatively high positive loading of 0 78 and sr with a positive loading of 0 53 also important in factor 4 are ph and depth that have a negative loading of approximately 0 5 the above values indicate that carbonate and feldspar minerals dissolve under the somewhat more acidic conditions that prevail in the shallow aquifer table s1 the variables grouped in factor 5 and factor 6 contain a relatively low variance contribution which together amounts to 13 07 the no3 in factor 5 has a positive loading of 0 78 there is a weak negative correlation between no3 and mn fig s1 which presumably reflects the fact that manganese reduction would only occur where no3 is completely depleted 3 4 interpretation of random forest model results to further elucidate key factors influencing iodine concentrations in groundwater we established two random forest models a full random forest model full rf based on the whole dataset and a random forest model for shallow groundwater samples shallow rf the original set of 16 predictor variables was further refined in a subsequent step in particular the variable no2 was removed as i the pearson correlation coefficient between iodine and no2 was close to 0 fig s1 and ii a low mean decrease in accuracy in both random forest models was found when its values were randomly rearranged in the oob samples the remaining 15 predictor variables were included in the optimized random forest model calculation overall 2000 trees were generated in the full rf model for computational convergence fig s2a and the number of variables tried at each split was 6 which were optimized by the function tune rf in the r software package randomforest cutler et al 2007 ließ et al 2012 for the full rf the data set with a total of 669 groundwater samples was randomly split into training 60 and testing 40 data sets for the shallow rf a dataset of 369 shallow samples was used with 60 of the dataset randomly selected as the training set similar to the full rf 5000 trees were generated to meet a stable overall error rate of forest fig s2b and the optimized number of variables tried at each split was 4 as table 2 shows in the test set of the full rf model 15 high iodine samples were incorrectly sorted into the low iodine class with an error of 9 8 while some low iodine samples were incorrectly sorted into the high iodine group equivalent to an error of 35 65 this means that the full rf model had better predictive capacities for the low iodine samples in general both full rf and the shallow rf can be categorized as well fitting according to the roc curve fig s3 and a relatively high auc table 2 table 3 in the test set of the shallow rf model the classification error of high iodine samples incorrectly sorted into the low iodine category also decreased to 17 14 this means the shallow rf model performed better in identifying high iodine samples the accuracy of the low iodine classification does not change significantly the roc curve and auc values tables 2 and 3 also show a consistent upward trend as the auc increases from 0 864 to 0 903 fig s3 considering that shallow groundwater samples show higher iodine concentrations than the deep aquifer samples the above observation suggests that the accuracy of the rf classification is affected by the ratio of high and low iodine found in each dataset because the deep groundwater amounts to 53 of the total groundwaters with a relatively low iodine concentration the full rf did not perform as well at classifying high iodine as the shallow rf model fig s3 fig 8a shows the rankings of the importance of the predictor variables in the rf model for the full dataset the mean decrease in accuracy is associated with randomizing a variable in oob samples and the mean decrease in gini node impurity is roughly consistent in assessing the relative importance for the full rf the top six variables for with the greatest mean decrease in accuracy include mg2 k depth cl na and hco3 for the shallow rf fig 8b the six most important variables for the mean decrease in accuracy were found to be cl hu no3 mg2 na hco3 followed by br and nh4 the variables mg2 na cl br and hco3 and hu are important in both the full rf model and the rf model for shallow aquifers indicating that they have a strong relationship with the iodine source and spatial variability no3 nh4 and hu can be considered as being quite important in affecting the iodine classification in the shallow aquifer since the ranking largely rises the ranking of depth has a higher importance in the full rf model than in the shallow rf model consistent with the fact that the high iodine distribution is found mainly in the shallow aquifer 4 discussion 4 1 iodine sources three types of sources appear to be the main candidates for explaining the observed iodine enrichment within the groundwater systems in our study area i paleo seawater mixing with groundwater ii marine sourced organic matter decomposition and iii atmospheric precipitation to identify the relative importance of these three types of sources as well as their spatial variety i the sedimentary facies associated with high iodine zones ii the cl br ratio of the water samples and iii the results of both the fa and the rf were jointly interpreted 4 1 1 paleo seawater mixing with groundwater the relationship between the cl br mass ratios hereinafter referred to as cl br ratio and iodine concentrations fig 9 can be used as an indicator to support the identification of iodine sources in particular to distinguish marine sediment origins from the influence of paleo seawater mixing fig 9a shows that high iodine groundwater cl br ratios within coastal areas reside near the seawater line note that yellow sea seawater has a cl br ratio of 244 as also shown by our data the presence of increased cl concentrations indicates the possibility that mixing of groundwater with residual paleo seawater has occurred with the latter being a source of iodine in groundwater this hypothesis relies on the fact that cl br ratios are not affected by dilution and evaporation of seawater before the onset of halite precipitation alcalá and custodio 2008 and therefore the cl br ratio in the paleo seawater can be assumed as being similar to the current cl br ratio in seawater note however that the paleo seawater would still need to have been concentrated by at least 16 7 times to increase the concentration of iodine from modern seawater average iodine level of 45 60 μg l towards the observed 1000 μg l implying that cl would simultaneously have been concentrated from the average cl level of modern seawater 14 5 g l to 242 15 g l however this value by far exceeds the observed maximum cl concentration 37 53 g l thus the mixing of paleo seawater and groundwater is very unlikely to be the only source of iodine 4 1 2 marine sourced organic matter decomposition at least in the coastal areas the decrease of the cl br ratio in conjunction with an increase of iodine concentration can more likely be attributed to iodine being sourced from marine sediments the underlying conceptual model is that a simultaneous release of br and iodine has occurred during the decomposition of organic matter hosted by marine facies sediments davis et al 1998 as shown by our factor analysis the variables na mg2 cl br which are commonly enriched in seawater or groundwater from marine facies related sediments and exhibit the high positive loading in factor 1 are indicative of marine origin for groundwater they are all closely associated with hco3 as indicated by the relatively higher ranking of these variables in both the full rf and the shallow rf fig 8 which also suggests that marine sourced organic matter decomposition plays a key role in iodine release into the groundwater system xue et al 2019 furthermore the results of the fa indicate that both the presence of a geochemically reducing environment factor 2 and the decomposition of organic matter factor 3 show a close relationship with the presence of iodine this positive correlation between iodine and ba fig s1 and fig 10 provides additional evidence that marine sourced organic matter is potentially the main source of iodine in groundwater ba can be considered as another important indicator of marine origins because ba2 has like i a relative large ionic radius allowing terrestrial facies ba2 to be easily adsorbed by iron oxides and organic matter or to be precipitated with so4 2 as barite baso4 nozaki et al 2001 schöne et al 2011 thus ba tends to accumulate at the land marine interface and in marine facies sediments while the concentration of dissolved ba is very low in seawater liguori et al 2016 the association of as ba and iodine in factor 2 and high positive correlation among as ba and iodine fig 10 and fig s1 suggests that reductive dissolution of iron oxides and associated with this process iodine desorption might be the underlying mechanism responsible for generating elevated groundwater iodine concentrations this mechanism has already previously been identified in the context of iodine release during early diagenesis fehn et al 2007 francois 1987 hardisty et al 2014 in the quest for identifying the origin of iodine sources it is important to note that the aquifer material at shallow depth that is now associated with high iodine groundwater was previously i e during the late pleistocene to holocene affected by marine transgression during this period the paleo shoreline reached the boundary of our study area near the western piedmont li et al 2017 and the upstream floodplain was a coastal plain containing a large number of lagoons before 1128 ce over the last 700 years most of these lagoons have subsequently been filled by sediments that were imported during old yellow river flooding events while the coastline was also pushed back eastward by 80 90 km xue 1993 understanding these geological features allows us to conclude that the marine or lagoons facies sediments might be the main source of iodine within the shallow upstream flood plain aquifer which to our knowledge has not been previously recognized within the upstream floodplain area high iodine concentrations are shown to be mostly associated with old yellow river flooding sediments but only in areas overlain by caprocks fig 4 accordingly the waters in caprocks do not show any elevated iodine concentrations andersen et al 2009 teng et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 the caprocks may have played an important role in isolating the lagoon facies sediments from the atmosphere and in facilitating iron reducing conditions that favored iodine release from lagoon filling sediments 4 1 3 atmospheric precipitation atmospheric dry and wet deposition may also contribute to the enrichment of iodine in soils in coastal areas this is thought to occur at distances of up to 50 80 km inland carpenter 2014 whitehead 1984 yeager et al 2017 in our case this could imply a potential influence over the entire marine plain and downstream flood plain indeed lu et al 2014 already noted a high correlation in the distribution of iodine between coastal soils and shallow high iodine groundwater however lu et al 2014 suggested that iodine in soils originates from marine sediments rather than from atmospheric input given that soil iodine concentrations increase with increasing depth within the depth range of 0 2 m below ground surface cl br ratios in the groundwaters of the upstream flood plain vary over a wide range fig 9 which may reflect the influence of various recharge sources thus the role of atmospheric deposition should be negligible for high iodine concentration in groundwater from the study area 4 2 main factors controlling elevated iodine concentrations in groundwater besides the origin of iodine it is important to understand which factors control its fate in groundwater systems previously redox conditions and ph have been suggested to most notably affect iodine speciation and mobility hou et al 2009 hu et al 2012 kaplan et al 2014 however in contrast to these studies our data showed no significant correlation between iodine concentrations and ph neither by our factor analysis nor our random forest modeling elsewhere weakly alkaline environments are often reported to be associated with elevated iodine concentrations explained by the corresponding lower sorption affinity on iron oxides under these conditions hong et al 2012 nagata et al 2009 nagata and fukushi 2010 another potential mechanism of iodine release like the biodegradation of organic iodination is often accompanied by a ph decrease induced by the metabolic activity of microorganisms santschi et al 2017 yeager et al 2017 this suggests that the relation between iodine concentrations and ph depends on the geochemical process that controls the release of iodine on a regional scale like our study area due to the chemical heterogeneities and different release mechanisms of iodine at different sites throughout the entire study area it is challenging to use statistical methods to measure the correlation between ph and iodine concentration fig 7 shows that i is the dominant species in high iodine groundwaters within the study area which is consistent with other studies that reported high iodine concentrations in groundwater systems e g hou et al 2009 wang et al 2018 samples with 500 μg l iodine are found under more reducing low eh conditions this is consistent with the fact that iodine release in water sediment systems is connected with presumably microbially mediated redox processes such as the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and the associated loss of sorption sites for iodine iodate reduction and reductive deiodination of organic compounds fuge and johnson 2015 küpper et al 2011 yeager et al 2017 fig 7 shows that iodine loading of 0 58 is associated with the variables as fe ba nh4 in factor 2 which supports this hypothesis fig 10 among those the occurrence of elevated concentrations of fe as and nh4 is a typical indicator for relatively reducing groundwater conditions of particular relevance is that increased as concentrations often result from the reductive dissolution of as bearing iron oxides fendorf et al 2010 harvey et al 2002 nickson et al 2000 rawson et al 2016 in conjunction with a positive correlation between as and iodine such a positive correlation between as and iodine has been previously discussed in the context of another high iodine and arsenic groundwater system i e the datong basin where this correlation was also attributed to the simultaneous release of as and iodine during the reductive dissolution of iron hydro oxides pi et al 2015 similarly the release process of ba was also previously hypothesized to be associated with iodine in more reducing environments liguori et al 2016 nozaki et al 2001 rothwell 1989 the relatively high ranking of redox sensitive variables such as fe nh4 product of organic matter decomposition and no3 in the shallow rf indicate that the prevailing redox conditions have a significant impact on the spatial variability of iodine concentrations in shallow groundwaters no3 originates mainly from surface soil leaching and terrestrial run off and can be used as a proxy for agricultural activity and the presence of a relatively oxidized environment mok et al 2018 tesoriero et al 2017 the ranking of no3 in the shallow rf model shows a high importance in classifying high vs low iodine concentrations while fig s1 show a weak correlation between iodine and no3 with the pearson correlation coefficient remaining between 0 2 and 0 the high ranking of importance for iodine classification can be attributed to the fact that the presence absence of no3 is an important indicator for the redox conditions that prevail in the shallow groundwaters note however that no3 does not directly participate in the geochemical reactions responsible for iodine release as microorganisms play an important role in iodine mobility the initial source of iodine in the sediments is the iodination of organic matter such as iodinated amino acids and iodinated humic substances han et al 2012 kaplan et al 2014 küpper et al 2011 many studies have previously emphasized the potential role of biodegradation of organic matter bowley et al 2016 cook et al 2000 qian et al 2017 schwehr et al 2009 yeager et al 2017 factor 3 shows that hco3 originates from the degradation of doc rather than the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the relatively middle level loading of iodine 0 34 in this factor suggests that degradation of organic matter seems to be related to iodine release li et al 2013 suggested that iodine increases with hco3 when iodine concentrations remain 500 μg l once iodine concentrations are 500 μg l hco3 decreases as iodine increases this can be attributed to the competitive adsorption between hco3 and iodine duan et al 2020 thus a closer relationship of iodine with doc rather than with hco3 see fig 10 and fig s1 suggests that degradation of organic matter may promote the release of iodine in an indirect pathway fortunately the random forest model is not sensitive to the non linear correlation and the high ranking of hco3 in both the full rf and the shallow rf shows that hco3 plays an important role in high vs low iodine classification therefore we conjecture that the degradation of organic matter releases iodine to porewater and subsequently adsorbs at least partially to iron oxides under reducing conditions the reductive dissolution of iron oxides in conjunction with the degradation of iodine bearing organic matter then promotes iodine release to groundwater the physical processes may also affect and or control the enrichment of iodine as shown in fig 4a iodine concentration increases along the direction of groundwater from the northwestern mountain recharge area to the coastal discharge area most of the highest iodine concentrations are found in the coastal groundwater discharge area the coupled iodine physical geochmeical transport processes should be further investigated with reactive transport in the future study 5 summary and conclusion combining the distribution characteristics of iodine hydrogeochemical analysis and statistical analyses methods such as random forest modeling and factor analysis this study identifies the source and key hydrogeochemical processes for iodine accumulation in groundwater and explores the mechanism affecting the iodine distribution in njyp the use of statistical modeling allowed to integrate and analyze a large amount of historical groundwater quality monitoring data and to determine critical hydrogeochemical variables and their relationship with the processes that we hypothesize to be associated with iodine release and fate the concentration of iodine in the groundwaters range from 4 8 to 4750 μg l and 48 9 of total samples 674 exceeded the threshold value of 100 μg l the high iodine standard guideline of china most of the high iodine concentrations are located in the flood plain of the old yellow river and marine plain shallow aquifer along the flow path the highest concentration of iodine 500 μg l is mainly found in the marine plain and the downstream flood plain associated with the hco3 na and clna type waters iodine below 500 μg l is commonly found in the upstream flood plain in deep groundwater high iodine concentrations are also dominated by hco3 na type and clna type salt groundwater in the downstream coastal q2 aquifer at 50 80 depth in the coastal plain the hydrogeochemical data suggest that the mixing of groundwater with paleo seawater and the marine facies sediment can be considered as the two sources of iodine both in the shallow and deep aquifer the marine or lagoons facies sediment is thought to be mainly responsible for iodine in the upstream flood plain the flood sediments of the old yellow river impact iodine behavior as they serve as cover layer to produce a reducing hydrogeochemical environment for iodine mobilization rather than acting as a direct source of iodine itself the results of our factor analysis revealed that reducing environments appear to enhance the geochemical processes that cause a release of iodine into groundwater the controlling hydrogeochemical processes for iodine release are proposed to be i the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and ii the degradation of organic matter combining the information of the spatial distribution of iodine concentrations and importance ranking for both the full rf and shallow rf models reveals that the distribution of marine facies related sediments is the primary controlling factor for the spatial variability of iodine concentration in the shallow groundwater system also the low flow rate of groundwater favors iodine release from sediments to groundwater by increasing residence times and therefore interactions between groundwater and marine facies sediments underpinning a shift towards more reducing environments both in the upstream flood plain and the downstream coastal discharge area finally insensitivity of the random forest model to non linear relationships makes the random forest model based on limited water quality monitoring data outstanding in predicting the spatial distribution of iodine thus greatly improving the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment of iodine

1368,iodine is an essential micronutrient in the human diet and an appropriate human iodine intake level is important for population health excessive iodine intake is often associated with high iodine groundwater which serves as an important drinking water source in many regions this study aims to identify the source and key hydrogeochemical processes for iodine accumulation and mobility in the groundwaters of the northern jiangsu yishusi plain combined hydrogeochemical and statistical analyses specifically random forest modeling and factor analysis were used to explore the mechanisms affecting the spatial distribution of iodine the concentration of iodine in the investigated groundwaters was found to vary widely and to range between 4 8 and 4750 μg l with 48 9 of the total samples 674 exceeding the threshold value of 100 μg l for toxic exposure as defined by the chinese high iodine standard guideline high iodine concentrations are shown to mainly occur in the marine plain and the shallow aquifer associated with the floodplains of the old yellow river the marine or lagoons facies sediments were identified as the most plausible iodine source in addition mixing of groundwater with paleo seawater might also have played a role in the coastal area in contrast the flood sediments of the old yellow river are shown to be an unlikely source however they serve as a cover layer that favored the development of reducing hydrogeochemical conditions that can trigger iodine mobilization via the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and the degradation of organic matter slow groundwater flow rates also appear to favor iodine release from sediments graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords iodine groundwater hydrogeochemistry random forest model machine learning 1 introduction iodine is an essential micronutrient in the human diet and an appropriate human iodine intake level is important for population health as both under and oversupply are associated with the occurrence of illnesses such as thyroid disorders laurberg et al 2010 for the last 100 years iodine deficiencies have become largely suppressed by amending iodine to table salt clark 2015 fuge and johnson 2015 meanwhile the risk of iodine excess disorders ied has received significant attention dietary iodine requirements as defined by the world health organization who range for adults between 80 and 150 μg l who 2003 according to the latest high iodine standard issued by the national health commission of the people s republic of china gb t 19380 2016 water with iodine concentration exceeding 100 μg l is classified as high iodine water in the last 20 years high iodine groundwater has been reported in many regions around the world such as denmark japan and china a close association between ied and high iodine groundwaters has been demonstrated andersen et al 2009 sayess et al 2021 teng et al 2006 voutchkova et al 2017 yin et al 2014 zhao et al 1998 regions with high iodine levels in china are mostly concentrated along old yellow river channels in the coastal area of the bohai sea arid inland basins the yangtze river delta the yellow river delta and the pearl river delta teng et al 2006 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 1998 among those affected by iodine exposure over 90 are located in the north china plain ncp and the north jiangsu plain njp shen et al 2007 zhao et al 1998 these are large areas and therefore the potential human health hazard is significant while the mechanisms controlling the formation of high iodine groundwaters in coastal areas have not been thoroughly studied in comparison with other areas affected by iodine enriched groundwater coastal aquifers provide unique geological and hydrogeological conditions for example in coastal aquifers groundwater quality is affected by mixing of groundwaters with paleo seawater furthermore multiple marine transgression regression may have caused the presence of iodine enriched marine sediments in coastal aquifers in the absence of previous studies investigating the interplay of processes controlling iodine release and fate in coastal aquifers it is important to study the relevant hydrochemical conditions and geochemical process at the watershed scale in the njp agricultural activities rely heavily on groundwater especially in the rural areas where it serves as the primary drinking water source and as a source for irrigation there shallow groundwater is generally used for irrigation water while deep groundwater has become the main source of drinking water zhang et al 2010 however over the decades the excessive exploitation of deep groundwater resources has caused serious land subsidence in this area zhu et al 2015 therefore a large number of these deep wells have in the meantime been sealed to suppress ground subsidence while purified surface water has become an increasingly important alternative water source however the higher cost of the purified water has caused many villagers in the study region to install shallow wells 3 15 m bgl for their domestic water needs which typically includes washing irrigation water to grow vegetables and rice as well as drinking water this means that the risk level of excess iodine exposure has increased and the current very fragmented understanding of the source and controlling factor of iodine needs urgent improvement the presence of iodine in aquifer systems has often been ascribed to the decomposition of iodine bearing organic matter in marine facies sediments here one hypothesized reaction pathway is that the decomposition of iodine bearing organic matter occurs in conjunction with the reductive dissolution of iron oxides francois 1987 lu et al 2015 in some instances the correlation between iodine selected redox sensitive groundwater constituents i e fe mn hco3 and dissolved organic carbon doc has been employed to identify this process li et al 2014 qian et al 2017 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2010b however a large number of epidemiological investigations for the jiangsu yellow river flood plains show that iodine concentrations are strongly associated with the depositional patterns of the yellow river flood plain e g andersen et al 2009 zhao et al 1998 although the studies of andersen et al 2009 and zhao et al 1998 demonstrated the importance of the prevailing redox conditions the sources of iodine in groundwater were with two exceptions lu et al 2014 not yet further investigated attributed the observed elevated iodine concentrations to the decomposition of organic matter while they thought that the presence of paleo seawater and marine transgression processes could have also played an important role lu et al 2014 on the other hand emphasized the contribution of iodine released from soil organic matter in the vadose zone factor analysis fa a variable based method is a widely used tool in geosciences including hydrogeochemistry to identify key factors and processes controlling the origin and fate of pollutants in groundwater e g adhikari and mal 2019 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017 olmez et al 1994 wei et al 2018 the main objective of this method is to describe the correlation between multiple water chemistry indicators to identify the interdependence of the original water chemistry variable correlation matrix using several synthesis factors each synthesis factor is a linear combination of multiple related original variables of water chemistry the interpretation of the synthesis factors is based on a prior understanding of hydrogeochemical processes the results obtained through factor analysis are not sensitive to whether the dataset is subject to a normal distribution while being greatly affected by outlier data dragon 2006 stetzenbach et al 2001 random forest rf is another machine learning technique that has rapidly emerged over the last 10 years as a highly valuable tool in the field of hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry in this period it has been increasingly applied to predict the large scale distribution of geogenic groundwater contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride podgorski and berg 2020 podgorski et al 2018 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 tesoriero et al 2017 previous studies on groundwater with high iodine have usually focused on a small scale and there is globally still a lack of analysis of geogenic high iodine groundwaters in large scale watersheds in this new study we use both fa and rf as complementary techniques to i investigate the occurrence and spatial distribution patterns of iodine in the coastal aquifers of the north jiangsu plain njp and ii explore potential iodine sources as well as geochemical processes and other factors that control its current and future distribution within our study area our study provides a template on how to identify the factors controlling high iodine in groundwaters and in obtaining a mechanistic understanding of its distribution in the coastal area deriving such an understanding is crucial for making optimal water management decisions in affected areas 2 material and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 general setting the north jiangsu yishusi plain njyp a sub basin of the njp is located in eastern china between 33 30 35 20 n and 118 15 120 24 extending over an area of 17 676 km3 it is bounded by the yellow sea to the east the sulu mountain uplift to the northwest and by abandoned yellow river arms to the south fig 1 the annual average rainfall is about 700 950 mm which mainly occurs over the summer period and decreases from the ocean towards the inland the main surface water systems are the shanhou river xinyi river and guan river while the old yellow river drains the plain near its south eastern boundary 2 1 2 geological and hydrogeological setting in the njyp sediments were deposited during the neogene and quaternary respectively while archean to proterozoic gneiss serves as the bedrock due to the regional uplift of the basement the bedrock outcrops in the northwest sulu mountain and the neogene sediment outcrops in the western area near the suqian city the thickness of sediments increases from the piedmont towards the coast while the lithology changes towards finer deposits in the flood plain surface sediments were deposited during old yellow river flood events since the holocene zhang et al 2016 these surface sediments mainly developed from the alluvial loam and silt in the fluvial lacustrine deposit in the eastern coastal areas coastal saline soils developed from marine clay and silts tang et al 1978 those soils are widely distributed and are rich in halogen elements such as fluorine bromine and iodine the surface soils 0 50 cm within the study area are largely impacted by a wide variety of human activities according to the sedimentary environment terrain and the characteristics of groundwater flow that occurs from the western piedmont plain towards the eastern coast of the yellow sea the study area can be divided into five hydrogeological units fig 1 i piedmont alluvial plain ii piedmont alluvial marine plain iii midstream alluvial marine plain iv marine plain and v old yellow river flood plain the old yellow river floodplain zones can be further divided into two sub areas i e an upstream floodplain area and a downstream floodplain area depending on the distance from the coastline the study area contains five main aquifers fig 2c the pliocene aquifer n the early q1 middle q2 and late q3 pleistocene aquifers and the holocene aquifer q4 based on their hydraulic connections and estimated groundwater residence times they can be separated into either shallow q4 and q3 or deep aquifers n q1 and q2 the shallow aquifer is mainly composed of gray and gray yellow silts and fine sand from marine or interactive marine and terrestrial depositions yue 2017 in the western area e g near suqian city the thickness of the holocene aquifer is limited to only 5 m while successively increasing to 30 m in the coastal zone except for the piedmont areas the groundwater levels within the shallow aquifer range between 1 and 5 m the shallow groundwater sections are mostly recharged from atmospheric precipitation and lateral runoff from the upstream piedmont areas fu 2015 furthermore groundwater dynamics are also affected by evapotranspiration by mixing with seawater at the groundwater marine interface zone and human exploitation li et al 2017 as a result of the influence of two transgressions during the late pleistocene the tds of the groundwater increases from low to high from the west towards the east the eastern coastal areas are brackish or saline water with a tds 1 g l among the deep aquifers the middle pleistocene aquifer q2 mainly received depositions of estuarine and lacustrine sediments in the form of grayish yellow and grayish white sands the underlying pleistocene q1 aquifer developed from the terrestrial facies rivers and lakes deposits mainly gray gray yellow gravel and medium to coarse sand as a result of the long term pumping groundwater levels in q1 have locally decreased by 10 30 m zhu et al 2015 the neogene aquifer n formation contains gravel and coarse sands with riverbed facies and flood plain facies ge et al 2017 due to the regional uplift of the basement the entire deep aquifer system including n q1 and q2 is absent in the north area of the jinping mountain under pre development conditions the deep aquifers were recharged by lateral runoff while discharging to the ocean however over the last 30 years groundwater extraction has increased substantially and thus become the main sink in the deep aquifer s water budget windows in the aquitards that usually separate q2 and q3 allow for an increased vertical leakage under the excess groundwater extractions in the deep aquifer 2 2 methods 2 2 1 sample collection and analysis in total our analysis is based on 674 hydrogeochemical compositions of those 132 groundwater and 3 seawater samples were collected during our field campaigns in march 2017 and october 2018 in addition 539 samples were collected earlier 537 groundwater and 2 seawater samples by the jiangsu provincial institute of geological survey jsgs and included in our data set these additional data were collected during multiple sampling campaigns in 2008 2009 lu et al 2014 and 2014 2017 fu 2015 yue and su 2016 all samples from our recent field campaign were filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane in the field into polythene bottles that were thoroughly prewashed with deionized water the samples

the china university of geosciences wuhan the shallow groundwater samples provided by jsgs were mainly obtained from dug wells while samples from the confined aquifer were collected from screened dedicated monitoring boreholes and local drinking water wells the dataset includes the complete set of analytes required by the water quality survey guidelines i e ca2 na mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 no2 nh4 mn fe f br iodine and ph also as ba and sr were analyzed for a few locations in the marine plain all hydrogeochemical analyses of these samples were performed at the nanjing mineral resources

kmo testing criteria james et al 2015 and the factors were extracted using a principal component analysis pca method the varimax method was employed as the method of factor rotation james et al 2015 penfold et al 1966 all data analysis was performed with spss version 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa 2 2 3 methodology of random forest model to complement the fa we also used rf to explore the key factors that are responsible for or related to the iodine enrichment in the groundwaters of our study area rf relies on classification and regression trees cart as initially proposed by breiman 2001 it generates a large number of trees by bootstrapping samples from the original dataset each tree is then trained using a randomized subset of the predictors rf does not overfit the model to the dataset since the classification error of one tree can be overcome by the whole forest ghimire et al 2010 a large number of trees reduce generalization errors breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 the out of bag oob error a method of measuring prediction error on each training sample can be used to perform a cross validation accuracy it can also evaluate the relationship between covariates and dependent variables and calculate the relative importance of covariates cutler et al 2007 kubosova et al 2010 moreover an advantage of the rf is that it can explore the nonlinear complex relationship between the predictor variables and the dependent variable in contrast to fa and a distinct advantage of this method rf allows the incorporation of additional categorical variables that can provide information about the deposition environment and mineral characteristics such as hydrogeological unit into the model calculation to determine the most important variable group and then to reveal the relationship between the high low iodine classification and the hydrogeochemical dataset considered as independent predictor variables rf modeling included all variables that were thought to potentially have a significant impact on distinguishing high versus low iodine classification by minimizing the oob error cutler et al 2007 genuer et al 2010 james et al 2015 also the area under the roc curve auc serves as an indicator of the goodness of model fitting ranging from 0 5 to 1 su et al 2018 the greater the auc value the better the performance of the model at fitting the data an auc value of 0 5 corresponds to a random guess any model achieving an auc of 0 5 0 69 is considered to fit poorly any auc in the range 0 7 0 79 to correspond to a moderate fit while any auc in the range 0 8 1 suggests that a model fits well vilar del hoyo et al 2011 all calculations in the present study were performed with the randomforest package in r version 3 6 2 as the occurrence of iodine in coastal groundwater can be strongly affected by the prevailing redox environment as well as the geochemical interactions of the groundwater with marine sediments 16 variables were selected as predictor variables these predictors included a group for major ions ca2 na mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 and a group for redox sensitive groundwater constituents no3 no2 nh4 mn fe ph and br which often reflects the effect from marine sediment or interaction of groundwater and seawater also since the depth and the hu can reflect the sedimentary environment and thus groundwater compositions they were selected as predictor variables to quantify the magnitude of their impact on hydrogeochemical conditions total iodine i served as the dependent variable and was divided into two classes i e low iodine 100 μg l and high iodine 100 μg l for a total of 669 groundwater samples with 262 samples were 100 μg l iodine 39 16 and 407 samples equal to or 100 μg l iodine 60 84 3 results 3 1 iodine in groundwater the measured iodine concentrations in the groundwaters of the study area vary over three orders of magnitude ranging between 4 8 and 4750 μg l among the samples 48 9 exceeded the chinese guideline value of 100 μg l gb t 19380 2016 as fig 3 shows high iodine groundwater 100 μg l is mainly found in shallow aquifer sections usually at a depth of 50 m below this depth iodine concentrations are distinctly lower iodine concentrations are relatively stable below a depth of 120 m fluctuating around an average value of 100 μg l the lateral distribution of iodine within the shallow groundwater system is shown in fig 4a generally iodine concentrations gradually increase along the main groundwater flow direction from the upstream piedmont areas in the northwest towards the downstream coastal plain areas high iodine groundwater can be found in both the upstream flood plain as well as in the eastern coastal area most noteworthy all samples showing iodine concentration above 500 μg l were collected in the eastern coastal area including both marine and downstream floodplain in the deep aquifer high iodine concentrations were mainly located in the eastern study area fig 4b in contrast to the shallow aquifer in the early and middle pleistocene deep aquifers there is no clear trend of increasing concentrations along the main groundwater flow direction 3 2 water chemistry associated with high iodine waters in the shallow aquifer fig 5a high iodine concentrations are found to be closely associated with hco3 na and clna type groundwaters which are typically found in the eastern marine plain and the downstream floodplain in contrast samples collected from the upstream floodplain with high iodine concentrations were associated with hco3 ca mg which gradually transforms along the main groundwater flow direction towards hco3 na type groundwater fig 5a seawater samples i e cl na type water show relatively low iodine concentrations ranging from 35 to 75 μg l consistent with previously reported data chance et al 2014 fuge and johnson 2015 küpper et al 2011 levy et al 2018 whitehead 1984 the high iodine groundwater samples in the deep aquifer fig 5b are mainly associated with hco3 na type and cl na type salty groundwater in the downstream coastal area higher iodine 500 μg l were only found in cl na type groundwater fig 6 illustrates that iodide i is likely to be the dominating species within the high iodine groundwaters in this study area samples with 500 μg l iodine are found in relatively low eh conditions while there is no obvious correlation between iodine and ph 3 3 factor analysis results the first five varimax rotated factors were extracted according to the kaiser criterion table 1 they were found to account for 74 80 of the total observed variance the high positive loading of cl so4 2 mg2 na br sr in factor 1 explains the greatest amount of variance with 26 20 the combination of these species that account for most of the variability in the hydrogeochemical composition is indicative of the origin of the groundwater samples fig 7 high loading of mg2 and br demonstrates a connection to marine origins sr with a loading of 0 61 seems to suggest the occurrence of intensive water sediment interaction because sr is usually released from continental sediments and therefore increasing towards the downstream sections of groundwater basins langmuir 1997 factor 2 accounts for 16 87 of the variance the highest loading of nh4 ba as fe are found in this group above 0 85 and iodine is also found with a related high loading of 0 58 this may suggest that high iodine groundwaters are related to reducing environments fig 7 factor 3 is characterized by high positive loadings on hco3 and doc accounting for 9 49 of the variance increased hco3 groundwater concentrations occur in areas of elevated doc concentration probably associated with enhanced doc mineralization rather than the dissolution of carbonates such as calcite and dolomite factor 4 amounts to 9 17 of the variance factor 4 includes ca2 with a relatively high positive loading of 0 78 and sr with a positive loading of 0 53 also important in factor 4 are ph and depth that have a negative loading of approximately 0 5 the above values indicate that carbonate and feldspar minerals dissolve under the somewhat more acidic conditions that prevail in the shallow aquifer table s1 the variables grouped in factor 5 and factor 6 contain a relatively low variance contribution which together amounts to 13 07 the no3 in factor 5 has a positive loading of 0 78 there is a weak negative correlation between no3 and mn fig s1 which presumably reflects the fact that manganese reduction would only occur where no3 is completely depleted 3 4 interpretation of random forest model results to further elucidate key factors influencing iodine concentrations in groundwater we established two random forest models a full random forest model full rf based on the whole dataset and a random forest model for shallow groundwater samples shallow rf the original set of 16 predictor variables was further refined in a subsequent step in particular the variable no2 was removed as i the pearson correlation coefficient between iodine and no2 was close to 0 fig s1 and ii a low mean decrease in accuracy in both random forest models was found when its values were randomly rearranged in the oob samples the remaining 15 predictor variables were included in the optimized random forest model calculation overall 2000 trees were generated in the full rf model for computational convergence fig s2a and the number of variables tried at each split was 6 which were optimized by the function tune rf in the r software package randomforest cutler et al 2007 ließ et al 2012 for the full rf the data set with a total of 669 groundwater samples was randomly split into training 60 and testing 40 data sets for the shallow rf a dataset of 369 shallow samples was used with 60 of the dataset randomly selected as the training set similar to the full rf 5000 trees were generated to meet a stable overall error rate of forest fig s2b and the optimized number of variables tried at each split was 4 as table 2 shows in the test set of the full rf model 15 high iodine samples were incorrectly sorted into the low iodine class with an error of 9 8 while some low iodine samples were incorrectly sorted into the high iodine group equivalent to an error of 35 65 this means that the full rf model had better predictive capacities for the low iodine samples in general both full rf and the shallow rf can be categorized as well fitting according to the roc curve fig s3 and a relatively high auc table 2 table 3 in the test set of the shallow rf model the classification error of high iodine samples incorrectly sorted into the low iodine category also decreased to 17 14 this means the shallow rf model performed better in identifying high iodine samples the accuracy of the low iodine classification does not change significantly the roc curve and auc values tables 2 and 3 also show a consistent upward trend as the auc increases from 0 864 to 0 903 fig s3 considering that shallow groundwater samples show higher iodine concentrations than the deep aquifer samples the above observation suggests that the accuracy of the rf classification is affected by the ratio of high and low iodine found in each dataset because the deep groundwater amounts to 53 of the total groundwaters with a relatively low iodine concentration the full rf did not perform as well at classifying high iodine as the shallow rf model fig s3 fig 8a shows the rankings of the importance of the predictor variables in the rf model for the full dataset the mean decrease in accuracy is associated with randomizing a variable in oob samples and the mean decrease in gini node impurity is roughly consistent in assessing the relative importance for the full rf the top six variables for with the greatest mean decrease in accuracy include mg2 k depth cl na and hco3 for the shallow rf fig 8b the six most important variables for the mean decrease in accuracy were found to be cl hu no3 mg2 na hco3 followed by br and nh4 the variables mg2 na cl br and hco3 and hu are important in both the full rf model and the rf model for shallow aquifers indicating that they have a strong relationship with the iodine source and spatial variability no3 nh4 and hu can be considered as being quite important in affecting the iodine classification in the shallow aquifer since the ranking largely rises the ranking of depth has a higher importance in the full rf model than in the shallow rf model consistent with the fact that the high iodine distribution is found mainly in the shallow aquifer 4 discussion 4 1 iodine sources three types of sources appear to be the main candidates for explaining the observed iodine enrichment within the groundwater systems in our study area i paleo seawater mixing with groundwater ii marine sourced organic matter decomposition and iii atmospheric precipitation to identify the relative importance of these three types of sources as well as their spatial variety i the sedimentary facies associated with high iodine zones ii the cl br ratio of the water samples and iii the results of both the fa and the rf were jointly interpreted 4 1 1 paleo seawater mixing with groundwater the relationship between the cl br mass ratios hereinafter referred to as cl br ratio and iodine concentrations fig 9 can be used as an indicator to support the identification of iodine sources in particular to distinguish marine sediment origins from the influence of paleo seawater mixing fig 9a shows that high iodine groundwater cl br ratios within coastal areas reside near the seawater line note that yellow sea seawater has a cl br ratio of 244 as also shown by our data the presence of increased cl concentrations indicates the possibility that mixing of groundwater with residual paleo seawater has occurred with the latter being a source of iodine in groundwater this hypothesis relies on the fact that cl br ratios are not affected by dilution and evaporation of seawater before the onset of halite precipitation alcalá and custodio 2008 and therefore the cl br ratio in the paleo seawater can be assumed as being similar to the current cl br ratio in seawater note however that the paleo seawater would still need to have been concentrated by at least 16 7 times to increase the concentration of iodine from modern seawater average iodine level of 45 60 μg l towards the observed 1000 μg l implying that cl would simultaneously have been concentrated from the average cl level of modern seawater 14 5 g l to 242 15 g l however this value by far exceeds the observed maximum cl concentration 37 53 g l thus the mixing of paleo seawater and groundwater is very unlikely to be the only source of iodine 4 1 2 marine sourced organic matter decomposition at least in the coastal areas the decrease of the cl br ratio in conjunction with an increase of iodine concentration can more likely be attributed to iodine being sourced from marine sediments the underlying conceptual model is that a simultaneous release of br and iodine has occurred during the decomposition of organic matter hosted by marine facies sediments davis et al 1998 as shown by our factor analysis the variables na mg2 cl br which are commonly enriched in seawater or groundwater from marine facies related sediments and exhibit the high positive loading in factor 1 are indicative of marine origin for groundwater they are all closely associated with hco3 as indicated by the relatively higher ranking of these variables in both the full rf and the shallow rf fig 8 which also suggests that marine sourced organic matter decomposition plays a key role in iodine release into the groundwater system xue et al 2019 furthermore the results of the fa indicate that both the presence of a geochemically reducing environment factor 2 and the decomposition of organic matter factor 3 show a close relationship with the presence of iodine this positive correlation between iodine and ba fig s1 and fig 10 provides additional evidence that marine sourced organic matter is potentially the main source of iodine in groundwater ba can be considered as another important indicator of marine origins because ba2 has like i a relative large ionic radius allowing terrestrial facies ba2 to be easily adsorbed by iron oxides and organic matter or to be precipitated with so4 2 as barite baso4 nozaki et al 2001 schöne et al 2011 thus ba tends to accumulate at the land marine interface and in marine facies sediments while the concentration of dissolved ba is very low in seawater liguori et al 2016 the association of as ba and iodine in factor 2 and high positive correlation among as ba and iodine fig 10 and fig s1 suggests that reductive dissolution of iron oxides and associated with this process iodine desorption might be the underlying mechanism responsible for generating elevated groundwater iodine concentrations this mechanism has already previously been identified in the context of iodine release during early diagenesis fehn et al 2007 francois 1987 hardisty et al 2014 in the quest for identifying the origin of iodine sources it is important to note that the aquifer material at shallow depth that is now associated with high iodine groundwater was previously i e during the late pleistocene to holocene affected by marine transgression during this period the paleo shoreline reached the boundary of our study area near the western piedmont li et al 2017 and the upstream floodplain was a coastal plain containing a large number of lagoons before 1128 ce over the last 700 years most of these lagoons have subsequently been filled by sediments that were imported during old yellow river flooding events while the coastline was also pushed back eastward by 80 90 km xue 1993 understanding these geological features allows us to conclude that the marine or lagoons facies sediments might be the main source of iodine within the shallow upstream flood plain aquifer which to our knowledge has not been previously recognized within the upstream floodplain area high iodine concentrations are shown to be mostly associated with old yellow river flooding sediments but only in areas overlain by caprocks fig 4 accordingly the waters in caprocks do not show any elevated iodine concentrations andersen et al 2009 teng et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 the caprocks may have played an important role in isolating the lagoon facies sediments from the atmosphere and in facilitating iron reducing conditions that favored iodine release from lagoon filling sediments 4 1 3 atmospheric precipitation atmospheric dry and wet deposition may also contribute to the enrichment of iodine in soils in coastal areas this is thought to occur at distances of up to 50 80 km inland carpenter 2014 whitehead 1984 yeager et al 2017 in our case this could imply a potential influence over the entire marine plain and downstream flood plain indeed lu et al 2014 already noted a high correlation in the distribution of iodine between coastal soils and shallow high iodine groundwater however lu et al 2014 suggested that iodine in soils originates from marine sediments rather than from atmospheric input given that soil iodine concentrations increase with increasing depth within the depth range of 0 2 m below ground surface cl br ratios in the groundwaters of the upstream flood plain vary over a wide range fig 9 which may reflect the influence of various recharge sources thus the role of atmospheric deposition should be negligible for high iodine concentration in groundwater from the study area 4 2 main factors controlling elevated iodine concentrations in groundwater besides the origin of iodine it is important to understand which factors control its fate in groundwater systems previously redox conditions and ph have been suggested to most notably affect iodine speciation and mobility hou et al 2009 hu et al 2012 kaplan et al 2014 however in contrast to these studies our data showed no significant correlation between iodine concentrations and ph neither by our factor analysis nor our random forest modeling elsewhere weakly alkaline environments are often reported to be associated with elevated iodine concentrations explained by the corresponding lower sorption affinity on iron oxides under these conditions hong et al 2012 nagata et al 2009 nagata and fukushi 2010 another potential mechanism of iodine release like the biodegradation of organic iodination is often accompanied by a ph decrease induced by the metabolic activity of microorganisms santschi et al 2017 yeager et al 2017 this suggests that the relation between iodine concentrations and ph depends on the geochemical process that controls the release of iodine on a regional scale like our study area due to the chemical heterogeneities and different release mechanisms of iodine at different sites throughout the entire study area it is challenging to use statistical methods to measure the correlation between ph and iodine concentration fig 7 shows that i is the dominant species in high iodine groundwaters within the study area which is consistent with other studies that reported high iodine concentrations in groundwater systems e g hou et al 2009 wang et al 2018 samples with 500 μg l iodine are found under more reducing low eh conditions this is consistent with the fact that iodine release in water sediment systems is connected with presumably microbially mediated redox processes such as the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and the associated loss of sorption sites for iodine iodate reduction and reductive deiodination of organic compounds fuge and johnson 2015 küpper et al 2011 yeager et al 2017 fig 7 shows that iodine loading of 0 58 is associated with the variables as fe ba nh4 in factor 2 which supports this hypothesis fig 10 among those the occurrence of elevated concentrations of fe as and nh4 is a typical indicator for relatively reducing groundwater conditions of particular relevance is that increased as concentrations often result from the reductive dissolution of as bearing iron oxides fendorf et al 2010 harvey et al 2002 nickson et al 2000 rawson et al 2016 in conjunction with a positive correlation between as and iodine such a positive correlation between as and iodine has been previously discussed in the context of another high iodine and arsenic groundwater system i e the datong basin where this correlation was also attributed to the simultaneous release of as and iodine during the reductive dissolution of iron hydro oxides pi et al 2015 similarly the release process of ba was also previously hypothesized to be associated with iodine in more reducing environments liguori et al 2016 nozaki et al 2001 rothwell 1989 the relatively high ranking of redox sensitive variables such as fe nh4 product of organic matter decomposition and no3 in the shallow rf indicate that the prevailing redox conditions have a significant impact on the spatial variability of iodine concentrations in shallow groundwaters no3 originates mainly from surface soil leaching and terrestrial run off and can be used as a proxy for agricultural activity and the presence of a relatively oxidized environment mok et al 2018 tesoriero et al 2017 the ranking of no3 in the shallow rf model shows a high importance in classifying high vs low iodine concentrations while fig s1 show a weak correlation between iodine and no3 with the pearson correlation coefficient remaining between 0 2 and 0 the high ranking of importance for iodine classification can be attributed to the fact that the presence absence of no3 is an important indicator for the redox conditions that prevail in the shallow groundwaters note however that no3 does not directly participate in the geochemical reactions responsible for iodine release as microorganisms play an important role in iodine mobility the initial source of iodine in the sediments is the iodination of organic matter such as iodinated amino acids and iodinated humic substances han et al 2012 kaplan et al 2014 küpper et al 2011 many studies have previously emphasized the potential role of biodegradation of organic matter bowley et al 2016 cook et al 2000 qian et al 2017 schwehr et al 2009 yeager et al 2017 factor 3 shows that hco3 originates from the degradation of doc rather than the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the relatively middle level loading of iodine 0 34 in this factor suggests that degradation of organic matter seems to be related to iodine release li et al 2013 suggested that iodine increases with hco3 when iodine concentrations remain 500 μg l once iodine concentrations are 500 μg l hco3 decreases as iodine increases this can be attributed to the competitive adsorption between hco3 and iodine duan et al 2020 thus a closer relationship of iodine with doc rather than with hco3 see fig 10 and fig s1 suggests that degradation of organic matter may promote the release of iodine in an indirect pathway fortunately the random forest model is not sensitive to the non linear correlation and the high ranking of hco3 in both the full rf and the shallow rf shows that hco3 plays an important role in high vs low iodine classification therefore we conjecture that the degradation of organic matter releases iodine to porewater and subsequently adsorbs at least partially to iron oxides under reducing conditions the reductive dissolution of iron oxides in conjunction with the degradation of iodine bearing organic matter then promotes iodine release to groundwater the physical processes may also affect and or control the enrichment of iodine as shown in fig 4a iodine concentration increases along the direction of groundwater from the northwestern mountain recharge area to the coastal discharge area most of the highest iodine concentrations are found in the coastal groundwater discharge area the coupled iodine physical geochmeical transport processes should be further investigated with reactive transport in the future study 5 summary and conclusion combining the distribution characteristics of iodine hydrogeochemical analysis and statistical analyses methods such as random forest modeling and factor analysis this study identifies the source and key hydrogeochemical processes for iodine accumulation in groundwater and explores the mechanism affecting the iodine distribution in njyp the use of statistical modeling allowed to integrate and analyze a large amount of historical groundwater quality monitoring data and to determine critical hydrogeochemical variables and their relationship with the processes that we hypothesize to be associated with iodine release and fate the concentration of iodine in the groundwaters range from 4 8 to 4750 μg l and 48 9 of total samples 674 exceeded the threshold value of 100 μg l the high iodine standard guideline of china most of the high iodine concentrations are located in the flood plain of the old yellow river and marine plain shallow aquifer along the flow path the highest concentration of iodine 500 μg l is mainly found in the marine plain and the downstream flood plain associated with the hco3 na and clna type waters iodine below 500 μg l is commonly found in the upstream flood plain in deep groundwater high iodine concentrations are also dominated by hco3 na type and clna type salt groundwater in the downstream coastal q2 aquifer at 50 80 depth in the coastal plain the hydrogeochemical data suggest that the mixing of groundwater with paleo seawater and the marine facies sediment can be considered as the two sources of iodine both in the shallow and deep aquifer the marine or lagoons facies sediment is thought to be mainly responsible for iodine in the upstream flood plain the flood sediments of the old yellow river impact iodine behavior as they serve as cover layer to produce a reducing hydrogeochemical environment for iodine mobilization rather than acting as a direct source of iodine itself the results of our factor analysis revealed that reducing environments appear to enhance the geochemical processes that cause a release of iodine into groundwater the controlling hydrogeochemical processes for iodine release are proposed to be i the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and ii the degradation of organic matter combining the information of the spatial distribution of iodine concentrations and importance ranking for both the full rf and shallow rf models reveals that the distribution of marine facies related sediments is the primary controlling factor for the spatial variability of iodine concentration in the shallow groundwater system also the low flow rate of groundwater favors iodine release from sediments to groundwater by increasing residence times and therefore interactions between groundwater and marine facies sediments underpinning a shift towards more reducing environments both in the upstream flood plain and the downstream coastal discharge area finally insensitivity of the random forest model to non linear relationships makes the random forest model based on limited water quality monitoring data outstanding in predicting the spatial distribution of iodine thus greatly improving the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment of iodine

1369,the removal of dissolved volatile organic compounds vocs from low permeability lenses is important to limit back diffusion at sites impacted by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls in situ thermal treatment istt technologies have the potential to treat dnapl impacted sites by enhancing diffusion from low permeability lenses during heating a series of two dimensional laboratory tank experiments was conducted to investigate heating gas formation and trichloroethene tce removal from a clay lens surrounded by sand results showed preferential heating of the clay and substantial tce removal with post heating relative concentrations less than 0 06 the extent of tce removal was not explained by only an increase in the aqueous tce diffusion coefficient with increased temperature modelling estimates based on 1d diffusion from the lens showed that diffusion through both gas and water phases was required to match observations gas formation in the interior of the lens was also indicated by measured changes in bulk electrical conductivity of the clay during cool down with gas saturations estimated to be greater than 0 21 at the end of heating these estimates were larger than those needed to match the observed removal by diffusion and suggest that connected gas pathways were created in the lens during heating but that not all of the gas produced was part of those pathways these results suggest that istt technologies may be effective in removing dissolved vocs from thin clay lenses and that gas formation within the clay should be considered when predicting the extent and rate of removal 1 introduction the remediation of soil and groundwater at sites impacted by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls is challenging particularly at sites with heterogeneous geology these challenges change throughout the lifecycle of a dnapl source zone kueper et al 2014 during earlier periods challenges are often associated with the dnapl itself which is typically distributed in a complex architecture of residual and pools dictated by the geology release history and dnapl properties during later periods however challenges are often associated with the diffusion of dissolved volatile organic compounds vocs from lower permeability layers and lenses into higher permeability flow pathways chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 stroo et al 2012 tatti et al 2016 commonly referred to as back diffusion this process is the result of high voc concentrations present in higher permeability material early in the source zone lifecycle that diffuse into adjacent initially clean lower permeability layers the source of the vocs can be high concentration plumes or dnapl at the interface between the higher and lower permeability materials following the lowering of voc concentrations in the higher permeability material later in the lifecycle either through natural processes or the application of in situ remediation technologies diffusion of vocs from the lower to the higher permeability material then supplies vocs to dominant groundwater flow pathways in many cases this mass loading can sustain a dissolved plume that remains above regulatory limits despite the removal of substantial mass in the higher permeability material in the case of in situ remediation this leads to concentration rebound kueper et al 2014 it is critical that remediation strategies address the potential for back diffusion either through management of the diffusive flux by natural attenuation or by treatment of the vocs in the lower permeability layers this applies to back diffusion from clay aquitards as well as to back diffusion from clay lenses particularly at sites where the dnapl source and voc plumes do not extend down to an aquitard parker et al 2008 an example of interbedded sand and thin clay lenses is shown in fig 1 with clay lenses between 1 and 20 cm in thickness treatment of lower permeability layers is difficult particularly when using injection based in situ remediation technologies including in situ chemical oxidation isco in situ chemical reduction iscr and in situ bioremediation isb where substantial differences in permeability result in the bypassing of these layers by the injected fluid stroo et al 2012 without advection through lower permeability layers the removal of vocs is controlled by diffusion and any acceleration of that removal depends on increasing diffusion coefficients or increasing concentration gradients alternatively adoption of a flux reduction approach can be used to limit diffusive release by decreasing concentration gradients through the introduction of reagents or bacteria into the lens clifton et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2017 hnatko et al 2020 in situ thermal treatment istt technologies including electrical resistance heating erh and thermal conductive heating tch are an alternative to injection based in situ remediation technologies istt technologies are commonly used for the treatment of volatile and semi volatile dnapls stroo et al 2012 ding et al 2019 horst et al 2021 because electrical conductivity in the case of erh and thermal conductivity in the case of erh and tch vary less between geologic media than hydraulic conductivity istt technologies have been applied to source zones in both the saturated and unsaturated zones nilsson et al 2011 tzovolou et al 2011 janfada et al 2020 during istt an increase in subsurface temperature is expected to enhance voc removal from lower permeability layers by increasing diffusion coefficients which increase with increasing temperature in addition an increase in subsurface temperature to the boiling point or co boiling point in the presence of dnapl will create a gas phase during istt a gas phase will be produced by heterogeneous nucleation jones et al 1999 resulting in the formation of disconnected bubbles followed by their expansion and coalescence into a network of gas channels although bubble migration is also possible in coarse grained material satik and yortsos 1996 hegele and mumford 2014 the formation migration and removal of a gas phase is critical to the success of most istt applications in addition to removing vocs directly from the higher permeability regions this gas formation and voc removal will also enhance voc removal from the adjacent lower permeability layers by increasing the concentration gradient furthermore istt technologies have the potential to create gas within lower permeability layers further increasing the effective voc diffusion coefficient and potentially creating connected gas phase pathways within the lower permeability layers fig 2 for example laboratory experiments by martin et al 2017 showed that during erh of thin clay and sandy clay lenses surrounded by sand gas was produced predominantly at the high low sand clay permeability interface during heating but gas saturations of 0 09 to 0 38 were also produced in the interior of the lens the onset of gas connection and the formation of advective transport pathways in clay has also been studied in the context of nuclear waste repositories e g horseman et al 1999 ortiz et al 2002 with connected gas reported at gas saturations of approximately 0 04 to 0 27 graham et al 2002 gallé 2000 harrington and horseman 2003 despite their relative insensitivity to permeability istt technologies are not immune to the effects of heterogeneity for example higher groundwater flow rates in higher permeability zones can lead to lower heating rates and lower treatment temperatures baston and kueper 2009 lebron et al 2012 hegele and mcgee 2017 spatial differences in temperature lead to natural convection which is affected by hydraulic conductivity krol et al 2014 and lower permeability layers act as capillary barriers that control gas migration and can lead to poor gas capture and voc condensation munholland et al 2016 nevertheless most laboratory studies of istt have focused on homogeneous higher permeability material such as sands devoe and udell 1998 burghardt and kueper 2008 krol et al 2011 hegele and mumford 2014 zhao et al 2014 hicknell et al 2018 studies that have focused on lower permeability material have done so in homogeneous systems including silty soil heron et al 1998b fractured clay liu et al 2013 2014 and rock chen et al 2010 kluger and beyke 2010 studies that have incorporated heterogeneity have been focused on sands and have not investigated removal from lower permeability layers martin and kueper 2011 munholland et al 2016 or have investigated dnapl embedded in lower permeability layers rather than dissolved voc baker and hiester 2009 geng et al 2021 given the prevalence of heterogeneous sites treated by istt and the importance of voc removal from lower permeability layers to limit back diffusion at dnapl impacted sites there is a need to investigate voc removal during heating of lower permeability material surrounded by higher permeability material the objectives of this study were to i investigate voc removal from thin clay lenses surrounded by sand during in situ heating and ii assess the importance of gas formation in the lens on that removal a series of laboratory tank experiments was conducted in which an aqueous solution of trichloroethene tce was emplaced in a clay lens and that lens was heated by erh different levels of heating were used to create conditions at or below the boiling point of water and results were compared to analytical solutions of voc diffusion from the lens assuming diffusion through gas and water in parallel or in series representative of connected or disconnected gas distributions 2 material and methods 2 1 packing and lens emplacement experiments were conducted in a 76 2 40 6 15 cm outer dimensions laboratory tank made from 1 3 cm thick polycarbonate sheets supported by an external aluminum frame martin et al 2016 martin et al 2017 fig 3 gas produced during heating was vented through ports in the tank lid an array of 30 ungrounded thermocouples 10 2 cm length 0 32 cm diameter t type omega inc spaced 7 6 cm apart was installed through the back wall of the tank such that the tip of each thermocouple was midway between the front and back walls prior to packing the tank clay lenses were created by consolidating a slurry of refined kaolin clay powder speswhite imery s performance minerals in a 480 mg l tce solution the kaolin powder was selected because it had a low organic carbon content of 0 01 mg kg ferrarese and andreottola 2008 resulting in little tce sorption the slurry was pressurized using a pneumatic piston in a 40 cm tall 30 cm diameter vertical cylinder martin et al 2017 over a period of 14 days with pressure increased incrementally to a maximum of 400 kpa throughout consolidation the cylinder was tented using plastic sheeting to reduce tce loss by volatilization following consolidation the cylinder pressure was decreased in a stepwise fashion over a three day period to form a water saturated clay by avoiding cavitation that would be caused by a sudden pressure release and would create an entrapped gas phase the porosity of the consolidated clay was 0 55 0 06 determined by weighing known volume samples before and after drying section 2 4 the consolidated clay was cut into 24 8 22 cm blocks immediately sealed in plastic wrap and the outside coated in wax to reduce tce loss by volatilization and stored at 4 c until immediately before packing the tank was packed in three stages first an approximately 15 cm thick layer of 20 30 accusand agsco schroth et al 1996 was emplaced in the tank using a wet packing technique in which a slurry of sand and water was poured continuously into a partially water filled cell second a clay block was trimmed to create a 19 4 12 4 cm lens that was pressed into place on top of the sand careful attention was paid to match the width of the lens to the width of the tank to ensure no gap between the lens and the front and back tank walls samples of the block near the lens were collected during trimming and analyzed to determine the initial tce concentration in the lens third additional sand was wet packed to the top of the cell most thermocouples were installed prior to sand packing but those in the clay lens were pressed into the lens after emplacement 2 2 heating and temperature measurements the sand and clay were heated by erh using two pairs of cylindrical graphite rods 30 cm length 1 3 cm diameter mcmaster carr 9121k73 as electrodes connected to a 110 v ac 60 hz power outlet a variable autotransformer powerstat 3n116b statco energy products and a step up transformer capable of providing a maximum electric potential of 330 v temperature measured by each thermocouple was recorded during and after heating at 5 min intervals using a digital multimeter keithley instruments 2600b and multiplexer keithley instruments 7708 four experiments were conducted using different applied potentials adjusted using the variable autotransformer and different heating durations table 1 experiments 100 v 1d 165 v 1d and 330 v 1d were conducted to investigate the effects of different treatment temperatures on tce removal and gas formation over a one day heating period and experiment 165 v 3d was conducted to investigate tce removal over a three day heating period following the one or three day heating period each experiment was allowed to cool down to the pre heating temperature for a period of approximately one day 2 3 gas saturations measurements gas saturations in the clay lens at the end of heating in each experiment were estimated using the method presented by martin et al 2017 with the main power supply switched off a potential of 17 5 v was applied between the stainless steel sheaths of adjacent thermocouples in the lens using a separate autotransformer and the resulting electric current was measured fig 3b electric current measurements began after heating was stopped and continued until the temperature of the lens returned to the pre heating temperature assuming that the ratio of the current measured at any temperature t to that at the pre heating temperature t 0 is equal to the ratio of the electrical conductivities at t and t 0 and that there is no change to the porosity in the lens the gas saturation can be determined by waxman and smits 1968 martin et al 2017 1 σ σ 0 s w n 1 s w σ w b t q v σ w 0 b t 0 q v where σ σ 0 is the bulk electrical conductivity ratio s w is the water saturation in the lens n is the saturation exponent σ w and σ w0 are the electrical conductivities of water s m 1 at t and t 0 b t and b t0 m2 s v 1 are the equivalent counterion mobilities at t and t 0 and q v is the excess charge at the surface of the grains c m 3 assuming that the equivalent counterion mobility is proportional to the equivalent surface mobility the equivalent counterion mobility as a function of temperature is given by revil et al 1998 2 b t b m 1 ν s t t 0 where b m is the maximum counterion mobility ν s 0 04 c 1 revil et al 1998 and the electrical conductivity of water is estimated using arps s law butler and knight 1995 3 σ w σ w 0 t 21 5 t 0 21 5 where t and t 0 are expressed in c parameter values used in all gas saturation calculations are listed in table 2 and are consistent with those used previously martin et al 2017 2 4 soil sampling and tce analysis after heating and cool down the sand above the clay lens in each experiment was removed and core samples were collected from the lens by driving sections of steel pipe 4 cm length 1 5 cm diameter into the clay using a rubber mallet after removing the pipe the ends were sealed using ptfe wrapped stoppers and the clay filled pipe was stored at 4 c until analyzed for analysis which was conducted within 72 h of sample collection either one or two subsamples approximately 5 g were collected from each pipe corresponding to the middle bottom or top of the lens fig 3c pre emplacement initial samples were collected prior to packing using the same approach differences in initial concentrations were the result of different tenting approaches used during consolidation to limit volatile losses and storage of the lens between consolidation and packing tce was extracted from the subsamples using methanol and analyzed by gas chromatography agilent technologies 7890b with a flame ionization detector gc fid according to modified method 8260c usepa 2006 with a detection limit of 20 μg kg 2 5 modelling tce removal by diffusion removal of dissolved tce from a clay lens at high water saturation will be controlled by diffusion as described by fick s second law crank 1975 expressed in 1d as 4 c w t d e 2 c w z 2 where c w is the aqueous concentration of tce and d e is the total effective diffusion coefficient for tce where both gas and water are present in a porous medium the total effective diffusion coefficient is a function of the effective diffusion coefficients in both phases their relationship to mass flux is defined by 5 j i θ i τ i d i 2 c i z 2 where j i is the mass flux through phase i gas g or water w θ i is the gas or water filled porosity τ i is the tortuosity for phase i and d i is the diffusion coefficient in phase i in the absence of porous media free gas or free water it is important to note that tortuosity can also be defined to include porosity batterman et al 1996 multiple expressions are available to estimate tortuosity including in clay batterman et al 1996 lim et al 1998 reinecke and sleep 2002 wang et al 2003 chou et al 2012 in this study two expressions were chosen to encompass a range of tortuosity estimates and knudsen diffusion was not considered the first expression was the popular millington and quirk 1961 expression 6 τ i θ i 7 3 θ t 2 s i 7 3 θ t 1 3 where θ t is the total porosity and s i is the saturation of phase i θ i s i θ t and s g s w 1 several studies of diffusion in unsaturated porous media have identified discrepancies between measured values and predictions based on millington and quirk 1961 batterman et al 1996 wang et al 2003 chou et al 2012 including overestimated aqueous phase tortuosity values in laboratory experiments using clay chou et al 2012 the second expression for tortuosity was that proposed by chou 2010 7 τ i 0 02 θ i 1 2 θ t 3 2 0 02 s i 1 2 θ t although eqs 6 and 7 both predict a decrease in tortuosity with decreasing saturation fig 4a tortuosity values are higher at higher saturations and lower at lower saturations when estimated using millington and quirk 1961 rather than chou 2010 estimates of the total effective diffusion coefficient also depend on an assumption of gas phase connectivity that is whether diffusion through the gas and water phases occurs in parallel or in series for example in their study of voc diffusion across the capillary fringe mccarthy and johnson 1993 presented a governing equation equivalent to a total effective diffusion coefficient defined as 8 d e θ w τ w d w θ g τ g d g h θ w θ g h s w τ w d w s g τ g d g h s w s g h where h is the dimensionless henry s constant that describes the equilibrium partitioning of voc between the gas and water phases and sorption and advection are negligible eq 8 assumes that diffusion in the aqueous and gas phases occurs through separate parallel pathways defined by θ w and θ g similar expressions have been used to describe total effective diffusion in the context of vapour intrusion e g johnson and ettinger 1991 which are typically presented using gas concentrations rather than aqueous concentrations as an alternative klenk and grathwohl 2002 suggested that diffusion in series is more appropriate to describe effective diffusion in the presence of a trapped gas phase assuming that s w and s g serve as estimates for the fraction of the total path length in each phase and that the tortuosity τ at any point along that path can be estimated using the total porosity the effective diffusion coefficient is 9 d e τ s w d w s g d g h 1 eqs 8 and 9 predict different increases in d e with increasing s g with higher predictions for diffusion in parallel eq 8 fig 4b compared to for diffusion in series eq 9 fig 4c at intermediate saturations it is also important to recognize that eq 8 predicts d e as d g whereas eq 9 predicts d e τd w s w as d g in istt applications the total effective diffusion coefficient increases with increasing temperature as well as with increasing gas saturation which is expected to result in higher rates of voc removal by diffusion expressions presented by rossi et al 2015 and watts 1971 were used to estimate the free water and free gas diffusion coefficients respectively as functions of temperature 10 ln d w ln d w e a rt 11 log d g log d g ν log t where d w is the diffusion coefficient for infinite temperature 8 9 10 3 cm2 s r is the ideal gas constant e a is the activation energy for diffusion 4 1 kcal mol 1 d g and ν are constants 9 8 10 7 cm2 s and 1 8654 and t is absolute temperature k the diffusion coefficient of tce in air was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of tce in the gas phase of these experiments the effective diffusion coefficients estimated using eqs 8 and 9 are also affected by the temperature dependence of the henry s constant given by heron et al 1998a 12 ln h 195 52 12540 t 27 11 ln t assuming one dimensional diffusion through a thin 4 cm lens and complete removal of tce from the sand clay interface as would be expected during isst once a connected gas phase was produced in the sand fig 2b the solution to eq 4 is crank 1975 13 c w c w 0 4 π n 0 1 n 2 n 1 exp d e 2 n 1 n π 2 t 4 z 2 cos 2 n 1 πz 2 z where c w0 is the initial aqueous concentration of tce in the lens z is the half thickness of the lens 2 cm in these experiments z is the vertical position the initial condition is c w z 0 c w0 the top boundary condition is c w z t 0 and the domain is assumed to be symmetric about the centreline of the lens 3 results and discussion 3 1 heating and gas production temperatures measured in the clay lens and surrounding sand during the initial heating period and during cool down are shown in fig 5 differences in bulk electrical conductivity between the sand and clay affect heating and gas production during erh martin et al 2016 with the higher bulk electrical conductivity of the clay resulting in greater current density more power and faster heating of the lens a faster increase in temperature occurred in the clay than in the sand in all four experiments heating rates in both sand and clay also increased with increased applied electric potential with the 165 v 1d and 165 v 3d experiments showing good reproducibility the maximum temperatures exceeded 100 c in the clay lens and were at or near 100 c in the sand during most of the 165 v 1d 165 3d and 330 v 1d experiments this resulted in visible gas production in the sand which originated at the sand clay interface during each experiment the sand clay interface is the preferential gas production location because of preferential heating in the clay lens combined with lower capillary forces in the sand that facilitate gas expansion martin et al 2017 similar observations of first gas formation in more permeable zones was reported for simulations of heating in fractured rock where gas forms preferentially in fractures rather than the rock matrix chen et al 2015 this gas production is expected to allow the rapid removal of tce from the sand clay interface in contrast maximum temperatures during the 100 v 1d experiments were 45 c in the clay and 43 c in the sand no gas production was observed in the sand and no gas production is expected in the clay at these temperatures although gas production was not visible in the clay lens in experiments 165 v 1d 165 v 3d and 330 v 1d the presence of gas was inferred based on a measured bulk electrical conductivity ratio that was lower than expected under water saturated conditions eqs 1 3 the bulk electrical conductivity ratio measured during cool down in each experiment is shown in fig 6 along with estimates assuming constant water saturated conditions the data are presented with decreasing temperatures from left to right to be consistent with time increasing from left to right during cool down for constant water saturated conditions a decrease in temperature results in a monotonic decrease in bulk electrical conductivity controlled by the decrease in electrical conductivity of the pore water and the surface mobility of the counterions revil et al 1998 the measurements taken during cool down however show non monotonic changes with a bulk electrical conductivity ratio that was less than the water saturated prediction immediately after heating was stopped i e measured at the highest temperature in each experiment shown in fig 6 these measurements then increased toward the water saturated prediction at intermediate temperatures followed by a decrease this non monotonic behaviour is attributed to gas that was present the moment that heating was stopped thereby decreasing the bulk electrical conductivity the gas then collapsed as temperatures decreased with gas presence pore water electrical conductivity and surface mobility of the counterions having competing effects on the bulk electrical conductivity gas saturations in the lens were estimated at the start of the cool down period for each experiment and range from 0 21 0 06 and 0 22 0 06 in experiments 165 v 1d and 165 v 3d to 0 56 0 14 in experiment 330 v 1d table 3 the uncertainty in each estimate is based on calculations using a saturation exponent n of 2 5 to 4 table 2 these estimates indicate that gas was formed in the interior of the lens and that gas saturations may have been sufficient to form a connected gas channel network 3 2 tce removal tce concentrations in the lens declined significantly as a result of erh during experiments that reached water boiling temperature table 3 with higher final concentrations measured along the lens centerline than near the lens edges fig 7 final concentrations are expressed as relative concentrations to compare between experiments with different initial tce concentrations in the lens limited removal occurred in the 100 v 1d experiment in which no boiling occurred under these conditions the effective diffusion coefficient was marginally increased by a factor of 1 6 between 23 c and 45 c eq 10 but was not further increased by the presence of a gas phase in the clay lens in addition the lack of gas production in the sand would extend the diffusion path length beyond the edge of the lens resulting in transport in the sand toward the top of the cell that would also be controlled by diffusion some removal may have resulted from partitioning of tce to the polycarbonate walls of the tank but this is expected to be negligible compared to the observed removal at water boiling temperature in contrast substantial removal occurred in the 165 v 1d 165 v 3d and 330 v 1d experiments if the average concentrations listed in table 3 are assumed to be representative of concentrations throughout the lens this represents removals of approximately 95 this is likely an underestimate of the removal because lower concentrations likely existed nearer to the lens edges this increased removal during heating is attributed to both a shortening of the diffusion path length compared to the 100 v 1d experiment due to tce that is removed rapidly from the sand clay interface through a connected network of gas channels in the sand and to increased effective diffusion coefficients due to gas production within the lenses this enhanced removal was achieved in experiments 165 v 1d and 165 v 3d and included tce removal to below detection limits in experiment 330 v 1d substantial removal in experiment 330 v 1d is consistent with steam stripping and gas advection through higher saturation connected gas pathways as has been observed in previous studies of heating in low permeability material chen et al 2010 liu et al 2014 although the lenses investigated in this study were thin resulting in substantial tce removal in hours to days enhanced removal is also expected for thicker lenses resulting from heating and gas production in those lenses 3 3 modelling enhanced diffusion estimated diffusion profiles calculated using eqs 8 10 and 13 are shown in fig 7 for temperatures of 45 c and 100 c after one day of heating representative of a heated water saturated lens s w 1 s g 0 and a zero tce concentration at the sand clay interface assuming uniform water saturation and temperature throughout the lens and negligible sorption the ratio of soil concentrations is equal to the ratio of aqueous concentrations which allows the measured concentration ratio to be compared to the estimates using eq 13 the measured concentrations in the 100 v 1d experiment lie between the estimates using the millington and quirk 1961 and chou 2010 expressions for tortuosity at 45 c in contrast the measured concentrations in the 165 v 1d and 330 v 1d experiments are below the water saturated prediction at 100 c using either the millington and quirk 1961 or chou 2010 estimates this is despite the large uncertainty represented by the range between those two estimates and the likely over prediction of diffusion in clay at higher water saturations using the millington and quirk 1961 expression chou et al 2012 the difference between the water saturated estimates and the measured concentrations e g either c c 0 1 or c c 0 0 26 compared to c c 0 0 06 at the lens centerline represents the contribution of the gas phase to tce removal from the lens the 165 v 1d concentrations were fit using eq 10 13 along with all combinations of eqs 6 or 7 with eqs 8 or 9 representative of diffusion through gas and water in parallel or in series with tortuosity estimated using millington and quirk 1961 or chou 2010 the total effective diffusion coefficient required to fit the measured concentrations is greater than the water saturated estimate at 100 c by a factor of 2 0 2 9 10 9 m2 s compared to 5 9 10 9 m2 s and greater that the water saturated estimate at 23 c by a factor of 8 5 assuming water and gas diffusion in parallel eq 8 through connected gas pathways this requires a gas saturation of 0 08 using millington and quirk 1961 or 0 04 using chou 2010 tce removal through connected gas pathways may also have occurred by advection of gas out of the lens and steam stripping of dissolved tce near those pathways liu et al 2014 which would allow similar removal at lower gas saturations in contrast assuming water and gas diffusion in series as would be expected for only discontinuous trapped gas in the lens requires a gas saturation of 0 51 using millington and quirk 1961 or 0 98 using chou 2010 the assumption of one dimensional diffusion neglects removal from the lateral edges of the lens and may overestimate the gas saturations required to match the observed removal however any difference is expected to be less than the uncertainty associated with the choice of tortuosity model the gas saturations based on changes in bulk electrical conductivity for the 165 v 1d and 165 3d experiments table 3 lie between these diffusion based estimates that is gas production in the lens was not high enough for the observed removal to have occurred by diffusion through only disconnected trapped gas but the observed removal was lower than if all gas produced was connected therefore it is likely that only a portion of the gas produced during heating formed a connected pathway and that this connected pathway dominated removal 4 summary and conclusions a series of two dimensional laboratory tank experiments demonstrated enhanced removal of dissolved tce from a thin clay lens surrounded by sand during heating by erh gas saturations in the clay lens at the end of heating were estimated using changes in the bulk electrical conductivity of the clay and were found to be approximately 0 22 when heated at a constant electrical potential of 165 v for between one and three days and approximately 0 56 when heated at a constant electrical potential of 330 v for one day relative aqueous concentrations of tce in the clay lens decreased to c c 0 0 06 during heating which supports the conceptual model of istt efficacy under heterogeneous conditions importantly these results were obtained for thin 4 cm clay lenses surrounded by sand where water boiling and gas production in the sand provided a pathway for rapid removal of tce from the sand clay interface for thicker clay lenses and tce or other vocs present deeper into those lenses it is expected that removal would still be enhanced during heating but that removal would be limited by the longer diffusion path length through and out of the lens the extent of tce removal observed in these experiments was not explained by an increase in the aqueous tce diffusion coefficient alone estimates based on 1d diffusion from a uniformly heated clay lens subject to a zero boundary condition at the sand clay interface showed that diffusion through both the gas and water phases was required to match observations these diffusion based estimates support conclusions regarding the presence of a gas phase in the interior of the lens during heating depending on the model chosen to represent tortuosity during diffusion in clay gas saturations of 0 04 0 08 were required assuming diffusion through gas and water in parallel whereas gas saturations of 0 51 0 98 were required assuming diffusion through gas and water in series neither of these estimates were consistent with measured values which suggests that a connected gas pathway was created in the lens during heating but that not all of the gas produced was part of that pathway these results suggest that istt technologies may be effective in removing dissolved voc from thin clay lenses and that gas formation within the clay should be considered when predicting the extent and rate of removal consideration of only temperature effects on the effective diffusion coefficient will underestimate removal rates in these experiments gases were formed at temperatures where the water vapour pressure is much lower than the sum of the water pressure and entry pressure of the clay which is expected to be required for widespread gas production and connection within the lens further investigations are required regarding internal exsolution compared to external invasion drainage processes and their relationship to gas connectivity such considerations of gas enhanced diffusion may also be important for other remediation technologies capable of producing gas including in situ chemical oxidation

1369,the removal of dissolved volatile organic compounds vocs from low permeability lenses is important to limit back diffusion at sites impacted by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls in situ thermal treatment istt technologies have the potential to treat dnapl impacted sites by enhancing diffusion from low permeability lenses during heating a series of two dimensional laboratory tank experiments was conducted to investigate heating gas formation and trichloroethene tce removal from a clay lens surrounded by sand results showed preferential heating of the clay and substantial tce removal with post heating relative concentrations less than 0 06 the extent of tce removal was not explained by only an increase in the aqueous tce diffusion coefficient with increased temperature modelling estimates based on 1d diffusion from the lens showed that diffusion through both gas and water phases was required to match observations gas formation in the interior of the lens was also indicated by measured changes in bulk electrical conductivity of the clay during cool down with gas saturations estimated to be greater than 0 21 at the end of heating these estimates were larger than those needed to match the observed removal by diffusion and suggest that connected gas pathways were created in the lens during heating but that not all of the gas produced was part of those pathways these results suggest that istt technologies may be effective in removing dissolved vocs from thin clay lenses and that gas formation within the clay should be considered when predicting the extent and rate of removal 1 introduction the remediation of soil and groundwater at sites impacted by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls is challenging particularly at sites with heterogeneous geology these challenges change throughout the lifecycle of a dnapl source zone kueper et al 2014 during earlier periods challenges are often associated with the dnapl itself which is typically distributed in a complex architecture of residual and pools dictated by the geology release history and dnapl properties during later periods however challenges are often associated with the diffusion of dissolved volatile organic compounds vocs from lower permeability layers and lenses into higher permeability flow pathways chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 stroo et al 2012 tatti et al 2016 commonly referred to as back diffusion this process is the result of high voc concentrations present in higher permeability material early in the source zone lifecycle that diffuse into adjacent initially clean lower permeability layers the source of the vocs can be high concentration plumes or dnapl at the interface between the higher and lower permeability materials following the lowering of voc concentrations in the higher permeability material later in the lifecycle either through natural processes or the application of in situ remediation technologies diffusion of vocs from the lower to the higher permeability material then supplies vocs to dominant groundwater flow pathways in many cases this mass loading can sustain a dissolved plume that remains above regulatory limits despite the removal of substantial mass in the higher permeability material in the case of in situ remediation this leads to concentration rebound kueper et al 2014 it is critical that remediation strategies address the potential for back diffusion either through management of the diffusive flux by natural attenuation or by treatment of the vocs in the lower permeability layers this applies to back diffusion from clay aquitards as well as to back diffusion from clay lenses particularly at sites where the dnapl source and voc plumes do not extend down to an aquitard parker et al 2008 an example of interbedded sand and thin clay lenses is shown in fig 1 with clay lenses between 1 and 20 cm in thickness treatment of lower permeability layers is difficult particularly when using injection based in situ remediation technologies including in situ chemical oxidation isco in situ chemical reduction iscr and in situ bioremediation isb where substantial differences in permeability result in the bypassing of these layers by the injected fluid stroo et al 2012 without advection through lower permeability layers the removal of vocs is controlled by diffusion and any acceleration of that removal depends on increasing diffusion coefficients or increasing concentration gradients alternatively adoption of a flux reduction approach can be used to limit diffusive release by decreasing concentration gradients through the introduction of reagents or bacteria into the lens clifton et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2017 hnatko et al 2020 in situ thermal treatment istt technologies including electrical resistance heating erh and thermal conductive heating tch are an alternative to injection based in situ remediation technologies istt technologies are commonly used for the treatment of volatile and semi volatile dnapls stroo et al 2012 ding et al 2019 horst et al 2021 because electrical conductivity in the case of erh and thermal conductivity in the case of erh and tch vary less between geologic media than hydraulic conductivity istt technologies have been applied to source zones in both the saturated and unsaturated zones nilsson et al 2011 tzovolou et al 2011 janfada et al 2020 during istt an increase in subsurface temperature is expected to enhance voc removal from lower permeability layers by increasing diffusion coefficients which increase with increasing temperature in addition an increase in subsurface temperature to the boiling point or co boiling point in the presence of dnapl will create a gas phase during istt a gas phase will be produced by heterogeneous nucleation jones et al 1999 resulting in the formation of disconnected bubbles followed by their expansion and coalescence into a network of gas channels although bubble migration is also possible in coarse grained material satik and yortsos 1996 hegele and mumford 2014 the formation migration and removal of a gas phase is critical to the success of most istt applications in addition to removing vocs directly from the higher permeability regions this gas formation and voc removal will also enhance voc removal from the adjacent lower permeability layers by increasing the concentration gradient furthermore istt technologies have the potential to create gas within lower permeability layers further increasing the effective voc diffusion coefficient and potentially creating connected gas phase pathways within the lower permeability layers fig 2 for example laboratory experiments by martin et al 2017 showed that during erh of thin clay and sandy clay lenses surrounded by sand gas was produced predominantly at the high low sand clay permeability interface during heating but gas saturations of 0 09 to 0 38 were also produced in the interior of the lens the onset of gas connection and the formation of advective transport pathways in clay has also been studied in the context of nuclear waste repositories e g horseman et al 1999 ortiz et al 2002 with connected gas reported at gas saturations of approximately 0 04 to 0 27 graham et al 2002 gallé 2000 harrington and horseman 2003 despite their relative insensitivity to permeability istt technologies are not immune to the effects of heterogeneity for example higher groundwater flow rates in higher permeability zones can lead to lower heating rates and lower treatment temperatures baston and kueper 2009 lebron et al 2012 hegele and mcgee 2017 spatial differences in temperature lead to natural convection which is affected by hydraulic conductivity krol et al 2014 and lower permeability layers act as capillary barriers that control gas migration and can lead to poor gas capture and voc condensation munholland et al 2016 nevertheless most laboratory studies of istt have focused on homogeneous higher permeability material such as sands devoe and udell 1998 burghardt and kueper 2008 krol et al 2011 hegele and mumford 2014 zhao et al 2014 hicknell et al 2018 studies that have focused on lower permeability material have done so in homogeneous systems including silty soil heron et al 1998b fractured clay liu et al 2013 2014 and rock chen et al 2010 kluger and beyke 2010 studies that have incorporated heterogeneity have been focused on sands and have not investigated removal from lower permeability layers martin and kueper 2011 munholland et al 2016 or have investigated dnapl embedded in lower permeability layers rather than dissolved voc baker and hiester 2009 geng et al 2021 given the prevalence of heterogeneous sites treated by istt and the importance of voc removal from lower permeability layers to limit back diffusion at dnapl impacted sites there is a need to investigate voc removal during heating of lower permeability material surrounded by higher permeability material the objectives of this study were to i investigate voc removal from thin clay lenses surrounded by sand during in situ heating and ii assess the importance of gas formation in the lens on that removal a series of laboratory tank experiments was conducted in which an aqueous solution of trichloroethene tce was emplaced in a clay lens and that lens was heated by erh different levels of heating were used to create conditions at or below the boiling point of water and results were compared to analytical solutions of voc diffusion from the lens assuming diffusion through gas and water in parallel or in series representative of connected or disconnected gas distributions 2 material and methods 2 1 packing and lens emplacement experiments were conducted in a 76 2 40 6 15 cm outer dimensions laboratory tank made from 1 3 cm thick polycarbonate sheets supported by an external aluminum frame martin et al 2016 martin et al 2017 fig 3 gas produced during heating was vented through ports in the tank lid an array of 30 ungrounded thermocouples 10 2 cm length 0 32 cm diameter t type omega inc spaced 7 6 cm apart was installed through the back wall of the tank such that the tip of each thermocouple was midway between the front and back walls prior to packing the tank clay lenses were created by consolidating a slurry of refined kaolin clay powder speswhite imery s performance minerals in a 480 mg l tce solution the kaolin powder was selected because it had a low organic carbon content of 0 01 mg kg ferrarese and andreottola 2008 resulting in little tce sorption the slurry was pressurized using a pneumatic piston in a 40 cm tall 30 cm diameter vertical cylinder martin et al 2017 over a period of 14 days with pressure increased incrementally to a maximum of 400 kpa throughout consolidation the cylinder was tented using plastic sheeting to reduce tce loss by volatilization following consolidation the cylinder pressure was decreased in a stepwise fashion over a three day period to form a water saturated clay by avoiding cavitation that would be caused by a sudden pressure release and would create an entrapped gas phase the porosity of the consolidated clay was 0 55 0 06 determined by weighing known volume samples before and after drying section 2 4 the consolidated clay was cut into 24 8 22 cm blocks immediately sealed in plastic wrap and the outside coated in wax to reduce tce loss by volatilization and stored at 4 c until immediately before packing the tank was packed in three stages first an approximately 15 cm thick layer of 20 30 accusand agsco schroth et al 1996 was emplaced in the tank using a wet packing technique in which a slurry of sand and water was poured continuously into a partially water filled cell second a clay block was trimmed to create a 19 4 12 4 cm lens that was pressed into place on top of the sand careful attention was paid to match the width of the lens to the width of the tank to ensure no gap between the lens and the front and back tank walls samples of the block near the lens were collected during trimming and analyzed to determine the initial tce concentration in the lens third additional sand was wet packed to the top of the cell most thermocouples were installed prior to sand packing but those in the clay lens were pressed into the lens after emplacement 2 2 heating and temperature measurements the sand and clay were heated by erh using two pairs of cylindrical graphite rods 30 cm length 1 3 cm diameter mcmaster carr 9121k73 as electrodes connected to a 110 v ac 60 hz power outlet a variable autotransformer powerstat 3n116b statco energy products and a step up transformer capable of providing a maximum electric potential of 330 v temperature measured by each thermocouple was recorded during and after heating at 5 min intervals using a digital multimeter keithley instruments 2600b and multiplexer keithley instruments 7708 four experiments were conducted using different applied potentials adjusted using the variable autotransformer and different heating durations table 1 experiments 100 v 1d 165 v 1d and 330 v 1d were conducted to investigate the effects of different treatment temperatures on tce removal and gas formation over a one day heating period and experiment 165 v 3d was conducted to investigate tce removal over a three day heating period following the one or three day heating period each experiment was allowed to cool down to the pre heating temperature for a period of approximately one day 2 3 gas saturations measurements gas saturations in the clay lens at the end of heating in each experiment were estimated using the method presented by martin et al 2017 with the main power supply switched off a potential of 17 5 v was applied between the stainless steel sheaths of adjacent thermocouples in the lens using a separate autotransformer and the resulting electric current was measured fig 3b electric current measurements began after heating was stopped and continued until the temperature of the lens returned to the pre heating temperature assuming that the ratio of the current measured at any temperature t to that at the pre heating temperature t 0 is equal to the ratio of the electrical conductivities at t and t 0 and that there is no change to the porosity in the lens the gas saturation can be determined by waxman and smits 1968 martin et al 2017 1 σ σ 0 s w n 1 s w σ w b t q v σ w 0 b t 0 q v where σ σ 0 is the bulk electrical conductivity ratio s w is the water saturation in the lens n is the saturation exponent σ w and σ w0 are the electrical conductivities of water s m 1 at t and t 0 b t and b t0 m2 s v 1 are the equivalent counterion mobilities at t and t 0 and q v is the excess charge at the surface of the grains c m 3 assuming that the equivalent counterion mobility is proportional to the equivalent surface mobility the equivalent counterion mobility as a function of temperature is given by revil et al 1998 2 b t b m 1 ν s t t 0 where b m is the maximum counterion mobility ν s 0 04 c 1 revil et al 1998 and the electrical conductivity of water is estimated using arps s law butler and knight 1995 3 σ w σ w 0 t 21 5 t 0 21 5 where t and t 0 are expressed in c parameter values used in all gas saturation calculations are listed in table 2 and are consistent with those used previously martin et al 2017 2 4 soil sampling and tce analysis after heating and cool down the sand above the clay lens in each experiment was removed and core samples were collected from the lens by driving sections of steel pipe 4 cm length 1 5 cm diameter into the clay using a rubber mallet after removing the pipe the ends were sealed using ptfe wrapped stoppers and the clay filled pipe was stored at 4 c until analyzed for analysis which was conducted within 72 h of sample collection either one or two subsamples approximately 5 g were collected from each pipe corresponding to the middle bottom or top of the lens fig 3c pre emplacement initial samples were collected prior to packing using the same approach differences in initial concentrations were the result of different tenting approaches used during consolidation to limit volatile losses and storage of the lens between consolidation and packing tce was extracted from the subsamples using methanol and analyzed by gas chromatography agilent technologies 7890b with a flame ionization detector gc fid according to modified method 8260c usepa 2006 with a detection limit of 20 μg kg 2 5 modelling tce removal by diffusion removal of dissolved tce from a clay lens at high water saturation will be controlled by diffusion as described by fick s second law crank 1975 expressed in 1d as 4 c w t d e 2 c w z 2 where c w is the aqueous concentration of tce and d e is the total effective diffusion coefficient for tce where both gas and water are present in a porous medium the total effective diffusion coefficient is a function of the effective diffusion coefficients in both phases their relationship to mass flux is defined by 5 j i θ i τ i d i 2 c i z 2 where j i is the mass flux through phase i gas g or water w θ i is the gas or water filled porosity τ i is the tortuosity for phase i and d i is the diffusion coefficient in phase i in the absence of porous media free gas or free water it is important to note that tortuosity can also be defined to include porosity batterman et al 1996 multiple expressions are available to estimate tortuosity including in clay batterman et al 1996 lim et al 1998 reinecke and sleep 2002 wang et al 2003 chou et al 2012 in this study two expressions were chosen to encompass a range of tortuosity estimates and knudsen diffusion was not considered the first expression was the popular millington and quirk 1961 expression 6 τ i θ i 7 3 θ t 2 s i 7 3 θ t 1 3 where θ t is the total porosity and s i is the saturation of phase i θ i s i θ t and s g s w 1 several studies of diffusion in unsaturated porous media have identified discrepancies between measured values and predictions based on millington and quirk 1961 batterman et al 1996 wang et al 2003 chou et al 2012 including overestimated aqueous phase tortuosity values in laboratory experiments using clay chou et al 2012 the second expression for tortuosity was that proposed by chou 2010 7 τ i 0 02 θ i 1 2 θ t 3 2 0 02 s i 1 2 θ t although eqs 6 and 7 both predict a decrease in tortuosity with decreasing saturation fig 4a tortuosity values are higher at higher saturations and lower at lower saturations when estimated using millington and quirk 1961 rather than chou 2010 estimates of the total effective diffusion coefficient also depend on an assumption of gas phase connectivity that is whether diffusion through the gas and water phases occurs in parallel or in series for example in their study of voc diffusion across the capillary fringe mccarthy and johnson 1993 presented a governing equation equivalent to a total effective diffusion coefficient defined as 8 d e θ w τ w d w θ g τ g d g h θ w θ g h s w τ w d w s g τ g d g h s w s g h where h is the dimensionless henry s constant that describes the equilibrium partitioning of voc between the gas and water phases and sorption and advection are negligible eq 8 assumes that diffusion in the aqueous and gas phases occurs through separate parallel pathways defined by θ w and θ g similar expressions have been used to describe total effective diffusion in the context of vapour intrusion e g johnson and ettinger 1991 which are typically presented using gas concentrations rather than aqueous concentrations as an alternative klenk and grathwohl 2002 suggested that diffusion in series is more appropriate to describe effective diffusion in the presence of a trapped gas phase assuming that s w and s g serve as estimates for the fraction of the total path length in each phase and that the tortuosity τ at any point along that path can be estimated using the total porosity the effective diffusion coefficient is 9 d e τ s w d w s g d g h 1 eqs 8 and 9 predict different increases in d e with increasing s g with higher predictions for diffusion in parallel eq 8 fig 4b compared to for diffusion in series eq 9 fig 4c at intermediate saturations it is also important to recognize that eq 8 predicts d e as d g whereas eq 9 predicts d e τd w s w as d g in istt applications the total effective diffusion coefficient increases with increasing temperature as well as with increasing gas saturation which is expected to result in higher rates of voc removal by diffusion expressions presented by rossi et al 2015 and watts 1971 were used to estimate the free water and free gas diffusion coefficients respectively as functions of temperature 10 ln d w ln d w e a rt 11 log d g log d g ν log t where d w is the diffusion coefficient for infinite temperature 8 9 10 3 cm2 s r is the ideal gas constant e a is the activation energy for diffusion 4 1 kcal mol 1 d g and ν are constants 9 8 10 7 cm2 s and 1 8654 and t is absolute temperature k the diffusion coefficient of tce in air was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of tce in the gas phase of these experiments the effective diffusion coefficients estimated using eqs 8 and 9 are also affected by the temperature dependence of the henry s constant given by heron et al 1998a 12 ln h 195 52 12540 t 27 11 ln t assuming one dimensional diffusion through a thin 4 cm lens and complete removal of tce from the sand clay interface as would be expected during isst once a connected gas phase was produced in the sand fig 2b the solution to eq 4 is crank 1975 13 c w c w 0 4 π n 0 1 n 2 n 1 exp d e 2 n 1 n π 2 t 4 z 2 cos 2 n 1 πz 2 z where c

boundary condition is c w z t 0 and the domain is assumed to be symmetric about the centreline of the lens 3 results and discussion 3 1 heating and gas production temperatures measured in the clay lens and surrounding sand during the initial heating period and during cool down are shown in fig 5 differences in bulk electrical conductivity between the sand and clay affect heating and gas production during erh martin et al 2016 with the higher bulk electrical conductivity of the clay resulting in greater current density more power and faster heating of the lens a faster increase in temperature occurred in the clay than in the sand in all four experiments heating rates in both sand and clay also increased with increased applied electric potential with the 165 v 1d and 165 v 3d experiments showing good reproducibility the maximum temperatures exceeded 100 c in the clay lens and were at or near 100 c in the sand during most of the 165 v 1d 165 3d and 330 v 1d experiments this resulted in visible gas production in the sand which originated at the sand clay interface during each experiment the sand clay interface is the preferential gas production location because of preferential heating in the clay lens combined with lower capillary forces in the sand that facilitate gas expansion martin et al 2017 similar observations of first gas formation in more permeable zones was reported for simulations of heating in fractured rock where gas forms preferentially in fractures rather than the rock matrix chen et al 2015 this gas production is expected to allow the rapid removal of tce from the sand clay interface in contrast maximum temperatures during the 100 v 1d experiments were 45 c in the clay and 43 c in the sand no gas production was observed in the sand and no gas production is expected in the clay at these temperatures although gas production was not visible in the clay lens in experiments 165 v 1d 165 v 3d and 330 v 1d the presence of gas was inferred based on a measured bulk electrical conductivity ratio that was lower than expected under water saturated conditions eqs 1 3 the bulk electrical conductivity ratio measured during cool down in each experiment is shown in fig 6 along with estimates assuming constant water saturated conditions the data are presented with decreasing temperatures from left to right to be consistent with time increasing from left to right during cool down for constant water saturated conditions a decrease in temperature results in a monotonic decrease in bulk electrical conductivity controlled by the decrease in electrical conductivity of the pore water and the surface mobility of the counterions revil et al 1998 the measurements taken during cool down however show non monotonic changes with a bulk electrical conductivity ratio that was less than the water saturated prediction immediately after heating was stopped i e measured at the highest temperature in each experiment shown in fig 6 these measurements then increased toward the water saturated prediction at intermediate temperatures followed by a decrease this non monotonic behaviour is attributed to gas that was present the moment that heating was stopped thereby decreasing the bulk electrical conductivity the gas then collapsed as temperatures decreased with gas presence pore water electrical conductivity and surface mobility of the counterions having competing effects on the bulk electrical conductivity gas saturations in the lens were estimated at the start of the cool down period for each experiment and range from 0 21 0 06 and 0 22 0 06 in experiments 165 v 1d and 165 v 3d to 0 56 0 14 in experiment 330 v 1d table 3 the uncertainty in each estimate is based on calculations using a saturation exponent n of 2 5 to 4 table 2 these estimates indicate that gas was formed in the interior of the lens and that gas saturations may have been sufficient to form a connected gas channel network 3 2 tce removal tce concentrations in the lens declined significantly as a result of erh during experiments that reached water boiling temperature table 3 with higher final concentrations measured along the lens centerline than near the lens edges fig 7 final concentrations are expressed as relative concentrations to compare between experiments with different initial tce concentrations in the lens limited removal occurred in the 100 v 1d experiment in which no boiling occurred under these conditions the effective diffusion coefficient was marginally increased by a factor of 1 6 between 23 c and 45 c eq 10 but was not further increased by the presence of a gas phase in the clay lens in addition the lack of gas production in the sand would extend the diffusion path length beyond the edge of the lens resulting in transport in the sand toward the top of the cell that would also be controlled by diffusion some removal may have resulted from partitioning of tce to the polycarbonate walls of the tank but this is expected to be negligible compared to the observed removal at water boiling temperature in contrast substantial removal occurred in the 165 v 1d 165 v 3d and 330 v 1d experiments if the average concentrations listed in table 3 are assumed to be representative of concentrations throughout the lens this represents removals of approximately 95 this is likely an underestimate of the removal because lower concentrations likely existed nearer to the lens edges this increased removal during heating is attributed to both a shortening of the diffusion path length compared to the 100 v 1d experiment due to tce that is removed rapidly from the sand clay interface through a connected network of gas channels in the sand and to increased effective diffusion coefficients due to gas production within the lenses this enhanced removal was achieved in experiments 165 v 1d and 165 v 3d and included tce removal to below detection limits in experiment 330 v 1d substantial removal in experiment 330 v 1d is consistent with steam stripping and gas advection through higher saturation connected gas pathways as has been observed in previous studies of heating in low permeability material chen et al 2010 liu et al 2014 although the lenses investigated in this study were thin resulting in substantial tce removal in hours to days enhanced removal is also expected for thicker lenses resulting from heating and gas production in those lenses 3 3 modelling enhanced diffusion estimated diffusion profiles calculated using eqs 8 10 and 13 are shown in fig 7 for temperatures of 45 c and 100 c after one day of heating representative of a heated water saturated lens s w 1 s g 0 and a zero tce concentration at the sand clay interface assuming uniform water saturation and temperature throughout the lens and negligible sorption the ratio of soil concentrations is equal to the ratio of aqueous concentrations which allows the measured concentration ratio to be compared to the estimates using eq 13 the measured concentrations in the 100 v 1d experiment lie between the estimates using the millington and quirk 1961 and chou 2010 expressions for tortuosity at 45 c in contrast the measured concentrations in the 165 v 1d and 330 v 1d experiments are below the water saturated prediction at 100 c using either the millington and quirk 1961 or chou 2010 estimates this is despite the large uncertainty represented by the range between those two estimates and the likely over prediction of diffusion in clay at higher water saturations using the millington and quirk 1961 expression chou et al 2012 the difference between the water saturated estimates and the measured concentrations e g either c c 0 1 or c c 0 0 26 compared to c c 0 0 06 at the lens centerline represents the contribution of the gas phase to tce removal from the lens the 165 v 1d concentrations were fit using eq 10 13 along with all combinations of eqs 6 or 7 with eqs 8 or 9 representative of diffusion through gas and water in parallel or in series with tortuosity estimated using millington and quirk 1961 or chou 2010 the total effective diffusion coefficient required to fit the measured concentrations is greater than the water saturated estimate at 100 c by a factor of 2 0 2 9 10 9 m2 s compared to 5 9 10 9 m2 s and greater that the water saturated estimate at 23 c by a factor of 8 5 assuming water and gas diffusion in parallel eq 8 through connected gas pathways this requires a gas saturation of 0 08 using millington and quirk 1961 or 0 04 using chou 2010 tce removal through connected gas pathways may also have occurred by advection of gas out of the lens and steam stripping of dissolved tce near those pathways liu et al 2014 which would allow similar removal at lower gas saturations in contrast assuming water and gas diffusion in series as would be expected for only discontinuous trapped gas in the lens requires a gas saturation of 0 51 using millington and quirk 1961 or 0 98 using chou 2010 the assumption of one dimensional diffusion neglects removal from the lateral edges of the lens and may overestimate the gas saturations required to match the observed removal however any difference is expected to be less than the uncertainty associated with the choice of tortuosity model the gas saturations based on changes in bulk electrical conductivity for the 165 v 1d and 165 3d experiments table 3 lie between these diffusion based estimates that is gas production in the lens was not high enough for the observed removal to have occurred by diffusion through only disconnected trapped gas but the observed removal was lower than if all gas produced was connected therefore it is likely that only a portion of the gas produced during heating formed a connected pathway and that this connected pathway dominated removal 4 summary and conclusions a series of two dimensional laboratory tank experiments demonstrated enhanced removal of dissolved tce from a thin clay lens surrounded by sand during heating by erh gas saturations in the clay lens at the end of heating were estimated using changes in the bulk electrical conductivity of the clay and were found to be approximately 0 22 when heated at a constant electrical potential of 165 v for between one and three days and approximately 0 56 when heated at a constant electrical potential of 330 v for one day relative aqueous concentrations of tce in the clay lens decreased to c c 0 0 06 during heating which supports the conceptual model of istt efficacy under heterogeneous conditions importantly these results were obtained for thin 4 cm clay lenses surrounded by sand where water boiling and gas production in the sand provided a pathway for rapid removal of tce from the sand clay interface for thicker clay lenses and tce or other vocs present deeper into those lenses it is expected that removal would still be enhanced during heating but that removal would be limited by the longer diffusion path length through and out of the lens the extent of tce removal observed in these experiments was not explained by an increase in the aqueous tce diffusion coefficient alone estimates based on 1d diffusion from a uniformly heated clay lens subject to a zero boundary condition at the sand clay interface showed that diffusion through both the gas and water phases was required to match observations these diffusion based estimates support conclusions regarding the presence of a gas phase in the interior of the lens during heating depending on the model chosen to represent tortuosity during diffusion in clay gas saturations of 0 04 0 08 were required assuming diffusion through gas and water in parallel whereas gas saturations of 0 51 0 98 were required assuming diffusion through gas and water in series neither of these estimates were consistent with measured values which suggests that a connected gas pathway was created in the lens during heating but that not all of the gas produced was part of that pathway these results suggest that istt technologies may be effective in removing dissolved voc from thin clay lenses and that gas formation within the clay should be considered when predicting the extent and rate of removal consideration of only temperature effects on the effective diffusion coefficient will underestimate removal rates in these experiments gases were formed at temperatures where the water vapour pressure is much lower than the sum of the water pressure and entry pressure of the clay which is expected to be required for widespread gas production and connection within the lens further investigations are required regarding internal exsolution compared to external invasion drainage processes and their relationship to gas connectivity such considerations of gas enhanced diffusion may also be important for other remediation technologies capable of producing gas including in situ chemical oxidation
