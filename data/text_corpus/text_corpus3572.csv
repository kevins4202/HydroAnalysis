17860,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a promising configuration for capacitive deionization due to its capability of continuous operation and achieving a relatively large salinity reduction due to the complexity of the multi phase flow involved in fcdi modeling fcdi system performance has been a challenge with no predictive fcdi model thus far developed in this study we developed an equivalent film electrode efe model for fcdi in which the flow electrodes are approximated as moving film electrodes that behave in a manner similar to conveyor belts the efe fcdi model is validated using results from a series of fcdi experiments and then applied to elucidate the spatial variations of the key properties of the fcdi system and to resolve the contributions of different aspects of the system to energy consumption the impact of activated carbon loading in the flow electrode and the feed and effluent target concentrations on the overall fcdi performance are also discussed based on model simulation in summary the efe fcdi model enhances our understanding of the system level behavior of fcdi systems and can be employed for optimizing fcdi design and operation graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi also referred to as electrosorption is an emerging electrochemical desalination technology of particular current interest in view of its potential to become a competitive technology in certain desalination applications porada et al 2013a suss et al 2015 with carbonaceous electrodes cdi involves the removal of ions from the feed stream and storage of these ions in the electrode micropores when a voltage is applied with subsequent release of the stored ions into the brine stream when the electrodes are short circuited or a reverse voltage is applied farmer et al 1996 porada et al 2013b ji et al 2019 tang et al 2019a there are a variety of cdi cell configurations and operational modes porada et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 suss et al 2012 wang and lin 2018a tang et al 2019b among which flow electrode cdi fcdi has received extensive and growing interest zhang et al 2018 2019 2020 jeon et al 2013 he et al 2018a cho et al 2019 luo et al 2020 three major advantages of fcdi over other cdi configurations include i the ability of continuous operation jeon et al 2014 gendel et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2018a compared to cyclic operation in conventional cdi that is more difficult to control and optimize ii the possibility of achieving a high degree of salinity reduction jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2016 moreno and hatzell 2018 and iii extremely high flow efficiency 100 as it avoids the switch between the desalinated and brine streams in the flow channel rommerskirchen et al 2015 2018a hawks et al 2018a in fcdi flow electrodes comprising a slurry mixture of activated materials i e activated carbon ac conductive additives e g carbon black particles carbon nanotubes and redox couples and aqueous electrolyte are pumped through two electrode channels while the salty feed water flows through the spacer channel liang et al 2017 hatzell et al 2015 ma et al 2019 typically ion exchange membranes are employed to separate the electrode channels from the spacer channel there are two general modes in which fcdi may be operated namely the short circuited closed cycle scc operation and the isolated closed cycle icc operation jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2017 in icc mode the positively and negatively charged flow electrodes are isolated and recirculated between their respective electrode channels and electrode reservoirs similar to conventional cdi icc fcdi is an intermittent process as it requires that the flow electrodes be regenerated by applying a reverse voltage in contrast a continuous steady state fcdi operation can be achieved using scc operation in scc operation the flow electrodes are regenerated when the positively and negatively charged ac slurries exiting the fcdi cell are mixed together in a single reservoir fig 1 a the contact between these oppositely charged ac particles results in neutralization of the ac and release of the adsorbed ions to the electrolyte solution that becomes the brine recent advances in film electrode based cdi i e cdi systems using solid phase thin film electrodes can be attributed in part to the enhanced fundamental understanding that has accrued from the development of dynamic cdi models the ability to model the behavior of cdi systems is critical to understanding the impacts of system parameters and operating conditions on cdi performance and for optimizing cdi system design and operation wang and lin 2018a 2019 2018b wang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 models with different levels of fidelity have been developed for film electrode cdi hemmatifar et al 2015 biesheuvel et al 2011 he et al 2018b suss et al 2014 qin et al 2019 however very limited effort has been devoted to the modeling of fcdi the major challenge in modeling fcdi is the treatment of the dynamic percolation between ac particles in the complex multi phase flow electrode karzar jeddi et al 2019 which is dependent on ac loading and flow characteristics dennison et al 2014 the only fcdi model that has been reported is that by rommerskirchen et al where they discretized the fcdi cell in the flow direction and coupled ion transport with the modified donnan md model for description of the electrical double layer edl rommerskirchen et al 2018b however the use of the stern layer capacitance as a fitting parameter that varies in different operations is not only physically ungrounded but also undermines the predictive power of the model i e while this model can be used for fitting experimental data it cannot be used for predicting performance for example increasing ac loading in the flow electrode promotes more frequent collision of ac particles and thus enhances the conductivity of the flow electrode however this effect of increasing ac loading is incorrectly accounted for by changing the stern layer capacitance in contrast previous studies on fixed electrode cdi with ac film electrodes have revealed that the stern layer capacitance is dependent on the micropore charge density via the mechanism of electrostatic compression bazant et al 2005 grahame 1947 but not directly dependent on any other operating condition we demonstrate in this study that the system level behavior of fcdi can be approximately modelled by an equivalent cdi model of moving film electrodes without the need for considering the mechanistic details of inter particulate mass and charge transfer fig 1b specifically a flow electrode stream can be approximated as a film electrode with much larger macro pore volume and significantly reduced electrical conductivity such an equivalent film electrode efe moves in the direction of the flow in a manner similar to a conveyer belt following this approximation we develop a pseudo 1d model that describes the ion transport and the edl formation in the fcdi with appropriate treatment of the stern layer capacitance and the effect of ac loading this pseudo 1d equivalent film electrode efe model is validated using fcdi experiments in scc mode and is then employed to evaluate the fcdi performance over a wide range of operating conditions in addition the efe fcdi model developed here is used to describe the spatial distribution of the important properties in the fcdi cell and the breakdown of the energy losses in the system finally we employ the developed efe fcdi model to conduct an analysis of the performance tradeoff in fcdi 2 model development 2 1 system description in this section we present the governing equations of a pseudo 1d efe model that describes ion transport in the spacer channel and ion retention in the electrode channel both the spacer and the electrode channels are divided into n subcells connected in series each of which is assumed to be a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr the electrode channel consists of ac particles with intra particulate macropores and micropores the volume occupied by the electrolyte solution outside the ac particles is considered as a large extra particulate macropore in the efe fcdi model intra particulate and extra particulate macropores are not distinguished and have the same ion concentration based on existing film electrode cdi models micropores contribute to the majority of ion storage capacity while macropores serve as pathways for rapid ion transport 2 2 ion transport in a unit cell as the spacer channel is discretized into n sub cells in series the mass balance of salt in each cstr like subcell can be expressed as 1 p s p v c s p k t j s a l t k a q s p c s p k 1 c s p k where p s p is the spacer porosity v is the volume ml of the subcell c s p k is the spacer channel concentration mol ml 1 in subcell k j s a l t k is the salt flux mol cm 2 s 1 from the spacer channel toward the electrode channel in sub cell k same as the ion fluxes j i o n s k a is the effective contact area cm2 between the spacer and the electrode channels and q s p is the stream flowrate ml s 1 in the spacer channel the transport of ions across the respective iem is driven by the gradients of both electrical potential and concentration the flux mol cm 2 s 1 of ion species i j i o n s k i in sub cell k can be described by the nernst planck equation 2 j i o n s k i d m c m k i x z i c m k i φ m k x where d m is the diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 in the iem d m is ion specific in principle but in this model we use the mean diffusion coefficient of the salt c m k i is the concentration mol ml 1 of i in the iem of subcell k and φ m k is the dimensionless electrical potential in the iem of subcell k due to the requirement for local electro neutrality in the membrane the following equation applies 3 c m k c m k ω x 0 where c m k and c m k are concentrations mol ml 1 of cation and anion in the iem of subcell k respectively x is the intrinsic charge density mol ml 1 of iem and ω is the sign of the charge i e 1 for cation exchange membrane cem and 1 for anion exchange membrane aem considering both cation and anion fluxes by adding equations 2 and 3 with the simplifying assumption of linear gradients for concentration and electrical potential across the iem we arrive at the following equation 4 j i o n s k d m l m δ c m k ω x δ φ m k where l m is the thickness of the membrane cm and δ c m k is the difference in total ion concentrations i e c m k c m k c m k unit mol ml 1 between the two edges of the iem here the edge refers to the iem phase that is next to the interface in other words δ c m k c m e l e c k c m s p k with c m e l e c k being the iem phase total ion concentration mol ml 1 next to the interfaces between the iem and the electrode channel of subcell k and c m s p k being the iem phase total ion concentration mol ml 1 at the interfaces between the iem and the spacer channel of subcell k the iem phase concentrations near the interface are related to the solution concentrations near the interface in a manner reasonably described by the following expressions 5 c m e l e c k 2 c m a j cosh δ φ m e k 6 c m s p k 2 c s p j cosh δ φ m s p k where c m a k and c s p k are macropore and spacer concentrations mol ml 1 in subcell k and δ φ m e k and δ φ m s p k are the donnan potentials across the electrode iem and spacer iem interfaces in sub cell k respectively the current density a cm 2 of subcell k i k depends on the electrical potential difference across the spacer channel and the spacer salt concentration 7 i k 2 d c s p k δ φ h f s p k l s p 2 f where d is the bulk diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 of the charged ions we use the mean diffusion coefficient of the salt here δ φ h f s p k is the dimensionless potential drop of half of the spacer channel of subcell k l s p 2 is half of the spacer thickness cm and f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol 1 eq 7 assumes that the suspension in the spacer volume in subcell k is completely mixed and thus has no concentration gradient because the current density in the spacer equals that in the iem it can be quantified as shown in eq 8 8 i k d m c m k δ φ m k l m f where c m k is the average ion concentration mol ml 1 in the iem in subcell k 2 3 ion partitioning between micropores and macropores upon charging electrical double layers edls overlap substantially inside the micropores of the ac which renders the modified donnan md approximation applicable for describing the ion distribution between micropores and macropores in each subcell biesheuvel et al 2011 the md model assumes a constant potential inside the micropore and thus a single potential difference between the micro and macro pores i e the dimensionless donnan potential in subcell k δ φ d k the ratio of the concentration mol ml 1 of a specific ion i in the micropore c m i k i and the concentration mol ml 1 of the same ion in the macropore c m a k is governed by δ φ d k via the boltzmann distribution 9 c m i k i c m a k exp z i δ φ d k where z i is the valence of ion i in the subcell k of the electrode the volumetric charge density in the micropores σ m i k mol ml 1 rises as a result of the concentration difference between counter ions and co ions 10 σ m i k i 1 n z i c m i k i for simplicity in this study we only consider a single solute of 1 1 electrolyte e g nacl in which case eq 10 becomes 11 σ m i k 2 c m a k sinh δ φ d k at the same time σ m i k is also related to the dimensionless stern layer potential difference δ φ s t k and the volumetric stern layer capacitance in the micropore c s t v o l k unit f ml 1 12 σ m i k f c s t v o l k δ φ s t k v t where v t is the thermal voltage that converts the dimensionless voltage to the unit of volt 25 6 mv at 298 k it has been shown that the volumetric stern layer capacitance increases with charge density due to electrostatic compression bazant et al 2005 grahame 1947 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 this relationship be can approximated using the following empirical expression 13 c s t v o l k c s t v o l 0 α σ m i k 2 where α is an empirical coefficient f ml 1 mol2 and c s t v o l 0 is the volumetric stern layer capacitance when the micropore charge density is zero 2 4 electrode channel modelling the flow electrode consists of ac particles cb particles and the electrolyte compared with film electrodes the flow electrode has a much smaller volume fraction of micropores and thus a much smaller microporosity due to the low weight to volume fraction of ac particles in addition as opposed to a film electrode the electrical conductivity of the flow electrode channel results from the conductivity of both ac particles and the electrolyte with the contribution of the electrolyte dependent on the electrolyte salinity we propose an empirical expression to estimate the overall conductivity of the flow electrode in a subcell with this expression accounting for the conductivity of pure ac ρ a c and the mass fraction of carbon w t dimensionless the overall conductivity ρ e l e c unit s cm 1 of the electrode channel is expressed as 14 ρ e l e c λ s c m a 1 w t ρ a c w t γ where λ s is the molar conductivity s cm2 mol 1 of the solution and γ is an empirical coefficient that is independent of operating conditions because the flowrate of the flow electrode slurry is large in this study we ignore the influence of the slurry flowrate in the present model with lower slurry flowrates however less frequent collisions between ac particles may also lead to lower overall conductivity combining the potential drop across the stern layer and the donnan potential we can rewrite the overall potential drop in the electrode channel as follows 15 v e l e c k 2 v t δ φ d k δ φ s t k 2 i k l e l e c ρ e l e c k the total voltage across the unit cell is the summation of all the voltage drops assuming the cell is symmetric the total voltage can be represented as 16 v t o t a l k 2 v t δ φ h f s p k δ φ m s p k δ φ m k δ φ m e k 2 v e l e c k i k e s r where e s r is the specific equivalent series resistance ω cm2 including the resistances that occur in between the current collector and the flow electrode and that in the electrical circuit note that in simulating the fcdi process under steady state the cell voltage in every unit cell is the same and equal to the overall cell voltage however the current density varies with unit cell of which the mean is the overall current density for each subcell k of the flow electrode channel c m a k and c m i k are related to the ion flux j i o n s k by the following equation similar to eq 1 17 t 2 p m a c m a k p m i c m i k j i o n s k l e l e c 2 p m a c m a k c m a k 1 p m i c m i k c m i k 1 τ e l e c n where τ e l e c is the total hydraulic resistance time hrt unit s of carbon slurry in the electrode channel which is divided by n to give the hrt in each subcell the system of differential and algebraic equations in the model were solved numerically with matlab 3 experimental methods 3 1 experimental setup the fcdi module used in this study has been described previously he et al 2018a briefly the module consists of two electrode channels separated from the central spacer channel by an aem and a cem aem type ii cem type ii fujifilm europe respectively the dry ac powder in the flow electrode is made from 90 wt darco ac and 10 wt norit ac both are purchased from sigma aldrich the details of the ac properties are summarized in table s2 during the operation the positively and negatively charged electrode slurries exiting the fcdi module are mixed in a stirred tank where oppositely charged ac particles contact each other to become neutral and the ions adsorbed inside the fcdi module are released the electrode slurries are pumped through the serpentine channels carved in an acrylic plate the channels have a dimension of 2 d 2 w mm 570 l mm the effective contact area between the serpentine channels and the iem is 11 9 cm2 while the contact area between the current collector and the iem is equal to 22 0 cm2 the details of the fcdi cell are shown in supplementary information fig s2 3 the feedwater is pumped through the spacer channel for ion removal with the effluent salinity measured continuously using an inline conductivity meter 3 2 experimental conditions the flow electrode was prepared by mixing milli q water 18 2 mω cm with different weight percentages of ac powder 2 5 and 10 wt the flow electrode was charged by a dc power supply with different current densities 8 4 16 8 25 2 and 33 6 a m 2 the influence of hrt 0 47 0 69 0 91 and 1 40 min on the fcdi performance was investigated by changing the flowrate of feed water running through the spacer channel 3 3 performance evaluation the cell voltage current and conductivity were recorded using corresponding probes vernier software technology beaverton or usa connected to a sensordaq the specific energy consumption sec can be defined as the energy consumped per unit volume of the product water i e sec w 18 s e c w a i v q or per amount of salt removed i e sec i 19 s e c i a i v q c 0 c d where v is the cell voltage i is the current density a is the effective area q is the feed flowrate in the spacer channel and c 0 and c d are the concentrations of the feed i e the influent and deionized water i e the effluent stream respectively because electro sorption and electrodialysis both occur in an fcdi process the quantification of desalination rate is based on average salt removal rate a s r r instead of the average salt adsorption rate asar as used in a cdi system based on film electrodes nativ et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the definition of asrr is the amount of salt removed per area of iem in a unit time 20 a s r r q c 0 c d a sec and asrr values for both experimental data and simulation results were obtained using eqs 18 20 with comparison of these values used to evaluate the fcdi performance over a range of experimental conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results and model validation a series of fcdi experiments with various operational conditions were conducted to validate the proposed model by fitting the data for effluent concentration and cell voltage current as a function of time a value of n 8 is used in this study with a larger number of subcells found to provide little improvement in model fit to the experimental data the only fitting parameters used were the coefficient γ in eq 14 and the specific equivalent series resistance r e s r in eq 16 which were adjusted to obtain a good fit of the experimentally measured effluent concentration and average current density the values of the ac properties such as c s t v o l 0 and α in eq 13 are reported in the literature wang and lin 2018b qu et al 2018 dykstra et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 we note that γ and e s r are the only two properties of the fcdi system and these parameters do not depend on operating conditions therefore the same γ and e s r apply to all scenarios with different operating conditions presented in this study consequently the fcdi model that is developed here with the fitted γ and e s r can be used for predicting performance at different operating conditions experimentally the effect of changes in three operating parameters including current density hydraulic residence time hrt and carbon content were examined in total four values of current density four values of spacer channel hrt and three values of carbon loading were studied the effluent concentrations and cell voltages at various current densities are presented in fig 2 although scc fcdi is usually considered a steady state process the start up of an fcdi system is still dynamic the presence of the iems however enables an fcdi system to reach a steady state effluent concentration in a relatively short time with the effluent concentration similar to that achieved in membrane cdi mcdi increasing the current density for the same hrt results in a decrease in the effluent concentration fig 2a at relatively high current density 33 6 a m 2 salt rejection as high as 92 was achieved during the start up stage the cell voltage rose sharply to a stable level unlike the case of film electrode cdi in which cell voltage continuously rises over time when the cell is charged at constant current the cell voltage in scc fcdi remains stable fig 2b because the exhausted ac particles continue to be regenerated outside the fcdi cell overall the results from the efe fcdi model are in excellent agreement with the experimental data of the steady state effluent concentrations with this agreement demonstrating the capability of the efe fcdi model in predicting the performance of fcdi over a range of operating conditions additional fittings of experimental data with the edf fcdi model are provided in the supporting information fig s1 cdi processes based on film electrodes are dynamic i e there are always certain key system parameters that vary temporally for example when charging a cdi process at constant voltage cv the current density and effluent salinity both change over time due to the temporal variation in the driving force for ion transport alternatively when charging a cdi process at constant current cc the cell voltage has to rise over time to offset the build up of stern and donnan potentials in the edl so that a constant driving force for ion transport can be maintained in contrast there is no temporal variation of parameters in a fcdi process except for the short start up stage even though the same build up of stern and donnan potentials in the edl of the ac still occur as ac particles flow along the electrode channel and accumulate additional ions in their micropores in essence the constant movement of the electrodes converts the temporal variations of the system to spatial variations the spatial variations of various system properties are illustrated in fig 3 these properties include the volumetric micropore charge density σ m i fig 3a the current density fig 3b the salt concentration in the spacer channel and the solution phase of the flow electrode channel fig 3c and the stern and donnan potentials fig 3d cdi systems with film electrodes are typically charged using cc or cv mode the reason for specifying what should be constant is precisely because not all properties can remain temporally constant specifically as charging proceeds the current diminishes in cv mode while the cell voltage rises in cc mode for fcdi with a single pair of current collectors however everything is temporally constant and there is only one cell voltage for the fcdi system as a whole on the other hand the current density varies spatially along the water flow direction as the water is desalinated fig 3b therefore referring to an fcdi operation as cc or cv is not meaningful as fcdi always possesses both characteristics however if we follow a thin slab of ac slurry in the flow electrode channel that flowing portion of the electrode has the characteristic of cv charging as the corresponding current density decreases over time temporally and along the electrode channel spatially fig 3b to futher illustrate that an fcdi cell has both cc and cv characteristics we simulate the distribution of potential drops in different components at different positions of the fcdi module fig 4 in a typical efe fcdi model these potential drops should include seven components including the stern potential in the micropores the donnan potential between the micropores and macropores the potential drop in the flow electrode chamber electrode the potential drop across the iems membrane the sum of the donnan potential drops across the two interfaces of the iems mem donnan the potential drop across the spatial channel spacer and the potential drop due to the series resistance ma et al 2018 however the results from our simulation suggest that the stern potential in the micropores and the donnan potential between the micropores and macropores are both negligible compared to other contributions fig 3d as such these potentials are not included in fig 4 because there can only be one potential for a current collector the cell voltage is also spatially independent therefore the sum of the all potential drops across the two current collectors is also spatially constant 1 8 v in this case however the individual contributions to the overall potential drop vary along the module as more charge is transferred top axis in fig 4 and more salts are removed from the feed stream specifically the potential drop across the iems and the potential drop due to series resistance both decrease as the local current density decreases along the feed stream flow in addition the decrease in salt concentration in the spacer channel and increase in the flow electrode channel results in changes in the electrical resistance and thus the potential drop in the respective channels fig 4 4 2 performance evaluation of fcdi the effects of operating conditions on the fcdi performance metrics were investigated over a wide range of operating conditions using both experimental and modeling approaches we first investigated the impact of current density on the average salt removal rate asrr and specifc energy consumption sec as the current density increases from 8 4 to 33 6 a cm 2 asrr increases linearly from 5 0 to 20 9 mmol cm 2 min 1 fig 5 a notably the asrr of fcdi is higher than the average salt adsorption rate in most mcdi processes usually lower than 10 mmol cm 2 min 1 increasing current density also results in greater energy consumption specifically sec increases linearly from 0 06 to 0 28 j μmol 1 when the current density quadrupled from 8 4 to 33 6 a cm 2 fig 5a these results reflect the intrinsic tradeoff between desalination rate and energy efficiency as discussed in several recent papers wang and lin 2019 2018b wang et al 2019 hawks et al 2018b hemmatifar et al 2018 we also note that results from the numerical simulation are in remarkably good agreement with the experimental results with a fixed current density increasing hrt results in a reduction in effluent salinity and an increase in salt rejection however hrt has a negligible impact on the desalination rate fig 5b which is unsurprising because asrr is roughly proportional to current density as long as charge efficiency remains similar in comparison the energy consumption is slightly more sensitive to hrt with sec increasing from 0 10 to 0 16 j μmol 1 when hrt increases from 0 47 to 1 4 min fig 5b sec increases mainly because a longer hrt results in greater reduction of the feed salinity and thus a lower average feed salinity which in turn leads to a higher average feed channel resistance and a higher overall cell resistance a distinct characteristic of fcdi as opposed to conventional cdi with film electrodes is that the carbon content of the electrode is adjustable increasing the ac loading from 2 to 10 results in a significant reduction in sec from 0 35 to 0 10 j μmol 1 fig 5c this improvement in energy efficiency is attributable to the increase of overall conductivity of the flow electrode channel as the charge transfer is enhanced as more frequent collisions between ac particles occur at higher ac loading however the increase of ac loading also comes with the practical disadvantage that circulating the ac slurry in the electrode channel becomes more challenging i e larger pressure drop and more prone to clogging as the viscosity increases with ac loading while this practical challenge is not specifically investigated in the current study the caveats of increasing the carbon content of the flow electrode should not be overlooked in practical system design on the other hand increasing the carbon content does not affect the asrr if the current density is maintained the same from all three series of experiments it is clear that while sec may depend on operational and system parameters in different ways the desalination rate is only a function of current density 4 3 performance tradeoff in fcdi recent studies have identified the importance of quantifying the intrinsic tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate for desalination systems wang and lin 2018b hawks et al 2018b liu and smith 2018 lin and elimelech 2017 specifically the performance tradeoff curve in this case relating the sec and asrr can serve as a useful tool for systematic comparison between operations and for technoeconomic analysis of fcdi here we construct the performance tradeoff curves using the experimentally validated efe fcdi model to elucidate the impacts of operating conditions on the overall system performance the performance tradeoff curves were simulated by simultaneously varying the applied voltage and the flowrate of the feed stream so that an identical effluent concentration is achieved for every point in a performance tradeoff curve fig 6 a we use the experimentally validated efe fcdi model to simulate performance tradeoff curves for fcdi systems with different carbon contents in the flow electrode fig 6b feed concentrations fig 6c and e and diluted effluent concentrations fig 6d and f the fcdi performance is quantified by performance tradeoff curves that relate the inverse of sec w or sec i and asrr which quantify the kinetic and energetic efficiencies respectively as a rule of thumb a performance tradeoff curve that is in the upper right position of a sec w 1 or sec i 1 vs asrr plot is preferred in general increasing the carbon content leads to kinetically and energetically more favorable fcdi operation fig 6b mainly due to increased electrical conductivity the positive impact of increasing the carbon content is particularly salient when the carbon conent is low for instance increasing the carbon content from 5 to 10 dramatically enhances sec w 1 however further increasing the carbon content from 10 to 15 by the same increment of 5 has a considerably smaller effect in further enhancing the energetic and kinetic efficiencies the dwindling impact of increasing carbon content when the carbon content is releatively high can be explained by the inverse relationship between electrical resistance and electrical conductivity i e increasing the electrical conductivity has a much stronger effect in reducing the electrical resistance when the electrical conductivity is low compared to the effect when it is high a flow electrode with high carbon content becomes more viscous and prone to clogging which increases the pumping energy for circulation not considered in this analysis and renders practical fcdi operation considerably more challenging considering the significant detrimental impacts on operation and diminishing return on reducing flow channel resistance of increasing carbon content the carbon content in the flow electrode should be limited to a certain level increasing the feed concentration fig 6c or reducing the effluent concentration fig 6d leads to less favorable performance as indicated by up right shift of the performance tradeoff curves sec w 1 vs asrr however this is unsurprising because in either case more salts are removed from the feed water which should supposedly result in high energy consumption per volume of the treated water when we normalize the energy by the amount of salt removed instead of the volume of water treated the new performance tradeoff curves sec i 1 vs asrr suggest that changing either the feed or the effluent concentration has minmal impact on the system performance fig 6e and f in theory a feed stream with a lower salinity has a higher electrical resistance which consequently results in compromised performance this effect is more salient with reduced effluent concentration than with reduced feed concentration because resistance is roughly inversely proportional to salinity and the impact of salinity is thus stronger in the low salinity range indeed compared to a nearly unobservable impact of feed concentration on performance fig 6e the impact of effluent concentration is more obvious fig 6f however neither impact is significant because the spacer channel resistance only has a small contribution to the overall resistance according to the breakdown shown in fig 4 5 conclusions and implications while the microscopic behavior of the flow electrodes in fcdi is very complex and requires multi phase hydrodynamic modeling for full elucidation we have demonstrated in this work that the system level behavior of fcdi can be satisfactorily described using an equivalent film electrode efe model where the flow electrode is simply treated as a moving film electrode not only does the efe model yield a very good description of the experimental data it can also be employed for performance prediction because the model does not have any operation specific fitting parameters as such the efe fcdi model can be employed for designing and optimizing fcdi systems it can also be used for theoretical investigation to enhance our fundamental understanding of fcdi because it enables the analysis of the spatial distribution of the important properties in the fcdi cell and the breakdown of energy loss in different parts of the system our analysis based on performance tradeoff curves simulated using the efe fcdi model suggests that ac content in the flow electrode channel has the largest impact on system performance evaluated based on energy consumption per ion removed whereas both the feed salinity and the target effluent salinity have negligible impact declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17860,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a promising configuration for capacitive deionization due to its capability of continuous operation and achieving a relatively large salinity reduction due to the complexity of the multi phase flow involved in fcdi modeling fcdi system performance has been a challenge with no predictive fcdi model thus far developed in this study we developed an equivalent film electrode efe model for fcdi in which the flow electrodes are approximated as moving film electrodes that behave in a manner similar to conveyor belts the efe fcdi model is validated using results from a series of fcdi experiments and then applied to elucidate the spatial variations of the key properties of the fcdi system and to resolve the contributions of different aspects of the system to energy consumption the impact of activated carbon loading in the flow electrode and the feed and effluent target concentrations on the overall fcdi performance are also discussed based on model simulation in summary the efe fcdi model enhances our understanding of the system level behavior of fcdi systems and can be employed for optimizing fcdi design and operation graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi also referred to as electrosorption is an emerging electrochemical desalination technology of particular current interest in view of its potential to become a competitive technology in certain desalination applications porada et al 2013a suss et al 2015 with carbonaceous electrodes cdi involves the removal of ions from the feed stream and storage of these ions in the electrode micropores when a voltage is applied with subsequent release of the stored ions into the brine stream when the electrodes are short circuited or a reverse voltage is applied farmer et al 1996 porada et al 2013b ji et al 2019 tang et al 2019a there are a variety of cdi cell configurations and operational modes porada et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 suss et al 2012 wang and lin 2018a tang et al 2019b among which flow electrode cdi fcdi has received extensive and growing interest zhang et al 2018 2019 2020 jeon et al 2013 he et al 2018a cho et al 2019 luo et al 2020 three major advantages of fcdi over other cdi configurations include i the ability of continuous operation jeon et al 2014 gendel et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2018a compared to cyclic operation in conventional cdi that is more difficult to control and optimize ii the possibility of achieving a high degree of salinity reduction jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2016 moreno and hatzell 2018 and iii extremely high flow efficiency 100 as it avoids the switch between the desalinated and brine streams in the flow channel rommerskirchen et al 2015 2018a hawks et al 2018a in fcdi flow electrodes comprising a slurry mixture of activated materials i e activated carbon ac conductive additives e g carbon black particles carbon nanotubes and redox couples and aqueous electrolyte are pumped through two electrode channels while the salty feed water flows through the spacer channel liang et al 2017 hatzell et al 2015 ma et al 2019 typically ion exchange membranes are employed to separate the electrode channels from the spacer channel there are two general modes in which fcdi may be operated namely the short circuited closed cycle scc operation and the isolated closed cycle icc operation jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2017 in icc mode the positively and negatively charged flow electrodes are isolated and recirculated between their respective electrode channels and electrode reservoirs similar to conventional cdi icc fcdi is an intermittent process as it requires that the flow electrodes be regenerated by applying a reverse voltage in contrast a continuous steady state fcdi operation can be achieved using scc operation in scc operation the flow electrodes are regenerated when the positively and negatively charged ac slurries exiting the fcdi cell are mixed together in a single reservoir fig 1 a the contact between these oppositely charged ac particles results in neutralization of the ac and release of the adsorbed ions to the electrolyte solution that becomes the brine recent advances in film electrode based cdi i e cdi systems using solid phase thin film electrodes can be attributed in part to the enhanced fundamental understanding that has accrued from the development of dynamic cdi models the ability to model the behavior of cdi systems is critical to understanding the impacts of system parameters and operating conditions on cdi performance and for optimizing cdi system design and operation wang and lin 2018a 2019 2018b wang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 models with different levels of fidelity have been developed for film electrode cdi hemmatifar et al 2015 biesheuvel et al 2011 he et al 2018b suss et al 2014 qin et al 2019 however very limited effort has been devoted to the modeling of fcdi the major challenge in modeling fcdi is the treatment of the dynamic percolation between ac particles in the complex multi phase flow electrode karzar jeddi et al 2019 which is dependent on ac loading and flow characteristics dennison et al 2014 the only fcdi model that has been reported is that by rommerskirchen et al where they discretized the fcdi cell in the flow direction and coupled ion transport with the modified donnan md model for description of the electrical double layer edl rommerskirchen et al 2018b however the use of the stern layer capacitance as a fitting parameter that varies in different operations is not only physically ungrounded but also undermines the predictive power of the model i e while this model can be used for fitting experimental data it cannot be used for predicting performance for example increasing ac loading in the flow electrode promotes more frequent collision of ac particles and thus enhances the conductivity of the flow electrode however this effect of increasing ac loading is incorrectly accounted for by changing the stern layer capacitance in contrast previous studies on fixed electrode cdi with ac film electrodes have revealed that the stern layer capacitance is dependent on the micropore charge density via the mechanism of electrostatic compression bazant et al 2005 grahame 1947 but not directly dependent on any other operating condition we demonstrate in this study that the system level behavior of fcdi can be approximately modelled by an equivalent cdi model of moving film electrodes without the need for considering the mechanistic details of inter particulate mass and charge transfer fig 1b specifically a flow electrode stream can be approximated as a film electrode with much larger macro pore volume and significantly reduced electrical conductivity such an equivalent film electrode efe moves in the direction of the flow in a manner similar to a conveyer belt following this approximation we develop a pseudo 1d model that describes the ion transport and the edl formation in the fcdi with appropriate treatment of the stern layer capacitance and the effect of ac loading this pseudo 1d equivalent film electrode efe model is validated using fcdi experiments in scc mode and is then employed to evaluate the fcdi performance over a wide range of operating conditions in addition the efe fcdi model developed here is used to describe the spatial distribution of the important properties in the fcdi cell and the breakdown of the energy losses in the system finally we employ the developed efe fcdi model to conduct an analysis of the performance tradeoff in fcdi 2 model development 2 1 system description in this section we present the governing equations of a pseudo 1d efe model that describes ion transport in the spacer channel and ion retention in the electrode channel both the spacer and the electrode channels are divided into n subcells connected in series each of which is assumed to be a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr the electrode channel consists of ac particles with intra particulate macropores and micropores the volume occupied by the electrolyte solution outside the ac particles is considered as a large extra particulate macropore in the efe fcdi model intra particulate and extra particulate macropores are not distinguished and have the same ion concentration based on existing film electrode cdi models micropores contribute to the majority of ion storage capacity while macropores serve as pathways for rapid ion transport 2 2 ion transport in a unit cell as the spacer channel is discretized into n sub cells in series the mass balance of salt in each cstr like subcell can be expressed as 1 p s p v c s p k t j s a l t k a q s p c s p k 1 c s p k where p s p is the spacer porosity v is the volume ml of the subcell c s p k is the spacer channel concentration mol ml 1 in subcell k j s a l t k is the salt flux mol cm 2 s 1 from the spacer channel toward the electrode channel in sub cell k same as the ion fluxes j i o n s k a is the effective contact area cm2 between the spacer and the electrode channels and q s p is the stream flowrate ml s 1 in the spacer channel the transport of ions across the respective iem is driven by the gradients of both electrical potential and concentration the flux mol cm 2 s 1 of ion species i j i o n s k i in sub cell k can be described by the nernst planck equation 2 j i o n s k i d m c m k i x z i c m k i φ m k x where d m is the diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 in the iem d m is ion specific in principle but in this model we use the mean diffusion coefficient of the salt c m k i is the concentration mol ml 1 of i in the iem of subcell k and φ m k is the dimensionless electrical potential in the iem of subcell k due to the requirement for local electro neutrality in the membrane the following equation applies 3 c m k c m k ω x 0 where c m k and c m k are concentrations mol ml 1 of cation and anion in the iem of subcell k respectively x is the intrinsic charge density mol ml 1 of iem and ω is the sign of the charge i e 1 for cation exchange membrane cem and 1 for anion exchange membrane aem considering both cation and anion fluxes by adding equations 2 and 3 with the simplifying assumption of linear gradients for concentration and electrical potential across the iem we arrive at the following equation 4 j i o n s k d m l m δ c m k ω x δ φ m k where l m is the thickness of the membrane cm and δ c m k is the difference in total ion concentrations i e c m k c m k c m k unit mol ml 1 between the two edges of the iem here the edge refers to the iem phase that is next to the interface in other words δ c m k c m e l e c k c m s p k with c m e l e c k being the iem phase total ion concentration mol ml 1 next to the interfaces between the iem and the electrode channel of subcell k and c m s p k being the iem phase total ion concentration mol ml 1 at the interfaces between the iem and the spacer channel of subcell k the iem phase concentrations near the interface are related to the solution concentrations near the interface in a manner reasonably described by the following expressions 5 c m e l e c k 2 c m a j cosh δ φ m e k 6 c m s p k 2 c s p j cosh δ φ m s p k where c m a k and c s p k are macropore and spacer concentrations mol ml 1 in subcell k and δ φ m e k and δ φ m s p k are the donnan potentials across the electrode iem and spacer iem interfaces in sub cell k respectively the current density a cm 2 of subcell k i k depends on the electrical potential difference across the spacer channel and the spacer salt concentration 7 i k 2 d c s p k δ φ h f s p k l s p 2 f where d is the bulk diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 of the charged ions we use the mean diffusion coefficient of the salt here δ φ h f s p k is the dimensionless potential drop of half of the spacer channel of subcell k l s p 2 is half of the spacer thickness cm and f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol 1 eq 7 assumes that the suspension in the spacer volume in subcell k is completely mixed and thus has no concentration gradient because the current density in the spacer equals that in the iem it can be quantified as shown in eq 8 8 i k d m c m k δ φ m k l m f where c m k is the average ion concentration mol ml 1 in the iem in subcell k 2 3 ion partitioning between micropores and macropores upon charging electrical double layers edls overlap substantially inside the micropores of the ac which renders the modified donnan md approximation applicable for describing the ion distribution between micropores and macropores in each subcell biesheuvel et al 2011 the md model assumes a constant potential inside the micropore and thus a single potential difference between the micro and macro pores i e the dimensionless donnan potential in subcell k δ φ d k the ratio of the concentration mol ml 1 of a specific ion i in the micropore c m i k i and the concentration mol ml 1 of the same ion in the macropore c m a k is governed by δ φ d k via the boltzmann distribution 9 c m i k i c m a k exp z i δ φ d k where z i is the valence of ion i in the subcell k of the electrode the volumetric charge density in the micropores σ m i k mol ml 1 rises as a result of the concentration difference between counter ions and co ions 10 σ m i k i 1 n z i c m i k i for simplicity in this study we only consider a single solute of 1 1 electrolyte e g nacl in which case eq 10 becomes 11 σ m i k 2 c m a k sinh δ φ d k at the same time σ m i k is also related to the dimensionless stern layer potential difference δ φ s t k and the volumetric stern layer capacitance in the micropore c s t v o l k unit f ml 1 12 σ m i k f c s t v o l k δ φ s t k v t where v t is the thermal voltage that converts the dimensionless voltage to the unit of volt 25 6 mv at 298 k it has been shown that the volumetric stern layer capacitance increases with charge density due to electrostatic compression bazant et al 2005 grahame 1947 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 this relationship be can approximated using the following empirical expression 13 c s t v o l k c s t v o l 0 α σ m i k 2 where α is an empirical coefficient f ml 1 mol2 and c s t v o l 0 is the volumetric stern layer capacitance when the micropore charge density is zero 2 4 electrode channel modelling the flow electrode consists of ac particles cb particles and the electrolyte compared with film electrodes the flow electrode has a much smaller volume fraction of micropores and thus a much smaller microporosity due to the low weight to volume fraction of ac particles in addition as opposed to a film electrode the electrical conductivity of the flow electrode channel results from the conductivity of both ac particles and the electrolyte with the contribution of the electrolyte dependent on the electrolyte salinity we propose an empirical expression to estimate the overall conductivity of the flow electrode in a subcell with this expression accounting for the conductivity of pure ac ρ a c and the mass fraction of carbon w t dimensionless the overall conductivity ρ e l e c unit s cm 1 of the electrode channel is expressed as 14 ρ e l e c λ s c m a 1 w t ρ a c w t γ where λ s is the molar conductivity s cm2 mol 1 of the solution and γ is an empirical coefficient that is independent of operating conditions because the flowrate of the flow electrode slurry is large in this study we ignore the influence of the slurry flowrate in the present model with lower slurry flowrates however less frequent collisions between ac particles may also lead to lower overall conductivity combining the potential drop across the stern layer and the donnan potential we can rewrite the overall potential drop in the electrode channel as follows 15 v e l e c k 2 v t δ φ d k δ φ s t k 2 i k l e l e c ρ e l e c k the total voltage across the unit cell is the summation of all the voltage drops assuming the cell is symmetric the total voltage can be represented as 16 v t o t a l k 2 v t δ φ h f s p k δ φ m s p k δ φ m k δ φ m e k 2 v e l e c k i k e s r where e s r is the specific equivalent series resistance ω cm2 including the resistances that occur in between the current collector and the flow electrode and that in the electrical circuit note that in simulating the fcdi process under steady state the cell voltage in every unit cell is the same and equal to the overall cell voltage however the current density varies with unit cell of which the mean is the overall current density for each subcell k of the flow electrode channel c m a k and c m i k are related to the ion flux j i o n s k by the following equation similar to eq 1 17 t 2 p m a c m a k p m i c m i k j i o n s k l e l e c 2 p m a c m a k c m a k 1 p m i c m i k c m i k 1 τ e l e c n where τ e l e c is the total hydraulic resistance time hrt unit s of carbon slurry in the electrode channel which is divided by n to give the hrt in each subcell the system of differential and algebraic equations in the model were solved numerically with matlab 3 experimental methods 3 1 experimental setup the fcdi module used in this study has been described previously he et al 2018a briefly the module consists of two electrode channels separated from the central spacer channel by an aem and a cem aem type ii cem type ii fujifilm europe respectively the dry ac powder in the flow electrode is made from 90 wt darco ac and 10 wt norit ac both are purchased from sigma aldrich the details of the ac properties are summarized in table s2 during the operation the positively and negatively charged electrode slurries exiting the fcdi module are mixed in a stirred tank where oppositely charged ac particles contact each other to become neutral and the ions adsorbed inside the fcdi module are released the electrode slurries are pumped through the serpentine channels carved in an acrylic plate the channels have a dimension of 2 d 2 w mm 570 l mm the effective contact area between the serpentine channels and the iem is 11 9 cm2 while the contact area between the current collector and the iem is equal to 22 0 cm2 the details of the fcdi cell are shown in supplementary information fig s2 3 the feedwater is pumped through the spacer channel for ion removal with the effluent salinity measured continuously using an inline conductivity meter 3 2 experimental conditions the flow electrode was prepared by mixing milli q water 18 2 mω cm with different weight percentages of ac powder 2 5 and 10 wt the flow electrode was charged by a dc power supply with different current densities 8 4 16 8 25 2 and 33 6 a m 2 the influence of hrt 0 47 0 69 0 91 and 1 40 min on the fcdi performance was investigated by changing the flowrate of feed water running through the spacer channel 3 3 performance evaluation the cell voltage current and conductivity were recorded using corresponding probes vernier software technology beaverton or usa connected to a sensordaq the specific energy consumption sec can be defined as the energy consumped per unit volume of the product water i e sec w 18 s e c w a i v q or per amount of salt removed i e sec i 19 s e c i a i v q c 0 c d where v is the cell voltage i is the current density a is the effective area q is the feed flowrate in the spacer channel and c 0 and c d are the concentrations of the feed i e the influent and deionized water i e the effluent stream respectively because electro sorption and electrodialysis both occur in an fcdi process the quantification of desalination rate is based on average salt removal rate a s r r instead of the average salt adsorption rate asar as used in a cdi system based on film electrodes nativ et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the definition of asrr is the amount of salt removed per area of iem in a unit time 20 a s r r q c 0 c d a sec and asrr values for both experimental data and simulation results were obtained using eqs 18 20 with comparison of these values used to evaluate the fcdi performance over a range of experimental conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results and model validation a series of fcdi experiments with various operational conditions were conducted to validate the proposed model by fitting the data for effluent concentration and cell voltage current as a function of time a value of n 8 is used in this study with a larger number of subcells found to provide little improvement in model fit to the experimental data the only fitting parameters used were the coefficient γ in eq 14 and the specific equivalent series resistance r e s r in eq 16 which were adjusted to obtain a good fit of the experimentally measured effluent concentration and average current density the values of the ac properties such as c s t v o l 0 and α in eq 13 are reported in the literature wang and lin 2018b qu et al 2018 dykstra et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 we note that γ and e s r are the only two properties of the fcdi system and these parameters do not depend on operating conditions therefore the same γ and e s r apply to all scenarios with different operating conditions presented in this study consequently the fcdi model that is developed here with the fitted γ and e s r can be used for predicting performance at different operating conditions experimentally the effect of changes in three operating parameters including current density hydraulic residence time hrt and carbon content were examined in total four values of current density four values of spacer channel hrt and three values of carbon loading were studied the effluent concentrations and cell voltages at various current densities are presented in fig 2 although scc fcdi is usually considered a steady state process the start up of an fcdi system is still dynamic the presence of the iems however enables an fcdi system to reach a steady state effluent concentration in a relatively short time with the effluent concentration similar to that achieved in membrane cdi mcdi increasing the current density for the same hrt results in a decrease in the effluent concentration fig 2a at relatively high current density 33 6 a m 2 salt rejection as high as 92 was achieved during the start up stage the cell voltage rose sharply to a stable level unlike the case of film electrode cdi in which cell voltage continuously rises over time when the cell is charged at constant current the cell voltage in scc fcdi remains stable fig 2b because the exhausted ac particles continue to be regenerated outside the fcdi cell overall the results from the efe fcdi model are in excellent agreement with the experimental data of the steady state effluent concentrations with this agreement demonstrating the capability of the efe fcdi model in predicting the performance of fcdi over a range of operating conditions additional fittings of experimental data with the edf fcdi model are provided in the supporting information fig s1 cdi processes based on film electrodes are dynamic i e there are always certain key system parameters that vary temporally for example when charging a cdi process at constant voltage cv the current density and effluent salinity both change over time due to the temporal variation in the driving force for ion transport alternatively when charging a cdi process at constant current cc the cell voltage has to rise over time to offset the build up of stern and donnan potentials in the edl so that a constant driving force for ion transport can be maintained in contrast there is no temporal variation of parameters in a fcdi process except for the short start up stage even though the same build up of stern and donnan potentials in the edl of the ac still occur as ac particles flow along the electrode channel and accumulate additional ions in their micropores in essence the constant movement of the electrodes converts the temporal variations of the system to spatial variations the spatial variations of various system properties are illustrated in fig 3 these properties include the volumetric micropore charge density σ m i fig 3a the current density fig 3b the salt concentration in the spacer channel and the solution phase of the flow electrode channel fig 3c and the stern and donnan potentials fig 3d cdi systems with film electrodes are typically charged using cc or cv mode the reason for specifying what should be constant is precisely because not all properties can remain temporally constant specifically as charging proceeds the current diminishes in cv mode while the cell voltage rises in cc mode for fcdi with a single pair of current collectors however everything is temporally constant and there is only one cell voltage for the fcdi system as a whole on the other hand the current density varies spatially along the water flow direction as the water is desalinated fig 3b therefore referring to an fcdi operation as cc or cv is not meaningful as fcdi always possesses both characteristics however if we follow a thin slab of ac slurry in the flow electrode channel that flowing portion of the electrode has the characteristic of cv charging as the corresponding current density decreases over time temporally and along the electrode channel spatially fig 3b to futher illustrate that an fcdi cell has both cc and cv characteristics we simulate the distribution of potential drops in different components at different positions of the fcdi module fig 4 in a typical efe fcdi model these potential drops should include seven components including the stern potential in the micropores the donnan potential between the micropores and macropores the potential drop in the flow electrode chamber electrode the potential drop across the iems membrane the sum of the donnan potential drops across the two interfaces of the iems mem donnan the potential drop across the spatial channel spacer and the potential drop due to the series resistance ma et al 2018 however the results from our simulation suggest that the stern potential in the micropores and the donnan potential between the micropores and macropores are both negligible compared to other contributions fig 3d as such these potentials are not included in fig 4 because there can only be one potential for a current collector the cell voltage is also spatially independent therefore the sum of the all potential drops across the two current collectors is also spatially constant 1 8 v in this case however the individual contributions to the overall potential drop vary along the module as more charge is transferred top axis in fig 4 and more salts are removed from the feed stream specifically the potential drop across the iems and the potential drop due to series resistance both decrease as the local current density decreases along the feed stream flow in addition the decrease in salt concentration in the spacer channel and increase in the flow electrode channel results in changes in the electrical resistance and thus the potential drop in the respective channels fig 4 4 2 performance evaluation of fcdi the effects of operating conditions on the fcdi performance metrics were investigated over a wide range of operating conditions using both experimental and modeling approaches we first investigated the impact of current density on the average salt removal rate asrr and specifc energy consumption sec as the current density increases from 8 4 to 33 6 a cm 2 asrr increases linearly from 5 0 to 20 9 mmol cm 2 min 1 fig 5 a notably the asrr of fcdi is higher than the average salt adsorption rate in most mcdi processes usually lower than 10 mmol cm 2 min 1 increasing current density also results in greater energy consumption specifically sec increases linearly from 0 06 to 0 28 j μmol 1 when the current density quadrupled from 8 4 to 33 6 a cm 2 fig 5a these results reflect the intrinsic tradeoff between desalination rate and energy efficiency as discussed in several recent papers wang and lin 2019 2018b wang et al 2019 hawks et al 2018b hemmatifar et al 2018 we also note that results from the numerical simulation are in remarkably good agreement with the experimental results with a fixed current density increasing hrt results in a reduction in effluent salinity and an increase in salt rejection however hrt has a negligible impact on the desalination rate fig 5b which is unsurprising because asrr is roughly proportional to current density as long as charge efficiency remains similar in comparison the energy consumption is slightly more sensitive to hrt with sec increasing from 0 10 to 0 16 j μmol 1 when hrt increases from 0 47 to 1 4 min fig 5b sec increases mainly because a longer hrt results in greater reduction of the feed salinity and thus a lower average feed salinity which in turn leads to a higher average feed channel resistance and a higher overall cell resistance a distinct characteristic of fcdi as opposed to conventional cdi with film electrodes is that the carbon content of the electrode is adjustable increasing the ac loading from 2 to 10 results in a significant reduction in sec from 0 35 to 0 10 j μmol 1 fig 5c this improvement in energy efficiency is attributable to the increase of overall conductivity of the flow electrode channel as the charge transfer is enhanced as more frequent collisions between ac particles occur at higher ac loading however the increase of ac loading also comes with the practical disadvantage that circulating the ac slurry in the electrode channel becomes more challenging i e larger pressure drop and more prone to clogging as the viscosity increases with ac loading while this practical challenge is not specifically investigated in the current study the caveats of increasing the carbon content of the flow electrode should not be overlooked in practical system design on the other hand increasing the carbon content does not affect the asrr if the current density is maintained the same from all three series of experiments it is clear that while sec may depend on operational and system parameters in different ways the desalination rate is only a function of current density 4 3 performance tradeoff in fcdi recent studies have identified the importance of quantifying the intrinsic tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate for desalination systems wang and lin 2018b hawks et al 2018b liu and smith 2018 lin and elimelech 2017 specifically the performance tradeoff curve in this case relating the sec and asrr can serve as a useful tool for systematic comparison between operations and for technoeconomic analysis of fcdi here we construct the performance tradeoff curves using the experimentally validated efe fcdi model to elucidate the impacts of operating conditions on the overall system performance the performance tradeoff curves were simulated by simultaneously varying the applied voltage and the flowrate of the feed stream so that an identical effluent concentration is achieved for every point in a performance tradeoff curve fig 6 a we use the experimentally validated efe fcdi model to simulate performance tradeoff curves for fcdi systems with different carbon contents in the flow electrode fig 6b feed concentrations fig 6c and e and diluted effluent concentrations fig 6d and f the fcdi performance is quantified by performance tradeoff curves that relate the inverse of sec w or sec i and asrr which quantify the kinetic and energetic efficiencies respectively as a rule of thumb a performance tradeoff curve that is in the upper right position of a sec w 1 or sec i 1 vs asrr plot is preferred in general increasing the carbon content leads to kinetically and energetically more favorable fcdi operation fig 6b mainly due to increased electrical conductivity the positive impact of increasing the carbon content is particularly salient when the carbon conent is low for instance increasing the carbon content from 5 to 10 dramatically enhances sec w 1 however further increasing the carbon content from 10 to 15 by the same increment of 5 has a considerably smaller effect in further enhancing the energetic and kinetic efficiencies the dwindling impact of increasing carbon content when the carbon content is releatively high can be explained by the inverse relationship between electrical resistance and electrical conductivity i e increasing the electrical conductivity has a much stronger effect in reducing the electrical resistance when the electrical conductivity is low compared to the effect when it is high a flow electrode with high carbon content becomes more viscous and prone to clogging which increases the pumping energy for circulation not considered in this analysis and renders practical fcdi operation considerably more challenging considering the significant detrimental impacts on operation and diminishing return on reducing flow channel resistance of increasing carbon content the carbon content in the flow electrode should be limited to a certain level increasing the feed concentration fig 6c or reducing the effluent concentration fig 6d leads to less favorable performance as indicated by up right shift of the performance tradeoff curves sec w 1 vs asrr however this is unsurprising because in either case more salts are removed from the feed water which should supposedly result in high energy consumption per volume of the treated water when we normalize the energy by the amount of salt removed instead of the volume of water treated the new performance tradeoff curves sec i 1 vs asrr suggest that changing either the feed or the effluent concentration has minmal impact on the system performance fig 6e and f in theory a feed stream with a lower salinity has a higher electrical resistance which consequently results in compromised performance this effect is more salient with reduced effluent concentration than with reduced feed concentration because resistance is roughly inversely proportional to salinity and the impact of salinity is thus stronger in the low salinity range indeed compared to a nearly unobservable impact of feed concentration on performance fig 6e the impact of effluent concentration is more obvious fig 6f however neither impact is significant because the spacer channel resistance only has a small contribution to the overall resistance according to the breakdown shown in fig 4 5 conclusions and implications while the microscopic behavior of the flow electrodes in fcdi is very complex and requires multi phase hydrodynamic modeling for full elucidation we have demonstrated in this work that the system level behavior of fcdi can be satisfactorily described using an equivalent film electrode efe model where the flow electrode is simply treated as a moving film electrode not only does the efe model yield a very good description of the experimental data it can also be employed for performance prediction because the model does not have any operation specific fitting parameters as such the efe fcdi model can be employed for designing and optimizing fcdi systems it can also be used for theoretical investigation to enhance our fundamental understanding of fcdi because it enables the analysis of the spatial distribution of the important properties in the fcdi cell and the breakdown of energy loss in different parts of the system our analysis based on performance tradeoff curves simulated using the efe fcdi model suggests that ac content in the flow electrode channel has the largest impact on system performance evaluated based on energy consumption per ion removed whereas both the feed salinity and the target effluent salinity have negligible impact declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17861,bacteriophages and engineered nano material agnps interactions is a relatively unexplored area of research to answer the fundamental question whether bacteriophage lytic growth cycle is affected by the presence of agnps laboratory experiments were performed with phages of klebsiella pneumoniae delftia tsuruhatensis salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri using silver nanoparticles agnps with coating materials one step growth curves of bacteriophages indicated that the presence of these nanoparticles and the associated ions of silver produced pronounced effects on the lytic infection of certain bacteriophages effects included 96 reductions in post infection phage yield in terms of plaque forming units pfus after phages were incubated with silver nanoparticles and 28 43 reductions from the presence of ag alone however when klebsiella pneumonia phage kl and salmonella typhimurium phage det7 were exposed to silver nanoparticles coated with poly n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone pvp an increase in final phage yield by as much as 250 was observed compared with the same phage not incubated with nanoparticles a proposed mechanism observed by transmission electron microscopy and verified using synthetic biology by which the nanoparticle binding phenotype can be produced is that the binding of metal nanomaterial to phage virions results in potentially inhibitory effects this binding was found to be dependent on the presence of exposed positively charged c terminal amino acid residues on the phage capsid surface implied at first by amino acid sequence comparisons between

terminus of non binding phage this induced the agnp binding phenotype as observed by tem dls size measurements and growth curve data that show the mutant constructs to be functionally inhibited after

applications in antimicrobial protection coatings and health products juganson et al 2015 benn and westerhoff 2008 the unrestricted entry of agnps into the environment has been a concern for several years wong et al 2017 xing et al 2016 in general the toxicity of some agnps inactivate or destroy microorganisms and negatively impacts microbial and eukaryotic ecology sheng and liu 2017 liu et al 2017 vazquez munoz et al 2017 for example agnps effectively suppress nitrifying bacteria populations which can lead to elevated nutrient conditions in aquatic systems and reduced effectiveness of the activated sludge process in wastewater treatment nielsen et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 studies of material from wastewater treatment plants suggest that as little as 1 0 mg l silver nanoparticles agnps can cause a 40 reduction in nitrification in activated sludge and dramatically reduce the growth of nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas europaea nitrosococcus oceani and other heterotrophs beddow et al 2014 yang et al 2014 likewise eukaryotic ecology has been shown to be sensitive to certain agnps for example algal growth has shown to be significantly depressed in the presence of at least 0 9 mg l agnps and function decreases rapidly as concentration increases yang et al 2014 increased exposure to agnps is correlated with a decrease in chlorophyll content and reduced cell viability sheng and liu 2017 while we have learned a great deal about the negative effects of agnps s on different living entities research on the effect of agnps on viruses remains largely unexplored bacteriophages viruses that infect bacteria make up the majority of organisms on earth and have a profound impact on prokaryotic life everywhere tempering microbial populations and promoting biodiversity though predation and gene transfer argov et al 2017 krystiak baltyn et al 2017 wittebole et al 2014 the importance of bacteriophages in determining the diversity and structure of bacterial communities has been a subject of considerable research especially in fresh water kenzaka et al 2007 brussaard et al 2008 matteson et al 2011 terrestrial ashelford et al 2000 swanson et al 2009 wang et al 2010 and marine ecosystems breitbart 2012 baker et al 2014 suttle 2005 2007 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 the findings such as those presented in this manuscript that silver nanoparticles can affect bacteriophages raises questions concerning these effects on overall microbial ecology as well as how these interactions may be exploited in a variety of applications despite the immense diversity of bacteriophages and their proven role in controlling microbial diversity absolutely nothing was known prior to this study about how agnps interact with bacteriophages at a mechanistic level in fact none of the nanotoxicity and agnps ecotoxicity databases report about these interactions because such information is rather scarce in literature the overall objective of this study is to evaluate and gain understanding of nanoparticles and bacteriophage interactions with agnps as model nanoparticles this is important for various reasons including potential improvements in phage therapy based solutions to bacteria related problems in for example waste water management mathieu et al 2019 and the fact that bacteriophages may act as a carrier for nanaparticles in the environment and thus support the transport of nanaparticles in aquatic systems moreover given the degree to which bacteriophages affect aquatic bacterial ecology through their known infection cycles understanding nanaparticles phage interactions is imperative from an aquatic ecology point of view the objective also included getting the first set of data in terms of their effect on phage growth cycles and make an effort towards understanding some of the potential underlying mechanisms of the observed phage growth cycle inhibition by agnps we first used klebsiella pneumonia and delftia tsuruhatensis as two different hosts to study interactions of their lytic phages rg2014 and kl respectively with agnps later we included more hosts to expand the variety of lytic phages to study the effects of agnp the associated ions of silver and the presence of pvp a coating used for stabilization of some nanoparticles as they relate to phage infectivity finally we used synthetic biology specifically the targeted dna editing of a phage model system to modify surface characteristics of the phage capsids to get a deeper understanding about phage agnps interactions the results obtained lay down a foundation for further research and provide the very first report along with a mechanistic understanding of phage agnps interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 host bacteria studied to begin the study two primary lytic phages and their hosts were used in these experiments one of the host bacteria used klebsiella pneumoniae atcc baa 2146 yong 2009 is a gram negative non motile encapsulated rod shaped bacteria first isolated from a us hospital patient in 2010 it carries the antibiotic resistance gene new delhi metallo β lactamase 1 ndm 1 which confers resistance to a broad range of beta lactam antibiotics a mainstay for the treatment of bacterial infections yong 2009 this strain was obtained from the american type culture collection atcc facility in manassas virginia the second host selected delftia tsuruhatensis arb 1 is a gram negative rod shaped motile bacteria originally isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in utah in dr ramesh goel s lab using methods described by bhattacharjee et al 2015 in addition to these two hosts shigella flexneri casjens et al 2004 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 mcclelland et al 2001 were also used as hosts to reflect a variety of phage morphologies and host strains 2 2 lytic phage isolation characterization and purification both host bacteria were grown in luria broth lb miller 1972 media for growth at 37 2 c mixed liquor biomass was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant and used as a source of phages to isolate lytic phages for bacterial hosts k pneumoniae and d tsuruhatensis the lytic phages kl infecting k pneumoniae and phage rg2014 infecting d tsuruhatensis were isolated following protocols previously described bhattacharjee et al 2017 hockett and baltrus 2017 a phage titer of the lysate stock and a tem analysis of the lytic phage was performed as described in our earlier study kotay et al 2011 all phages were purified from individual plaques and propagated by infection of their respective hosts in liquid culture earnshaw et al 1976 phages were purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation tang et al 2006 in an sw41 ultra clear centrifuge tube for sw41 beckman rotors concentrated phage lysate was layered atop a step gradient consisting of 10 sucrose smg 1 4 g ml cscl smg and 1 6 g ml smg separated by phase in that order from top to bottom these preparations were then centrifuged at 220 000g for 2 h at 20 c the band containing phage located at the 1 4 1 6 cscl interface was extracted with a syringe and dialyzed against smg buffer using a spectra por 7 50 000 mwco dialysis membrane measurement of the protein concentrations of purified phage was done using the qubit protein assay kit cat q33211 2 3 other reference lytic phages studied after testing the lytic phage for two host strains e g klebsiella pneumoniae atcc baa 2146 and delftia tsuruhatensis arb 1 we also used the podoviridae phage sf6 of shigella flexneri casjens et al 2004 as well as a variety of other well studied phages belonging to different families infecting salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 mcclelland et al 2001 p22 podoviridae sp6 podoviridae 9na siphoviridae and det7 myoviridae pedulla et al 2003 dobbins et al 2004 casjens et al 2014 casjens et al 2015 so as to reflect a variety of phage morphologies and host strains in our testing with agnps the p22 strain used uc 937 is a temperate phage that has been heavily modified for use in the dna editing methods described later it carries a knockout of gene c1 which represses transcription of lytic genes obligating it to the lytic life cycle tokuno and gough 1975 the chloramphenicol resistance gene camr and an amber mutation in the holin gene gp13 that inactivates lysis unless grown in a host suppressor strain s typhimurium supe sf6 p22 sp6 and 9na were purified using the same protocol detailed earlier and dialyzed in 1x smg buffer the preferred buffer of rg2014 and for which the other phage tested appeared stable based on plaque assays over time data not shown the final concentration of smg when in use was 5x smg after 1 1 dilution with nanoparticle solutions phages were also dialyzed in 2x tm buffer to assess any observable difference phage nanoparticle interactions when using a lower ionic strength buffer 1x tm after dilution with nanoparticle solution all experiments using p22 fusion mutants were conducted using phage dialyzed in 2x tm buffer the standard buffer of p22 is 1x tm and the final concentration used in experiments after dilution det7 proved to be unstable in cesium chloride gradients and so was purified by repeated centrifugation 6000g filtration through a 0 45 nm filter and centrifuged through 10 sucrose sw41 rotor 220 000g followed by resuspension in 2x tm or smg buffer 2 4 nanoparticle types and characterization in this manuscript bare agnps refer to uncoated agnps in sodium citrate and coated refer to agnp coated with poly n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone pvp for stability the nanoxact silver agnp spherical nanoparticles were obtained from nanocomposix in sizes of 10 nm both uncoated bare stored in 2 mm sodium citrate and pvp coated stored in h20 biopure versions of these nanoparticles available at higher concentrations 1 g l and quality were also purchased other stock specification details of the nanoparticles used are provided in table 1 zeta potential ζ values for nanoparticles were obtained via dynamic light scattering dls malvern panalytical zetasizer nano zs and are given as the average of n 3 scans table 1 nanoparticles were diluted to concentrations of 2 0 mg l in various dispersion media tm 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 5 smg 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 5 100 mm nacl 10 mm mgso4 0 01 gelatin 2 mm sodium citrate or h2o transmission electron microscopy conducted on the agnp stock solution confirmed uniform size distribution and very little or no agglomeration of agnps in solution 2 5 bacteria and agnp interactions agnps have been shown to be lethal to prokaryotes as a control to assess the impacts of agnps during culture we tested host strains delftia tsuruhatensis and klebsiella pneumoniae for their response to agnps used in this study 25 ml of each strain was grown to mid log phase in a 250 ml flask at 37 2 c in an orbital shaker 190 rmp 1 ml from each culture was then incubated at room temperature for 5 min with different concentrations of bare silver nanoparticles 0 025 mg l 0 25 mg l and 1 25 mg l controls in which cultures were not incubated with nanoparticles were prepared for each strain the cultures were then centrifuged at 3000 g at room temperature for 3 min decanted and resuspended with 1 ml lb these resuspensions were then added to 25 ml lb in 250 ml flasks and shaken at 37 2 c for 70 min this is the same incubation time used post infection in most infectivity experiments and is sufficient for comparative measurements of growth 1 ml from the cultures was then placed on ice for 10 min serially diluted in lb and plated onto lb agar plates plates were incubated overnight at 37 2 c after which colonies were counted visually n 1 to assess the impact of citrate present in bare agnp stocks phages were incubated in 1 mm na citrate in parallel with and in the same manner as the described growth curve experiments as a control n 1 2 6 nanoparticle and phage interactions our primary method of study for phage nanoparticle interactions was the measurement of the effect of nanoparticles on phage one step growth curves and total phage yield after 70 min of infection a one step growth curve defines the rate at which during bacteriophage infection of its host the phage is attached to the bacterium injects its genetic material and produces more phage progeny which burst from the cell upon completion of the lytic cycle for one step growth curve experiments purified phage stored in smg or 2x tm buffer was added to 10 mg l concentrations of nanoparticle solution at a 1 1 vol ratio with a final phage concentration of 5 108 pfu ml and final buffer concentration of 0 5x smg or 1x tm this solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 2 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes a volume necessary to achieve a multiplicity of infection moi of 0 0625 phage per host bacterium was then transferred to 1 ml of host cells at mid log phase in lb and incubated at room temperature for 5 min cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 3000g decanted and resuspended in fresh lb this resuspension was transferred to a 25 ml host culture at mid log phase in a 250 ml flask and shaken 190 rpm at 37 2 c for 70 min for detailed analysis of bacteriophage growth curve effects for rg2014 and k pneumonia phage kl only 1 ml culture quantities were collected every 10 min as the infection proceeded these cultures were then immediately treated with chloroform vortexed and centrifuged at 6000g for 5 min after which the supernatant was collected and plaque forming units pfu were measured in all other cases the data was collected only at 70 min as the yield at the end of this time consistently reflects the efficiencies of the viral infections being compared this was based on the detailed growth curve data from kl and rg2014 and t 70 minute titrations of the other phage used in this study that suggested growth to be sufficiently substantial at this time point for comparative analysis all phages used in this study were directly titered on their respective hosts after incubation with agnps in which 1 1010 pfu ml phage were incubated in 10 mg l 10 nm bare agnps for 30 min at room temperature to determine whether background ag present in the stock nanoparticle solution has an effect independent of the presence of nanoparticles stock nanoparticle solutions were diluted 2x separately in h2o or smg and centrifuged at 194 000g for 90 min using a sw55ti beckman rotor this is done to remove nanoparticles and other insoluble products from nanoparticle solutions thereby isolating ag the ag present in these supernatants was quantified by icp ms using an agilent 7500ce quadrupole mass spectrometer these solutions were then used to infect cultures by the one step growth curve method described the volume of nanoparticle solution containing no agnps used in these experiments was identical to that used in the 10 mg l nanoparticles growth curve experiments to isolate effects seen from pvp when used as a coating for agnps experiments were conducted using pvp powder average mw 40 000 amu dissolved in sterile milliq pure water to 20 mg l stock solution one step growth curve measurements n 2 for phage incubated with 2x diluted pvp solution with a final concentration of 10 mg l were conducted in the same manner as detailed earlier dls size data for phage agnp interactions was obtained by incubating 1 1011 phage with 10 mg l agnps for 30 min this was then diluted 10x into tm buffer and applied to the malvern zetasizer with values given as the average of n 3 scans 2 7 construction of positively charged c terminal p22 coat protein extensions salmonella p22 prophage strain uc 937 was used to genetically fuse peptide extensions of positively charged amino acid residues arginine and or lysine to the c terminus of coat protein p22 gp5 by a serine glycine linker sgsgs the peptide fusions constructed have properties detailed in table 1 one of the three peptide sequences chosen gp5 f1 resulted in a non functional phage product once constructed likely due to improper folding of the coat protein this peptide sequence lacks the sgsgs linker but remained relevant to the study dna editing was done using the lambda red mediated galk galactokinase recombineering methods described in marinelli et al 2012 the salmonella strain carrying the p22 prophage uc 937 and the plasmid pkd46 expressing the recombinase lambda red was grown in lb 50 μg ml ampicillin and 0 2 arabinose to od595 0 7 cells were then harvested and made competent for electroporation o callaghan and charbit 1990 using pcr gotaq mastermix cat m7133 and the recommended cycling conditions from product literature the gene galk was amplified from the plasmid pgalk using primers that added 50 base pair bp 5 and 3 tails containing dna sequence homology to regions flanking the site to be edited that is the 3 end of p22 coat protein gp5 this product was used for linear dna transformation electroporation of the above cells the galk phenotype was then selected for on minimal media containing 0 4 galactose replacement dna containing the final modified sequence was constructed by pcr amplification of wild type p22 dna using primers that supply sufficient tails of homology to regions flanking the galk site of the above transformant this product was used for transformation of the galk knock out strain in the presence of lambda red galk cells cells presumed to be successfully edited were selected for using minimal media containing 30 μg ml chloramphenicol for retention of the prophage and deoxy galactose which produces a toxic compound after being metabolized colony candidates were struck out onto lb chloramphenicol the correct insertion of the sequences was confirmed by pcr amplification of colonies followed by sanger sequencing of pcr products primer sequences for amplification of galk insertion and replacement dna using wild type p22 as the template are in table s1 2 8 transmission electron microscopy for tem visualization of nanoparticle phage interactions 2 1011 pfu ml phage dialyzed in 2x tm or 1x smg were mixed with an equal volume of 20 mg l nanoparticles in their respective stock buffer either 2 mm sodium citrate or h2o after 30 min at room temperature 3 μl of this mixture was laid onto formvar 400 mesh copper grids after 1 min the excess phage solution was removed with filter paper 3 ml of 1 uranyl acetate was then added to the grid left for 1 min and then removed with filter paper all negatively stained tem images were obtained using a tem model jeol jem 1400 2 9 statistical analysis pfu values were determined by dividing the pfu of the nanoparticle exposure test subject by the control no nanoparticle exposure this was done for each repeat number the pfu given is the mean of these experimental repeats with p values obtained from an unpaired t test significance was determined at an alpha level of 0 05 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 agnps and phage zeta potential characteristics upon taking dls zeta potential measurements of nanoparticles diluted in smg the primary physiological buffer used in these experiments we observed significant precipitation and increases in millivolt values from high negative to low negative high salt concentrations are known to cause an increase in current heat and ultimately a thinning and collapse of the electrical double layer resulting in significant reduction of zeta potential dukhovich et al 2003 skoglund et al 2017 when particles were diluted in a lower ionic strength buffer such as tm 10 mm tris ph 7 5 1 mm mgcl2 the values upon measurement aligned more closely with those of the stock medium since the effects of nanoparticle interaction are observable in either tm or smg these are the values used for comparative analysis all nanoparticle types produced negative values with pvp coated nanoparticles having consistently lower negativity when compared to uncoated silver nanoparticles in h2o table 1 the pvp coatings on some agnps are largely present to reduce aggregation in higher salt concentrations which may hinder biological activity and to reduce toxicity in higher organisms mirzaei et al 2017 the tradeoff is shorter shelf life in stock solution due to a greater instability compared with bare particles in h2o and a lower reaction potential negativity as noted in zeta potential specifications mirzaei et al 2017 dls size analysis of nanoparticles diluted in smg suggested the presence of aggregation and production of precipitate while the phage and nanoparticles diluted in tm did not yield errors related to precipitation and yielded values in line with those expected nearly all of the components of smg 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 5 100 mm nacl 10 mm mgso4 and 0 01 gelatin kapoor et al 1994 are capable of reacting with silver ions which are being slowly shed from the nanoparticles over time much of this precipitate likely consists of destabilized nanoparticles and insoluble compounds of ag with buffer components as detailed later in section 3 7 experimental data also discussed later does not suggest co precipitation of phage and nanoparticles as a mechanistic explanation for the effects observed the effects described in this report are seen experimentally when phages are incubated with nanoparticles in smg or tm buffers so it can be presumed that the sedimentation or agglomeration observed though dls when smg is used does not prevent phage interaction with nanoparticles or influence the observed effects on infection for phage agnps interaction experiments the magnitude of the surface charge of particles was inferred by measurement of the zeta potential the zeta potential is a measure of the electric field potential difference between the dispersion media in this case tm smg buffer 2 mm sodium citrate or h2o and the layer of fluid attached to the particle nanoparticles or phage while not equal to the surface potential of a particle zeta potential can be used to approximate the magnitude of the surface charge bhattacharjee 2016 table 1 shows the zeta potentials of the two isolated phages delftia tsuruhatensis phage rg2014 and klebsiella pneumoniae phage kl as well as the five other phages obtained from a different laboratory and the four p22 mutant constructs table 1 also shows the c terminal coat protein capsid sequence of each phage all phage species diluted in tm produced zeta potential values that were negative and similar to one another 3 2 bactericidal effects of agnps on host strains several publications have shown bactericidal effects of agnps on model bacterial populations seil and webster 2012 dakal et al 2016 in an attempt to evaluate this possibility with the host strains used cells were treated with concentrations of bare and pvp coated nanoparticles identical to those used in the one step growth curve experiments of phages and subjected to the same incubation and wash protocol after 70 min of growth the average time used for phage growth curve experiments no significant difference in colony forming units cfu fig s1 or spectrophotometric absorbance was observed in cells treated with nanoparticles as compared to cells not treated with nanoparticles while bactericidal effects have been observed at these concentrations in other systems seil and webster 2012 the short periods of exposure used in this study prior to dilution appear to have little if any effect on growth of the strains examined under our conditions nevertheless these results confirmed that agnps were not inhibitory to both bacteria at tested concentrations of agnps 3 3 the first experimental evidence of the effect of agnps on phage growth cycle first we tested the effect of silver agnps on the growth cycles of lytic phages kl of k pneumonia and rg2014 of d tsuruhatensis these lytic phages represent two distinctly different families of lytic phages with rg2014 belonging to podoviridae the short tailed phages and kl to siphoviridae long tailed phages in these experiments we used higher concentrations of agnps particularly during the phage nanoparticle incubation step than are generally present in the environment this was done for different reasons 1 there are no reports concerning concentration range as it relates to dose response available for agnp bacteriophage interactions and 2 we wanted to evaluate these interactions under worst case scenarios such as those where researchers initially used much higher concentrations of agnps to evaluate their effect on prokaryotic ecology under lab scale conditions sheng and liu 2017 liu et al 2017 vazquez munoz et al 2017 nevertheless these experiments promise to establish baseline information about agnp phage interactions which could be useful for future design of new experiments it should also be noted that lb the growth media used for all infectivity experiments contains peptides and proteins that chelate or otherwise react with silver ions corbisier et al 1999 since the effects described were observable and statistically significant using lb it was deemed reasonable to examine the effect of silver nanoparticles and their ions using semi physiological conditions in the sense that lb is optimized for growth of these bacteria as opposed to non chelating buffers typically used in the study of ion based toxicity uncoated agnps come in 2 mm sodium citrate as a suspension buffer it is known that some concentrations of sodium citrate negatively affect phage infectivity shafiai and thompson 1964 to determine whether sodium citrate at the concentrations used has an effect on phage infectivity during experiments a one step growth curve was conducted using phage in 1 mm sodium citrate without prior incubation with nanoparticles no effect from the citrate was observed under the conditions used fig s2 fig 1 a and b shows one step growth curves in lb for phage rg2014 infecting d tsuruhatensis arb 1 and phage kl infecting k pneumoniae with 10 min intervals of data after the phage were incubated with 10 mg l of uncoated and pvp coated silver nanoparticles in 0 5x smg as stated in the methods section smg buffer contains components known to react with silver nanoparticles and their associated ions gelatin in particular is known to chelate silver ions in solution thus reducing bioavailability in these experiments the final concentration of gelatin after dilution 0 005 is very low relative to studies that describe such interactions kapoor et al 1994 adverse effects on phage lytic growth cycle after agnp incubation were seen during infections of both phages in these experiments uncoated bare silver nanoparticles reduced infection yields of phage rg2014 by 89 n 1 and phage kl by 92 4 n 1 after 70 min of infection as compared with control experiments black circles where the phage mixture was not incubated with agnp that showed normal phage infection of its host bacteria pvp coated silver nanoparticles reduced the post infection pfu of rg2014 by 74 n 1 black squares to our surprise pvp coated silver agnps increased the yield of phage kl by 192 n 1 as shown by inverted black triangles in fig 1b growth curve experiments were also conducted lasting beyond 70 min for phage kl which demonstrated total lysis of culture to occur after 80 to 90 min see fig s3 much like in fig 1b fig s3 also shows significant differences in pfus for kl phage when incubated with agnps as compared with the control as sufficient growth and effects from agnps were consistently observable at t 70 minutes for phage kl as well as the additional phages used in this study this is the time point set for measurement of infectivity in all downstream experiments the observed increase in yield of phage kl but not of rg2014 with pvp coated silver nanoparticles prompted us to perform more control experiments using pure pvp powder presented later in this paper phage kl was incubated with 10 mg l bare silver agnps 10 mg l pvp coated silver agnps and pure pvp power dissolved to 10 mg l phage incubated with dissolved pvp powder was observed to have a similar elevation in phage yield as phage incubated with pvp coated silver nanoparticles n 2 fig 1c this suggests that the presence of pvp alone is sufficient to produce this effect in phage kl and has nothing to do with the presence of agnps in the case of phage kl the shedding of silver ions from pvp coated silver nanoparticles destabilizes them potentially causing the pvp held to the particle by weak van der waals forces to be released into solution at an unknown rate this de stabilization occurs over time in nanoparticle stock solution and is increased in salt containing buffer solutions levard et al 2013 this may result in the production of free pvp in solution which in the case of silver agnps is more likely to react with the virions to produce the observed effects than when bound as nanoparticle coating it was observed in fact that pfu yields of phage kl were significantly higher when incubated with pvp silver that was over a month old from the date of purchase compared to recently purchased nanoparticles used immediately after the receipt from the manufacturer n 2 fig 1d to verify the findings that pvp coated silver agnps caused an increase in yield in phage kl we conducted further experiments that included phage det7 a myoviridae phage infecting salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and several other phages belonging to different phage families all the phages used in this study were exposed to pvp coated nanoparticles results further discussed in section 3 5 and fig 3b and only kl and det7 phages were shown to display an increase in phage function kl and det7 phages have very different tail morphologies siphoviridae and myoviridae respectively and the only other siphoviridae tested 9na does not have a positive response to pvp structural comparisons between phage therefore provide few clues as to mechanism low concentrations of pvp has been reported to stabilize some proteins acting as a crowding agent that reduces aggregation under some conditions gombotz et al 1994 huan xiang 2013 tem images of kl particles do not appear to be aggregated however specific viral or host proteins involved in the attachment mechanism of these phages may be affected by pvp in such ways while interesting these mechanisms are subject to a different set of experiments outside the scope of this paper 3 4 transmission electron microscopy for phage agnp interactions tem was conducted on phage mixtures incubated with agnps to determine any resulting structural changes phages rg2014 and kl were incubated with agnps at various concentrations for 30 min at room temperature after which it was observed by tem that the majority of nanoparticles tended to be bound to the virions without evidence of aggregation fig 2 a c to determine whether nanoparticles would remain attached to phage post cesium chloride purification phage mixtures were incubated in a different set of experiments with 10 mg l and 500 mg l biopure 10 nm agnps nanoparticles both bare and pvp coated for 30 min at room temperature thereafter incubated phages were purified by cesium chloride step gradient centrifugation the purified phage samples were examined by tem and were determined not to have any nanoparticles attached to them nor to have any noticeable structural changes hypothetically if strong interactions between agnps and phages occurred heavier phages are not expected to be in the same density layer the free phages in that case either two layers will be seen in cesium chloride purification and or heavy loss of phage numbers will be recorded post ultracentrifugation however we did not see either two bands or loss of phages post ultracentrifugation next the cesium chloride purified phages which were initially incubated with nanoparticles were diluted to the same protein concentrations as a control cesium purified but not incubated with nanoparticles and used to infect the host using the described one step growth method after 70 min of infection no significant effects on pfus levels were observed fig 3a this is in contrast with experiments conducted simultaneously using phage that were not cesium purified after incubation with nanoparticles and which did show significant reductions in pfus fig 3a mechanistically these data suggest that the bonding of agnps with phages is not strong enough to allow agnps to remain attached to phages during cesium chloride purification and that no permanent structural changes are incurred at least under these tested conditions that produce inhibitory effects on infection after nanoparticles are removed 3 5 further confirmation of inhibitory effects of agnps on phage growth cycle using additional phage types and a mechanistic understanding to further test the effects of nanoparticles on infection of liquid bacterial cultures five additional phages were selected to include representatives from the families myoviridae det7 siphoviridae 9na and podoviridae p22 sp6 sf6 these along with the other two phages used in this study were incubated with agnps in 0 5x smg and used to infect their host after 70 min of growth the pfu in the cleared lysates were measured with the results shown in fig 3b as evident from fig 3b different phages are shown to be affected in different ways by different types of nanoparticles delftia phage rg2014 when incubated with bare agnps produced up to 92 4 n 5 p 0 05 fewer plaques closely aligning with what was reported earlier in this manuscript after 70 min of shaking compared to the plaques produced in the control phage kl produced 60 7 5 n 5 p 0 05 fewer plaques after exposure to bare silver nanoparticles after kl exposure to pvp silver nanoparticles pfu yield increased to 218 21 n 5 p 0 05 compared with the control phage det7 showed similar results as kl to include an even larger increase in pfu after incubation with pvp silver nanoparticles 263 63 9 n 3 p 0 05 phages p22 n 3 p 0 05 and 9na n 3 p 0 08 showed roughly 28 16 reductions in pfu when exposed to bare and pvp coated silver nanoparticles phage sp6 n 3 p 0 05 and sf6 n 3 p 0 05 showed no statistical reduction in pfu after exposure to silver nanoparticles tem images clearly depict nanoparticles sticking to the capsids of rg2014 and kl phage particles fig 2 and not to p22 fig 2f this suggests that the binding of nanoparticles to phage is related to the observed inhibitory effects on infection it also suggests that the exposed regions of the viral coat proteins of rg2014 kl and det7 share nanoparticle binding features strong enough to overcome the weaker repelling forces between the negatively charged surfaces of phage and nanoparticles that p22 9na sp6 and sf6 lack one such feature may be the presence of positive charges near the c terminus of the major capsid protein a region likely to extend from the surface of the capsid servid et al 2013 and a hypothesis we propose to test for further demonstration of the observed phage agnp interactions table 1 lists properties of the different phages tested to include zeta potential measurements the c terminal peptide sequence of the capsid protein the charge number q of the last 10 residues and the pfu percentage of surviving phage after exposure to bare silver nanoparticles as evident from this table phages rg2014 kl and det7 have positive charges in this region and were also shown to be negatively affected by silver nanoparticles in contrast other phages with negative charges at this location were either affected to a smaller degree or not at all by agnps these preliminary results imply a relationship between inhibition of phage lytic cycle and phage coat protein c terminus composition with the magnitude of these local charges appearing to correlate with both the ability to bind nanoparticles and the inhibitory effect of nanoparticles on infectivity table 1 fig 3b 3 6 effect of agnps on phage mutants with positively charged c terminal p22 coat protein extensions double stranded dna dsdna tailed phages major capsid proteins generally share a common protein fold but often have little recognizable amino acid sequence similarity there is usually an outer negatively charged region exposed to the surface and an inner positively charged region that allows the phage capsid to interact with the negatively charged dna to form a stable container tresset et al 2017 in cases where the 3d structures of these proteins are experimentally known the c terminus is often exposed at the surface and at varying distances fig s4 servid et al 2013 duda et al 1995 kizziah et al 2017 positively charged amino acid residues at this position would grant a distribution of positive charge over the surface via multiple 5 or 6 unit rings scattered around the capsid that could enable the observed binding effects even while the global interaction potentials of both interacting bodies are negative and repulsive in nature to test the hypothesis that exposed positive coat protein c termini of phages are associated with nanoparticle binding and greater susceptibility to silver agnp inhibition an attempt was made to induce the nanoparticle binding phenotype by using synthetic biology to attach positively charged amino acid residues to the c terminal end of coat protein bacteriophage p22 was chosen as the model system since it is not observed to bind to nanoparticles and has a well characterized capsid structure appearing to possess no surface positive charges hryc et al 2017 lambda red mediated galk recombineering methods were used to construct three separate p22 coat protein gp5 c terminal fusions table s1 p22gp5 f1 p22 vglpgqta pgagagan is a control mutant with an 8 amino acid extension having a small negative charge similar to wild type p22 at the c terminus q 0 39 p22gp5 f2 p22 vglpgqta sgsgs kar consist of an 8 amino acid extension that includes a serine glycine linker followed by a positively charged amino acid sequence and p22gp5 f3 p22 vglpgqta sgsgs rr is similar to f2 except that the sg linker is followed by two positive arginine residues these mutants after purification were incubated with bare silver nanoparticles for 30 min at room temperature in 1x tm buffer the standard buffer of p22 tem images show the two mutants with positive c terminal coat protein charges to have acquired the nanoparticle binding phenotype as compared to the wild type p22 control and the negatively charged control construct fig 2f size scattering measurements were taken using dls equipment for wild type and mutant p22 phages after incubating them with silver agnps fig s5 shows the scatters for the different conditions tested the average size of wild type phage in solution show no noticeable shift when incubated with agnp 72 01 nm 80 04 nm panels a and b in fig s5 on the other hand the p22 coat protein gp5 mutant with positive charge at c terminus p22gp5 f2 shows significant shift in average size from 97 84 nm 156 3 nm panels c and d in fig s5 in growth curve experiments n 3 p 0 05 the mutant phages with positive c terminal charges show substantial inhibition of infection from exposure to silver nanoparticles that the wild type strain and mutant control lack fig 4 a this suggests that the nanoparticle binding feature and the resulting inhibition of infection is indeed related to these exposed positively charged residues on the capsid and that these features can be artificially produced by genomic editing methods it is likely that the mechanism by which the metal nanoparticles disrupt phage functionality derive in part from the binding of nanoparticles across the surface of the phage capsid tem images do not appear to show preferential binding of nanoparticles to tail spike domains so the blocking of host receptor binding domains as the sole mechanism for loss of infectivity seems unlikely it is conceivable that the binding effect places nanoparticles in close proximity to phage or host receptor proteins during infection so that ag being shed continuously from the nanoparticles produces a more focused localized deleterious effect on phage attachment ag is known to complex with the sulfur groups of certain amino acids i e methionine and cysteine and in ways that can interfere with structure and function of proteins behra et al 2013 differences in the number of methionine and cysteine residues in tail spike domains tail needle proteins or host secondary receptor proteins may also account for the differences in ag sensitivity observed between rg2014 p22 9na sp6 and sf6 the mutant phages also appear to display higher levels of aggregation in tem when nanoparticles and the ability to bind them are present they in fact appear stuck together by a single nanoparticle linkage in the majority of images this may also reduce infectivity although in direct titers as opposed to phages used in growth curves phages incubated with nanoparticles for 30 min did not show difference in pfu if co aggregation of nanoparticles and phage were the issue one would expect to see loss in titer there as well 3 7 effect of ag on phage infectivity to assess the extent to which free silver ions released from nanoparticles affect phage infectivity nanoparticles were removed from silver nanoparticle solutions that had been mixed in di water or smg buffer by centrifugation these supernatants were analyzed for the presence of silver ions using icp ms analysis and the results are shown in table 2 it is notable that when nanoparticle solutions are diluted 2x into smg buffer for 30 min the ag concentration is substantially lower 72 lower than when diluted into h2o ag and can form complexes with the cl and so2 4 in smg buffer to form insoluble products e g agcl and ag2s behra et al 2013 this would explain the resulting drop in ag since these products would conceivably be pelleted out of solution with the nanoparticles upon centrifugation the solution obtained from centrifugation of bare nanoparticles in 0 5x smg containing 0 26 mg l ag and small soluble products but no nanoparticles was used to incubate phages rg2014 p22 and 9na to a final ag concentration of 0 005 mg l for inclusion in one step growth curve experiments exposure to ag under these conditions reduced the pfu of rg2014 by 43 7 5 n 3 p 0 05 9na by 24 4 n 3 p 0 05 and p22 by 27 2 n 3 p 0 05 figs 4b 3 these results suggest the presence of silver ions ag has a significant effect on infection of the phages tested regardless of any silver ion chelating reactive properties present in the growth media or phage np incubation buffers the ag inhibition of p22 and 9na which are not observed to bind to nanoparticles is similar in degree to that when exposed to non centrifuged nanoparticle solution rg2014 show inhibitory effects from ag as a 43 7 5 loss of pfu after 70 min of infection but up to 96 4 5 n 3 p 0 05 figs 4b 1 when incubated with nanoparticle solutions not centrifuged since nanoparticles bind to rg2014 this further suggests that the greater inhibitory effects may be due to the increased proximity of nanoparticles to the phage and or the host during infection and thus greater localized exposure to ag the inhibitory effects from ag seem to be in part due to action on host rather than viral proteins in another experiment a phage concentration 25x of that used in the other growth curve experiments was incubated with 10 mg l nanoparticles after which they were used to infect host stains at the typical moi of 0 0625 fig 4b this dilutes the amount of nanoparticle solution in the 1 ml culture 25x where effects from ag and nanoparticles are predicted to be negligible behra et al 2013 rg2014 goes onto produce an 85 3 n 3 p 0 05 reduction in pfu whereas p22 and 9na infected with normal efficiency n 3 p 0 05 this provides further evidence that the nanoparticles are bound to rg2014 since a similar degree of inhibitory effect is produced before or after dilution also since p22 and 9na which do not bind to nanoparticles did not produce the smaller 30 inhibition of infection from ag as previously observed when the nanoparticle solution is not diluted fig 4b this implies the effects are a result of ag interacting with host 4 conclusions bacteriophages are highly diverse with unique properties and means of infection and are affected by nanoparticles in different ways this report doesn t seek to explore the interactions between every combination of agnps and phages or describe the mechanism for every possible effect rather it describes limited examples of interactions to lay the groundwork for future research it provides 1 the first experimental evidence of effects from silver agnps on lytic growth curves of selected phages 2 experimental evidence that some phages are affected and others are not by metal agnps and 3 a small degree of mechanistic understandings of some components of inhibition using comparative genetics and targeted dna editing the experimentally observed interactions between nanoparticles pvp and bacteriophage virions reveal effects on infection efficiency which confer a clear fitness disadvantage or advantage in the case of nanoparticles coated with pvp to certain types of phages with the potential to affect microbial diversity in these experiments agnps and their ions are also shown to significantly affect phages at concentrations and incubation times in culture low enough to not affect growth of their host as inferred by the agnp bacteriocidal controls used in this study the ability to predict which species of phage is sensitive to nanoparticles and or their ions based off of simple coat protein sequence and structural predictions may answer questions regarding the populations affected further insights into the types and concentrations of nanoparticles required to manifest these effects will answer questions regarding the degree of impact as well declaration of

17861,bacteriophages and engineered nano material agnps interactions is a relatively unexplored area of research to answer the fundamental question whether bacteriophage lytic growth cycle is affected by the presence of agnps laboratory experiments were performed with phages of klebsiella pneumoniae delftia tsuruhatensis salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri using silver nanoparticles agnps with coating materials one step growth curves of bacteriophages indicated that the presence of these nanoparticles and the associated ions of silver produced pronounced effects on the lytic infection of certain bacteriophages effects included 96 reductions in post infection phage yield in terms of plaque forming units pfus after phages were incubated with silver nanoparticles and 28 43 reductions from the presence of ag alone however when klebsiella pneumonia phage kl and salmonella typhimurium phage det7 were exposed to silver nanoparticles coated with poly n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone pvp an increase in final phage yield by as much as 250 was observed compared with the same phage not incubated with nanoparticles a proposed mechanism observed by transmission electron microscopy and verified using synthetic biology by which the nanoparticle binding phenotype can be produced is that the binding of metal nanomaterial to phage virions results in potentially inhibitory effects this binding was found to be dependent on the presence of exposed positively charged c terminal amino acid residues on the phage capsid surface implied at first by amino acid sequence comparisons between capsid proteins of the different phages used in this study this was then proven experimentally using targeted dna editing methods to fuse positive charged amino acid residues to the coat protein c terminus of non binding phage this induced the agnp binding phenotype as observed by tem dls size measurements and growth curve data that show the mutant constructs to be functionally inhibited after exposure to agnps this research sets up a first platform for further research in the unexplored area of phage and agnp interactions and provides useful findings keywords silver nanomaterial lytic

applications in antimicrobial protection coatings and health products juganson et al 2015 benn and westerhoff 2008 the unrestricted entry of agnps into the environment has been a concern for several years wong et al 2017 xing et al 2016 in general the toxicity of some agnps inactivate or destroy microorganisms and negatively impacts microbial and eukaryotic ecology sheng and liu 2017 liu et al 2017 vazquez munoz et al 2017 for example agnps effectively suppress nitrifying bacteria populations which can lead to elevated nutrient conditions in aquatic systems and reduced effectiveness of the activated sludge process in wastewater treatment nielsen et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 studies of material from wastewater treatment plants suggest that as little as 1 0 mg l silver nanoparticles agnps can cause a 40 reduction in nitrification in activated sludge and dramatically reduce the growth of nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas europaea nitrosococcus oceani and other heterotrophs beddow et al 2014 yang et al 2014 likewise eukaryotic ecology has been shown to be sensitive to certain agnps for example algal growth has shown to be significantly depressed in the presence of at least 0 9 mg l agnps and function decreases rapidly as concentration increases yang et al 2014 increased exposure to agnps is correlated with a decrease in chlorophyll content and reduced cell viability sheng and

predation and gene transfer argov et al 2017 krystiak baltyn et al 2017 wittebole et al 2014 the importance of bacteriophages in determining the diversity and structure of bacterial communities has

marine ecosystems breitbart 2012 baker et al 2014 suttle 2005 2007 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 the findings such as those presented in this manuscript that silver nanoparticles can affect bacteriophages raises questions concerning these effects on overall microbial ecology as well as how these interactions may be exploited in a variety of applications despite the immense diversity of bacteriophages and their proven role in controlling microbial diversity absolutely nothing was known prior to this study about how agnps interact with bacteriophages at a mechanistic level in fact none of the nanotoxicity and agnps ecotoxicity databases report about these interactions because such information is rather scarce in literature the overall objective of this study is to evaluate and gain understanding of nanoparticles and bacteriophage interactions with agnps as model nanoparticles this is important for various reasons including potential improvements in phage therapy based solutions to bacteria related problems in for example waste water management mathieu et al 2019 and the fact that bacteriophages may act as a carrier for nanaparticles in the environment and thus support the transport of nanaparticles in aquatic systems moreover given the degree to which bacteriophages affect aquatic bacterial ecology through their known infection cycles understanding nanaparticles phage interactions is imperative from an aquatic ecology point of view the objective also included getting the first set of data in terms of their effect on phage growth cycles and make an effort towards understanding some of the potential underlying mechanisms of the observed phage growth cycle inhibition by agnps we first used klebsiella pneumonia and delftia tsuruhatensis as two different hosts to study interactions of their lytic phages rg2014 and kl respectively with agnps later we included more hosts to expand the variety of lytic phages to study the effects of agnp the associated ions of silver and the presence of pvp a coating used for stabilization of some nanoparticles as they relate to phage infectivity finally we used synthetic biology specifically the targeted dna editing of a phage model system to modify surface characteristics of the phage capsids to get a deeper understanding about phage agnps interactions the results obtained lay down a foundation for further research and provide the very first report along with a mechanistic understanding of phage agnps interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 host bacteria studied to begin the study two primary lytic phages and their hosts were used in these experiments one of the host bacteria used klebsiella pneumoniae atcc baa 2146 yong 2009 is a gram negative non motile encapsulated rod shaped bacteria first isolated from a us hospital patient in 2010 it carries the antibiotic resistance gene new delhi metallo β lactamase 1 ndm 1 which confers resistance to a broad range of beta lactam antibiotics a mainstay for the treatment of bacterial infections yong 2009 this strain was obtained from the american type culture collection atcc facility in manassas virginia the second host selected delftia tsuruhatensis arb 1 is a gram negative rod shaped motile bacteria originally isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in utah in dr ramesh goel s lab using methods described by bhattacharjee et al 2015 in addition to these two hosts shigella flexneri casjens et al 2004 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 mcclelland et al 2001 were also used as hosts to reflect a variety of phage morphologies and host strains 2 2 lytic phage isolation characterization and purification both host bacteria were grown in luria broth lb miller 1972 media for growth at 37 2 c mixed liquor biomass was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant and used as a source of phages to isolate lytic phages for bacterial hosts k pneumoniae and d tsuruhatensis the lytic phages kl infecting k pneumoniae and phage rg2014 infecting d tsuruhatensis were isolated following protocols previously described bhattacharjee et al 2017 hockett and baltrus 2017 a phage titer of the lysate stock and a tem analysis of the lytic phage was performed as described in our earlier study kotay et al 2011 all phages were purified from individual plaques and propagated by infection of their respective hosts in liquid culture earnshaw et al 1976 phages were purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation tang et al 2006 in an sw41 ultra clear centrifuge tube for sw41 beckman rotors concentrated phage lysate was layered atop a step gradient consisting of 10 sucrose smg 1 4 g ml cscl smg and 1 6 g ml smg separated by phase in that order from top to bottom these preparations were then centrifuged at 220 000g for 2 h at 20 c the band containing phage located at the 1 4 1 6 cscl interface was extracted with a syringe and dialyzed against smg buffer using a spectra por 7 50 000 mwco dialysis membrane measurement of the protein concentrations of purified phage was done using the qubit protein assay kit cat q33211 2 3 other reference lytic phages studied after testing the lytic phage for two host strains e g klebsiella pneumoniae atcc baa 2146 and delftia tsuruhatensis arb 1 we also used the podoviridae phage sf6 of shigella flexneri casjens et al 2004 as well as a variety of other well studied phages belonging to different families infecting salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 mcclelland et al 2001 p22 podoviridae sp6 podoviridae 9na siphoviridae and det7 myoviridae pedulla et al 2003 dobbins et al 2004 casjens et al 2014 casjens et al 2015 so as to reflect a variety of phage morphologies and host strains in our testing with agnps the p22 strain used uc 937 is a temperate phage that has been heavily modified for use in the dna editing methods described later it carries a knockout of gene c1 which represses transcription of lytic genes obligating it to the lytic life cycle tokuno and gough 1975 the chloramphenicol resistance gene camr and an amber mutation in the holin gene gp13 that inactivates lysis unless grown in a host suppressor strain s typhimurium supe sf6 p22 sp6 and 9na were purified using the same protocol detailed earlier and dialyzed in 1x smg buffer the preferred buffer of rg2014 and for which the other phage tested appeared stable based on plaque assays over time data not shown the final concentration of smg when in use was 5x smg after 1 1 dilution with nanoparticle solutions phages were also dialyzed in 2x tm buffer to assess any observable difference phage nanoparticle interactions when using a lower ionic strength buffer 1x tm after dilution with nanoparticle solution all experiments using p22 fusion mutants were conducted using phage dialyzed in 2x tm buffer the standard buffer of p22 is 1x tm and the final concentration used in experiments after dilution det7 proved to be unstable in cesium chloride gradients and so was purified by repeated centrifugation 6000g filtration through a 0 45 nm filter and centrifuged through 10 sucrose sw41 rotor 220 000g followed by resuspension in 2x tm or smg buffer 2 4 nanoparticle types and characterization in this manuscript bare agnps refer to uncoated agnps in sodium citrate and coated refer to agnp coated with poly n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone pvp for stability the nanoxact silver agnp spherical nanoparticles were obtained from nanocomposix in sizes of 10 nm both uncoated bare stored in 2 mm sodium citrate and pvp coated stored in h20 biopure versions of these nanoparticles available at higher concentrations 1 g l and quality were also purchased other stock specification details of the nanoparticles used are provided in table 1 zeta potential ζ values for nanoparticles were obtained via dynamic light scattering dls malvern panalytical zetasizer nano zs and are given as the average of n 3 scans table 1 nanoparticles were diluted to concentrations of 2 0 mg l in various dispersion media tm 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 5 smg 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 5 100 mm nacl 10 mm mgso4 0 01 gelatin 2 mm sodium citrate or h2o transmission electron microscopy conducted on the agnp stock solution confirmed uniform size distribution and very little or no agglomeration of agnps in solution 2 5 bacteria and agnp interactions agnps have been shown to be lethal to prokaryotes as a control to assess the impacts of agnps during culture we tested host strains delftia tsuruhatensis and klebsiella pneumoniae for their response to agnps used in this study 25 ml of each strain was grown to mid log phase in a 250 ml flask at 37 2 c in an orbital shaker 190 rmp 1 ml from each culture was then incubated at room temperature for 5 min with different concentrations of bare silver nanoparticles 0 025 mg l 0 25 mg l and 1 25 mg l controls in which cultures were not incubated with nanoparticles were prepared for each strain the cultures were then centrifuged at 3000 g at room temperature for 3 min decanted and resuspended with 1 ml lb these resuspensions were then added to 25 ml lb in 250 ml flasks and shaken at 37 2 c for 70 min this is the same incubation time used post infection in most infectivity experiments and is sufficient for comparative measurements of growth 1 ml from the cultures was then placed on ice for 10 min serially diluted in lb and plated onto lb agar plates plates were incubated overnight at 37 2 c after which colonies were counted visually n 1 to assess the impact of citrate present in bare agnp stocks phages were incubated in 1 mm na citrate in parallel with and in the same manner as the described growth curve experiments as a control n 1 2 6 nanoparticle and phage interactions our primary method of study for phage nanoparticle interactions was the measurement of the effect of nanoparticles on phage one step growth curves and total phage yield after 70 min of infection a one step growth curve defines the rate at which during bacteriophage infection of its host the phage is attached to the bacterium injects its genetic material and produces more phage progeny which burst from the cell upon completion of the lytic cycle for one step growth curve experiments purified phage stored in smg or 2x tm buffer was added to 10 mg l concentrations of nanoparticle solution at a 1 1 vol ratio with a final phage concentration of 5 108 pfu ml and final buffer concentration of 0 5x smg or 1x tm this solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 2 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes a volume necessary to achieve a multiplicity of infection moi of 0 0625 phage per host bacterium was then transferred to 1 ml of host cells at mid log phase in lb and incubated at room temperature for 5 min cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 3000g decanted and resuspended in fresh lb this resuspension was transferred to a 25 ml host culture at mid log phase in a 250 ml flask and shaken 190 rpm at 37 2 c for 70 min for detailed analysis of bacteriophage growth curve effects for rg2014 and k pneumonia phage kl only 1 ml culture quantities were collected every 10 min as the infection proceeded these cultures were then immediately treated with chloroform vortexed and centrifuged at 6000g for 5 min after which the supernatant was collected and plaque forming units pfu were measured in all other cases the data was collected only at 70 min as the yield at the end of this time consistently reflects the efficiencies of the viral infections being compared this was based on the detailed growth curve data from kl and rg2014 and t 70 minute titrations of the other phage used in this study that suggested growth to be sufficiently substantial at this time point for comparative analysis all phages used in this study were directly titered on their respective hosts after incubation with agnps in which 1 1010 pfu ml phage were incubated in 10 mg l 10 nm bare agnps for 30 min at room temperature to determine whether background ag present in the stock nanoparticle solution has an effect independent of the presence of nanoparticles stock nanoparticle solutions were diluted 2x separately in h2o or smg and centrifuged at 194 000g for 90 min using a sw55ti beckman rotor this is done to remove nanoparticles and other insoluble products from nanoparticle solutions thereby isolating ag the ag present in these supernatants was quantified by icp ms using an agilent 7500ce quadrupole mass spectrometer these solutions were then used to infect cultures by the one step growth curve method described the volume of nanoparticle solution containing no agnps used in these experiments was identical to that used in the 10 mg l nanoparticles growth curve experiments to isolate effects seen from pvp when used as a coating for agnps experiments were conducted using pvp powder average mw 40 000 amu dissolved in sterile milliq pure water to 20 mg l stock solution one step growth curve measurements n 2 for phage incubated with 2x diluted pvp solution with a final concentration of 10 mg l were conducted in the same manner as detailed earlier dls size data for phage agnp interactions was obtained by incubating 1 1011 phage with 10 mg l agnps for 30 min this was then diluted 10x into tm buffer and applied to the malvern zetasizer with values given as the average of n 3 scans 2 7 construction of positively charged c terminal p22 coat protein extensions salmonella p22 prophage strain uc 937 was used to genetically fuse peptide extensions of positively charged amino acid residues arginine and or lysine to the c terminus of coat protein p22 gp5 by a serine glycine linker sgsgs the peptide fusions constructed have properties detailed in table 1 one of the three peptide sequences chosen gp5 f1 resulted in a non functional phage product once constructed likely due to improper folding of the coat protein this peptide sequence lacks the sgsgs linker but remained relevant to the study dna editing was done using the lambda red mediated galk galactokinase recombineering methods described in marinelli et al 2012 the salmonella strain carrying the p22 prophage uc 937 and the plasmid pkd46 expressing the recombinase lambda red was grown in lb 50 μg ml ampicillin and 0 2 arabinose to od595 0 7 cells were then harvested and made competent for electroporation o callaghan and charbit 1990 using pcr gotaq mastermix cat m7133 and the recommended cycling conditions from product literature the gene galk was amplified from the plasmid pgalk using primers that added 50 base pair bp 5 and 3 tails containing dna sequence homology to regions flanking the site to be edited that is the 3 end of p22 coat protein gp5 this product was used for linear dna transformation electroporation of the above cells the galk phenotype was then selected for on minimal media containing 0 4 galactose replacement dna containing the final modified sequence was constructed by pcr amplification of wild type p22 dna using primers that supply sufficient tails of homology to regions flanking the galk site of the above transformant this product was used for transformation of the galk knock out strain in the presence of lambda red galk cells cells presumed to be successfully edited were selected for using minimal media containing 30 μg ml chloramphenicol for retention of the prophage and deoxy galactose which produces a toxic compound after being metabolized colony candidates were struck out onto lb chloramphenicol the correct insertion of the sequences was confirmed by pcr amplification of colonies followed by sanger sequencing of pcr products primer sequences for amplification of galk insertion and replacement dna using wild type p22 as the template are in table s1 2 8 transmission electron microscopy for tem visualization of nanoparticle phage interactions 2 1011 pfu ml phage dialyzed in 2x tm or 1x smg were mixed with an equal volume of 20 mg l nanoparticles in their respective stock buffer either 2 mm sodium citrate or h2o after 30 min at room temperature 3 μl of this mixture was laid onto formvar 400 mesh copper grids after 1 min the excess phage solution was removed with filter paper 3 ml of 1 uranyl acetate was then added to the grid left for 1 min and then removed with filter paper all negatively stained tem images were obtained using a tem model jeol jem 1400 2 9 statistical analysis pfu values were determined by dividing the pfu of the nanoparticle exposure test subject by the control no nanoparticle exposure this was done for each repeat number the pfu given is the mean of these experimental repeats with p values obtained from an unpaired t test significance was determined at an alpha level of 0 05 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 agnps and phage zeta potential characteristics upon taking dls zeta potential measurements of nanoparticles diluted in smg the primary physiological buffer used in these experiments we observed significant precipitation and increases in millivolt values from high negative to low negative high salt concentrations are known to cause an increase in current heat and ultimately a thinning and collapse of the electrical double layer resulting in significant reduction of zeta potential dukhovich et al 2003 skoglund et al 2017 when particles were diluted in a lower ionic strength buffer such as tm 10 mm tris ph 7 5 1 mm mgcl2 the values upon measurement aligned more closely with those of the stock medium since the effects of nanoparticle interaction are observable in either tm or smg these are the values used for comparative analysis all nanoparticle types produced negative values with pvp coated nanoparticles having consistently lower negativity when compared to uncoated silver nanoparticles in h2o table 1 the pvp coatings on some agnps are largely present to reduce aggregation in higher salt concentrations which may hinder biological activity and to reduce toxicity in higher organisms mirzaei et al 2017 the tradeoff is shorter shelf life in stock solution due to a greater instability compared with bare particles in h2o and a lower reaction potential negativity as noted in zeta potential specifications mirzaei et al 2017 dls size analysis of nanoparticles diluted in smg suggested the presence of aggregation and production of precipitate while the phage and nanoparticles diluted in tm did not yield errors related to precipitation and yielded values in line with those expected nearly all of the components of smg 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 5 100 mm nacl 10 mm mgso4 and 0 01 gelatin kapoor et al 1994 are capable of reacting with silver ions which are being slowly shed from the nanoparticles over time much of this precipitate likely consists of destabilized nanoparticles and insoluble compounds of ag with buffer components as detailed later in section 3 7 experimental data also discussed later does not suggest co precipitation of phage and nanoparticles as a mechanistic explanation for the effects observed the effects described in this report are seen experimentally when phages are incubated with nanoparticles in smg or tm buffers so it can be presumed that the sedimentation or agglomeration observed though dls when smg is used does not prevent phage interaction with nanoparticles or influence the observed effects on infection for phage agnps interaction experiments the magnitude of the surface charge of particles was inferred by measurement of the zeta potential the zeta potential is a measure of the electric field potential difference between the dispersion media in this case tm smg buffer 2 mm sodium citrate or h2o and the layer of fluid attached to the particle nanoparticles or phage while not equal to the surface potential of a particle zeta potential can be used to approximate the magnitude of the surface charge bhattacharjee 2016 table 1 shows the zeta potentials of the two isolated phages delftia tsuruhatensis phage rg2014 and klebsiella pneumoniae phage kl as well as the five other phages obtained from a different laboratory and the four p22 mutant constructs table 1 also shows the c terminal coat protein capsid sequence of each phage all phage species diluted in tm produced zeta potential values that were negative and similar to one another 3 2 bactericidal effects of agnps on host strains several publications have shown bactericidal effects of agnps on model bacterial populations seil and webster 2012 dakal et al 2016 in an attempt to evaluate this possibility with the host strains used cells were treated with concentrations of bare and pvp coated nanoparticles identical to those used in the one step growth curve experiments of phages and subjected to the same incubation and wash protocol after 70 min of growth the average time used for phage growth curve experiments no significant difference in colony forming units cfu fig s1 or spectrophotometric absorbance was observed in cells treated with nanoparticles as compared to cells not treated with nanoparticles while bactericidal effects have been observed at these concentrations in other systems seil and webster 2012 the short periods of exposure used in this study prior to dilution appear to have little if any effect on growth of the strains examined under our conditions nevertheless these results confirmed that agnps were not inhibitory to both bacteria at tested concentrations of agnps 3 3 the first experimental evidence of the effect of agnps on phage growth cycle first we tested the effect of silver agnps on the growth cycles of lytic phages kl of k pneumonia and rg2014 of d tsuruhatensis these lytic phages represent two distinctly different families of lytic phages with rg2014 belonging to podoviridae the short tailed phages and kl to siphoviridae long tailed phages in these experiments we used higher concentrations of agnps particularly during the phage nanoparticle incubation step than are generally present in the environment this was done for different reasons 1 there are no reports concerning concentration range as it relates to dose response available for agnp bacteriophage interactions and 2 we wanted to evaluate these interactions under worst case scenarios such as those where researchers initially used much higher concentrations of agnps to evaluate their effect on prokaryotic ecology under lab scale conditions sheng and liu 2017 liu et al 2017 vazquez munoz et al 2017 nevertheless these experiments promise to establish baseline information about agnp phage interactions which could be useful for future design of new experiments it should also be noted that lb the growth media used for all infectivity experiments contains peptides and proteins that chelate or otherwise react with silver ions corbisier et al 1999 since the effects described were observable and statistically significant using lb it was deemed reasonable to examine the effect of silver nanoparticles and their ions using semi physiological conditions in the sense that lb is optimized for growth of these bacteria as opposed to non chelating buffers typically used in the study of ion based toxicity uncoated agnps come in 2 mm sodium citrate as a suspension buffer it is known that some concentrations of sodium citrate negatively affect phage infectivity shafiai and thompson 1964 to determine whether sodium citrate at the concentrations used has an effect on phage infectivity during experiments a one step growth curve was conducted using phage in 1 mm sodium citrate without prior incubation with nanoparticles no effect from the citrate was observed under the conditions used fig s2 fig 1 a and b shows one step growth curves in lb for phage rg2014 infecting d tsuruhatensis arb 1 and phage kl infecting k pneumoniae with 10 min intervals of data after the phage were incubated with 10 mg l of uncoated and pvp coated silver nanoparticles in 0 5x smg as stated in the methods section smg buffer contains components known to react with silver nanoparticles and their associated ions gelatin in particular is known to chelate silver ions in solution thus reducing bioavailability in these experiments the final concentration of gelatin after dilution 0 005 is very low relative to studies that describe such interactions kapoor et al 1994 adverse effects on phage lytic growth cycle after agnp incubation were seen during infections of both phages in these experiments uncoated bare silver nanoparticles reduced infection yields of phage rg2014 by 89 n 1 and phage kl by 92 4 n 1 after 70 min of infection as compared with control experiments black circles where the phage mixture was not incubated with agnp that showed normal phage infection of its host bacteria pvp coated silver nanoparticles reduced the post infection pfu of rg2014 by 74 n 1 black squares to our surprise pvp coated silver agnps increased the yield of phage kl by 192 n 1 as shown by inverted black triangles in fig 1b growth curve experiments were also conducted lasting beyond 70 min for phage kl which demonstrated total lysis of culture to occur after 80 to 90 min see fig s3 much like in fig 1b fig s3 also shows significant differences in pfus for kl phage when incubated with agnps as compared with the control as sufficient growth and effects from agnps were consistently observable at t 70 minutes for phage kl as well as the additional phages used in this study this is the time point set for measurement of infectivity in all downstream experiments the observed increase in yield of phage kl but not of rg2014 with pvp coated silver nanoparticles prompted us to perform more control experiments using pure pvp powder presented later in this paper phage kl was incubated with 10 mg l bare silver agnps 10 mg l pvp coated silver agnps and pure pvp power dissolved to 10 mg l phage incubated with dissolved pvp powder was observed to have a similar elevation in phage yield as phage incubated with pvp coated silver nanoparticles n 2 fig 1c this suggests that the presence of pvp alone is sufficient to produce this effect in phage kl and has nothing to do with the presence of agnps in the case of phage kl the shedding of silver ions from pvp coated silver nanoparticles destabilizes them potentially causing the pvp held to the particle by weak van der waals forces to be released into solution at an unknown rate this de stabilization occurs over time in nanoparticle stock solution and is increased in salt containing buffer solutions levard et al 2013 this may result in the production of free pvp in solution which in the case of silver agnps is more likely to react with the virions to produce the observed effects than when bound as nanoparticle coating it was observed in fact that pfu yields of phage kl were significantly higher when incubated with pvp silver that was over a month old from the date of purchase compared to recently purchased nanoparticles used immediately after the receipt from the manufacturer n 2 fig 1d to verify the findings that pvp coated silver agnps caused an increase in yield in phage kl we conducted further experiments that included phage det7 a myoviridae phage infecting salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and several other phages belonging to different phage families all the phages used in this study were exposed to pvp coated nanoparticles results further discussed in section 3 5 and fig 3b and only kl and det7 phages were shown to display an increase in phage function kl and det7 phages have very different tail morphologies siphoviridae and myoviridae respectively and the only other siphoviridae tested 9na does not have a positive response to pvp structural comparisons between phage therefore provide few clues as to mechanism low concentrations of pvp has been reported to stabilize some proteins acting as a crowding agent that reduces aggregation under some conditions gombotz et al 1994 huan xiang 2013 tem images of kl particles do not appear to be aggregated however specific viral or host proteins involved in the attachment mechanism of these phages may be affected by pvp in such ways while interesting these mechanisms are subject to a different set of experiments outside the scope of this paper 3 4 transmission electron microscopy for phage agnp interactions tem was conducted on phage mixtures incubated with agnps to determine any resulting structural changes phages rg2014 and kl were incubated with agnps at various concentrations for 30 min at room temperature after which it was observed by tem that the majority of nanoparticles tended to be bound to the virions without evidence of aggregation fig 2 a c to determine whether nanoparticles would remain attached to phage post cesium chloride purification phage mixtures were incubated in a different set of experiments with 10 mg l and 500 mg l biopure 10 nm agnps nanoparticles both bare and pvp coated for 30 min at room temperature thereafter incubated phages were purified by cesium chloride step gradient centrifugation the purified phage samples were examined by tem and were determined not to have any nanoparticles attached to them nor to have any noticeable structural changes hypothetically if strong interactions between agnps and phages occurred heavier phages are not expected to be in the same density layer the free phages in that case either two layers will be seen in cesium chloride purification and or heavy loss of phage numbers will be recorded post ultracentrifugation however we did not see either two bands or loss of phages post ultracentrifugation next the cesium chloride purified phages which were initially incubated with nanoparticles were diluted to the same protein concentrations as a control cesium purified but not incubated with nanoparticles and used to infect the host using the described one step growth method after 70 min of infection no significant effects on pfus levels were observed fig 3a this is in contrast with experiments conducted simultaneously using phage that were not cesium purified after incubation with nanoparticles and which did show significant reductions in pfus fig 3a mechanistically these data suggest that the bonding of agnps with phages is not strong enough to allow agnps to remain attached to phages during cesium chloride purification and that no permanent structural changes are incurred at least under these tested conditions that produce inhibitory effects on infection after nanoparticles are removed 3 5 further confirmation of inhibitory effects of agnps on phage growth cycle using additional phage types and a mechanistic understanding to further test the effects of nanoparticles on infection of liquid bacterial cultures five additional phages were selected to include representatives from the families myoviridae det7 siphoviridae 9na and podoviridae p22 sp6 sf6 these along with the other two phages used in this study were incubated with agnps in 0 5x smg and used to infect their host after 70 min of growth the pfu in the cleared lysates were measured with the results shown in fig 3b as evident from fig 3b different phages are shown to be affected in different ways by different types of nanoparticles delftia phage rg2014 when incubated with bare agnps produced up to 92 4 n 5 p 0 05 fewer plaques closely aligning with what was reported earlier in this manuscript after 70 min of shaking compared to the plaques produced in the control phage kl produced 60 7 5 n 5 p 0 05 fewer plaques after exposure to bare silver nanoparticles after kl exposure to pvp silver nanoparticles pfu yield increased to 218 21 n 5 p 0 05 compared with the control phage det7 showed similar results as kl to include an even larger increase in pfu after incubation with pvp silver nanoparticles 263 63 9 n 3 p 0 05 phages p22 n 3 p 0 05 and 9na n 3 p 0 08 showed roughly 28 16 reductions in pfu when exposed to bare and pvp coated silver nanoparticles phage sp6 n 3 p 0 05 and sf6 n 3 p 0 05 showed no statistical reduction in pfu after exposure to silver nanoparticles tem images clearly depict nanoparticles sticking to the capsids of rg2014 and kl phage particles fig 2 and not to p22 fig 2f this suggests that the binding of nanoparticles to phage is related to the observed inhibitory effects on infection it also suggests that the exposed regions of the viral coat proteins of rg2014 kl and det7 share nanoparticle binding features strong enough to overcome the weaker repelling forces between the negatively charged surfaces of phage and nanoparticles that p22 9na sp6 and sf6 lack one such feature may be the presence of positive charges near the c terminus of the major capsid protein a region likely to extend from the surface of the capsid servid et al 2013 and a hypothesis we propose to test for further demonstration of the observed phage agnp interactions table 1 lists properties of the different phages tested to include zeta potential measurements the c terminal peptide sequence of the capsid protein the charge number q of the last 10 residues and the pfu percentage of surviving phage after exposure to bare silver nanoparticles as evident from this table phages rg2014 kl and det7 have positive charges in this region and were also shown to be negatively affected by silver nanoparticles in contrast other phages with negative charges at this location were either affected to a smaller degree or not at all by agnps these preliminary results imply a relationship between inhibition of phage lytic cycle and phage coat protein c terminus composition with the magnitude of these local charges appearing to correlate with both the ability to bind nanoparticles and the inhibitory effect of nanoparticles on infectivity table 1 fig 3b 3 6 effect of agnps on phage mutants with positively charged c terminal p22 coat protein extensions double stranded dna dsdna tailed phages major capsid proteins generally share a common protein fold but often have little recognizable amino acid sequence similarity there is usually an outer negatively charged region exposed to the surface and an inner positively charged region that allows the phage capsid to interact with the negatively charged dna to form a stable container tresset et al 2017 in cases where the 3d structures of these proteins are experimentally known the c terminus is often exposed at the surface and at varying distances fig s4 servid et al 2013 duda et al 1995 kizziah et al 2017 positively charged amino acid residues at this position would grant a distribution of positive charge over the surface via multiple 5 or 6 unit rings scattered around the capsid that could enable the observed binding effects even while the global interaction potentials of both interacting bodies are negative and repulsive in nature to test the hypothesis that exposed positive coat protein c termini of phages are associated with nanoparticle binding and greater susceptibility to silver agnp inhibition an attempt was made to induce the nanoparticle binding phenotype by using synthetic biology to attach positively charged amino acid residues to the c terminal end of coat protein bacteriophage p22 was chosen as the model system since it is not observed to bind to nanoparticles and has a well characterized capsid structure appearing to possess no surface positive charges hryc et al 2017 lambda red mediated galk recombineering methods were used to construct three separate p22 coat protein gp5 c terminal fusions table s1 p22gp5 f1 p22 vglpgqta pgagagan is a control mutant with an 8 amino acid extension having a small negative charge similar to wild type p22 at the c terminus q 0 39 p22gp5 f2 p22 vglpgqta sgsgs kar consist of an 8 amino acid extension that includes a serine glycine linker followed by a positively charged amino acid sequence and p22gp5 f3 p22 vglpgqta sgsgs rr is similar to f2 except that the sg linker is followed by two positive arginine residues these mutants after purification were incubated with bare silver nanoparticles for 30 min at room temperature in 1x tm buffer the standard buffer of p22 tem images show the two mutants with positive c terminal coat protein charges to have acquired the nanoparticle binding phenotype as compared to the wild type p22 control and the negatively charged control construct fig 2f size scattering measurements were taken using dls equipment for wild type and mutant p22 phages after incubating them with silver agnps fig s5 shows the scatters for the different conditions tested the average size of wild type phage in solution show no noticeable shift when incubated with agnp 72 01 nm 80 04 nm panels a and b in fig s5 on the other hand the p22 coat protein gp5 mutant with positive charge at c terminus p22gp5 f2 shows significant shift in average size from 97 84 nm 156 3 nm panels c and d in fig s5 in growth curve experiments n 3 p 0 05 the mutant phages with positive c terminal charges show substantial inhibition of infection from exposure to silver nanoparticles that the wild type strain and mutant control lack fig 4 a this suggests that the nanoparticle binding feature and the resulting inhibition of infection is indeed related to these exposed positively charged residues on the capsid and that these features can be artificially produced by genomic editing methods it is likely that the mechanism by which the metal nanoparticles disrupt phage functionality derive in part from the binding of nanoparticles across the surface of the phage capsid tem images do not appear to show preferential binding of nanoparticles to tail spike domains so the blocking of host receptor binding domains as the sole mechanism for loss of infectivity seems unlikely it is conceivable that the binding effect places nanoparticles in close proximity to phage or host receptor proteins during infection so that ag being shed continuously from the nanoparticles produces a more focused localized deleterious effect on phage attachment ag is known to complex with the sulfur groups of certain amino acids i e methionine and cysteine and in ways that can interfere with structure and function of proteins behra et al 2013 differences in the number of methionine and cysteine residues in tail spike domains tail needle proteins or host secondary receptor proteins may also account for the differences in ag sensitivity observed between rg2014 p22 9na sp6 and sf6 the mutant phages also appear to display higher levels of aggregation in tem when nanoparticles and the ability to bind them are present they in fact appear stuck together by a single nanoparticle linkage in the majority of images this may also reduce infectivity although in direct titers as opposed to phages used in growth curves phages incubated with nanoparticles for 30 min did not show difference in pfu if co aggregation of nanoparticles and phage were the issue one would expect to see loss in titer there as well 3 7 effect of ag on phage infectivity to assess the extent to which free silver ions released from nanoparticles affect phage infectivity nanoparticles were removed from silver nanoparticle solutions that had been mixed in di water or smg buffer by centrifugation these supernatants were analyzed for the presence of silver ions using icp ms analysis and the results are shown in table 2 it is notable that when nanoparticle solutions are diluted 2x into smg buffer for 30 min the ag concentration is substantially lower 72 lower than when diluted into h2o ag and can form complexes with the cl and so2 4 in smg buffer to form insoluble products e g agcl and ag2s behra et al 2013 this would explain the resulting drop in ag since these products would conceivably be pelleted out of solution with the nanoparticles upon centrifugation the solution obtained from centrifugation of bare nanoparticles in 0 5x smg containing 0 26 mg l ag and small soluble products but no nanoparticles was used to incubate phages rg2014 p22 and 9na to a final ag concentration of 0 005 mg l for inclusion in one step growth curve experiments exposure to ag under these conditions reduced the pfu of rg2014 by 43 7 5 n 3 p 0 05 9na by 24 4 n 3 p 0 05 and p22 by 27 2 n 3 p 0 05 figs 4b 3 these results suggest the presence of silver ions ag has a significant effect on infection of the phages tested regardless of any silver ion chelating reactive properties present in the growth media or phage np incubation buffers the ag inhibition of p22 and 9na which are not observed to bind to nanoparticles is similar in degree to that when exposed to non centrifuged nanoparticle solution rg2014 show inhibitory effects from ag as a 43 7 5 loss of pfu after 70 min of infection but up to 96 4 5 n 3 p 0 05 figs 4b 1 when incubated with nanoparticle solutions not centrifuged since nanoparticles bind to rg2014 this further suggests that the greater inhibitory effects may be due to the increased proximity of nanoparticles to the phage and or the host during infection and thus greater localized exposure to ag the inhibitory effects from ag seem to be in part due to action on host rather than viral proteins in another experiment a phage concentration 25x of that used in the other growth curve experiments was incubated with 10 mg l nanoparticles after which they were used to infect host stains at the typical moi of 0 0625 fig 4b this dilutes the amount of nanoparticle solution in the 1 ml culture 25x where effects from ag and nanoparticles are predicted to be negligible behra et al 2013 rg2014 goes onto produce an 85 3 n 3 p 0 05 reduction in pfu whereas p22 and 9na infected with normal efficiency n 3 p 0 05 this provides further evidence that the nanoparticles are bound to rg2014 since a similar degree of inhibitory effect is produced before or after dilution also since p22 and 9na which do not bind to nanoparticles did not produce the smaller 30 inhibition of infection from ag as previously observed when the nanoparticle solution is not diluted fig 4b this implies the effects are a result of ag interacting with host 4 conclusions bacteriophages are highly diverse with unique properties and means of infection and are affected by nanoparticles in different ways this report doesn t seek to explore the interactions between every combination of agnps and phages or describe the mechanism for every possible effect rather it describes limited examples of interactions to lay the groundwork for future research it provides 1 the first experimental evidence of effects from silver agnps on lytic growth curves of selected phages 2 experimental evidence that some phages are affected and others are not by metal agnps and 3 a small degree of mechanistic understandings of some components of inhibition using comparative genetics and targeted dna editing the experimentally observed interactions between nanoparticles pvp and bacteriophage virions reveal effects on infection efficiency which confer a clear fitness disadvantage or advantage in the case of nanoparticles coated with pvp to certain types of phages with the potential to affect microbial diversity in these experiments agnps and their ions are also shown to significantly affect phages at concentrations and incubation times in culture low enough to not affect growth of their host as inferred by the agnp bacteriocidal controls used in this study the ability to predict which species of phage is sensitive to nanoparticles and or their ions based off of simple coat protein sequence and structural predictions may answer questions regarding the populations affected further insights into the types and concentrations of nanoparticles required to manifest these effects will answer questions regarding the degree of impact as well declaration of

17862,the río de la plata estuary drains the second largest river basin of south america the occurrence of frequent cyanobacterial blooms of the microcystis and dolichospermum complex in the uruguayan coast are associated with high flows of uruguay river due to rainy years in summer 2019 a massive cyanobacterial bloom reached up to the uruguayan atlantic coast this study seeks to unveil the origin and the environmental conditions that favored the occurrence of the last cyanobacterial bloom in the río de la plata and to contribute with the development of an early warning system of cyanobacterial scum on montevideo beaches a complementary approach was applied with sentinel 2 imagery environmental data of monitoring programs of salto grande reservoir and montevideo beaches hydro meteorological information and hydroelectric dam operation images were analyzed with the normalized difference chlorophyll index ndci which allowed evaluating several water bodies within the same ranges positive anomalous rainfall increased river flows particularly that of uruguay and negro rivers which caused the opening of the dam spillways ndci maps showed that areas with high values ndci 0 06 in salto grande reservoir kept a similar surface area before and after the prolonged overflow period 8 7 7 8 km2 before and after in the río negro reservoirs however ndci 0 06 coverage remarkably changed 62 5 km2 palmar reservoir with a subsequent 56 fold reduction in the post discharge of surface water twenty days after opening the spillways montevideo beaches were closed to swimming and the ndci 0 06 surface reached 51 7 km2 in the río de la plata coast the dynamics of ndci areas the downstream bloom discharge and the predicted río de la plata residual currents suggest that the cyanobacterial bloom originated in the negro river palmar reservoir this bloom event was one of the worst that occurred in the río de la plata in last 20 years circulated along the uruguayan sub corridor to the atlantic coast along 690 km from its origin and lasted three months on montevideo coast this is the first study that addresses the impact of cyanobacterial blooms from the negro river reservoirs on the río de la plata estuary therefore the negro river basin is where the main efforts should be directed to mitigate massive cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacterial bloom remote sensing climate reservoir estuary early warning 1 introduction eutrophication is a global issue driven by population growth and changes in land management practices which is expected to

being the main cause of river flow fragmentation grill et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and cyanobacterial bloom occurrence burford et al 2007 as a consequence the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms has

cyanobacterial scum warning initiatives for swimmers one of the largest cyanobacterial blooms in terms of intensity and duration according to municipality of montevideo technical report risso et al 2018 took place during summer 2009 2010 from the following summer to the present time the use of sanitary flags to warn swimmers against the presence of cyanobacteria has been adopted despite the

encouraged the binational administrative commission for the uruguay river caru to launch in 2007 a vigilance program of river beaches from salto grande reservoir which included from 2012 the downstream beaches to the uruguay river mouth into the río de la plata last summer on january 27 2019 and under an ongoing enso event montevideo beaches set up sanitary flags due to the presence of cyanobacterial scum ten days before a large cyanobacterial bloom had been registered 142 km to the west of montevideo city along the río de la plata northern coast colonia department just two days after the cyanobacterial warning in montevideo the media reported cyanobacterial scum occurrence about 100 km to the east punta del este beach and up to 200 km from montevideo along the atlantic uruguayan coast la paloma rocha kruk et al 2019 the sanitary flags were hoisted until late march severely affecting the main uruguay beaches during the peak season this large bloom phenomenon could not be anticipated by the local environmental authorities and urgent measures had to be adopted in order to inform and protect swimmer s health the public concern about the health risks of this phenomenon was translated into greater media coverage than in previous summers as a result less foreign tourists visited uruguayan beaches during the summer of 2019 mainly due to the presence of cyanobacterial scum among other factors in a country where tourism contributes with about 8 of the gross domestic product consequently the national secretariat for the environment water and climate change of the presidency of the republic carried out the formation of a working group of specialists in cyanobacteria and water quality to address this problem to better understand the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms that cover large water extensions the combination of information of water quality monitoring programs and hydrological data along with remote sensing tools of large spatial and frequent temporal coverage are necessary palmer et al 2015 stumpf et al 2012 2016 wynne et al 2011 the use of remote sensing as an alternative tool to assess phytoplankton dynamics in ocean waters has been globally accepted gordon et al 1985 o reilly et al 1998 o reilly and werdell 2019 coastal estuarine and inland waters are optically more complex than ocean waters mainly due to the high light absorption capacity in the blue region of the colored dissolved organic matter cdom and suspended solids gons et al 2002 zheng et al 2015 in these waters the most successful approaches to estimate

and high cdom waters is that this cyanobacterial complex is scum forming by regulating buoyancy and producing large colonies microcystis that can be easily detected by remote sensing matthews et al 2012 the resulting heterogeneous and thick surface blooms are highly susceptible to wind transport which determines the accumulation of scum in lake surfaces and coastlines wu et al 2010 on the other hand the high heterogeneity of scum forming cyanobacteria imposes well known limitations on representative sampling in order to determine in situ concentration of pigments by analytical methods fluorometry and biovolume estimations alcántara et al 2018 mur et al 1999 these constraints also apply to remote sensing since the heterogeneity of the surface biomass needs an adequate spatial resolution a recent study has postulated that the best performance among the spectral bands of seven satellites was attained with sentinel 2 european space agency in terms of spatial resolution 10 20 and 60 m and the use of red and near infrared regions to identify cyanobacterial blooms of microcystis and dolichospermum complex in the salto grande reservoir of the uruguay river drozd et al 2019 the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible origin and the environmental conditions under which large cyanobacterial blooms composed of the microcystis and dolichospermum complex took place in the río de la plata in the summer 2019 and to propose the framework of an early warning system databases from montevideo and salto grande reservoir monitoring programs of two contrasting years 2018 2019 were analyzed along with meteorological data and the hydrological variability of paraná uruguay and negro rivers the information from the dam operations of salto grande and negro river reservoirs was combined with ndci maps obtained during closed and open spillway flows as well as with ndci maps of the inner río de la plata northern coast colonia and outer río de la plata at montevideo city this information is key to advance in conceptual and numerical predictive models and to focus efforts in mitigation measures directed at controlling cyanobacterial growth in hot spots located in sub basins the results allow the proposal of a simple and qualitative early warning system of cyanobacterial scum for northern río de la plata coast based in open online data the analysis of the 2019 case study on massive cyanobacterial bloom in río de la plata may afford some insight into the promoting environmental factors as well as the local and upstream possible origins as driving factors of bloom formation and transport downstream to estuaries and the ocean 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the río de la plata estuary drains the second largest river basin of south america 3 200 000 km2 which spreads over five countries argentina brazil bolivia paraguay and uruguay and contains a population estimated at nearly 160 million inhabitants fig 1 the paraná and the uruguay river are the major tributary rivers with flows generally rising in winter 26 000 m3 s 1 and yielding low values in summer 16 000 m3 s 1 in the uruguay river mean flow 5 500 m3 s 1 is the salto grande reservoir area 750 km2 a binational hydroelectric dam located 340 km from the mouth with the río de la plata fig 1 the negro river mean flow 650 m3 s 1 is the largest river in uruguay basin area 68 450 km2 and 750 km length and has three hydroelectric dams bonete area 1 070 km2 located upstream baygorria 100 km2 in the middle and palmar 320 km2 downstream the negro river empties into the uruguay river 55 km from the mouth of the latter in the río de la plata fig 1 the estuary of the río de la plata is strongly impacted by enso events with large fluctuations in river inflow from an average of 25 000 m3 s 1 and 32 933 to 22 039 m3 s 1 during el niño and la niña neutral periods respectively muniz et al 2019 nagy et al 2008 montevideo is located to the north and middle of the río de la plata covering 50 km of the coastline with over 15 sandy beaches monitored regularly by the municipality of montevideo since the 90s risso et al 2018 fig 1 2 2 field data daily flow data from paraná river was obtained from the ina national water and sewer institute argentina at the hydrological station of rosario city 32 58 22 04 s 60 37 5 50 w daily uruguay river flow and spillway flow data from salto grande dam were provided by joint technical commission ctm data from the negro river flow and spillway flows of the palmar baygorria and bonete dams were provided by the national administration of power plants and electrical transmissions ute the negro river flow data was collected from the hydrological station at mercedes city 33 14 45 37 s 58 2 17 49 w physicochemical data temperature turbidity conductivity and chlorophyll a from montevideo beaches were provided by the water quality unit environmental control and evaluation service municipality of montevideo the data period covered from january 2017 to april 2019 n 626 and data was collected from 15 sampling stations located at urban and suburban beaches fig 1 water samples were collected by technicians subsuperficially by entering the water up to waist height sample bottles were immediately refrigerated 4 c until arriving to the laboratory for chemical analysis data from salto grande reservoir was provided by ctm and ranged from january 2018 to february 2019 n 242 from seven stations located at a southern area near the dam fig 1 samplings in salto grande reservoir were performed by boat and samples were taken with water sampler chlorophyll a analysis by montevideo municipality and salto grande laboratories was performed with 10 200 h method apha 2005 and calculated according to lorenzen 1967 total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn data from salto grande and negro river were performed following apha 2005 by salto grande and the environmental national directorate dinama laboratories respectively negro river tp and tn reservoirs bonete n 33 baygorria n 27 and palmar n 35 from july 2017 to 2019 was obtained from the geoportal of dinama https www dinama gub uy oan geoportal chl a data from negro river reservoirs was not included because of only few records were available 4 12 historical records of visual monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms on montevideo beaches from 2001 to 2019 were provided by the municipality of montevideo in other río de la plata colonia san josé and maldonado departments and atlantic beaches maldonado and rocha departments records were obtained from the geoportal of dinama data available from january 2015 to december 2019 the criteria used for visual detection is divided in three levels absence presence and cyanobacterial scum the presence of cyanobacteria is reported by technical personnel when dispersed colonies of cyanobacteria are not visible from distance by naked eye but are visible when approaching to the water surface cyanobacterial scum is defined when the density of colonies is very high and green stain appears in the water surface being visible from distance 2 3 satellite image acquisition and processing the remote sensing of algal blooms introduces potential errors ascribed mainly to the algorithms used the atmospheric correction and the image processing steps however the tool power when it comes to detecting spatial patterns and dynamics should be highlighted beck et al 2016 the index calibration for the accurate prediction of chl a concentrations requires numerous in situ observations of a given water body in line with remote observation pahlevan et al 2016 since this work aims to evaluate the spatial dynamics of large cumulative cyanobacterial blooms in several reservoirs and in the río de la plata estuary the qualitative comparison of ndci was used the ndci was calculated according to mishra and mishra 2012 1 ndci r r s 705 r r s 665 r r s 705 r r s 665 where rrs 705 and rrs 665 are reflectances in the near infrared and in the red regions in order to calculate bloom areas km2 a value of ndci was used as a reference to map the bloom contours the quadratic function of mishra and mishra 2012 allows estimating chl a concentrations as follows 2 chl a μ g l 1 194 325 ndci 2 86 115 ndci 14 039 the eq 2 has been used successfully to assess massive blooms in coastal waters and lakes and to perform cross validations mishra et al 2018 page et al 2018 in this study the estimation of chl a concentration gradients was avoided however a chl a threshold was estimated as a reference to calculate bloom areas by using eq 2 a reference lower limit of 20 μg chl a l 1 was defined to map bloom areas which corresponds to a ndci value of approximately 0 06 the chl a 20 μg l 1 criteria has been used by montevideo municipality to define poor water quality conditions risso et al 2018 which was adopted from the u s environmental protection agency criteria for coastal regions usepa 2008 the range 20 μg chl a l 1 also includes mostly of the who guidance level 1 and 2 for bathing 10 50 μg chl a l 1 and 50 μg chl a l 1 respectively chorus and bartram 1999 therefore values of ndci 0 06 were considered for mapping the surface area of cyanobacterial blooms sentinel 2 esa msi images were downloaded from the l1c level and atmospherically corrected with the dark fit spectrum method the earth and cloud pixels were masked and ndci was calculated with a fixed range using acolite software vanhellemont and ruddick 2016 2 4 meteorological information the nasa giovanni data analysis system http giovanni

analysis the comparisons of physicochemical water variables between summers 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 on montevideo beaches and records of visual monitoring of cyanobacterial scum were conducted with the kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests since data did not fulfill the prerequisites of the parametric statistical tests the conover iman post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons conover and iman 1976 chlorophyll a data from montevideo and salto grande reservoir was used for the median and maximum values among sampling stations for each sampling date and along the studied period non parametric correlation analyses spearman test with p value 0 05 st were performed between environmental variables and chl a as regards correlation analyzes only summer and autumn data was included 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 in order to minimize the existing spatial correlation among beaches two were selected for the analysis m1 and m6 fig 1 located to the west and east of montevideo city respectively in order to analyze the effect of flows in chl a at montevideo beaches backward time spans of flows were considered 0 5 10 15 and 20 days to analyze the effect of main tributaries for instance variables were generated from the daily flow data of the paraná river negro river and uruguay river at salto grande reservoir flow of the same day pr0 nr0 sg0 and 20 days ago pr20 nr20 sg20 daily flows in backward mode were used because it was the variable that depicted trends in the best way the wind was analyzed according to its components zonal zonw and meridional merw these components reflect the intensity vector module and wind direction sign the zonal component refers to the wind speed in the east west direction where the negative sign indicates east winds and the positive west winds on the other hand the southern component is indicated with a positive sign while the northern with a negative one in addition generalized linear models glm with lognormal distribution were used to estimate the effect of environmental variables temperature turbidity conductivity wind direction flow on chl a as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass supplementary material the variables introduced in the models showed a correlation of less than 0 7 in order to avoid collinear variables dormann et al 2013 total nutrient data was not included in the model due to the relative low available records the explanatory variables were centered and standardized to improve the interpretation of the effects schielzeth 2010 the final explanatory variables used in the glm models supplementary material were turbidity turb temperature temp conductivity k zonal wind zonw meridional wind merw beach year negro river nr salto grande sg and paraná river flows at n days ago

residual analysis models were made with the lme 4 package and the selection by aic with mass all statistical analyzes were conducted with the r version 3 5 2 software r core team 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions monthly accumulated precipitation values during the summer 2018 were close to the summer historical mean for the northern part of uruguay artigas 106 69 mm month 1 except for february 100 mm month 1 with neutral to negative anomalies for the rest of the country the precipitation pattern in 2019 showed different tendencies with positive anomalies at the beginning of the summer in the southern region montevideo 150 mm month 1 followed by high precipitation records from the central to the northern region in january precipitation 465 and 670 mm month 1 salto and artigas respectively the strong positive precipitation anomaly 535 mm month 1 occurred in january 2019 over the uruguay river and upstream salto grande reservoir fig 2 the most frequent average wind direction in montevideo city during both summers yielded similar trends fig s1 nonetheless the most frequent wind direction displayed a clearer pattern in 2018 from the nne and ese quadrants 14 3 13 5 respectively than in 2019 9 6 11 0 nne and ese quadrants respectively in the summer of 2019 higher frequencies from n nnw w and sse directions were recorded as compared to 2018 wind speed showed similar frequency distributions between summers with a most frequent velocity range of 13 16 km h 1 22 26 in 2018 and 2019 respectively however wind speeds between 21 and 24 km h 1 were more frequent in 2018 than in the following summer 17 2 and 9 8 in 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 2 records of visual monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms the visual detection of cyanobacterial presence and scum on montevideo beaches evaluated as the percentage of sampling days with visual detection and scum per year shows higher significant records from 2011 to 2019 than in previous decade fig 3 a k w p 0 001 maximum records of cyanobacterial presence and scum detection in the last two decades occurred in the 2019 bloom event 71 4 and 15 3 of sampling days with visual detection presence and scum respectively the secondary massive bloom events considering scum records occurred in 2009 2010 24 9 and 14 0 and 2015 2016 summers 37 8 and 10 9 presence and scum respectively visual monitoring from other coastal departments fig 3b show high records in canelones coast with few cases in western río de la plata colonia and zero cases in the atlantic coast rocha in the case of montevideo canelones trough the río de la plata limit with the atlantic ocean maldonado higher records are shown in 2019 than in previous years although no statistically significant fig 3b cyanobacterial scum detection along the coast was more widespread in 2016 and 2019 no scum records were reported in maldonado and rocha the río de la plata coastline covered by the bloom in 2019 was at least 307 km if considering the distance from colonia to maldonado punta del este the bloom lasted in montevideo beaches for 92 days from the first scum technical report on january 28 to the last one on april 29 2019 3 3 hydrological conditions during the study period the paraná and uruguay rivers yielded mean flow values above the historical mean flows 21 and 24 above the historical mean paraná and uruguay rivers respectively fig 4 the paraná river presented minimum flow values in late september 2018 10 442 m3 s 1 while the uruguay river did so in early january 2018 1 397 m3 s 1 maximum flow values in both rivers were recorded in the summer of 2019 february 03 2019 34 668 m3 s 1 january 19 2019 30 002 m3 s 1 paraná and uruguay rivers respectively interestingly the maximum flow recorded in the uruguay river in january 2019 equaled and even exceeded the paraná river flow for few days fig 4c considering that the historical mean paraná river flow is 3 fold higher than the uruguay river mean flow similarly negro river showed high flows from september to late october 2018 austral spring with a second flow increase from december 2018 throughout the summer of 2019 fig 4 the high flow values registered in uruguay and negro rivers in the summer of 2019 are clearly related to the positive high precipitation anomalies recorded in january particularly in the uruguay river fig 4 also shows the periods of spillway flows in salto grande and palmar hydroelectric dams during the summer of 2018 the spillways were closed due to the low river flows while from late august 2018 to january 2019 they were opened several times 3 4 physicochemical conditions of water bodies the chl a values from the salto grande reservoir ranged from maximum median values in march 2018 40 9 μg l 1 to lowest in the late winter of 2018 2 9 μg l 1 before the flow increase in january 2019 chl a decreased from a median of 19 4 μg l 1 to 8 0 μg l 1 at flow peak fig 4a after the flooding chl a increased up to 16 0 μg

three summer months of 2019 range 15 17 to 32 11 ms cm 1 and 3 26 to 4 33 ms cm 1 summer 2018 and 2019 respectively chl a showed maximum median values of 80 6 μg l 1 in the summer of 2019 maximum chl

montevideo beaches five glm models were run with river flows registered at 0 5 10 15 and 20 backward days table s1 the models with the highest deviance were the ones obtained with flows at 5 and 10 backward days table s1 as a general trend the paraná river flow did not correlate with chl a in both years while the negro river flow from day 5 was negatively correlated in 2018 and positively in 2019 the salto grande flow was positively correlated in 2018 and negatively in 2019 on day 0 and 5 and became positive from day 10 consistently chl a correlated positively with temperature and turbidity and negatively with conductivity the southern wind also had a consistent positive effect table s1 the spearman correlation analysis showed similar general trends as the glm models fig s4 in the summer of 2018 chl a was positively correlated with conductivity and temperature 0 36 and 0 60 respectively and negatively with paraná river flow on day 15 and 20 0 38 and 0 57 respectively in the summer of 2019 chl a was positively correlated with salto grande flow on day 20 although a higher coefficient was obtained on day 15 0 28 and 0 36 respectively also with the southern winds 0 4 interestingly the increase in correlation coefficients of salto grande flows with montevideo chl a ranged from slightly negative on day 0 to maximum positive on day 15 while a consistent negative trend was observed in paraná river flows from day 0 20 in the summer of 2018 negatively correlations were obtained with conductivity 0 41 in 2019 fig s4 3 6 ndci map analysis the colored maps of salto grande reservoir show a similar pattern of negative ndci values in the central water body and maximum positive ones in the reservoir arms particularly those located to the western side from december 2018 to february 2019 fig 5 the spillway flow behavior of salto grande dam exhibited a short overflow period december 25 map followed by eight days of spillway closed conditions from december 31 2018 to january 7 2019 during this period the reservoir western arms showed ndci 0 06 values that covered 8 7 km2 then the high overflow period occurred from january 7 to february 3 unfortunately maps with clearer atmosphere conditions could not be obtained at the end of the overflow period ndci 0 06 values remained in the western and even eastern arms of salto grande reservoir fig 5 with a similar surface coverage as that observed before 7 8 km2 ndci maps from negro river reservoirs were obtained before and after a spillway flow period from december 13 to 25 2018 for palmar dam and from december 16 to 23 2018 for bonete dam fig 6 before the december spillway flow only bonete reservoir showed high ndci values particularly in the central water body and the southern arm ndci 0 06 12 6 km2 after the overflows of bonete and palmar dams the maximum ndci values were registered close to bonete dam restricted to a small area ndci 0 06 0 5 km2 the central water body showed low values however a large cloudy area was present in the palmar reservoir the area with ndci 0 06 values increased from 1 9 km2 to 62 5 km2 in less than 25 days fig 6 which covered the central water body and its arms from january 5 a similar long lasting overflow as that registered in salto grande reservoir was observed in palmar until february 7 and bonete january 10 to february 9 maps obtained for palmar at the end of january showed that ndci 0 06 decreased 56 fold negative values were recorded in the main water body with very small areas of positive ndci values on the southern coast ndci 0 06 1 1 km2 similarly at the end of the spillway flow in bonete reservoir the central water body showed negative ndci values except for a dense accumulation found in the southern arm ndci 0 06 4 3 km2 maps of the río de la plata estuary were obtained short after the high flow of the uruguay river registered in january 2019 that equaled the paraná flow january 21 fig 7 ndci values were within the negative range except for some restricted coastal areas between colonia and san josé departments and santa lucía river mouth d e areas ndci 0 06 1 0 km2 fig 7 the next maps were obtained at decreased uruguay river flow january 31 higher ndci values at the western coast of río de la plata san josé coast and particularly along montevideo coast d e areas ndci 0 06 6 4 km2 can be observed the sanitary flags of the summer 2019 were hoisted on montevideo beaches on january 27 and kept flying for as long as the summer lasted on february 5 the ndci 0 06 surface increased almost 8 6 fold which appeared along colonia san josé and montevideo coast with large accumulations in santa lucía river mouth d e areas ndci 0 06 51 7 km2 it is worth noticing that after the high uruguay river flow the turbidity front passed montevideo and advanced towards the eastern coast this front was no observed on february 5 still positive and high ndci values were derived from the inner río de la plata front 4 discussion this study accounts for the first evidence of the origin of one of the worst massive cyanobacterial blooms that occurred in the río de la plata estuary in the last 20 years this remarkable bloom resulted from a combination of biomass accumulation in negro river reservoirs and the subsequent hydrological transport by the uruguay river along the northern río de la plata coast driven by positive precipitation anomalies that occurred in central to northern uruguay the palmar reservoir at negro river holds frequently toxic blooms of microcystis and dolichospermum complex md complex that can reach high biomasses close to 50 mm3 l 1 cyanobacterial biovolume gonzález piana et al 2017 a secondary source of high surface chl a concentrations was identified in salto grande reservoir in areas were blooms of md complex are typically located bordet et al 2017 o farrell et al 2012 however said biomass accumulation remained in the same locations after the prolonged reservoir overflow in january 2019 the uruguay river is the main water conveyor in the northern río de la plata coast and functions as a high freshwater flow input with influence on the chl a of montevideo beaches the displacement of freshwater masses along the montevideo coast resulted in higher temperatures and lower conductivity values than the previous summer table 1 in general the correlation analyses show that high temperatures freshwater like conditions and also southern winds are consistently associated with high chl a in montevideo conditions that are favorable for the appearance of high cyanobacterial biomass on this site haakonsson et al 2020 a recent probabilistic modeling using only temperature an conductivity as explanatory variables successful predicted the cyanobacterial biovolume in a río de la plata site between san josé and montevideo coast where strong variations in conductivity occur haakonsson et al 2020 a third source of cyanobacteria is suggested to be generated in the río de la plata estuary itself local bloom as it briefly occurred during the summer of 2018 this short term bloom occurrence could be the result of the growth of local cyanobacterial populations favored by the prevailing eutrophic conditions of the estuary therefore a bloom early warning system based on hydro meteorological models combined with the analysis of ndci satellite imagery for detection of freshwater masses displacing with cyanobacterial blooms and probabilistic modeling using minimal in situ measurements haakonsson et al 2020 is needed to guide decision makers thus ongoing summer monitoring routines e g sampling frequency toxin analyses can be adjusted according to predicted scenarios and take early measures to avoid swimmers contact with cyanobacterial scum the strong social impact of the 2019 bloom event was reflected in intense media coverage and fewer domestic and foreign tourists who visited uruguayan beaches during the summer with a particular impact on the atlantic coast where blooms of freshwater cyanobacteria are not expected this is the first study that addresses the impact that cyanobacterial blooms on the negro river reservoirs have on the bloom events of the río de la plata north coast the use of ndci in several water bodies allowed us to determine that the negro river reservoirs and particularly palmar were the main biomass generators that exported large surface blooms ndci 0 06 62 5 and 1 1 km2 before and after the opening of spillway flow respectively downstream during dam overflow in turn uruguay river functions more as a high flow input than as a biomass producer due to its high and short term flow peaks the chl a of the salto grande reservoir did not show high concentrations one month before the start of the spillway overflow period maximum median 17 3 μg chl a l 1 particularly in the central sampling station s4 max 14 0 μg chl a l 1 for example areas with high surface chl a concentrations remained in the same reservoir locations even after the high flow period that was 4 6 fold above the mean historical salto grande outflow max 25 368 m3 s 1 january 19 2019 the confinement of the md complex in the western arms of the salto grande reservoir is frequently observed bordet et al 2017 o farrell et al 2012 even with human intoxication reports giannuzzi et al 2011 the in situ chl a measurements are consistent with the ndci gradients mapped in the central body of the salto grande reservoir ndci 0 06 8 7 and 7 8 km2 before and after the spillway overflow respectively as low ndci values were observed at the central water body while high ndci values were confined to the reservoir arms regardless of whether the spillways were open or closed thus it was not possible to detect a biomass transport event in salto grande after opening the spillway despite the expectation of inocula outflow this is in agreement with caru reports of satellite imagery analysis drozd 2016 vigilance of uruguay river beaches by caru detected cyanobacterial presence alert level i chorus and bartram 1999 from january 9 to february 5 2019 close to the uruguay river mouth into río de la plata and downstream negro river mouth nueva palmira uruguay caru 2019 evidence of cyanobacterial fluvial transport was confirmed by genotypes detection of the md complex found from salto grande reservoir and along the uruguay river and through the río de la plata until the marine environment martínez de la escalera et al 2017 moreover the uruguay river and particularly salto grande reservoir has been considered the main source of cyanobacterial presence and bloom events on the río de la plata north coast martínez de la escaleral et al 2017 pírez et al 2013 risso et al 2018 however the impact of the río negro reservoirs on the cyanobacteria blooms of the río de la plata had not been reported to date therefore this study offer a new insight for future studies in order to evaluate under which hydrological and environmental conditions salto grande and negro river reservoir pose jointly or alternately a major influence in río de la plata bloom development and transport the negro river reservoirs frequently hold cyanobacterial blooms of the toxic md complex gonzález piana et al 2017 composed of the two most commonly found cyanobacterial genera in uruguay haakonsson et al 2017 in this study however the low monitoring frequency of water quality in negro river reservoirs about 3 sampling dates per year prevented a proper temporal evaluation of bloom development and the availability of supporting information for ndci maps plotting despite the scarce information it is well known that palmar reservoir holds higher cyanobacterial biomass than bonete and baygorria reservoirs gonzález piana et al 2017 and that it has been classified as hypereutrophic reservoir while the last two have been classified as eutrophic haakonsson et al 2017 this is in agreement with the significant higher tp values found in palmar compared to those in the upper negro river reservoirs and salto grande palmar reservoir is surrounded by a more intense soils use than the other two reservoirs and part of its catchment has been experienced the highest agriculture intensification of the country in the last decade gazzano et al 2019 therefore periods of closed palmar dam spillway in summer may be critical for the accumulation of md complex from upper reservoirs and its subsequent exponential growth due to the higher amount of nutrients available therefore drastic reductions of n and p loads from the catchment should be considered to control harmful blooms and avoid long term resilience of cyanobacterial populations aubriot 2018 aubriot and bonilla 2018 burford et al 2019 this is of particular concern in a region where an increase in n and p loads due to agriculture intensification and point source discharge is expected as well as high rainfall variability and temperature manta and alcántara 2018 martín gómez et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 therefore the efforts to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in the uruguayan coast of the río de la plata should be directed towards the negro river reservoirs and its basin in order to effectively decrease bloom impact cyanobacterial blooms in the uruguayan coast of río de la plata is mainly associated with enso events in which the high river discharge due to positive precipitation anomalies facilitates the scum transport along the coastline and beaches particularly associated with high flow periods of the uruguay river pírez et al 2013 however the río de la plata is not just a cyanobacterial bloom receiver since the prevalent eutrophic conditions of the estuary are sufficient to sustain cyanobacterial growth in contrast to what was observed in the uruguayan coast of the río de la plata high densities of cyanobacteria on the argentinean coast occurs less frequently than in the north coast and are associated to the neutral phases of the southern climatic anomalies with no significant association with the paraná river discharge regimes sathicq et al 2015 these results are in line with the observation of a cyanobacterial scum on montevideo beaches during one day in the summer of 2018 january 13 which may resulted from the río de la plata development of existing md complex inocula and the prevailing eutrophic conditions brugnoli et al 2019 nagy et al 2002 montevideo is located between the main turbidity front mtf salinity 1 3 and the secondary marine front smf salinity 10 12 the former is strongly affected by the wind direction and therefore it can move more than 200 km from w to e nagy et al 2008 thus it is expected that as western winds facilitate turbidity front and freshwater transport to the marine environment nagy et al 2008 southern winds can accumulate scum on the beaches as identified in the correlation and linear regression analysis intermediate wind speed is well known to be the main factor for the transport and accumulation of surface cyanobacterial md complex scum wang et al 2016 therefore local río de la plata blooms can be transported from mtf to montevideo coast and even to the eastern canelones department persisting wind direction from the southern quadrants is determinant for scum accumulation on beaches during average river discharge summer conditions this study suggests that paraná river was not the main source of cyanobacterial blooms in the río de la plata in summer 2019 the yacyretá reservoir 27 28 s 56 44 w surface 1600 km2 placed in the paraná river and located about 1200 km upstream río de la plata featured microcystis spp blooms aguilera et al 2018 o farrell et al 2019 10 years after its construction in 1994 february to april 2004 2005 and 2008 which is in line with prolonged drought periods devercelli et al 2014 coincidently the presence of cyanobacterial scum has been reported from summer 2005 on the argentinean coast andrinolo et al 2007 sathicq et al 2014 while some studies have postulated that md complex blooms were detected 200 km downstream yacyretá reservoir but they disappeared after paraguay s river confluence forastier et al 2016 others have reported severe toxic microcystis sp blooms during that same period on the argentinean río de la plata coast andrinolo et al 2007 giannuzzi et al 2012 suggesting a common origin in the upper paraná river the presence of md complex blooms on the argentinean río de la plata coast seems to have an opposite trend if compared to the effect of enso events on the uruguayan coast while high microcystis sp densities are recorded on the argentinean coast during neutral and la niña periods dry periods sathicq et al 2014 2015 records of cyanobacterial scum on montevideo beaches were within the lowest during those years risso et al 2018 therefore it is suggested that contrasting hydrological conditions favor the occurrence of md complex blooms in northern mean to high flows and southern mean to low flows coast of río de la plata although in the latter case with less frequency of occurrence the differences in cyanobacterial scum occurrence on the northern and southern coast of río de la plata particularly considering bloom persistence and extent along the coastline can be explained by the paraná and uruguay river corridor and sub corridor flow patterns of the río de la plata estuary piedra cueva and fossati 2007 the numerical modeling performed by piedra cueva and fossati 2007 suggested that the uruguay and northern paraná rivers paraná bravo sauce flow through a corridor bounded by the uruguayan northern coast and the southern corridor associated with the paraná bravo sauce river discharge particularly the uruguay river flows through the río de la plata s sub corridor bounded by the uruguayan coast and the path associated with the uruguay river discharge fossati and piedra cueva 2013 piedra cueva and fossati 2007 therefore the transport of surface blooms in this study which was restricted to the northern coast of río de la plata is consistent with the predictions made by the hydrological modeling of piedra cueva and fossati 2007 in which slow northern surface residual currents correspond mainly to the uruguay river discharge taking into account the current results it is possible to postulate that the 2019 bloom event can be considered as the worst bloom that occurred in the río de la plata in the last 20 years in terms of distance of displacement and total summer days with cyanobacterial presence and scum in the coastline compared to the severe events of 2009 2010 and 2015 2016 the distance that the bloom displaced from its origin site to the furthest end point to the end of the uruguay river is about 208 km considering the palmar reservoir as the bloom expansion and discharge site if adding the distance along the coastline to the furthest sampling point in which cyanobacterial presence was recorded punta del este maldonado the total displacement distance can be set at 600 km if we consider the report of md complex found on the atlantic coast at la paloma rocha kruk et al 2019 the total distance displaced from the 2019 bloom event must have reached 690 km in fact the 2019 bloom event showed the strongest impact in eastern beaches in the light of current results a simple cyanobacterial bloom early warning system for the northern coast of the río de la plata can be outlined based on a precautionary principle to minimize the contact of swimmers with scum fig s5 in order to facilitate the rapid decision making process the proposal only requires on line open data regardless of the in situ measurements and water laboratory analyses results this proposal acknowledges that the final public warning sanitary flag is in the hands of the lifeguards at the assigned beaches when they detect the scum nonetheless it can be useful for decision makers at montevideo municipality in order to anticipate different scenarios the warning system requires a surveillance department for data acquisition meteorological and hydrological data and the remote sensing analysis of bloom formation by ndci in salto grande negro river reservoirs and northwestern río de la plata coast future studies are needed to calibrate the ndci data in order to validate the chl a prediction in those water bodies this warning system can be improved by hydrological modeling in order to include quantitative information also in situ online fluorometry can complement remote sensing although being spatially limited this combined approach provides useful information for decision makers to anticipate possible scenarios and help prevent the contact of swimmers with cyanobacterial scum as well as other harmful effects the cyanobacterial bloom early warning system proposal needs to be validated in future studies this study shows the first evidence that one of the worst cyanobacterial blooms of last two decades in río de la plata estuary was originated in negro river reservoirs strong rainfall events during the enso period occurred in northern uruguay and middle to lower uruguay river basin facilitating the bloom discharge from palmar negro river reservoir then the hydrological transport by high flows of uruguay river pushed the surface bloom along the northern río de la plata coast and the atlantic ocean palmar reservoir presents hypereutrophic conditions that may additionally promote bloom development as compared to upper eutrophic reservoirs in spite of the fact that salto grande reservoir may generate extended cyanobacterial blooms under particular hydrological regimes bordet et al 2017 this reservoir showed lower tp than negro river reservoirs and did not seem to supply significant cyanobacterial biomasses in the present event this study shows the need of to increase the frequency and space coverage of negro river monitoring program in order to enhance the knowledge about the environmental factors involved in bloom formation and temporal trends despite the scarce information available on negro river efforts directed at mitigating cyanobacterial blooms should be centered on negro river basin in order to effectively decrease the impact of blooms in the uruguayan coast 5 conclusions the combination of sentinel 2 imagery open in situ data and hydrometeorological analyzes revealed the first evidence of the impact that cyanobacterial blooms of the río negro reservoirs have on the massive bloom events on the río de la plata northern coast and the nearby atlantic ocean the cyanobacterial bloom developed first in bonete reservoir and it was then transported downstream to palmar reservoir after a short period of spillway overflow where bloom further developed until covering a maximum surface area of 62 5 km2 ndci 0 06 driven by anomalous precipitations the next event of open spillway discharged the major bloom biomass to the overflowed uruguay river and the río de la plata the palmar reservoir presents hypereutrophic conditions that promote the formation of massive blooms while salto grande reservoir may generate cyanobacterial blooms under high flows but typically confined in the western arms similarly the río de la plata can also develop local cyanobacterial blooms under mean summer flows however those blooms are confined to western coastal areas and occur during short time periods the cyanobacterial bloom of summer of 2019 was the largest of the decade which displaced 690 km to the atlantic ocean and lasted 92 days on montevideo beaches mitigation measures of eutrophication are in urgent need in the negro river basin in order to control the development of large cyanobacterial biomasses in the context of climate variability scenarios a simple early warning system of cyanobacterial blooms on montevideo beaches is proposed subject to future validations this approach will facilitate the rapid decision making process to anticipate possible scenarios and help to prevent the contact of swimmers with cyanobacterial scum and the resulting harmful effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17862,the río de la plata estuary drains the second largest river basin of south america the occurrence of frequent cyanobacterial blooms of the microcystis and dolichospermum complex in the uruguayan coast are associated with high flows of uruguay river due to rainy years in summer 2019 a massive cyanobacterial bloom reached up to the uruguayan atlantic coast this study seeks to unveil the origin and the environmental conditions that favored the occurrence of the last cyanobacterial bloom in the río de la plata and to contribute with the development of an early warning system of cyanobacterial scum on montevideo beaches a complementary approach was applied with sentinel 2 imagery environmental data of monitoring programs of salto grande reservoir and montevideo beaches hydro meteorological information and hydroelectric dam operation images were analyzed with the normalized difference chlorophyll index ndci which allowed evaluating several water bodies within the same ranges positive anomalous rainfall increased river flows particularly that of uruguay and negro rivers which caused the opening of the dam spillways ndci maps showed that areas with high values ndci 0 06 in salto grande reservoir kept a similar surface area before and after the prolonged overflow period 8 7 7 8 km2 before and after in the río negro reservoirs however ndci 0 06 coverage remarkably changed 62 5 km2 palmar reservoir with a subsequent 56 fold reduction in the post discharge of surface water twenty days after opening the spillways montevideo beaches were closed to swimming and the ndci 0 06 surface reached 51 7 km2 in the río de la plata coast the dynamics of ndci areas the downstream bloom discharge and the predicted río de la plata residual currents suggest that the cyanobacterial bloom originated in the negro river palmar reservoir this bloom event was one of the worst that occurred in the río de la plata in last 20 years circulated along the uruguayan sub corridor to the atlantic coast along 690 km from its origin and lasted three months on montevideo coast this is the first study that addresses the impact of cyanobacterial blooms from the negro river reservoirs on the río de la plata estuary therefore the negro river basin is where the main efforts should be directed to mitigate massive cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacterial bloom remote sensing climate reservoir estuary early warning 1 introduction eutrophication is a global issue driven by population growth and changes in land management practices which is expected to be exacerbated by the increase in extreme precipitation in some regions donat et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 in addition hydrological alterations have reached most large rivers worldwide dam construction being the main cause of river flow fragmentation grill et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and cyanobacterial bloom occurrence burford et al 2007 as a consequence the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms has risen in the last decades due to the combination of eutrophication hydrological alterations and climate change o neil et al 2012 paerl 2014 sinha et al 2012 increasing in frequency magnitude and duration at a global scale burford et al 2019 ho et al 2019 huisman et al 2018 thus fluvial systems often function as cyanobacterial bloom transporters along cascading dams from headwater eutrophic reservoirs to estuaries and the ocean bowling et al 2013 li et al 2013 the río de la plata estuary basin is the fifth largest in the world covering five south american countries and containing over 160 million inhabitants the río de la plata basin has been hydrologically altered by the construction of large hydropower dams e g yacyretá itaipú salto grande rincón del bonete the estuary has shown symptoms of eutrophication driven by agriculture expansion point source pollution due to increasing urbanization and industrialization and strong climate variability brugnoli et al 2019 muniz et al 2019 nagy et al 2002 2014 one of the most noticeable symptoms of eutrophication is the frequent toxic cyanobacterial blooms found along the northern río de la plata coast particularly on montevideo beaches recorded in the last two decades brena et al 2006 de león and yunes 2001 kruk et al 2017 pírez et al 2013 cyanobacterial blooms also occur on the argentine coast of the río de la plata however this phenomenon take place less frequently than on the north coast sathicq et al 2014 since 2000 the municipality of montevideo has been implementing a regular water quality monitoring program and cyanobacterial scum warning initiatives for swimmers one of the largest cyanobacterial blooms in terms of intensity and duration according to municipality of montevideo technical report risso et al 2018 took place during summer 2009 2010 from the following summer to the present time the use of sanitary flags to warn swimmers against the presence of cyanobacteria has been adopted despite the efforts to warn the population by raising the sanitary flags a case of acute liver failure in a 20 month old child was reported in january 2015 after recreational exposure to cyanobacterial scums vidal et al 2017 the cyanobacterial blooms of the río de la plata are consistently composed of the microcystis and dolichospermum complex with variable microcystins production with extreme concentrations detected in cyanobacterial scums 26 mg microcystin l 1 pírez et al 2013 the municipality of montevideo technical reports have shown an association between rainy summers and the presence of cyanobacteria on the coast and in turn linked to el niño southern oscillation enso events risso et al 2018 enso events increase freshwater discharge into the río de la plata producing significant changes in terms of turbidity front nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton composition brugnoli et al 2018 nagy et al 2008 2014 sathicq et al 2015 the presence of cyanobacterial blooms in the río de la plata and montevideo city is currently associated to the high flows of the uruguay river risso et al 2018 particularly from salto grande reservoir where toxic blooms of microcystis and dolichospermum complexes have been reported since the dam was constructed in 1979 bordet et al 2017 de león and chalar 2003 o farrell et al 2012 the frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in uruguay river encouraged the binational administrative commission for the uruguay river caru to launch in 2007 a vigilance program of river beaches from salto grande reservoir which included from 2012 the downstream beaches to the uruguay river mouth into the río de la plata last summer on january 27 2019 and under an ongoing enso event montevideo beaches set up sanitary flags due to the presence of cyanobacterial scum ten days before a large cyanobacterial bloom had been registered 142 km to the west of montevideo city along the río de la plata northern coast colonia department just two days after the cyanobacterial warning in montevideo the media reported cyanobacterial scum occurrence about 100 km to the east punta del este beach and up to 200 km from montevideo along the atlantic uruguayan coast la paloma rocha kruk et al 2019 the sanitary flags were hoisted until late march severely affecting the main uruguay beaches during the peak season this large bloom phenomenon could not be anticipated by the local environmental authorities and urgent measures had to be adopted in order to inform and protect swimmer s health the public concern about the health risks of this phenomenon was translated into greater media coverage than in previous summers as a result less foreign tourists visited uruguayan beaches during the summer of 2019 mainly due to the presence of cyanobacterial scum among other factors in a country where tourism contributes with about 8 of the gross domestic product consequently the national secretariat for the environment water and climate change of the presidency of the republic carried out the formation of a working group of specialists in cyanobacteria and water quality to address this problem to better understand the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms that cover large water extensions the combination of information of water quality monitoring programs and hydrological data along with remote sensing tools of large spatial and frequent temporal coverage are necessary palmer et al 2015 stumpf et al 2012 2016 wynne et al 2011 the use of remote sensing as an alternative tool to assess phytoplankton dynamics in ocean waters has been globally accepted gordon et al 1985 o reilly et al 1998 o reilly and werdell 2019 coastal estuarine and inland waters are optically more complex than ocean waters mainly due to the high light absorption capacity in the blue region of the colored dissolved organic matter cdom and suspended solids gons et al 2002 zheng et al 2015 in these waters the most successful approaches to estimate chlorophyll a chl a take the maximum reflectance in the near infrared 700 nm and the minimum in the red 665 nm as a characteristic reference of chl a gitelson 1992 moses et al 2019 however cyanobacterial scum can be relatively easy to find with several sensors because of the contrasting optics when the bloom is accumulated in surface layers of the water column ibelings et al 2003 reinart and kutser 2006 wynne et al 2011 among others the normalized difference chlorophyll index ndci developed by mishra and mishra 2012 has been highlighted as successfully tested in systems with high content of cdom and suspended solids after several validations augusto silva et al 2014 beck et al 2016 page et al 2018 the advantage of detecting microcystis and dolichospermum blooms in turbid and high cdom waters is that this cyanobacterial complex is scum forming by regulating buoyancy and producing large colonies microcystis that can be easily detected by remote sensing matthews et al 2012 the resulting heterogeneous and thick surface blooms are highly susceptible to wind transport which determines the accumulation of scum in lake surfaces and coastlines wu et al 2010 on the other hand the high heterogeneity of scum forming cyanobacteria imposes well known limitations on representative sampling in order to determine in situ concentration of pigments by analytical methods fluorometry and biovolume estimations alcántara et al 2018 mur et al 1999 these constraints also apply to remote sensing since the heterogeneity of the surface biomass needs an adequate spatial resolution a recent study has postulated that the best performance among the spectral bands of seven satellites was attained with sentinel 2 european space agency in terms of spatial resolution 10 20 and 60 m and the use of red and near infrared regions to identify cyanobacterial blooms of microcystis and dolichospermum complex in the salto grande reservoir of the uruguay river drozd et al 2019 the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible origin and the environmental conditions under which large cyanobacterial blooms composed of the microcystis and dolichospermum complex took place in the río de la plata in the summer 2019 and to propose the framework of an early warning system databases from montevideo and salto grande reservoir monitoring programs of two contrasting years 2018 2019 were analyzed along with meteorological data and the hydrological variability of paraná uruguay and negro rivers the information from the dam operations of salto grande and negro river reservoirs was combined with ndci maps obtained during closed and open spillway flows as well as with ndci maps of the inner río de la plata northern coast colonia and outer río de la plata at montevideo city this information is key to advance in conceptual and numerical predictive models and to focus efforts in mitigation measures directed at controlling cyanobacterial growth in hot spots located in sub basins the results allow the proposal of a simple and qualitative early warning system of cyanobacterial scum for northern río de la plata coast based in open online data the analysis of the 2019 case study on massive cyanobacterial bloom in río de la plata may afford some insight into the promoting environmental factors as well as the local and upstream possible origins as driving factors of bloom formation and transport downstream to estuaries and the ocean 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the río de la plata estuary drains the second largest river basin of south america 3 200 000 km2 which spreads over five countries argentina brazil bolivia paraguay and uruguay and contains a population estimated at nearly 160 million inhabitants fig 1 the paraná and the uruguay river are the major tributary rivers with flows generally rising in winter 26 000 m3 s 1 and yielding low values in summer 16 000 m3 s 1 in the uruguay river mean flow 5 500 m3 s 1 is the salto grande reservoir area 750 km2 a binational hydroelectric dam located 340 km from the mouth with the río de la plata fig 1 the negro river mean flow 650 m3 s 1 is the largest river in uruguay basin area 68 450 km2 and 750 km length and has three hydroelectric dams bonete area 1 070 km2 located upstream baygorria 100 km2 in the middle and palmar 320 km2 downstream the negro river empties into the uruguay river 55 km from the mouth of the latter in the río de la plata fig 1 the estuary of the río de la plata is strongly impacted by enso events with large fluctuations in river inflow from an average of 25 000 m3 s 1 and 32 933 to 22 039 m3 s 1 during el niño and la niña neutral periods respectively muniz et al 2019 nagy et al 2008 montevideo is located to the north and middle of the río de la plata covering 50 km of the coastline with over 15 sandy beaches monitored regularly by the municipality of montevideo since the 90s risso et al 2018 fig 1 2 2 field data daily flow data from paraná river was obtained

the water up to waist height sample bottles were immediately refrigerated 4 c until arriving to the laboratory for chemical analysis data from salto grande reservoir was provided by ctm and ranged from january 2018 to february 2019 n 242 from seven stations located at a southern area near the dam fig 1 samplings in salto grande reservoir were performed by boat and samples were taken with water sampler chlorophyll a analysis by montevideo municipality and salto grande laboratories was performed with 10 200 h method apha 2005 and calculated according to lorenzen 1967 total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn data from salto grande and negro river were performed following apha 2005 by salto grande and the environmental national directorate dinama laboratories respectively negro river tp

reservoirs was not included because of only few records were available 4 12 historical records of visual monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms on montevideo beaches from 2001 to 2019 were provided by the municipality of montevideo in other río de la plata colonia san josé and maldonado departments and atlantic beaches maldonado and rocha departments records were obtained from the geoportal of dinama data available from january 2015 to december 2019 the criteria used for visual detection is divided in three levels absence presence and cyanobacterial scum the presence of cyanobacteria is reported by technical personnel when dispersed colonies of cyanobacteria are not visible from distance by naked eye but are visible when approaching to the water surface cyanobacterial scum is defined when the density of colonies is very high and green stain appears in the water surface being visible from distance 2 3 satellite image acquisition and processing the remote sensing of algal blooms introduces potential errors ascribed mainly to the algorithms used the atmospheric correction and the image processing steps however the tool power when it comes to detecting spatial patterns and dynamics should be highlighted beck et al 2016 the index calibration for the accurate prediction of chl a concentrations requires numerous in situ observations of a given water body in line with remote observation pahlevan et al 2016 since this work aims to evaluate the spatial dynamics of large cumulative cyanobacterial blooms in several reservoirs and in the río de la plata estuary the qualitative comparison of ndci was used the ndci was calculated according to mishra and mishra 2012 1 ndci r r s 705 r r s 665 r r s 705 r r s 665 where rrs 705 and rrs 665 are reflectances in the near infrared and in the red regions in order to calculate bloom areas km2 a value of ndci was used as a reference to map the bloom contours the quadratic function of mishra and mishra 2012 allows estimating chl a concentrations as follows 2 chl a μ g l 1 194 325 ndci 2 86 115 ndci 14 039 the eq 2 has been used successfully to assess massive blooms in coastal waters and lakes and to perform cross validations mishra et al 2018 page et al 2018 in this study the estimation of chl a concentration gradients was avoided however a chl a threshold was estimated as a reference to calculate bloom areas by using eq 2 a reference lower limit of 20 μg chl a l 1 was defined to map bloom areas which corresponds to a ndci value of approximately 0 06 the chl a 20 μg l 1 criteria has been used by montevideo municipality to define poor water quality conditions risso et al 2018 which was adopted from the u s environmental protection agency criteria for coastal regions usepa 2008 the range 20 μg chl a l 1 also includes mostly of the who guidance level 1 and 2 for bathing 10 50 μg chl a l 1 and 50 μg chl a l 1 respectively chorus and bartram 1999 therefore values of ndci 0 06 were considered for mapping the surface area of cyanobacterial blooms sentinel 2 esa msi images were downloaded from the l1c level and atmospherically corrected with the dark fit spectrum method the earth and cloud pixels were masked and ndci was calculated with a fixed range using acolite software vanhellemont and ruddick 2016 2 4 meteorological information the nasa giovanni data analysis system http giovanni

the kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests since data did not fulfill the prerequisites of the parametric statistical tests the conover iman post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons conover and iman 1976 chlorophyll a data from montevideo and salto grande reservoir was used for the median and maximum values among sampling stations for each sampling date and along the studied period non parametric correlation analyses spearman test with p value 0 05 st were performed between environmental variables and chl a as regards correlation analyzes only summer and autumn data was included

respectively in order to analyze the effect of flows in chl a at montevideo beaches backward time spans of flows were considered 0 5 10 15 and 20 days to analyze the effect of main tributaries for instance variables were generated from the daily flow data of the paraná river negro river and uruguay river at salto grande reservoir flow of the same day pr0 nr0 sg0 and 20 days ago pr20 nr20 sg20 daily flows in backward mode were used because it was the variable that depicted trends in the best way the wind was analyzed according to its components zonal zonw and meridional merw these components reflect the intensity vector module and wind direction sign the zonal component refers to the wind speed in the east west direction where the negative sign indicates east winds and the positive west winds on the other hand the southern component is indicated with a positive sign while the northern with a negative one in addition generalized linear models glm with lognormal

similar frequency distributions between summers with a most frequent velocity range of 13 16 km h 1 22 26 in 2018 and 2019 respectively however wind speeds between 21 and 24 km h 1 were more frequent

other coastal departments fig 3b show high records in canelones coast with few cases in western río de la plata colonia and zero cases in the atlantic coast rocha in the case of montevideo canelones trough the río de la plata limit with the atlantic ocean maldonado higher records are shown in 2019 than in previous years although no statistically significant fig 3b cyanobacterial scum detection along the coast was more widespread in 2016 and 2019 no scum records were reported in maldonado and rocha the río de la plata coastline covered by the bloom in 2019 was at least 307 km if considering the distance from colonia to maldonado punta del este the bloom lasted in montevideo beaches for 92 days from the first scum technical report on january 28 to the last one on april 29 2019 3 3 hydrological conditions during the study period the paraná and uruguay rivers yielded mean flow values above the historical mean flows 21 and 24 above the historical mean paraná and uruguay rivers respectively fig 4 the paraná river presented minimum flow values in late september 2018 10 442 m3 s 1 while the uruguay river did so in early january 2018 1 397 m3 s 1 maximum flow values in both rivers were recorded in the summer of 2019 february 03 2019 34 668 m3 s 1 january 19 2019 30 002 m3 s 1 paraná and uruguay rivers respectively interestingly the maximum flow recorded in the uruguay river in january 2019 equaled and even exceeded the paraná river flow for few days fig 4c considering that the historical mean paraná river flow is 3 fold higher than the uruguay river mean flow similarly negro river showed high flows from september to late october 2018 austral spring with a second flow increase from december 2018 throughout the summer of 2019 fig 4 the high flow values registered in uruguay and negro rivers in the summer of 2019 are clearly related to the positive high precipitation anomalies recorded in january particularly in the uruguay river fig 4 also shows the periods of spillway flows in salto grande and palmar hydroelectric dams during the summer of 2018 the spillways were closed due to the low river flows while from late august 2018 to january 2019 they

montevideo beaches five glm models were run with river flows registered at 0 5 10 15 and 20 backward days table s1 the models with the highest deviance were the ones obtained with flows at 5 and 10 backward days table s1 as a general trend the paraná river flow did not correlate with chl a in both years while the negro river flow from day 5 was negatively correlated in 2018 and positively in 2019 the salto grande flow was positively correlated in 2018 and negatively in 2019 on day 0 and 5 and became positive from day 10 consistently chl a correlated positively with temperature and turbidity and negatively with conductivity the southern wind also had a consistent positive effect table s1 the spearman correlation analysis showed similar general trends as the glm models fig s4 in the summer of 2018 chl a was positively correlated with conductivity and temperature 0 36 and 0 60 respectively and negatively with paraná river flow on day 15 and 20 0 38 and 0 57 respectively in the summer of 2019 chl a was positively correlated with salto grande flow on day 20 although a higher coefficient was obtained on day 15 0 28 and 0 36 respectively also with the southern winds 0 4 interestingly the increase in correlation coefficients of salto grande flows with montevideo chl a ranged from slightly negative on day 0 to maximum positive on day 15 while a consistent negative trend was observed in paraná river flows from day 0 20 in the summer of 2018 negatively correlations were obtained with conductivity 0 41 in 2019 fig s4 3 6 ndci map analysis the colored maps of salto grande reservoir show a similar pattern of negative ndci values in the central water body and maximum positive ones in the reservoir arms particularly those located to the western side from december 2018 to february 2019 fig 5 the spillway flow behavior of salto grande dam exhibited a short overflow period december 25 map followed by eight days of spillway closed conditions from december 31 2018 to january 7 2019 during this period the reservoir western arms showed ndci 0 06 values that covered 8 7 km2 then the high overflow period occurred from january 7 to february 3 unfortunately maps with clearer atmosphere conditions could not be obtained at the end of the overflow period ndci 0 06 values remained in the western and even eastern arms of salto grande reservoir fig 5 with a similar surface coverage as that observed before 7 8 km2 ndci maps from negro river reservoirs were obtained before and after a spillway flow period from december 13 to 25 2018 for palmar dam and from december 16 to 23 2018 for bonete dam fig 6 before the december spillway flow only bonete reservoir showed high ndci values particularly in the central water body and the southern arm ndci 0 06 12 6 km2 after the overflows of bonete and palmar dams the maximum ndci values were registered close to bonete dam restricted to a small area ndci 0 06 0 5 km2 the central water body showed low values however a large cloudy area was present in the palmar reservoir the area with ndci 0 06 values increased from 1 9 km2 to 62 5 km2 in less than 25 days fig 6 which covered the central water body and its arms from january 5 a similar long lasting overflow as that registered in salto grande reservoir was observed in palmar until february 7 and bonete january 10 to february 9 maps obtained for palmar at the end of january showed that ndci 0 06 decreased 56 fold negative values were recorded in the main water body with very small areas of positive ndci values on the southern coast ndci 0 06 1 1 km2 similarly at the end of the spillway flow in bonete reservoir the central water body showed negative ndci values except for a dense accumulation found in the southern arm ndci 0 06 4 3 km2 maps of the río de la plata estuary were obtained short after the high flow of the uruguay river registered in january 2019 that equaled the paraná flow january 21 fig 7 ndci values were within the negative range except for some restricted coastal areas between colonia and san josé departments and santa lucía river mouth d e areas ndci 0 06 1 0 km2 fig 7 the next maps were obtained at decreased uruguay river flow january 31 higher ndci values at the western coast of río de la plata san josé coast and particularly along montevideo coast d e areas ndci 0 06 6 4 km2 can be observed the sanitary flags of the summer 2019 were hoisted on montevideo beaches on january 27 and kept flying for as long as the summer lasted on february 5 the ndci 0 06 surface increased almost 8 6 fold which appeared along colonia san josé and montevideo coast with large accumulations in santa lucía river mouth d e areas ndci 0 06 51 7 km2 it is worth noticing that after the high uruguay river flow the turbidity front passed montevideo and advanced towards the eastern coast this front was no observed on february 5 still positive and high ndci values were derived from the inner río de la plata front 4 discussion this study accounts for the first evidence of the origin of one of the worst massive cyanobacterial blooms that occurred in the río de la plata estuary in the last 20 years this remarkable bloom resulted from a combination of biomass accumulation in negro river reservoirs and the subsequent hydrological transport by the uruguay river along the northern río de la plata coast driven by positive precipitation anomalies that occurred in central to northern uruguay the palmar reservoir at negro river holds frequently toxic blooms of microcystis and dolichospermum complex md complex that can reach high biomasses close to 50 mm3 l 1 cyanobacterial biovolume gonzález piana et al 2017 a secondary source of high surface chl a concentrations was identified in salto grande reservoir in areas were blooms of md complex are typically located bordet et al 2017 o farrell et al 2012 however said biomass accumulation remained in the same locations after the prolonged reservoir overflow in january 2019 the uruguay river is the main water conveyor in the northern río de la plata coast and functions as a high freshwater flow input with influence on the chl a of montevideo beaches the displacement of freshwater masses along the montevideo coast resulted in higher temperatures and lower conductivity values than the previous summer table 1 in general the correlation analyses show that high temperatures freshwater like conditions and also southern winds are consistently associated with high chl a in montevideo conditions that are favorable for the appearance of high cyanobacterial biomass on this site haakonsson et al 2020 a recent probabilistic modeling using only temperature an conductivity as explanatory variables successful predicted the cyanobacterial biovolume in a río de la plata site between san josé and montevideo coast where strong variations in conductivity occur haakonsson et al 2020 a third source of cyanobacteria is suggested to be generated in the río de la plata estuary itself local bloom as it briefly occurred during the summer of 2018 this short term bloom occurrence could be the result of the growth of local cyanobacterial populations favored by the prevailing eutrophic conditions of the estuary therefore a bloom early warning system based on hydro meteorological models combined with the analysis of ndci satellite imagery for detection of freshwater masses displacing with cyanobacterial blooms and probabilistic modeling using minimal in situ measurements haakonsson et al 2020 is needed to guide decision makers thus ongoing summer monitoring routines e g sampling frequency toxin analyses can be adjusted according to predicted scenarios and take early measures to avoid swimmers contact with cyanobacterial scum the strong social impact of the 2019 bloom event was reflected in intense media coverage and fewer domestic and foreign tourists who visited uruguayan beaches during the summer with a particular impact on the atlantic coast where blooms of freshwater cyanobacteria are not expected this is the first study that addresses the impact that cyanobacterial blooms on the negro river reservoirs have on the bloom events of the río de la plata north coast the use of ndci in several water bodies allowed us to determine that the negro river reservoirs and particularly palmar were the main biomass generators that exported large surface blooms ndci 0 06 62 5 and 1 1 km2 before and after the opening of spillway flow respectively downstream during dam overflow in turn uruguay river functions more as a high flow input than as a biomass producer due to its high and short term flow peaks the chl a of the salto grande reservoir did not show high concentrations one month before the start of the spillway overflow period maximum median 17 3 μg chl a l 1 particularly in the central sampling station s4 max 14 0 μg chl a l 1 for example areas with high surface chl a concentrations remained in the same reservoir locations even after the high flow period that was 4 6 fold above the mean historical salto grande outflow max 25 368 m3 s 1 january 19 2019 the confinement of the md complex in the western arms of the salto grande reservoir is frequently observed bordet et al 2017 o farrell et al 2012 even with human intoxication reports giannuzzi et al 2011 the in situ chl a measurements are consistent with the ndci gradients mapped in the central body of the salto grande reservoir ndci 0 06 8 7 and 7 8 km2 before and after the spillway overflow respectively as low ndci values were observed at the central water body while high ndci values were confined to the reservoir arms regardless of whether the spillways were open or closed thus it was not possible to detect a biomass transport event in salto grande after opening the spillway despite the expectation of inocula outflow this is in agreement with caru reports of satellite imagery analysis drozd 2016 vigilance of uruguay river beaches by caru detected cyanobacterial presence alert level i chorus and bartram 1999 from january 9 to february 5 2019 close to the uruguay river mouth into río de la plata and downstream negro river mouth nueva palmira uruguay caru 2019 evidence of cyanobacterial fluvial transport was confirmed by genotypes detection of the md complex found from salto grande reservoir and along the uruguay river and through the río de la plata until the marine environment martínez de la escalera et al 2017 moreover the uruguay river and particularly salto grande reservoir has been considered the main source of cyanobacterial presence and bloom events on the río de la plata north coast martínez de la escaleral et al 2017 pírez et al 2013 risso et al 2018 however the impact of the río negro reservoirs on the cyanobacteria blooms of the río de la plata had not been reported to date therefore this study offer a new insight for future studies in order to evaluate under which hydrological and environmental conditions salto grande and negro river reservoir pose jointly or alternately a major influence in río de la plata bloom development and transport the negro river reservoirs frequently hold cyanobacterial blooms of the toxic md complex gonzález piana et al 2017 composed of the two most commonly found cyanobacterial genera in uruguay haakonsson et al 2017 in this study however the low monitoring frequency of water quality in negro river reservoirs about 3 sampling dates per year prevented a proper temporal evaluation of bloom development and the availability of supporting information for ndci maps plotting despite the scarce information it is well known that palmar reservoir holds higher cyanobacterial biomass than bonete and baygorria reservoirs gonzález piana et al 2017 and that it has been classified as hypereutrophic reservoir while the last two have been classified as eutrophic haakonsson et al 2017 this is in agreement with the significant higher tp values found in palmar compared to those in the upper negro river reservoirs and salto grande palmar reservoir is surrounded by a more intense soils use than the other two reservoirs and part of its catchment has been experienced the highest agriculture intensification of the country in the last decade gazzano et al 2019 therefore periods of closed palmar dam spillway in summer may be critical for the accumulation of md complex from upper reservoirs and its subsequent exponential growth due to the higher amount of nutrients available therefore drastic reductions of n and p loads from the catchment should be considered to control harmful blooms and avoid long term resilience of cyanobacterial populations aubriot 2018 aubriot and bonilla 2018 burford et al 2019 this is of particular concern in a region where an increase in n and p loads due to agriculture intensification and point source discharge is expected as well as high rainfall variability and temperature manta and alcántara 2018 martín gómez et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 therefore the efforts to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in the uruguayan coast of the río de la plata should be directed towards the negro river reservoirs and its basin in order to effectively decrease bloom impact cyanobacterial blooms in the uruguayan coast of río de la plata is mainly associated with enso events in which the high river discharge due to positive precipitation anomalies facilitates the scum transport along the coastline and beaches particularly associated with high flow periods of the uruguay river pírez et al 2013 however the río de la plata is not just a cyanobacterial bloom receiver since the prevalent eutrophic conditions of the estuary are sufficient to sustain cyanobacterial growth in contrast to what was observed in the uruguayan coast of the río de la plata high densities of cyanobacteria on the argentinean coast occurs less frequently than in the north coast and are associated to the neutral phases of the southern climatic anomalies with no significant association with the paraná river discharge regimes sathicq et al 2015 these results are in line with the observation of a cyanobacterial scum on montevideo beaches during one day in the summer of 2018 january 13 which may resulted from the río de la plata development of existing md complex inocula and the prevailing eutrophic conditions brugnoli et al 2019 nagy et al 2002 montevideo is located between the main turbidity front mtf salinity 1 3 and the secondary marine front smf salinity 10 12 the former is strongly affected by the wind direction and therefore it can move more than 200 km from w to e nagy et al 2008 thus it is expected that as western winds facilitate turbidity front and freshwater transport to the marine environment nagy et al 2008 southern winds can accumulate scum on the beaches as identified in the correlation and linear regression analysis intermediate wind speed is well known to be the main factor for the transport and accumulation of surface cyanobacterial md complex scum wang et al 2016 therefore local río de la plata blooms can be transported from mtf to montevideo coast and even to the eastern canelones department persisting wind direction from the southern quadrants is determinant for scum accumulation on beaches during average river discharge summer conditions this study suggests that paraná river was not the main source of cyanobacterial blooms in the río de la plata in summer 2019 the yacyretá reservoir 27 28 s 56 44 w surface 1600 km2 placed in the paraná river and located about 1200 km upstream río de la plata featured microcystis spp blooms aguilera et al 2018 o farrell et al 2019 10 years after its construction in 1994 february to april 2004 2005 and 2008 which is in line with prolonged drought periods devercelli et al 2014 coincidently the presence of cyanobacterial scum has been reported from summer 2005 on the argentinean coast andrinolo et al 2007 sathicq et al 2014 while some studies have postulated that md complex blooms were detected 200 km downstream yacyretá reservoir but they disappeared after paraguay s river confluence forastier et al 2016 others have reported severe toxic microcystis sp blooms during that same period on the argentinean río de la plata coast andrinolo et al 2007 giannuzzi et al 2012 suggesting a common origin in the upper paraná river the presence of md complex blooms on the argentinean río de la plata coast seems to have an opposite trend if compared to the effect of enso events on the uruguayan coast while high microcystis sp densities are recorded on the argentinean coast during neutral and la niña periods dry periods sathicq et al 2014 2015 records of cyanobacterial scum on montevideo beaches were within the lowest during those years risso et al 2018 therefore it is suggested that contrasting hydrological conditions favor the occurrence of md complex blooms in northern mean to high flows and southern mean to low flows coast of río de la plata although in the latter case with less frequency of occurrence the differences in cyanobacterial scum occurrence on the northern and southern coast of río de la plata particularly considering bloom persistence and extent along the coastline can be explained by the paraná and uruguay river corridor and sub corridor flow patterns of the río de la plata estuary piedra cueva and fossati 2007 the numerical modeling performed by piedra cueva and fossati 2007 suggested that the uruguay and northern paraná rivers paraná bravo sauce flow through a corridor bounded by the uruguayan northern coast and the southern corridor associated with the paraná bravo sauce river discharge particularly the uruguay river flows through the río de la plata s sub corridor bounded by the uruguayan coast and the path associated with the uruguay river discharge fossati and piedra cueva 2013 piedra cueva and fossati 2007 therefore the transport of surface blooms in this study which was restricted to the northern coast of río de la plata is consistent with the predictions made by the hydrological modeling of piedra cueva and fossati 2007 in which slow northern surface residual currents correspond mainly to the uruguay river discharge taking into account the current results it is possible to postulate that the 2019 bloom event can be considered as the worst bloom that occurred in the río de la plata in the last 20 years in terms of distance of displacement and total summer days with cyanobacterial presence and scum in the coastline compared to the severe events of 2009 2010 and 2015 2016 the distance that the bloom displaced from its origin site to the furthest end point to the end of the uruguay river is about 208 km considering the palmar reservoir as the bloom expansion and discharge site if adding the distance along the coastline to the furthest sampling point in which cyanobacterial presence was recorded punta del este maldonado the total displacement distance can be set at 600 km if we consider the report of md complex found on the atlantic coast at la paloma rocha kruk et al 2019 the total distance displaced from the 2019 bloom event must have reached 690 km in fact the 2019 bloom event showed the strongest impact in eastern beaches in the light of current results a simple cyanobacterial bloom early warning system for the northern coast of the río de la plata can be outlined based on a precautionary principle to minimize the contact of swimmers with scum fig s5 in order to facilitate the rapid decision making process the proposal only requires on line open data regardless of the in situ measurements and water laboratory analyses results this proposal acknowledges that the final public warning sanitary flag is in the hands of the lifeguards at the assigned beaches when they detect the scum nonetheless it can be useful for decision makers at montevideo municipality in order to anticipate different scenarios the warning system requires a surveillance department for data acquisition meteorological and hydrological data and the remote sensing analysis of bloom formation by ndci in salto grande negro river reservoirs and northwestern río de la plata coast future studies are needed to calibrate the ndci data in order to validate the chl a prediction in those water bodies this warning system can be improved by hydrological modeling in order to include quantitative information also in situ online fluorometry can complement remote sensing although being spatially limited this combined approach provides useful information for decision makers to anticipate possible scenarios and help prevent the contact of swimmers with cyanobacterial scum as well as other harmful effects the cyanobacterial bloom early warning system proposal needs to be validated in future studies this study shows the first evidence that one of the worst cyanobacterial blooms of last two decades in río de la plata estuary was originated in negro river reservoirs strong rainfall events during the enso period occurred in northern uruguay and middle to lower uruguay river basin facilitating the bloom discharge from palmar negro river reservoir then the hydrological transport by high flows of uruguay river pushed the surface bloom along the northern río de la plata coast and the atlantic ocean palmar reservoir presents hypereutrophic conditions that may additionally promote bloom development as compared to upper eutrophic reservoirs in spite of the fact that salto grande reservoir may generate extended cyanobacterial blooms under particular hydrological regimes bordet et al 2017 this reservoir showed lower tp than negro river reservoirs and did not seem to supply significant cyanobacterial biomasses in the present event this study shows the need of to increase the frequency and space coverage of negro river monitoring program in order to enhance the knowledge about the environmental factors involved in bloom formation and temporal trends despite the scarce information available on negro river efforts directed at mitigating cyanobacterial blooms should be centered on negro river basin in order to effectively decrease the impact of blooms in the uruguayan coast 5 conclusions the combination of sentinel 2 imagery open in situ data and hydrometeorological analyzes revealed the first evidence of the impact that cyanobacterial blooms of the río negro reservoirs have on the massive bloom events on the río de la plata northern coast and the nearby atlantic ocean the cyanobacterial bloom developed first in bonete reservoir and it was then transported downstream to palmar reservoir after a short period of spillway overflow where bloom further developed until covering a maximum surface area of 62 5 km2 ndci 0 06 driven by anomalous precipitations the next event of open spillway discharged the major bloom biomass to the overflowed uruguay river and the río de la plata the palmar reservoir presents hypereutrophic conditions that promote the formation of massive blooms while salto grande reservoir may generate cyanobacterial blooms under high flows but typically confined in the western arms similarly the río de la plata can also develop local cyanobacterial blooms under mean summer flows however those blooms are confined to western coastal areas and occur during short time periods the cyanobacterial bloom of summer of 2019 was the largest of the decade which displaced 690 km to the atlantic ocean and lasted 92 days on montevideo beaches mitigation measures of eutrophication are in urgent need in the negro river basin in order to control the development of large cyanobacterial biomasses in the context of climate variability scenarios a simple early warning system of cyanobacterial blooms on montevideo beaches is proposed subject to future validations this approach will facilitate the rapid decision making process to anticipate possible scenarios and help to prevent the contact of swimmers with cyanobacterial scum and the resulting harmful effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17863,the principle of subsurface arsenic removal sar from groundwater is based on oxidation and adsorption reactions by infiltrating oxygen into the anoxic aquifer and the immobilization of arsenic as onto freshly formed iron fe hydr oxides in this study a pilot scale plant for sar has been subject to long term testing in the mekong delta vietnam initial concentrations of fe 8 4 1 3 mg l 1 and as 81 8 μg l 1 in the exploited groundwater were successfully lowered to below the who guideline value limits for drinking water of 0 3 mg l 1 and 10 μg l 1 respectively adsorption and co precipitation of as with fe hydr oxides could be identified as the principal mechanism responsible for the as removal from groundwater demonstrating the feasibility of sar as a low cost and zero waste solution over a period of two years however naturally occurring geochemical reducing conditions and high ammonium levels in the groundwater delayed the removal of manganese mn an additional post treatment filtration for mn removal was temporarily used to comply with the vietnamese drinking water standard until a mn mitigation was achieved by the sar process in contrast to most as remediation technologies sar appears to be a long term sustainable treatment option with the salient advantage of negligible production of toxic waste which with ex situ processes require additionally management

these sources can impact groundwater in regions as described from latin america with its mostly oxidizing aquifers bundschuh et al 2012 litter et al 2020 morales simfors et al 2020 the mobilization and release of geogenic as into the groundwater in reducing aquifers such as in most of southeast asia is a result of the reductive dissolution of both iron fe and manganese mn oxi hydr oxides from as bearing sediments berg et al 2007 norrman et al 2008 d zhang et al 2017a in addition some of these regions with predominantly high levels of as also show particularly high levels of ammonium n h 4 jia et al 2018 norrman et al 2015 and mn2 berg et al 2008 datta et al 2014 1 2 arsenic remediation there are many established methods for treating as contaminated water the most common include oxidation and filtration adsorption ion exchange and separation by membrane technologies each displaying different advantages and disadvantages ghosh et al 2019 jadhav et al 2015 litter et al 2019 nicomel et al 2015 singh et al 2015 other emerging technologies comprise electrochemical and coagulation processes phytoremediation and alternative adsorptive materials kumar et al 2019 the main disadvantage of these ex situ technologies is the generation of as laden waste in the form of solids or concentrate streams which have to be disposed of safely clancy et al 2013 as a consequence the safety and disposal costs of as bearing wastes become an issue and alternative techniques with an economical and environmental sustainable concept approach are needed the in situ as treatment by aeration is a technique based on subsurface iron removal sir which has proven to be a technically feasible practice in europe and the united states for decades in a variety of hydrogeochemical settings for the in situ treatment of fe mn and n h 4 in groundwater ahmad 2012 grischek et al 2015 hallberg and martinell 1976 henning and rott 2003 karakish 2005 rott and friedle 2000 rott and kauffmann 2008 however subsurface as removal sar is not yet an established solution and has only been tested in a very limited number of laboratory tests and pilot trials kundu et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 rott et al 1996 sarkar and rahman 2001 sen gupta et al 2009 van halem et al 2009 2010 the majority of studies on sar have focused on the vulnerability of the process to diverse geochemical conditions such as ph redox potential eh and the presence of co ions such as phosphates sulphates carbonates and ammonium luong et al 2018 that are competing with as for adsorption sites and can have a negative influence on the as removal in some cases this can make it difficult to comply with the stringent guideline value for drinking water recommended by the who of 10 μg l 1 who 2017 however the salient advantage of sar is its low operating and maintenance costs combined with its negligible waste production with no waste streams containing toxic as the major questions that arise regarding sar are the stability of the subsurface adsorption the possible remobilization of as and its accumulation in the aquifer grischek et al 2015 rahman et al 2014 van halem et al 2011 1 3 principle of sar the basic principle of sar is based on the adsorption and co precipitation of as onto fe hydr oxides by periodically extracting anoxic groundwater aerating it and infiltrating the oxygen rich water back into the aquifer oxygen reacts with dissolved iron fe2 to form hydrous ferric oxides hfos which are poorly crystalline oxides with high porosity and large surface areas oxidation when water is abstracted dissolved as adsorbs onto the freshly formed hfos adsorption and groundwater with lower as concentrations can be extracted a given amount of groundwater with low arsenic can be extracted after each infiltration cycle this volume depends on the amount of oxygen that is available for the oxidation reactions kundu et al 2018 luong et al 2018 rott and friedle 2000 in order to estimate the treatment capacity of each plant and the amount of water that can be extracted after each infiltration an important parameter of a sar system is the injection to extraction ratio qe vi ve which is the ratio of the volume of infiltrated oxygenated water vi to the amount of extracted treated water ve this volume specific parameter is a design parameter principally given by the quality of the raw water and can be calculated from the stoichiometric oxygen amount required for the chemical oxidation process luong et al 2018 with a ratio of for example qe 0 5 the infiltration of 1 m³ allows the extraction of 2 m³ of fresh water however in anoxic groundwater with high oxygen demand for example due to high mn2 and n h 4 concentrations qe may be higher than 1 meaning more volume must be infiltrated than the amount that can be extracted since the abstracted groundwater is always infiltrated back into the aquifer no water is lost and no waste stream is produced which is another important feature of the process however the treated water quality can in some exceptional cases e g technical failure infiltration or over extraction in daily operation gradually decrease this is also discussed later as a breakthrough experiment see section 3 2 as oxidation reactions in the aquifer are also coupled with microbial oxidation the sorption and co precipitation processes in the aquifer can be also influenced by given natural hydrogeological conditions and microbial activity of the aquifer in order to ensure a safe water supply and avoid over extraction a maximum daily limit ve max is set for each individual sar plant luong et al 2018 2019 1 4 objectives the main objective of this study is to prove the feasibility of the sar process as a sustainable treatment option for simultaneous fe and as removal and to evaluate the technology on a pilot scale for the first time its long term stability in terms of removal efficiency operation stability and energy demand has been evaluated in the course of 2 years the pilot sar plant was installed in the mekong delta vietnam as part of the joint research project wakap from 2016 to 2019 hoinkis et al 2016 2 method 2 1 sar pilot plant and location the sar pilot plant fermanox wasseraufbereitung type bv 45 fig 1 was installed in the village of cho vam in the province of an giang in the mekong delta vietnam next to the cambodian border coordinates n 10 719308 e 105 331354 this province has previously been identified as one of the most affected by high as concentrations in the country with more than 75 of wells analyzed presenting concentrations higher than 10 μg as l 1 kỳ 2009 thu et al 2011 the plant was setup for the treatment of as laden groundwater and the water supply of a small group of people from a religious community the existing shallow tube well ø 42 cm had a depth of 17 m and was connected to an existing storage tank used for water storage and supply for irrigation toilet flushing and washing fig 1 shows the installation of the sar pilot plant with the available storage tank and an extra aeration tank 2 2 raw water analysis before the trial tests started 52 possible pilot sites were analyzed in the province of an giang from which the pilot test site was selected detailed results see supplement 1 and supplement 2 the presence of preferably high concentrations fe2 was important for the site selection since a successful as mitigation is based on the adsorption onto and the co precipitation with the hfos other important criteria considered were low mn2 and n h 4 as well as the total water demand of the well full analysis results of the groundwater at the selected well in cho vam are presented in table 1 analyses were carried out at different times of the year in order to assess seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater quality prior to the beginning of the pilot the high fe as ratio of the selected site of 106 24 w w was favorable for the arsenic adsorption average ratio of study area fe as 22 48 w w see supplement 2 however the presence of ions such as phosphate p o 4 3 and silicate si competing with as for adsorption sites due to their similar adsorption mechanisms can hinder the effective removal of as furthermore mn2 and n h 4 concentrations above the drinking water standards in the groundwater may challenge the complete treatment for this reason these parameters were carefully monitored during the pilot tests 2 3 plant operation the pilot plant scheme is displayed in fig 2 showing the sar storage tank 390 l with an air injection nozzle and air filter the feed pump speck pm 15 with pressure vessel 200 l and an automatic control unit cu to monitor and regulate the infiltration and extraction processes depending on the actual water demand an extension tank 1000 l was added in a later stage to increase the treatment capacity of the plant the sar system was operated in intermittent daily cycles as manufacturer s recommendation using the following basic steps 1 aeration anoxic groundwater is extracted from the aquifer using the feed pump and aerated with an air injector at a pressure of pmin 0 28 mpa here a pressure tank is used which is regulated by a pressure switch 0 28 p 0 35 mpa each aeration cycle is controlled automatically by the cu of the system which is programmed to carry out a maximum of two cycles daily 2 infiltration adsorption after the groundwater is aerated the oxygen rich water do saturation 99 is re injected through the tube well into the aquifer via gravity lifting the redox potential of the anoxic aquifer and inducing the formation of oxidation and adsorption zones around the well here fe2 is oxidized to fe iii hydr oxides or hfos then as adsorbs onto the freshly formed hfos and is co precipitated within the fe hydr oxide matrix 3 abstraction when water is abstracted raw groundwater flows through the oxidation adsorption zone where as is adsorbed and more fe iii hydroxides are formed creating more adsorption places for the next cycle 4 treated water can be abstracted from the well in line with the maximum daily capacity ve max the number of infiltration cycles n was regulated with a control unit based on the water consumption the maximum infiltration cycles was set to nmax 2 if no water consumption occurred no infiltration was needed n 0 however an infiltration cycle was carried out every 2 days even without consumption in order to assure the process stability the pilot trials were carried out in four operational periods during the first three months period 1 the plant had an infiltration capacity of vi 1 390 l size of sar tank which corresponded to an extraction volume of ve 1 max 470 l with two infiltration cycles per day 2 vi 1 780 l and an infiltration to abstraction ratio of qe 1 66 for the second period period 2 the infiltration volume was increased to vi 2 1390 l sar tank extension tank with a capacity of 1000 l with two infiltrations cycles per day 2 vi 2 2780 l a total volume ve 2 max 1900 l could be extracted daily this corresponds to an infiltration to abstraction ratio of qe 1 46 in the third and fourth period the process stability was evaluated during over extraction period 3 and after re operation period 4 in order to ensure a safe operation an alarm was triggered when ve max was exceeded this not only prevented the breakthrough of contaminants but also prolonged the well life by protecting the extraction area surrounding the tube well from incrustations furthermore no water was extracted from the well during each infiltration cycle plus at least 15 min of subsequent rest time this was done to avoid re abstraction of oxygenated water after infiltration 2 4 sampling and analysis water samples were taken daily from the sample valve during the first ten days of commissioning and twice a week thereafter every time a sample was taken groundwater was firstly abstracted and stored in the water supply tank until it reached the maximum extracted capacity ve max the samples were acidified with nitric or hydrochloric acid for conservation before transporting them to the laboratory values for ph and electrical conductivity e c were measured on site or at the laboratory raw samples using a portable sensor wtw multi parameter 3430 an atomic adsorption spectrometer analytik jena con traa 300 was used with flame technique 50 mm burner with air acetylene gases for the determination of mn2 and fe2 while hydride generation hs 55 batch system was used for total arsenic t as determination analytik jena ag 2019 moreover special cartridges meng cartridges metalsoft were used for as iii as v separation to conduct as speciation meng et al 2001 ion chromatography metrohm 883 basic ic plus was used to analyze cations metrosep c4 150 4 0 column according to iso 14911 and anions metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 column the toc was analyzed with a shimadzu toc l analyzer measurements were repeated at least twice and samples were stored in line with the iso 5667 3 standard 2 5 data gathering this study shows the results of two years of operation including installation and commissioning of the sar plant data on water samples chemical and physical parameters water withdrawal and energy consumption were recorded continuously for the first 8 months to evaluate the process operation and efficiency afterwards the well data were periodically monitored for the complete 28 months to show the long term stability and monitor the energy consumption 3 results and discussion 3 1 iron and arsenic removal results in fig 3 show how the initial fe concentration of 9 0 1 mg fe l 1 dropped to below the vietnamese drinking water standard value of 0 3 mg fe l 1 within the first week of operation this demonstrates that the oxidation of dissolved fe2 to particulate fe3 hfo occurs rapidly after the first infiltration cycles as it occurs in the sir process braester and martinell 1988 rott 1985 rott and lamberth 1993 van beek 1983 the as elimination process was evaluated by monitoring the as immobilization onto the fe hydr oxide surfaces during each of the four operational periods see section 2 3 plant operation arsenic mitigation only started after the first infiltration cycles occurred with as concentrations decreasing from day 2 to concentrations around 20 μg l 1 remaining constant for the first ten days compliance for as standard of 10 μg as l 1 was achieved after 14 days removing more than 95 of the initial as concentration 82 10 μg as l 1 and with as levels dropping continuously to concentration below 2 μg l 1 this shows the complete adsorption of as requires the formation of enough hfo after several cycles the mass balance for as and hfo in the form of feooh of the first 14 days including the extracted volumes are listed in table 2 results show a significant increase in the as and fe removal from day 8 to day 9 and indicate the adsorption reaches an equilibrium with an as adsorption capacity of qm 8 0 1 μg as mg feooh 1 in period 2 after the increase of the total plant capacity day 100 concentrations of dissolved fe and as continued to remain stable well below the drinking water standard with only small fluctuations in the concentrations being observed which can be attributed to natural fluctuations in groundwater concentrations and increased water withdrawal depending on consumer behavior in period 3 day 155 water was extracted for 12 days while no infiltration was carried out due to a technical problem with the motor of the feed pump which led to an over extraction ve ve max the over extraction continued during period 3 for a total of 51 days due to electrical failure of the water meter and the cu although more water was extracted than the allowed daily limit ve ve max 1900 l no as breakthrough above the drinking water limit was observed and fe remained close to the standard of 0 3 mg l 1 with only a small increment to a maximum of 0 51 mg l 1 increases in as concentrations during periods 3 and 4 as well as the concentration spikes seen during early operation days day 6 day 74 indicate a strong correlation to the increases in fe concentrations showing that as breakthrough may occur from desorption from hfo these results also suggest that the removal of as correlated to the oxidation rate of iron since even small fluctuations in fe removal show change in as concentration thus validating the proposed adsorption mechanisms of as onto the fe iii hydr oxides in total as concentrations remained below the 10 μg l 1 limit for a total of 51 days reaching a maximum value of 9 6 μg l 1 after regular infiltration was resumed and operation continued normally fe concentrations started to slowly drop to values below the drinking water limit this shows the feasibility of the process for as removal in the long run and its stability despite technical complications or over extraction however some difficulties were observed for the elimination of mn and n h 4 the detailed results are shown in section 3 3 by assuming a monolayer adsorption theory the adsorption behavior can be described with the linearized mathematical form of langmuir isotherm eqn 1 1 c e q e c e q m 1 q m b with qe in mg g 1 being the amount of adsorbate in mg as removed per weight adsorbent in g feooh ce the as concentration at equilibrium in mg l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity qm in mg g 1 and b the langmuir constant in l mg 1 the isotherm parameters qm and b can be determined from the slope and intercept of the linear regression of the isotherm by plotting ce qe versus ce the values of qm 7 9 mg g 1 and b 0 67 l mg 1 obtained are in line with the qm value calculated from the as uptake in table 2 however showing lower adsorption to those found in literature for as batch experiments li et al 2015 qm 28 6 mg g 1 and b 2 14 l mg 1 the larger the qm value the larger the adsorption capacity whereas b indicates a stronger adsorption bond the low adsorption capacity calculated can be explained by the differences in real and laboratory conditions and can be an indication of a limited adsorption due to the presence of competing ions in the raw groundwater 3 2 arsenic breakthrough experiments after one month of operation as breakthrough tests were carried out on site to evaluate the quality of the treated water over the course of one infiltration extraction cycle the tests were done by measuring the total arsenic t as concentration and the as species distribution arsenite as iii and arsenate as v when the sar completed an infiltration cycle volume vi 1 390 l during period 1 treated water was pumped and samples were taken at different intervals first sample at point zero until reaching the 100 treatment target ve max 260 l additionally two more samples were examined at 150 of ve max 360 l and 250 of ve max 650 l for evaluating if any as breakthrough occurred during over extraction the results are presented in fig 4 analyses show a slight rise in both t as and as iii concentrations with increasing extraction volume it is important for the successful sar process that sufficient hfo surface area is provided for the effective as adsorption some previous studies on the correlation of as adsorption in fe oxidation show that fe oxidation is influenced by the dissolved oxygen content in the infiltrated water van halem et al 2010 2009 visoottiviseth and ahmed 2008 the more water is abstracted the more fe and as enter the treatment zone oxidation area and correspondingly the more oxygen is used for the oxidation reactions this leads to the depletion of the oxidation zone and the decrease in the available area for further as adsorption moreover the increase of the as iii as v ratio indicates both the decrease in as iii oxidation to as v and the breakthrough of raw anoxic groundwater containing as iii from the outer oxidation zone into the extraction area closer to the well however the increase in t as is not substantial indicating that the as removal persists even after 2 5 times more water is extracted than the given maximum ve max for the effective removal of as by use of oxidation filtration processes a minimum fe as ratio of 20 w w is recommended in the literature epa 2012 on the contrary the experimental results show no significant correlation between the fe as ratio and the overall as mitigation to evaluate this and the dependence of the adsorption to the oxygen demand and the fe as ratio twelve small scale aeration experiments were carried out with model water n 12 and real water on site n 1 model water containing 5 mg fe l 1 and increasing as concentrations from 125 to 500 μg l 1 was aerated using 2 l glass beakers and an air pump with stone bubbler additionally two experiments with higher iron 7 2 and 9 0 mg l 1 and concentrations of 60 and 81 μg as l 1 were carried out to also simulate higher fe as ratios as found in the groundwater at the pilot location first di water in the beaker glass was purged with nitrogen gas until dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l 1 do was measured using a wtw portable sensor oxi 3210 samples were taken at different time intervals 0 2 5 5 10 30 60 120 min etc and filtrated immediately with a 0 45 μm syringe filter before analyzing all experiments showed a general decrease in the t as concentration within the initial minutes until before reaching a plateau phase depending on the length of each experiment 0 5 120 h the as removal was averaged from the total measurements and varied between 58 and 81 beyond the individual adsorption behavior of each experiment the average removal versus the corresponding fe as ratios is also of interest the results in fig 5 show there is no correlation between the fe as ratio within range 20 120 and a higher removal efficiency in contrast to the tests with model water the experiment in the beaker glass with real water fig 6 resulted in an overall lower as mitigation with a maximum removal efficiency of 49 in a 72 h aeration experiment this may be due to the presence of competing ions such as p o 3 and si that are naturally present in the raw water in higher concentrations than in the model water the as iii and as v ratio throughout the experiment shows an interesting trend initially 100 of t as was present as as iii as it is in the raw groundwater this ratio does not significantly change within the first 5 h even though a representative part of the as adsorption is already finalized t as 53 1 μg l 1 this can be explained mainly by the oxidation of as iii to as v and its respective adsorption and removal from the water however a removal of t as by direct adsorption of as iii onto the fe oxides cannot be excluded after 72 h the remaining amount of 42 8 μg l 1 of t as in the water was present as as v the total mitigation of only 49 indicates an unsuccessful adsorption due to limited availability of adsorption sites as seen in the jar tests with model water other studies with column and batch experiments also demonstrated that neither the fe as ratio nor the amount of fe present in the groundwater have a direct effect on the as removal capacity in sar they indicated rather that the as removal is limited by the co adsorption of competitive ions van halem et al 2009 the results suggest that a successful sar plant must provide both an effective oxidation zone and a sufficient adsorption volume area this was achieved by setting a tolerance margin for the infiltration to abstraction ratio qe and fixing a daily target limit ve max by setting this extraction limit concentrations of as remained well below the drinking water limit at 4 25 μg l 1 it could be possible to increase the margin limit for improving the capacity of the plant however this should be only attempted after sufficient tests have been performed 3 3 manganese and ammonium removal the presence of ammonium nitrogen in groundwater is linked to reduced groundwater conditions that in general promote as release kurosawa et al 2013 ammonium mitigation through sar is based on its oxidation to nitrate n o 3 which occurs in the subsurface through microbial oxidation processes results show that the n h 4 removal was considerably slower than the removal of as and fe the initial concentrations of n h 4 in the raw groundwater of 1 1 mg l 1 were below the vietnamese drinking water standard of 3 mg l 1 these values were gradually lowered until reaching concentrations of around zero within the first 60 days of operation see fig 7 however during period 3 and 4 the n h 4 concentrations rose back to initial raw water concentrations max concentration day 183 c 1 17 mg l 1 due to over extraction in addition mn2 in the groundwater remained relatively stable during period 1 and 2 following natural fluctuations average 1 5 0 2 mg l 1 after a slight decrease from its initial value within the first 15 days the effective mn removal only started on day 152 approx 3 months after a n h 4 mitigation was achieved the lowest mn concentration was observed after 2 weeks linear decrease reaching a concentration of 0 46 mg l 1 day 166 however both mn and n h 4 concentrations increased following the excessive extraction in period 3 while the n h 4 content rose to initial concentrations c 1 1 mg l 1 mn level reached a maximum of 2 74 mg l 1 which was higher than the initial values this behavio r could be linked to the microbial mediated reductive release of mn which causes the temporary increase in its concentration swain et al 2018 long time experience with sir in europe shows that a complete removal of mn can take long time and a mitigation of mn with sar is feasible fermanox 2017 in general the biological mn removal occurs usually simultaneous to the catalytic mno2 oxidation and the required start up period of biological filters can take several months farnsworth et al 2012 gouzinis et al 1998a nitzsche et al 2015 the slow mn mitigation can be associated in general to the unfavorable eh ph conditions given by the natural anoxic hydro geological setting and to the high initial n h 4 concentrations 1 1 0 1 mg n h 4 l 1 of the groundwater when n h 4 is present the oxidation of mn2 can only take place after complete nitrification due to the necessary evolution of the redox potential gouzinis et al 1998a luong et al 2018 nevertheless mn levels were lowered significantly faster after normal operation was restarted in period 4 this indicates that once the removal of mn has been established the microorganisms responsible for the oxidation remain active and will drive the mitigation process after re operation in contrast to as and fe the rise of both mn and n h 4 in period 3 was observed several days delayed to the start of the over extraction period this can be an indication that the oxidation mechanisms are linked to microbial activity which will respond slower than a chemical oxidation after the oxygen feeding ammonium concentrations remained thus constant throughout the measured days in period 4 day 240 although n h 4 concentrations below the detection limit were reached again in later analyses see section 3 5 further research on the behavior of the microorganisms involved is needed to critically evaluate the role of microbial oxidation during sar 3 4 post treatment for mn removal as a result of the limitations on mn removal achieving vietnamese drinking standard 0 3 mg mn l 1 could not be accomplished within the first 240 days of operation fig 7 an additional post treatment filter with mno2 for mn removal was temporarily used to comply with the vietnamese drinking water standard until a mn mitigation was achieved by the sar process concentrations of mn before and after the oxidative granulate filter were monitored occasionally showing that mn concentrations below 0 3 mg l 1 were first achieved by use of only the sar process without the filter after operation day 420 however the lack of continuous parameter monitoring after the first 8 months of study means that a mn mitigation could have happened earlier 3 5 overall sar efficiency after more than two years of operation analyses show that drinking water standard was achieved for all parameters reaching stable concentrations throughout the process the relevant results are summarized in table 3 all parameters including coliforms and e coli were analyzed additionally by different certified commercial laboratories in ho chi minh city 3 6 energy demand the energy consumption of the system including the controlling unit and monitoring devices as well as the pump for both delivery and treatment were monitored throughout the pilot water demand was recorded with a water meter and water consumption was logged to the controller system an energy meter was used to measure the total energy consumption of the plant the specific energy consumption sec of the sar plant for both treated and supplied water ranged between 0 87 and 1 07 kwh m ³ which leads to specific costs of 0 06 0 07 usd per cubic meter with average electricity prices of 0 07 0 12 usd kwh 1 retail price for household electricity 1678 2927 vnd kwh vietnam electricity 2019 these specific costs are remarkably below the values reported in literature with results from different field tests varying from 0 11 to 1 11 usd m 3 shan et al 2018 and other similar in situ groundwater treatments reporting specific costs of about 0 5 usd m 3 sen gupta et al 2009 4 conclusion and recommendations results show that subsurface arsenic removal sar is a feasible mitigation technique for achieving safe drinking water from groundwater in regions like vietnam and southeast asia characterized by reducing aquifer conditions arsenic concentrations were lowered well below the limit of 10 μg as l 1 during the pilot phase of 2 years and remained stable throughout the process even when temporary operational failures occurred causing the breakthrough of fe the salient advantages of this technique are the negligible toxic waste production ease of use and the low operational and capital costs that also make the technology suitable for low income countries such as vietnam the success of the as removal through sar strongly depends on the infiltration to abstraction ratio of the groundwater from the aquifer the injection extraction dynamics should be controlled to ensure the complete and effective fe oxidation with enough time allowed for the oxidation reactions and a sufficient adsorption area in contrast to other studies and pilot plants an appropriate aeration system must ensure oxygen saturation and the extraction to infiltration ratio qe must be determined to avoid over extraction studying the sar process under different hydrogeological settings is still needed to evaluate the feasibility and the range of applications of the technology including the negative effect of co ion adsorption and the removal efficiency when higher as levels e g 500 μg l 1 are present hydrogeochemical conditions may affect the efficiency in obtaining drinking water standard when high n h 4 and mn concentrations are present furthermore the construction of informal wells in unsecured surroundings and vulnerable zones increase the risk of anthropogenic n h 4 contamination and should be taken into consideration when applying sar declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17863,the principle of subsurface arsenic removal sar from groundwater is based on oxidation and adsorption reactions by infiltrating oxygen into the anoxic aquifer and the immobilization of arsenic as onto freshly formed iron fe hydr oxides in this study a pilot scale plant for sar has been subject to long term testing in the mekong delta vietnam initial concentrations of fe 8 4 1 3 mg l 1 and as 81 8 μg l 1 in the exploited groundwater were successfully lowered to below the who guideline value limits for drinking water of 0 3 mg l 1 and 10 μg l 1 respectively adsorption and co precipitation of as with fe hydr oxides could be identified as the principal mechanism responsible for the as removal from groundwater demonstrating the feasibility of sar as a low cost and zero waste solution over a period of two years however naturally occurring geochemical reducing conditions and high ammonium levels in the groundwater delayed the removal of manganese mn an additional post treatment filtration for mn removal was temporarily used to comply with the vietnamese drinking water standard until a mn mitigation was achieved by the sar process in contrast to most as remediation technologies sar appears to be a long term sustainable treatment option with the salient advantage of negligible production of toxic waste which with ex situ processes require additionally management

arsenic as is considered to be one of the most serious naturally occurring inorganic contaminants in groundwater on a global scale amini et al 2008 sarkar and paul 2016 srivastava 2020 and it has been recognized as a significant environmental cause of cancer mortality khan et al 2020 who 2012 arsenic occurrence in natural groundwater varies depending on the local geology the hydrochemical characteristics of the aquifer and the ph and redox dependent mechanisms for its mobilization from the solid phase into the groundwater arsenic is found mainly as arsenate as v and arsenite as iii species in reducing and oxidizing milieus respectively campbell and nordstrom 2014 kumar et al 2020 d zhang et al 2017a high concentrations of geogenic as are found in the groundwater of many world

bearing sediments berg et al 2007 norrman et al 2008 d zhang et al 2017a in addition some of these regions with predominantly high levels of as also show particularly high levels of ammonium n h 4 jia et al 2018 norrman et al 2015 and mn2 berg et al 2008 datta et al 2014 1 2 arsenic remediation there are many established methods for treating as contaminated water the most common include oxidation and filtration adsorption ion exchange and separation by membrane technologies each displaying different advantages and disadvantages ghosh et al 2019 jadhav et al 2015 litter et al 2019 nicomel et al 2015 singh et al 2015 other emerging technologies comprise electrochemical and coagulation processes phytoremediation and alternative adsorptive materials kumar et al 2019 the main disadvantage of these ex situ technologies is the generation of as laden waste in the form of solids or concentrate streams which have to be disposed of safely clancy et al 2013 as a consequence the safety and disposal costs of as bearing wastes become an issue and alternative techniques with an economical and environmental sustainable concept approach are needed the in situ as treatment by aeration is a technique based on subsurface iron removal sir which has proven to be a technically feasible practice in europe and the united states for decades in a variety of hydrogeochemical settings for the in situ treatment of fe mn and n h 4 in groundwater ahmad 2012 grischek et al 2015 hallberg and martinell 1976 henning and rott 2003 karakish 2005 rott and friedle 2000 rott and kauffmann 2008 however subsurface as removal sar is not yet an established solution and has only been tested in a very limited number of laboratory tests and pilot trials kundu et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 rott et al 1996 sarkar and rahman 2001 sen gupta et al 2009 van halem et al 2009 2010 the majority of studies on sar have focused on the vulnerability of the process to diverse geochemical conditions such as ph redox potential eh and the presence of co ions such as phosphates sulphates carbonates and ammonium luong et al 2018 that are competing with as for adsorption sites and can have a negative influence on the as removal in some cases this can make it difficult to comply with the stringent guideline value for drinking water recommended by the who of 10 μg l 1 who 2017 however the salient advantage of sar is its low operating and maintenance costs combined with its negligible waste production with no waste streams containing toxic as the major questions that arise regarding sar are the stability of the subsurface adsorption the possible remobilization of as and its accumulation in the aquifer grischek et al 2015 rahman et al 2014 van halem et al 2011 1 3 principle of sar the basic principle of sar is based on the adsorption and co precipitation of as onto fe hydr oxides by periodically extracting anoxic groundwater aerating it and infiltrating the oxygen rich water back into the aquifer oxygen reacts with dissolved iron fe2 to form hydrous ferric oxides hfos which are poorly crystalline oxides with high porosity and large surface areas oxidation when water is abstracted dissolved as adsorbs onto the freshly formed hfos adsorption and groundwater with lower as concentrations can be extracted a given amount of groundwater with low arsenic can be extracted after each infiltration cycle this volume depends on the amount of oxygen that is available for the oxidation reactions kundu et al 2018 luong et al 2018 rott and friedle 2000 in order to estimate the treatment capacity of each plant and the amount of water that can be extracted after each infiltration an important parameter of a sar system is the injection to extraction ratio qe vi ve which is the ratio of the volume of infiltrated oxygenated water vi to the amount of extracted treated water ve this volume specific parameter is a design parameter principally given by the quality of the raw water and can be calculated from the stoichiometric oxygen amount required for the chemical oxidation process luong et al 2018 with a ratio of for example qe 0 5 the infiltration of 1 m³ allows the extraction of 2 m³ of fresh water however in anoxic groundwater with high oxygen demand for example due to high mn2 and n h 4 concentrations qe may be higher than 1 meaning more volume must be infiltrated than the amount that can be extracted since the abstracted groundwater is always infiltrated back into the aquifer no water is lost and no waste stream is produced which is another important feature of the process however the treated water quality can in some exceptional cases e g technical failure infiltration or over extraction in daily operation gradually decrease this is also discussed later as a breakthrough experiment see section 3 2 as oxidation reactions in the aquifer are also coupled with microbial oxidation the sorption and co precipitation processes in the aquifer can be also influenced by given natural hydrogeological conditions and microbial activity of the aquifer in order to ensure a safe water supply and avoid over extraction a maximum daily limit ve max is set for each individual sar plant luong et al 2018 2019 1 4 objectives the main objective of this study is to prove the feasibility of the sar process as a sustainable treatment option for simultaneous fe and as removal and to evaluate the technology on a pilot scale for the first time its long term stability in terms of removal efficiency operation stability and energy demand has been evaluated in the course of 2 years the pilot sar plant was installed in the mekong delta vietnam as part of the joint research project wakap from 2016 to 2019 hoinkis et al 2016 2 method 2 1 sar pilot plant and location the sar pilot plant fermanox wasseraufbereitung type bv 45 fig 1 was installed in the village of cho vam in the province of an giang in the mekong delta vietnam next to the cambodian border coordinates n 10 719308 e 105 331354 this province has previously been identified as one of the most affected by high as concentrations in the country with more than 75 of wells analyzed presenting concentrations higher than 10 μg as l 1 kỳ 2009 thu et al 2011 the plant was setup for the treatment of as laden groundwater and the water supply of a small group of people from a religious community the existing shallow tube well ø 42 cm had a depth of 17 m and was connected to an existing storage tank used for water storage and supply for irrigation toilet flushing and washing fig 1 shows the installation of the sar pilot plant with the available storage tank and an extra aeration tank 2 2 raw water analysis before the trial tests started 52 possible pilot sites were analyzed in the province of an giang from which the pilot test site was selected detailed results see supplement 1 and supplement 2 the presence of preferably high concentrations fe2 was important for the site selection since a successful as mitigation is based on the adsorption onto and the co precipitation with the hfos other important criteria considered were low mn2 and n h 4 as well as the total water demand of the well full analysis results of the groundwater at the selected well in cho vam are presented in table 1 analyses were carried out at different times of the year in order to assess seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater quality prior to the beginning of the pilot the high fe as ratio of the selected site of 106 24 w w was favorable for the arsenic adsorption average ratio of study area fe as 22 48 w w see supplement 2 however the presence of ions such as phosphate p o 4 3 and silicate si competing with as for adsorption sites due to their similar adsorption mechanisms can hinder the effective removal of as furthermore mn2 and n h 4 concentrations above the drinking water standards in the groundwater may challenge the complete treatment for this reason these parameters were carefully monitored during the pilot tests 2 3 plant operation the pilot plant scheme is displayed in fig 2 showing the sar storage tank 390 l with an air injection nozzle and air filter the feed pump speck pm 15 with pressure vessel 200 l and an automatic control unit cu to monitor and regulate the infiltration and extraction processes depending on the actual water demand an extension tank 1000 l was added in a later stage to increase the treatment capacity of the plant the sar system was operated in intermittent daily cycles as manufacturer s recommendation using the following basic steps 1 aeration anoxic groundwater is extracted from the aquifer using the feed pump and aerated with an air injector at a pressure of pmin 0 28 mpa here a pressure tank is used which is regulated by a pressure switch 0 28 p 0 35 mpa each aeration cycle is controlled automatically by the cu of the system which is programmed to carry out a maximum of two cycles daily 2 infiltration adsorption after the groundwater is aerated the oxygen rich water do saturation 99 is re injected through the tube well into the aquifer via gravity lifting the redox potential of the anoxic aquifer and inducing the formation of oxidation and adsorption zones around the well here fe2 is oxidized to fe iii hydr oxides or hfos then as adsorbs onto the freshly formed hfos and is co precipitated within the fe hydr oxide matrix 3 abstraction when water is abstracted raw groundwater flows through the oxidation adsorption zone where as is adsorbed and more fe iii hydroxides are formed creating more adsorption places for the next cycle 4 treated water can be abstracted from the well in line with the maximum daily capacity ve max the number of infiltration cycles n was regulated with a control unit based on the water consumption the maximum infiltration cycles was set to nmax 2 if no water consumption occurred no infiltration was needed n 0 however an infiltration cycle was carried out every 2 days even without consumption in order to assure the process stability the pilot trials were carried out in four operational periods during the first three months period 1 the plant had an infiltration capacity of vi 1 390 l size of sar tank which corresponded to an extraction volume of ve 1 max 470 l with two infiltration cycles per day 2 vi 1 780 l and an infiltration to abstraction ratio of qe 1 66 for the second period period 2 the infiltration volume was increased to vi 2 1390 l sar tank extension tank with a capacity of 1000 l with two infiltrations cycles per day 2 vi 2 2780 l a total volume ve 2 max 1900 l could be extracted daily this corresponds to an infiltration to abstraction ratio of qe 1 46 in the third and fourth period the process stability was evaluated during over extraction period 3 and after re operation period 4 in order to ensure a safe operation an alarm was triggered when ve max was exceeded this not only prevented the breakthrough of contaminants but also prolonged the well life by protecting the extraction area surrounding the tube well from incrustations furthermore no water was extracted from the well during each infiltration cycle plus at least 15 min of subsequent rest time this was done to avoid re abstraction of oxygenated water after infiltration 2 4 sampling and analysis water samples were taken daily from the sample valve during the first ten days of commissioning and twice a week thereafter every time a sample was taken groundwater was firstly abstracted and stored in the water supply tank until it reached the maximum extracted capacity ve max the samples were acidified with nitric or hydrochloric acid for conservation before transporting them to the laboratory values for ph and electrical conductivity e c were measured on site or at the laboratory raw samples using a portable sensor wtw multi parameter 3430 an atomic adsorption spectrometer analytik jena con traa 300 was used with flame technique 50 mm burner with air acetylene gases for the determination of mn2 and fe2 while hydride generation hs 55 batch system was used for total arsenic t as determination analytik jena ag 2019 moreover special cartridges meng cartridges metalsoft were used for as iii as v separation to conduct as speciation meng et al 2001 ion chromatography metrohm 883 basic ic plus was used to analyze cations metrosep c4 150 4 0 column according to iso 14911 and anions metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 column the toc was analyzed with a shimadzu toc l analyzer measurements were repeated at least twice and samples were stored in line with the iso 5667 3 standard 2 5 data gathering this study shows the results of two years of operation including installation and commissioning of the sar plant data on water samples chemical and physical parameters water withdrawal and energy consumption were recorded continuously for the first 8 months to evaluate the process operation and efficiency afterwards the well data were periodically monitored for the complete 28 months to show the long term stability and monitor the energy consumption 3 results and discussion 3 1 iron and arsenic removal results in fig 3 show how the initial fe concentration of 9 0 1 mg fe l 1 dropped to below the vietnamese drinking water standard value of 0 3 mg fe l 1 within the first week of operation this demonstrates that the oxidation of dissolved fe2 to particulate fe3 hfo occurs rapidly after the first infiltration cycles as it occurs in the sir process braester and martinell 1988 rott 1985 rott and lamberth 1993 van beek 1983 the as elimination process was evaluated by monitoring the as immobilization onto the fe hydr oxide surfaces during each of the four operational periods see section 2 3 plant operation arsenic mitigation only started after the first infiltration cycles occurred with as concentrations decreasing from day 2 to concentrations around 20 μg l 1 remaining constant for the first ten days compliance for as standard of 10 μg as l 1 was achieved after 14 days removing more than 95 of the initial as concentration 82 10 μg as l 1 and with as levels dropping continuously to concentration below 2 μg l 1 this shows the complete adsorption of as requires the formation of enough hfo after several cycles the mass balance for as and hfo in the form of feooh of the first 14 days including the extracted volumes are listed in table 2 results show a significant increase in the as and fe removal from day 8 to day 9 and indicate the adsorption reaches an equilibrium with an as adsorption capacity of qm 8 0 1 μg as mg feooh 1 in period 2 after the increase of the total plant capacity day 100 concentrations of dissolved fe and as continued to remain stable well below the drinking water standard with only small fluctuations in the concentrations being observed which can be attributed to natural fluctuations in groundwater concentrations and increased water withdrawal depending on consumer behavior in period 3 day 155 water was extracted for 12 days while no infiltration was carried out due to a technical problem with the motor of the feed pump which led to an over extraction ve ve max the over extraction continued during period 3 for a total of 51 days due to electrical failure of the water meter and the cu although more water was extracted than the allowed daily limit ve ve max 1900 l no as breakthrough above the drinking water limit was observed and fe remained close to the standard of 0 3 mg l 1 with only a small increment to a maximum of 0 51 mg l 1 increases in as concentrations during periods 3 and 4 as well as the concentration spikes seen during early operation days day 6 day 74 indicate a strong correlation to the increases in fe concentrations showing that as breakthrough may occur from desorption from hfo these results also suggest that the removal of as correlated to the oxidation rate of iron since even small fluctuations in fe removal show change in as concentration thus validating the proposed adsorption mechanisms of as onto the fe iii hydr oxides in total as concentrations remained below the 10 μg l 1 limit for a total of 51 days reaching a maximum value of 9 6 μg l 1 after regular infiltration was resumed and operation continued normally fe concentrations started to slowly drop to values below the drinking water limit this shows the feasibility of the process for as removal in the long run and its stability despite technical complications or over extraction however some difficulties were observed for the elimination of mn and n h 4 the detailed results are shown in section 3 3 by assuming a monolayer adsorption theory the adsorption behavior can be described with the linearized mathematical form of langmuir isotherm eqn 1 1 c e q e c e q m 1 q m b with qe in mg g 1 being the amount of adsorbate in mg as removed per weight adsorbent in g feooh ce the as concentration at equilibrium in mg l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity qm in mg g 1 and b the langmuir constant in l mg 1 the isotherm parameters qm and b can be determined from the slope and intercept of the linear regression of the isotherm by plotting ce qe versus ce the values of qm 7 9 mg g 1 and b 0 67 l mg 1 obtained are in line with the qm value calculated from the as uptake in table 2 however showing lower adsorption to those found in literature for as batch experiments li et al 2015 qm 28 6 mg g 1 and b 2 14 l mg 1 the larger the qm value the larger the adsorption capacity whereas b indicates a stronger adsorption bond the low adsorption capacity calculated can be explained by the differences in real and laboratory conditions and can be an indication of a limited adsorption due to the presence of competing ions in the raw groundwater 3 2 arsenic breakthrough experiments after one month of operation as breakthrough tests were carried out on site to evaluate the quality of the treated water over the course of one infiltration extraction cycle the tests were done by measuring the total arsenic t as concentration and the as species distribution arsenite as iii and arsenate as v when the sar completed an infiltration cycle volume vi 1 390 l during period 1 treated water was pumped and samples were taken at different intervals first sample at point zero until reaching the 100 treatment target ve max 260 l additionally two more samples were examined at 150 of ve max 360 l and 250 of ve max 650 l for evaluating if any as breakthrough occurred during over extraction the results are presented in fig 4 analyses show a slight rise in both t as and as iii concentrations with increasing extraction volume it is important for the successful sar process that sufficient hfo surface area is provided for the effective as adsorption some previous studies on the correlation of as adsorption in fe oxidation show that fe oxidation is influenced by the dissolved oxygen content in the infiltrated water van halem et al 2010 2009 visoottiviseth and ahmed 2008 the more water is abstracted the more fe and as enter the treatment zone oxidation area and correspondingly the more oxygen is used for the oxidation reactions this leads to the depletion of the oxidation zone and the decrease in the available area for further as adsorption moreover the increase of the as iii as v ratio indicates both the decrease in as iii oxidation to as v and the breakthrough of raw anoxic groundwater containing as iii from the outer oxidation zone into the extraction area closer to the well however the increase in t as is not substantial indicating that the as removal persists even after 2 5 times more water is extracted than the given maximum ve max for the effective removal of as by use of oxidation filtration processes a minimum fe as ratio of 20 w w is recommended in the literature epa 2012 on the contrary the experimental results show no significant correlation between the fe as ratio and the overall as mitigation to evaluate this and the dependence of the adsorption to the oxygen demand and the fe as ratio twelve small scale aeration experiments were carried out with model water n 12 and real water on site n 1 model water containing 5 mg fe l 1 and increasing as concentrations from 125 to 500 μg l 1 was aerated using 2 l glass beakers and an air pump with stone bubbler additionally two experiments with higher iron 7 2 and 9 0 mg l 1 and concentrations of 60 and 81 μg as l 1 were carried out to also simulate higher fe as ratios as found in the groundwater at the pilot location first di water in the beaker glass was purged with nitrogen gas until dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l 1 do was measured using a wtw portable sensor oxi 3210 samples were taken at different time intervals 0 2 5 5 10 30 60 120 min etc and filtrated immediately with a 0 45 μm syringe filter before analyzing all experiments showed a general decrease in the t as concentration within the initial minutes until before reaching a plateau phase depending on the length of each experiment 0 5 120 h the as removal was averaged from the total measurements and varied between 58 and 81 beyond the individual adsorption behavior of each experiment the average removal versus the corresponding fe as ratios is also of interest the results in fig 5 show there is no correlation between the fe as ratio within range 20 120 and a higher removal efficiency in contrast to the tests with model water the experiment in the beaker glass with real water fig 6 resulted in an overall lower as mitigation with a maximum removal efficiency of 49 in a 72 h aeration experiment this may be due to the presence of competing ions such as p o 3 and si that are naturally present in the raw water in higher concentrations than in the model water the as iii and as v ratio throughout the experiment shows an interesting trend initially 100 of t as was present as as iii as it is in the raw groundwater this ratio does not significantly change within the first 5 h even though a representative part of the as adsorption is already finalized t as 53 1 μg l 1 this can be explained mainly by the oxidation of as iii to as v and its respective adsorption and removal from the water however a removal of t as by direct adsorption of as iii onto the fe oxides cannot be excluded after 72 h the remaining amount of 42 8 μg l 1 of t as in the water was present as as v the total mitigation of only 49 indicates an unsuccessful adsorption due to limited availability of adsorption sites as seen in the jar tests with model water other studies with column and batch experiments also demonstrated that neither the fe as ratio nor the amount of fe present in the groundwater have a direct effect on the as removal capacity in sar they indicated rather that the as removal is limited by the co adsorption of competitive ions van halem et al 2009 the results suggest that a successful sar plant must provide both an effective oxidation zone and a sufficient adsorption volume area this was achieved by setting a tolerance margin for the infiltration to abstraction ratio qe and fixing a daily target limit ve max by setting this extraction limit concentrations of as remained well below the drinking water limit at 4 25 μg l 1 it could be possible to increase the margin limit for improving the capacity of the plant however this should be only attempted after sufficient tests have been performed 3 3 manganese and ammonium removal the presence of ammonium nitrogen in groundwater is linked to reduced groundwater conditions that in general promote as release kurosawa et al 2013 ammonium mitigation through sar is based on its oxidation to nitrate n o 3 which occurs in the subsurface through microbial oxidation processes results show that the n h 4 removal was considerably slower than the removal of as and fe the initial concentrations of n h 4 in the raw groundwater of 1 1 mg l 1 were below the vietnamese drinking water standard of 3 mg l 1 these values were gradually lowered until reaching concentrations of around zero within the first 60 days of operation see fig 7 however during period 3 and 4 the n h 4 concentrations rose back to initial raw water concentrations max concentration day 183 c 1 17 mg l 1 due to over extraction in addition mn2 in the groundwater remained relatively stable during period 1 and 2 following natural fluctuations average 1 5 0 2 mg l 1 after a slight decrease from its initial value within the first 15 days the effective mn removal only started on day 152 approx 3 months after a n h 4 mitigation was achieved the lowest mn concentration was observed after 2 weeks linear decrease reaching a concentration of 0 46 mg l 1 day 166 however both mn and n h 4 concentrations increased following the excessive extraction in period 3 while the n h 4 content rose to initial concentrations c 1 1 mg l 1 mn level reached a maximum of 2 74 mg l 1 which was higher than the initial values this behavio r could be linked to the microbial mediated reductive release of mn which causes the temporary increase in its concentration swain et al 2018 long time experience with sir in europe shows that a complete removal of mn can take long time and a mitigation of mn with sar is feasible fermanox 2017 in general the biological mn removal occurs usually simultaneous to the catalytic mno2 oxidation and the required start up period of biological filters can take several months farnsworth et al 2012 gouzinis et al 1998a nitzsche et al 2015 the slow mn mitigation can be associated in general to the unfavorable eh ph conditions given by the natural anoxic hydro geological setting and to the high initial n h 4 concentrations 1 1 0 1 mg n h 4 l 1 of the groundwater when n h 4 is present the oxidation of mn2 can only take place after complete nitrification due to the necessary evolution of the redox potential gouzinis et al 1998a luong et al 2018 nevertheless mn levels were lowered significantly faster after normal operation was restarted in period 4 this indicates that once the removal of mn has been established the microorganisms responsible for the oxidation remain active and will drive the mitigation process after re operation in contrast to as and fe the rise of both mn and n h 4 in period 3 was observed several days delayed to the start of the over extraction period this can be an indication that the oxidation mechanisms are linked to microbial activity which will respond slower than a chemical oxidation after the oxygen feeding ammonium concentrations remained thus constant throughout the measured days in period 4 day 240 although n h 4 concentrations below the detection limit were reached again in later analyses see section 3 5 further research on the behavior of the microorganisms involved is needed to critically evaluate the role of microbial oxidation during sar 3 4 post treatment for mn removal as a result of the limitations on mn removal achieving vietnamese drinking standard 0 3 mg mn l 1 could not be accomplished within the first 240 days of operation fig 7 an additional post treatment filter with mno2 for mn removal was temporarily used to comply with the vietnamese drinking water standard until a mn mitigation was achieved by the sar process concentrations of mn before and after the oxidative granulate filter were monitored occasionally showing that mn concentrations below 0 3 mg l 1 were first achieved by use of only the sar process without the filter after operation day 420 however the lack of continuous parameter monitoring after the first 8 months of study means that a mn mitigation could have happened earlier 3 5 overall sar efficiency after more than two years of operation analyses show that drinking water standard was achieved for all parameters reaching stable concentrations throughout the process the relevant results are summarized in table 3 all parameters including coliforms and e coli were analyzed additionally by different certified commercial laboratories in ho chi minh city 3 6 energy demand the energy consumption of the system including the controlling unit and monitoring devices as well as the pump for both delivery and treatment were monitored throughout the pilot water demand was recorded with a water meter and water consumption was logged to the controller system an energy meter was used to measure the total energy consumption of the plant the specific energy consumption sec of the sar plant for both treated and supplied water ranged between 0 87 and 1 07 kwh m ³ which leads to specific costs of 0 06 0 07 usd per cubic meter with average electricity prices of 0 07 0 12 usd kwh 1 retail price for household electricity 1678 2927 vnd kwh vietnam electricity 2019 these specific costs are remarkably below the values reported in literature with results from different field tests varying from 0 11 to 1 11 usd m 3 shan et al 2018 and other similar in situ groundwater treatments reporting specific costs of about 0 5 usd m 3 sen gupta et al 2009 4 conclusion and recommendations results show that subsurface arsenic removal sar is a feasible mitigation technique for achieving safe drinking water from groundwater in regions like vietnam and southeast asia characterized by reducing aquifer conditions arsenic concentrations were lowered well below the limit of 10 μg as l 1 during the pilot phase of 2 years and remained stable throughout the process even when temporary operational failures occurred causing the breakthrough of fe the salient advantages of this technique are the negligible toxic waste production ease of use and the low operational and capital costs that also make the technology suitable for low income countries such as vietnam the success of the as removal through sar strongly depends on the infiltration to abstraction ratio of the groundwater from the aquifer the injection extraction dynamics should be controlled to ensure the complete and effective fe oxidation with enough time allowed for the oxidation reactions and a sufficient adsorption area in contrast to other studies and pilot plants an appropriate aeration system must ensure oxygen saturation and the extraction to infiltration ratio qe must be determined to avoid over extraction studying the sar process under different hydrogeological settings is still needed to evaluate the feasibility and the range of applications of the technology including the negative effect of co ion adsorption and the removal efficiency when higher as levels e g 500 μg l 1 are present hydrogeochemical conditions may affect the efficiency in obtaining drinking water standard when high n h 4 and mn concentrations are present furthermore the construction of informal wells in unsecured surroundings and vulnerable zones increase the risk of anthropogenic n h 4 contamination and should be taken into consideration when applying sar declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17864,lanthanum modified bentonite lmb is a widely used phosphorus inactivating agent in lakes however dissolved organic carbon doc exists ubiquitously in lakes and its influence on phosphate binding is still not adequately understood our results showed that both phosphate and doc can be adsorbed by lmb the langmuir adsorption maxima of phosphate and doc were 9 06 mg p g and 5 31 mg c g respectively generating a c p molar ratio 1 5 when phosphate and doc coexisted at this ratio the adsorption of phosphate was not influenced by doc and vice versa however the phosphate capture by lmb was significantly reduced by raising the ratio above 9 and the reduction was increased with increasing the ratio once adsorbed by lmb phosphate was essentially not desorbed by doc while adsorbed doc can be mostly liberated by phosphate it is deemed that phosphate can interact preferentially with la on lmb however doc can still be adsorbed by lmb even after lmb was saturated with phosphate which was attributed to i the high coordination capacity of la ii the interaction of doc with the hydroxyl group s of the adsorbed phosphate via hydrogen bonding and iii the interaction of doc with the la sites unoccupied by phosphate we proposed that lmb can be applied in the season time when the doc p ratio in lakes is low enough to facilitate the adsorption of phosphate which will no longer be released into water even after the c p ratio is raised later graphical abstract image 1 keywords lanthanum phosphorus sediment dissolved organic carbon adsorption desorption 1 introduction phosphorus inactivation agents pias have been utilized for about half a century to suppress the internal phosphorus loading in eutrophic lakes douglas et al 2016 the early pias were soluble metal salts and among them alum has been used for phosphorus and algae control in more than 200 lakes especially in lakes of north america and europe jensen et al 2015 welch 2005 although the application of soluble metal salts particularly alum is still one of the most effective measures for the control of the internal phosphorus loading in deep water lakes the use of insoluble solid pias has attracted increasing attention in recent years berg et al 2004 copetti et al 2015 gibbs et al 2011 lin et al 2019 lürling et al 2016 wang and jiang 2016 wang et al 2017 2019 the lanthanum modified bentonite lmb developed by the australian commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro is the most investigated solid pia and has been shown to be very promising for lake restoration copetti et al 2015 dithmer et al 2015 egemose et al 2010 lürling and faassen 2012 lürling and tolman 2010 mucci et al 2018 reitzel et al 2013 ross et al 2008 spears et al 2016 waajen et al 2016 yin et al 2018 it has been successfully used in approximately 200 water bodies for large scale practical applications copetti et al 2015 the main advantages of this pia can be summarized as follows i lmb exhibits an excellent efficiency lanthanum has a high affinity for phosphate and the solubility of the formed lanthanum phosphate product is the lowest among rare earth elements firschlng and brune 1991 in addition the coordination capacity of lanthanum is strong for example the characteristic coordination number of iron and aluminium is 6 while that of lanthanum can reach 12 wu et al 2007 ii the inactivated product exhibits a high stability unlike other pias the interaction of phosphate with lmb produces rhabdophane minerals lapo4 nh2o dithmer et al 2015 which is highly stable under the common ph range and redox conditions found in natural waters copetti et al 2015 iii lmb is ecologically safe ecological impact tests show that lmb is safe for aquatic life lürling and tolman 2010 to date there have been no indications of the long term negative impact of using lmb on the ecosystem spears et al 2016 iv lmb is cost effective lanthanum is not only the most abundant among the rare earth elements but also the cheapest taylor and mcclennan 1985 taking rauwbraken lake in the netherlands as an example the cost of using lmb to control the endogenous phosphorus load in the lake is estimated to be only one tenth of the cost of dredging lürling and faassen 2012 assuming that lapo4 nh2o was formed the theoretical binding ratio for lanthanum and phosphate is 1 1 however it has been widely reported that the removal of phosphate by lmb was not proportional and the interference from the water parameters was thus documented egemose et al 2010 lürling and faassen 2012 reitzel et al 2013 ross et al 2008 wang et al 2017 for instance a negative relationship between alkalinity and the phosphate binding capacity of lmb was observed and the higher phosphate binding capacity of lmb in lakes with lower alkalinity could be attributed to a more pronounced dispersion of lmb reitzel et al 2013 2017 dissolved organic carbon doc is another important water parameter to influence the binding of phosphate by lmb dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 spears et al 2016 doc exists ubiquitously in lake water and in the pore water of lake sediments de lange 2000 de vicente et al 2008 in particular eutrophic lakes tend to have higher doc concentrations on average 10 30 mg l than oligo mesotrophic lakes on average 2 3 mg l li et al 2019 thurman 1985 furthermore doc is often found in higher concentrations in pore water compared to lake water dithmer et al 2016 lmb is usually applied to the surface lake water where it can capture dissolved phosphorus and once settled onto the surface of the sediment bed lmb can inactivate the phosphorus in sediment by sequestering phosphorus from the pore water hence the effect of doc on the efficacy of lmb for eutrophication control is of the utmost importance the work by lürling et al lürling et al 2014 was the first study to understand the influence of doc and their results showed that less phosphate was removed in the presence of humic substances laboratory tests by dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 also revealed the negative effects of two model doc compounds humic acid and phthalate on the phosphate binding capacity of lmb furthermore using lake water samples from 16 danish lakes a significant negative relationship was found between the natural doc concentration and colour and the phosphate binding capacity of lmb similarly spears et al spears et al 2016 examined the effectiveness of lmb across a wide range of lake conditions and found that the phosphorus concentrations following lmb applications varied across the lakes and were correlated positively with the doc concentrations indicating that doc interfered with the phosphorus removal by lmb however the effect of doc on the phosphate adsorption by lmb is still not adequately clarified for instance although the maximum adsorption capacity of phosphate by lmb can be expressed by the la p molar ratio of 1 1 because the formation of lapo4 nh2o was confirmed the maximum adsorption capacity of doc by lmb has still not been measured before in other words the ratio of the adsorption maxima of doc versus phosphate c p molar ratio or c la molar ratio is still unknown understanding the adsorption behaviour of doc by lmb would help determine how doc influences phosphate adsorption by lmb in addition although the removal of phosphate by lmb in the presence at different concentrations and absence of doc was investigated previously and negative effect of doc on phosphate removal was shown dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 the experiments were done when phosphate and doc coexisted it is still not clarified if phosphate previously adsorbed on lmb is stable when exposed to doc later and if doc previously adsorbed on lmb is stable when exposed to phosphate later this information is important to understand for the binding of phosphate and doc by lmb which solute has higher affinity towards the adsorption sites and which solute can be more strongly retained by lmb in this study to better understand the efficacy of lmb for phosphate removal in the presence of doc the adsorption behaviours of both phosphate and doc were first evaluated second the phosphate immobilization by lmb was examined as a function of the doc concentration in both deionized water and doc spiked lake water taken from lake taihu which is located in the yangtze delta plain and is the third largest freshwater lake in china lake taihu has an area of 2250 km2 and an average depth of 2 m third the reversibility of the adsorption of both phosphate and doc on lmb was determined finally the implication of the results for the inactivation of phosphorus in lakes was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the lmb sample used in this study was provided by the shanghai phoslock water solutions ltd for comparison purposes a natural bentonite sample was obtained from the linshou hengchang mining co ltd hebei province china the samples were ground to pass through an 80 mesh sieve prior to use the chemical composition of bentonite and lmb are presented in table 1 the elemental compositions of the materials were determined by x ray fluorescence axios x panalytical company while the moisture and loss on ignition were measured from the weight loss at 105 c and 900 c respectively the phosphate solutions were prepared with kh2po4 humic acid has been widely used as a model doc compound and was also used in this study humic acid was supplied by aldrich chemical in the form of humic acid sodium salt which was extracted from waters draining from an open pit mine in oberhessen germany the natural lake water sample was obtained on august 24th 2018 from the gonghu bay of lake taihu 31 21 23 n 119 59 35 e the concentrations of some of the soluble components are given in table s1 among them the total p and soluble reactive p srp concentrations were determined using the molybdenum blue colorimetric method chinese environmental protection administration 2002 doc was measured using a chnos elemental analyser model vario eliii germany after the water had been filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the total alkalinity in caco3 was determined to be 87 8 mg l by the titration method chinese environmental protection administration 2002 all other common ions were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icap 6000 radial thermo usa and ion chromatography metrohm mici switzerland the water sample had a ph of 7 5 as measured by a hach sension ph meter 2 2 methods 2 2 1 adsorption isotherm studies the adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted using aqueous solutions containing either phosphate or doc the initial phosphate and doc concentrations ranged from 5 to 100 mg l and from 2 5 to 300 mg l respectively all the solutions contained 0 01 m nacl as the background electrolyte first stock solutions of kh2po4 with the concentration of 1000 mgp l and humic acid sodium salt with the concentration of 1000 mgc l were separately prepared using 0 01 m nacl solution the working solutions of phosphate and doc were then obtained by dilution of the stock solutions with 0 01 m nacl solution the use of 0 01 m nacl was to keep the ionic strength roughly constant independently of the amount of kh2po4 or humic acid sodium salt added the experiments were performed by adding 40 ml of the aqueous solutions to centrifuge tubes containing 0 1 g of lmb or the bentonite sample the tubes were then shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c for 48 h an adsorption time of 48 h was found to be sufficient for both phosphate and doc to achieve equilibrium in our adsorption kinetics studies fig s1 specifically under our experimental conditions the amount of adsorbed phosphate and doc increased sharply at the initial stage and then continued to increase slowly but the adsorption amount reached equilibrium at 24 h since there was no statistically significant increase in the amount adsorbed between the adsorption time of 24 h and 48 h duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 after 48 h the suspensions were centrifuged and the phosphate concentrations in the supernatants were determined by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method chinese environmental protection administration 2002 and doc was evaluated directly at a wavelength of 218 5 nm with a unico spectrophotometer model uv 2102pcs china the amount of adsorbed phosphate or doc at equilibrium qe was calculated using the following equation 1 q e v c 0 c e m where v is the volume of the solution l c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of phosphate or doc mg l respectively and m is the dry mass of lmb or bentonite g adsorption isotherm experiments using aqueous solutions containing both phosphate and doc were also carried out in this case the phosphate concentration varied from 5 to 100 mg l while the doc concentration was set to achieve a constant c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 this ratio was adopted since the c p molar ratio when the adsorption capacity of phosphate and doc on lmb attained saturation was 1 5 1 the doc concentration in the supernatant was directly measured spectrophotometrically while the phosphate concentration was determined after the supernatant was digested with a potassium persulfate solution because our preliminary experiment confirmed that the colour of doc can influence the quantification of phosphate when the doc concentration exceeded 20 mg l 2 2 2 adsorption of phosphate as a function of the doc concentration forty millilitres of a phosphate solution with different doc concentrations was added to 50 ml centrifuge tubes containing 2 48 mg of lmb this dose corresponds to the lmb p mass ratio of 100 1 which was used in previous studies dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013 waajen et al 2016 yin et al 2018 to accurately add small amount of lmb a stock suspension was first prepared by the continuous mixing of 2 48 g of lmb with 1 l of deionized water subsamples of 1 ml were taken from this suspension and were transferred to centrifuge tubes the phosphate concentration of 0 62 mg l was adopted as it is representative of the pore water concentrations in danish eutrophic lakes reitzel et al 2013 the doc concentration was set to 0 0 5 2 4 8 12 20 40 60 80 and 120 mg l this range of doc concentrations can represent the natural doc concentration level in danish lakes de vicente et al 2008 dithmer et al 2016 furthermore the solutions were prepared with a 0 01 m ammonium chloride ammonia buffer solution instead of pure water to achieve a constant ph of 7 5 and an ionic strength equal to that of 0 01 m nacl after being shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm for 48 h the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter and the filtrate was then digested with a potassium persulfate solution the phosphate concentration in the digested filtrate was measured 2 2 3 adsorption of phosphate from natural lake water spiked with doc before the experiment the lake water was spiked with kh2po4 to achieve an srp concentration of 0 62 mg l furthermore an aliquot of this lake water was spiked with humic acid to achieve a doc concentration of 14 21 mg l i e increasing the doc concentration by 10 mg l forty millilitres of the lake water with or without the adjusted doc concentration was added to 50 ml centrifuge tubes and 2 48 mg of lmb was added for comparison purposes experiments using a phosphate solution with a concentration of 0 62 mg l which was prepared from pure water were also conducted the tubes were shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm after 1 2 4 8 14 20 and 28 days the suspensions were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and the srp concentration of the filtrates were determined 2 2 4 reversibility of phosphate and doc adsorption to evaluate the reversibility of phosphate adsorption the first step was to prepare phosphate loaded lmb for this purpose 0 1 g of lmb was weighed and placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes then 40 ml of a phosphate solution whose concentration was 50 mg l was added this phosphate concentration was adopted to reach nearly the maximum amount of phosphate adsorption based on the isotherm studies the solution contained 0 01 m nacl as the background electrolyte after being shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm for 48 h the tubes were centrifuged and the phosphate concentration and amount of phosphate adsorbed by lmb qe were calculated with the supernatants the solid in the tube was rinsed five times with deionized water to remove any residual phosphate that was not adsorbed by lmb the second step was to measure the adsorption isotherm of doc on the phosphate loaded lmb which was performed according to the method described in section 2 2 1 however the phosphate concentration in the equilibrium solution was additionally measured and the amount of phosphate desorbed from lmb qd was calculated as follows 2 q d c d v m the desorption efficiency was calculated using the following equation 3 η q d q e 100 where cd is the phosphate concentration in the supernatant after desorption mg l v is the volume of the doc solution added as the desorption reagent l and qe is the amount of phosphate adsorbed mg g to further illustrate the reversibility of phosphate adsorption the phosphate loaded lmb was also repeatedly washed with the doc solution that is the doc solution which had a concentration of 50 mg l and used 0 01 m nacl as the background electrolyte was added to the tubes containing phosphate loaded lmb this doc concentration was used because doc can nearly reach its maximum adsorption amount based on the isotherm studies the tubes were shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm for 48 h to desorb the adsorbed phosphate after centrifugation the phosphate concentration in the supernatant was measured after this desorption step a fresh doc solution was again added and the desorption experiment was repeated three times in total the reversibility of doc adsorption was evaluated in the same manner by measuring the desorption of doc previously adsorbed on lmb and using the phosphate solution as the desorption agent 2 2 5 data analysis the phosphate and doc concentrations were expressed in elemental p and c respectively all the experiments were undertaken in triplicate and the mean value and the standard deviation are reported whenever necessary data were also analysed using one way analysis of variance by comparing the treated groups and the control and or comparing the different treated groups using the student newman keuls multiple range tests the homogeneity of variance was tested using bartlett s test the statistical analysis was performed using the statistical analysis system sas 8 2 sas institute cary nc usa all the significance levels mentioned in the text are p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherms the results of the separate adsorption isotherms of phosphate and doc on lmb and a bentonite sample are presented in fig 1 a the affinity of lmb for phosphate was high causing a vertical isotherm shape at the low initial phosphate concentrations this means that at low phosphate concentrations lmb can exhaust or uptake most of the phosphate in the water leaving a very low residual phosphate concentration specifically when the initial phosphate concentration was lower than 10 mg l 99 of the phosphate in the water can be sequestered by lmb the results in fig 1a also showed that lmb has the capability to adsorb doc however it appeared that the affinity of lmb for doc was lower than that of lmb for phosphate since only 40 of the doc in the water can be captured by lmb even when the doc concentration was low 30 mg l the complex formation of la with humic substances was previously predicted at 5 mg l tang and johannesson 2003 and experimentally demonstrated for example at 10 mg l sonke and salters 2006 tang and johannesson 2003 2010 our results suggested that the fixation of doc by the la on lmb can occur at a concentration as low as 2 5 mg l removal efficiency 40 at high concentrations however the amount of both phosphate and doc adsorbed by lmb levelled off indicating that the adsorption sites are limited and the adsorption ability reached saturation nevertheless as seen in fig 1a the bentonite sample exhibited a very low adsorption capacity for both phosphate and doc this is expected however since both the bentonite surface the phosphate ion and doc are negatively charged and repulsion between the bentonite surface and the two adsorbate species must take place therefore although the bentonite sample used in this study is different from that used for the preparation of lmb the latter bentonite is not available it is reasonable to conclude that both phosphate and doc are fixed by the lanthanum on lmb the adsorption isotherm data were fitted using the common langmuir and freundlich models which were given below 4 langmuir model q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 5 freundlich model q e k f c e 1 n where c e is the adsorbate concentration at equilibrium mg l k l is a langmuir constant related to the affinity of the binding sites l mg q max is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g k f is a freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity mg g mg l 1 n and 1 n is a constant related to the adsorption density the fitting results are given in table 2 from the correlation coefficients r2 values it can be concluded that the langmuir model gave a better fit than the freundlich model with r2 values all exceeding 0 995 from the qmax value of phosphate shown in table 2 and the la content of lmb shown in table 1 the la p molar ratio was estimated to be 1 23 1 which was slightly higher than the 1 1 binding ratio theoretically determined by assuming that lapo4 nh2o formed meaning that a small part of la was not available for phosphate binding the lanthanum speciation depends on the hydrolysis of the la ion because the ph condition used in this study was not regulated and was measured to be 7 3 0 4 the dominant la species would be mostly trivalent la ions la3 with a small proportion of divalent hydroxyl la ions laoh2 while the existence of the species la oh 2 la oh 3 and la oh 4 is unlikely kawahigashi et al 2005 on the other hand the predominant phosphate species at a ph 7 3 0 4 would be a mixture of h2po4 and hpo4 because these two species are exclusively present at ph values ranging from 5 to 10 bouyer et al 2006 therefore the surface species present due to the inner sphere complex formation of phosphate with lmb can be inferred as follows guan et al 2020 6 la hpo4 2 la hpo4 7 la h2po4 la h2po4 8 la oh hpo4 2 la po4 h2o 9 la oh h2po4 la hpo4 h2o from the qmax values of phosphate and doc it was calculated that the adsorption capacity of phosphate and doc had a c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 when their adsorption reached saturation compared with the small inorganic phosphate anion which can come close to the surface for binding the size of doc macromolecules is large for instance the diameter of humic acid is approximately 2 7 nm rahnemaie et al 2007 therefore although most of the phosphate ions can be bound to la a large part of the doc has to be positioned beyond the adsorption sites and only a small part of the carboxylate groups rcoo can interact with la to form an inner sphere complex according to the ligand exchange reaction similar to that occurring for phosphate hiemstra et al 2013 weng et al 2012 10 la rcoo la oocr 11 la oh rcooh la oocr h2o 3 2 co adsorption of phosphate and doc the results of the co adsorption isotherms of phosphate and doc coexisting in water at a c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 are given in fig 1b and the fitting results of the adsorption isotherm data to the two adsorption models are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the adsorption of both phosphate and doc was essentially not influenced by one another and their adsorption maxima differed little from their adsorption maxima obtained when they presented in water as a single adsorbate this phenomenon was surprising and may be explained by the great coordination capacity of la although both the solutes can be coordinated with la the small phosphate ion would be more competitive than doc this will be described in more detail in section 3 4 and would interact first with la however even after phosphate was adsorbed the characteristic coordination number of 12 for la still renders the adsorption of doc possible in addition the interaction of the abundant o n and s atoms of doc with the hydroxyl group of the phosphate adsorbed via hydrogen bonding may also contribute to the adsorption of doc after phosphate adsorption one more explanation is that phosphate did not occupy all the la sites as abovementioned the la p molar ratio was 1 23 1 which was larger than 1 1 and the interaction of doc with these unoccupied la sites scattered on the bentonite surface may be still possible in this case due to the large size of doc the interaction of each carboxyl group can add adsorption forces to the doc macromolecule rendering the adsorption of large doc particles possible in each case however the hydrogen bonds can occur both intra and inter molecularly between the adsorbed doc which would certainly facilitate adsorption 3 3 adsorption of phosphate in the presence of doc at different c p molar ratios as abovementioned the adsorption of phosphate was not influenced by the presence of doc and vice versa at the low c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 which was relevant to the ratio of their qmax values however it should be noted that the c p molar ratio in natural lakes would be much higher for instance dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 measured the srp and doc concentrations in both lake water and sediment pore water obtained from 16 danish lakes and found that the c p molar ratio in the lake water and pore water was as high as 165 and 70 on average respectively even assuming that the phosphorus concentration reached 0 62 mg l which is the representative phosphorus concentration level in the pore water of sediments of eutrophic lakes reitzel et al 2013 the c p molar ratio was still as high as 32 in the lake water and 48 in the pore water respectively similarly de vicente de vicente et al 2008 measured the average doc concentration in lake water obtained from 31 danish lakes to be 7 5 mg l while spears et al spears et al 2016 determined the doc concentration of 18 lakes across a wide range of lake conditions in europe and canada to be 9 95 mg l on average the doc concentrations of 7 5 and 9 95 mg l will result in c p molar ratios of 32 and 42 respectively assuming that the phosphorus concentration is 0 62 mg l considering that the srp concentration would be lower than 0 62 mg l in most cases the c p molar ratio would be higher than estimated above therefore understanding the adsorption of phosphate as a function of the doc concentration c p molar ratio is of great importance the results in fig 2 showed that the phosphate amount absorbed by lmb depended greatly on the doc concentration c p molar ratio although doc did not influence the phosphate uptake significantly at concentrations 2 mg l i e c p molar ratios 9 duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 a further increase in the doc concentration c p molar ratio caused a linear increase in the residual phosphate concentration after phosphate was adsorbed by lmb fig 2 the residual phosphate concentration continued to increase when the doc concentration exceeded 40 mg l c p molar ratio 167 but the growth rate decreased this phenomenon can be explained readily by the law of mass action which states that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two reactants for a bi reactant reaction because the collision frequency increases with increasing concentrations for the adsorption of phosphate and doc the concentration of lmb as a reactant is the same and therefore at the same phosphate concentration the higher the doc concentration the higher the adsorption amount of doc via formula 10 and 11 when compared with the phosphate adsorption amount obtained via formulas 6 to 9 the results of the 28 day incubation experiments shown in fig 3 further supported the abovementioned conclusion in pure water the capture of phosphate by lmb was completed within two days because there was no statistically significant decrease in the residual phosphate concentration at incubation times longer than two days duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 the coexistence of soluble components in the lake water including a doc concentration of 4 21 mg l corresponding to a c p molar ratio of 18 greatly reduced the performance of lmb for srp capture fig 3 however this decrease cannot be attributed solely to doc since a number of other components in the lake water may also influence srp adsorption although we believe that doc played a dominant role based on the results shown in fig 2 similar results on the importance of the doc concentration in influencing the lmb performance for phosphorus inactivation was recently pointed out by spears et al spears et al 2016 who reported that the phosphorus concentrations following lmb applications varied across the lakes and were correlated positively with the dissolved organic carbon concentrations spiking doc by adding humic acid into the lake water to achieve a concentration of 14 21 mg l further decreased the performance of lmb fig 3 which indicated that an increase in the doc concentration alone can reduce the sequestration of srp by lmb in addition the existence of doc not only decreased the adsorption amount of srp increased the residual srp concentration but also lowered the rate of the srp adsorption process the adsorption process occurring in both the lake water and doc spiked lake water was much slower than that occurring in the pure water in which phosphate adsorption reached equilibrium within two days in fact a statistically significant decline in the residual srp concentration continued until day 14 from which time on there was no significant decrease in the residual srp concentration duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 after being applied in lakes lmb will eventually settled onto lake bed where it can continuously adsorb phosphorus from pore water in sediment i e inactivate phosphorus in lake sediments the adopted phosphate concentration in this study was 0 62 mg l which was representative of phosphorus concentration in pore water of eutrophic lake sediments and was also used in other studies dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013 however this concentration is far higher than that of the water sample taken from the lake taihu table s1 lmb can scavenge dissolved phosphorus from the water column during the settling process which may takes weeks to months under natural conditions spears et al 2013 or when settled lmb is re suspended into water column by wind induced waves and currents for the inactivation of phosphorus in water column of lakes such as the lake taihu further studies using much lower phosphate concentration may be required however the results in laboratory experiments in this study could be really applied for the phosphate binding from water column in heavily eutrophic lakes with relevant high phosphate concentrations for instance lake dianchi 24 40 25 02 n 102 36 102 47 e is one of the most eutrophicated lakes in china and high phosphorus concentration in the lake has been reported reaching 0 4 mg l in the caohai section and 0 2 mg l in the waihai section yan et al 2019 similarly xie et al 2013 found that phosphorus concentration reached 0 32 mg l in the caohai section and varied from 0 12 to 0 18 mg l in the waihai section li et al 2019 collected water samples from the waihai section for the experiments of phosphorus removal by ferric chloride and determined the initial phosphorus concentration to be 0 19 mg l 3 4 reversibility of the adsorption of phosphate and doc to determine whether phosphate or doc is more strongly adsorbed by lmb the adsorption isotherm of phosphate on lmb that was previously saturated with doc and the adsorption isotherm of doc on lmb that was previously saturated with phosphate were measured and the results are displayed in fig 4 fig 4 clearly revealed that regardless of the presence of doc on lmb the phosphate adsorption amount can reach an adsorption amount maximum as high as that of the original lmb fig 4 table 2 at the same time phosphate can replace most of the doc that was previously adsorbed on lmb fig 4 on the other hand the adsorption of doc on phosphate loaded lmb also attained nearly the same adsorption maximum as the original lmb but doc displaced little phosphate that was previously adsorbed on lmb fig 4 table 2 this clearly shows that phosphate is more competitive than doc for the la sites recently dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 conducted a long term 400 days laboratory study suggesting that the negative effect of doc on srp adsorption by lmb is obvious in the short term but probably not permanent i e srp will eventually be sequestered by lmb our results provided solid proof to support that the consideration of dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 is very likely since the adsorption of doc is reversible in the presence of phosphate however although phosphate adsorption attained the adsorption maximum doc was not totally desorbed fig 4a possible reasons are that i displaced doc can be re adsorbed on the phosphate loaded lmb due to the high coordination capacity of la ii the o n or s atoms of doc interact with the hydroxyl group s of the phosphate adsorbed via hydrogen bonding and iii doc interacts with the la sites that were not occupied by phosphate note that the la p molar ratio was higher than 1 1 even when phosphate reached saturation as described in section 3 1 these reasons may also explain why the adsorption of doc essentially reached its adsorption maximum without the displacement of the phosphate that was previously adsorbed on lmb fig 4b to further confirm the reversibility of the adsorption of phosphate or doc in the presence of doc or phosphate the phosphate saturated lmb or doc saturated lmb was desorbed with repeated washing using a doc solution or phosphate solution the concentration of either the doc solution or phosphate solution can assure that the solutes reach their adsorption maxima provided that doc or phosphate were present in the water as a single adsorbate the results shown in table 3 indicated that both the adsorption of doc on the phosphate saturated lmb and the adsorption of phosphate on the doc saturated lmb virtually achieved their adsorption maxima by the first washing step and further washing only resulted in little adsorption what is the most important is that doc desorbed little phosphate that was pre adsorbed on lmb but most of the doc pre loaded on lmb can be displaced by phosphate therefore once the phosphate was adsorbed by lmb it is stable and will not be released into the water even in the presence of high doc concentrations these results observed in our present study showing that phosphate adsorption is advantageous at low c p ratios and the adsorbed phosphate is stable in the presence of high doc concentrations have important implications for phosphorus inactivation in lakes using lmb that is lmb can be applied during the season time when the c p ratio in lakes is low facilitating the adsorption of phosphorus which will no longer be liberated into water even after the c p ratio is increased later avoiding the application of lmb when the c p ratio is high is especially important in soft low alkalinity water lakes because of the high la dissolution in soft low alkalinity water with high doc concentration reitzel et al 2017 for instance the bloom of algae in lakes can not only increase the doc level via metabolic excretion which is the autolysis of cells or death from an external factor e g virus attack in aquatic and artificial ecosystems henderson et al 2008 hertkorn et al 2002 li et al 2019 but also decrease the srp concentration by algal uptake li et al 2019 therefore the season in which the high chlorophyll a concentration would lead to a high c p ratio should be avoided for lmb application in addition to the autochthonous material derived from algal or microbiological productivity allochthonous organic matter from terrestrial inputs also contributes to the doc in lakes and often dominates the organic carbon balance in most freshwater systems located in temperate climates mash et al 2004 onstad et al 2000 allochthonous organic matter which is derived from the decomposition of terrestrial plant debris and the humification of soil organic matter enters aquatic systems mainly from the subsequent runoff of overland water flow during rainfall events mash et al 2004 onstad et al 2000 to achieve a good removal efficiency of phosphate by lmb it would be better to avoid this season however because our experimental results revealed that the relative concentration of doc versus phosphorus determines the efficiency of the phosphorus removal by lmb it would be important to realize the dynamics of the c p ratio in a lake rather than the dynamics of the doc concentration or phosphorus concentration alone prior to the internal phosphorus load management using lmb humic substances such as humic acid and fulvic acid form the major fraction of doc in aquatic systems typically compose about 60 of the doc antelo et al 2007 stevenson 1994 and humic acid is thus used as a model doc in this study and many other studies e g de vicente et al 2008 dithmer et al 2016 hiemstra et al 2013 lürling et al 2014 however doc consists of a complex mixture of compounds as a result of its variety of sources and continual reworking by photochemical and microbial degradation processes scully et al 2004 as an example autochthonous and allochthonous docs are substantially different terrestrial or allochthonous material tends to be higher in lignin content with high aromatic content and lower nutrient n p inclusion mash et al 2004 in contrast autochthonous material derived from algal or microbiological productivity tends to be more aliphatic with much higher nutrient inclusion mash et al 2004 therefore future studies are needed to investigate how these kinds of complex doc in lakes under environmental concentration affects adsorption of phosphate by lmb 4 conclusions lmb is a widely used phosphorus inactivating agent in lakes in our present study both phosphate and doc were shown to interact with the la on lmb the influence of doc on the phosphate uptake depended greatly on the relative concentration of doc versus phosphate which can be expressed as the c p molar ratio a significant reduction in the phosphate amount captured by lmb took place at c p molar ratios exceeding 9 below which phosphate adsorption was not influenced significantly by doc on the other hand once fixed by lmb phosphate was essentially not desorbed by doc while adsorbed doc was mostly re released into water by phosphate it is presumed that phosphate can interact preferentially with la through stronger binding forces than doc but doc can be adsorbed on lmb even after it was saturated with phosphate the results obtained in this study have important implications for the inactivation of phosphorus in lakes using lmb showing that lmb should be applied in lakes when the c p molar ratios are low that is it is a good strategy to understand the dynamics of the concentration ratio of doc and phosphate in a lake prior to the use of lmb to achieve a better

17864,lanthanum modified bentonite lmb is a widely used phosphorus inactivating agent in lakes however dissolved organic carbon doc exists ubiquitously in lakes and its influence on phosphate binding is still not adequately understood our results showed that both phosphate and doc can be adsorbed by lmb the langmuir adsorption maxima of phosphate and doc were 9 06 mg p g and 5 31 mg c g respectively generating a c p molar ratio 1 5 when phosphate and doc coexisted at this ratio the adsorption of phosphate was not influenced by doc and vice versa however the phosphate capture by lmb was significantly reduced by raising the ratio above 9 and the reduction was increased with increasing the ratio once adsorbed by lmb phosphate was essentially not desorbed by doc while adsorbed doc can be mostly liberated by phosphate it is deemed that phosphate can interact preferentially with la on lmb however doc can still be adsorbed by lmb even after lmb was saturated with phosphate which was attributed to i the high coordination capacity of la ii the interaction of doc with the hydroxyl group s of the adsorbed phosphate via hydrogen bonding and iii the interaction of doc with the la sites unoccupied by phosphate we proposed that lmb can be applied in the season time when the doc p ratio in lakes is low enough to facilitate the adsorption of phosphate which will no longer be released into water even after the c p ratio is raised later graphical abstract image 1 keywords lanthanum phosphorus sediment dissolved organic carbon adsorption desorption 1 introduction phosphorus inactivation agents pias have been utilized for about half a century to suppress the internal phosphorus loading in eutrophic lakes douglas et al 2016 the early pias were soluble metal salts and among them alum has been used for phosphorus and algae control in more than 200 lakes especially in lakes of north america and europe jensen et al 2015 welch 2005 although the application of soluble metal salts particularly alum is still one of the most effective measures for the control of the internal phosphorus loading in deep water lakes the use of insoluble solid pias has attracted increasing

dithmer et al 2015 egemose et al 2010 lürling and faassen 2012 lürling and tolman 2010 mucci et al 2018 reitzel et al 2013 ross et al 2008 spears et al 2016 waajen et al 2016 yin et al 2018 it has been successfully used in approximately 200 water bodies for large scale practical applications copetti et al 2015 the main advantages of this pia can be summarized as follows i lmb exhibits an excellent efficiency lanthanum has a high affinity for phosphate and the solubility of the formed lanthanum phosphate product is the lowest among rare earth elements firschlng and brune 1991 in addition the coordination capacity of lanthanum is strong for example the characteristic coordination number of iron and aluminium is 6 while that of lanthanum can reach 12 wu et al 2007 ii the inactivated product exhibits a high stability unlike other pias the interaction of phosphate with lmb produces rhabdophane minerals lapo4 nh2o dithmer et al 2015 which is highly stable under the common ph range and redox conditions found in natural waters copetti et al 2015 iii lmb is ecologically safe ecological impact tests show that lmb is safe for aquatic life lürling and tolman 2010 to date there have been no indications of the long term negative impact of using lmb on the ecosystem spears et al 2016 iv lmb is cost effective lanthanum is not only the most abundant among the rare earth elements but also the cheapest taylor and mcclennan 1985 taking rauwbraken lake in the netherlands as an example the cost of using lmb to control the endogenous phosphorus load in the lake is estimated to be only one tenth of the cost of dredging lürling and faassen 2012 assuming that lapo4 nh2o was formed the theoretical binding ratio for lanthanum and phosphate is 1 1 however it has been widely reported that the removal of phosphate by lmb was not proportional and the interference from the water parameters was thus documented egemose et al 2010 lürling and faassen 2012 reitzel et al 2013 ross et al 2008 wang et al 2017 for instance a negative relationship between alkalinity and the phosphate binding capacity of lmb was observed and the higher phosphate binding capacity of lmb in lakes with lower alkalinity could be attributed to a more pronounced dispersion of lmb reitzel et al 2013 2017 dissolved organic carbon doc is another important water parameter to influence the binding of phosphate by lmb dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 spears et al 2016 doc exists ubiquitously in lake water and in the pore water of lake sediments de lange 2000 de vicente et al 2008 in particular eutrophic lakes tend to have higher doc concentrations on average 10 30 mg l than oligo mesotrophic lakes on average 2 3 mg l li et al 2019 thurman 1985 furthermore doc is often found in higher concentrations in pore water compared to lake water dithmer et al 2016 lmb is usually applied to the surface lake water where it can capture dissolved phosphorus and once settled onto the surface of the sediment bed lmb can inactivate the phosphorus in sediment by sequestering phosphorus from the pore water hence the effect of doc on the efficacy of lmb for eutrophication control is of the utmost importance the work by lürling et al lürling et al 2014 was the first study to understand the influence of doc and their results showed that less phosphate was removed in the presence of humic substances laboratory tests by dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 also revealed the negative effects of two model doc compounds humic acid and phthalate on the phosphate binding capacity of lmb furthermore using lake water samples from 16 danish lakes a significant negative relationship was found between the natural doc concentration and colour and the phosphate binding capacity of lmb similarly spears et al spears et al 2016 examined the effectiveness of lmb across a wide range of lake conditions and found that the phosphorus concentrations following lmb applications varied across the lakes and were correlated positively with the doc concentrations indicating that doc interfered with the phosphorus removal by lmb however the effect of doc on the phosphate adsorption by lmb is still not adequately clarified for instance although the maximum adsorption capacity of phosphate by lmb can be expressed by the la p molar ratio of 1 1 because the formation of lapo4 nh2o was confirmed the maximum adsorption capacity of doc by lmb has still not been measured before in other words the ratio of the adsorption maxima of doc versus phosphate c p molar ratio or c la molar ratio is still unknown understanding the adsorption behaviour of doc by lmb would help determine how doc influences phosphate adsorption by lmb in addition although the removal of phosphate by lmb in the presence at different concentrations and absence of doc was investigated previously and negative effect of doc on phosphate removal was shown dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 the experiments were done when phosphate and doc coexisted it is still not clarified if phosphate previously adsorbed on lmb is stable when exposed to doc later and if doc previously adsorbed on lmb is stable when exposed to phosphate later this information is important to understand for the binding of phosphate and doc by lmb which solute has higher affinity towards the adsorption sites and which solute can be more strongly retained by lmb in this study to better understand the efficacy of lmb for phosphate removal in the presence of doc the adsorption behaviours of both phosphate and doc were first evaluated second the phosphate immobilization by lmb was examined as a function of the doc concentration in both deionized water and doc spiked lake water taken from lake taihu which is located in the yangtze delta plain and is the third largest freshwater lake in china lake taihu has an area of 2250 km2 and an average depth of 2 m third the reversibility of the adsorption of both phosphate and doc on lmb was determined finally the implication of the results for the inactivation of phosphorus in lakes was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the lmb sample used in this study was provided by the shanghai phoslock water solutions ltd for comparison purposes a natural bentonite sample was obtained from the linshou hengchang mining co ltd hebei province china the samples were ground to pass through an 80 mesh sieve prior to use the chemical composition of bentonite and lmb are presented in table 1 the elemental compositions of the materials were determined by x ray fluorescence axios x panalytical company while the moisture and loss on ignition were measured from the weight loss at 105 c and 900 c respectively the phosphate solutions were prepared with kh2po4 humic acid has been widely used as a model doc compound and was also used in this study humic acid was supplied by aldrich chemical in the form of humic acid sodium salt which was extracted from waters draining from an open pit mine in oberhessen germany the natural lake water sample was obtained on august 24th 2018 from the gonghu bay of lake taihu 31 21 23 n 119 59 35 e the concentrations of some of the soluble components are given in table s1 among them the total p and soluble reactive p srp concentrations were determined using the molybdenum blue colorimetric method chinese environmental protection administration 2002 doc was measured using a chnos elemental analyser model vario eliii germany after the water had been filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the total alkalinity in caco3 was determined to be 87 8 mg l by the titration method chinese environmental protection administration 2002 all other common ions were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icap 6000 radial thermo usa and ion chromatography metrohm mici switzerland the water sample had a ph of 7 5 as measured by a hach sension ph meter 2 2 methods 2 2 1 adsorption isotherm studies the adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted using aqueous solutions containing either phosphate or doc the initial phosphate and doc concentrations ranged from 5 to 100 mg l and from 2 5 to 300 mg l respectively all the solutions contained 0 01 m nacl as the background electrolyte first stock solutions of kh2po4 with the concentration of 1000 mgp l and humic acid sodium salt with the concentration of 1000 mgc l were separately prepared using 0 01 m nacl solution the working solutions of phosphate and doc were then obtained by dilution of the stock solutions with 0 01 m nacl solution the use of 0 01 m nacl was to keep the ionic strength roughly constant independently of the amount of kh2po4 or humic acid sodium salt added the experiments were performed by adding 40 ml of the aqueous solutions to centrifuge tubes containing 0 1 g of lmb or the bentonite sample the tubes were then shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c for 48 h an adsorption time of 48 h was found to be sufficient for both phosphate and doc to achieve equilibrium in our adsorption kinetics studies fig s1 specifically under our experimental conditions the amount of adsorbed phosphate and doc increased sharply at the initial stage and then continued to increase slowly but the adsorption amount reached equilibrium at 24 h since there was no statistically significant increase in the amount adsorbed between the adsorption time of 24 h and 48 h duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 after 48 h the suspensions were centrifuged and the phosphate concentrations in the supernatants were determined by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method chinese environmental protection administration 2002 and doc was evaluated directly at a wavelength of 218 5 nm with a unico spectrophotometer model uv 2102pcs china the amount of adsorbed phosphate or doc at equilibrium qe was calculated using the following equation 1 q e v c 0 c e m where v is the volume of the solution l c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of phosphate or doc mg l respectively and m is the dry mass of lmb or bentonite g adsorption isotherm experiments using aqueous solutions containing both phosphate and doc were also carried out in this case the phosphate concentration varied from 5 to 100 mg l while the doc concentration was set to achieve a constant c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 this ratio was adopted since the c p molar ratio when the adsorption capacity of phosphate and doc on lmb attained saturation was 1 5 1 the doc concentration in the supernatant was directly measured spectrophotometrically while the phosphate concentration was determined after the supernatant was digested with a potassium persulfate solution because our preliminary experiment confirmed that the colour of doc can influence the quantification of phosphate when the doc concentration exceeded 20 mg l 2 2 2 adsorption of phosphate as a function of the doc concentration forty millilitres of a phosphate solution with different doc concentrations was added to 50 ml centrifuge tubes containing 2 48 mg of lmb this dose corresponds to the lmb p mass ratio of 100 1 which was used in previous studies dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013 waajen et al 2016 yin et al 2018 to accurately add small amount of lmb a stock suspension was first prepared by the continuous mixing of 2 48 g of lmb with 1 l of deionized water subsamples of 1 ml were taken from this suspension and were transferred to centrifuge tubes the phosphate concentration of 0 62 mg l was adopted as it is representative of the pore water concentrations in danish eutrophic lakes reitzel et al 2013 the doc concentration was set to 0 0 5 2 4 8 12 20 40 60 80 and 120 mg l this range of doc concentrations can represent the natural doc concentration level in danish lakes de vicente et al 2008 dithmer et al 2016 furthermore the solutions were prepared with a 0 01 m ammonium chloride ammonia buffer solution instead of pure water to achieve a constant ph of 7 5 and an ionic strength equal to that of 0 01 m nacl after being shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm for 48 h the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter and the filtrate was then digested with a potassium persulfate solution the phosphate concentration in the digested filtrate was measured 2 2 3 adsorption of phosphate from natural lake water spiked with doc before the experiment the lake water was spiked with kh2po4 to achieve an srp concentration of 0 62 mg l furthermore an aliquot of this lake water was spiked with humic acid to achieve a doc concentration of 14 21 mg l i e increasing the doc concentration by 10 mg l forty millilitres of the lake water with or without the adjusted doc concentration was added to 50 ml centrifuge tubes and 2 48 mg of lmb was added for comparison purposes experiments using a phosphate solution with a concentration of 0 62 mg l which was prepared from pure water were also conducted the tubes were shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm after 1 2 4 8 14 20 and 28 days the suspensions were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and the srp concentration of the filtrates were determined 2 2 4 reversibility of phosphate and doc adsorption to evaluate the reversibility of phosphate adsorption the first step was to prepare phosphate loaded lmb for this purpose 0 1 g of lmb was weighed and placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes then 40 ml of a phosphate solution whose concentration was 50 mg l was added this phosphate concentration was adopted to reach nearly the maximum amount of phosphate adsorption based on the isotherm studies the solution contained 0 01 m nacl as the background electrolyte after being shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm for 48 h the tubes were centrifuged and the phosphate concentration and amount of phosphate adsorbed by lmb qe were calculated with the supernatants the solid in the tube was rinsed five times with deionized water to remove any residual phosphate that was not adsorbed by lmb the second step was to measure the adsorption isotherm of doc on the phosphate loaded lmb which was performed according to the method described in section 2 2 1 however the phosphate concentration in the equilibrium solution was additionally measured and the amount of phosphate desorbed from lmb qd was calculated as follows 2 q d c d v m the desorption efficiency was calculated using the following equation 3 η q d q e 100 where cd is the phosphate concentration in the supernatant after desorption mg l v is the volume of the doc solution added as the desorption reagent l and qe is the amount of phosphate adsorbed mg g to further illustrate the reversibility of phosphate adsorption the phosphate loaded lmb was also repeatedly washed with the doc solution that is the doc solution which had a concentration of 50 mg l and used 0 01 m nacl as the background electrolyte was added to the tubes containing phosphate loaded lmb this doc concentration was used because doc can nearly reach its maximum adsorption amount based on the isotherm studies the tubes were shaken at 25 c and 180 rpm for 48 h to desorb the adsorbed phosphate after centrifugation the phosphate concentration in the supernatant was measured after this desorption step a fresh doc solution was again added and the desorption experiment was repeated three times in total the reversibility of doc adsorption was evaluated in the same manner by measuring the desorption of doc previously adsorbed on lmb and using the phosphate solution as the desorption agent 2 2 5 data analysis the phosphate and doc concentrations were expressed in elemental p and c respectively all the experiments were undertaken in triplicate and the mean value and the standard deviation are reported whenever necessary data were also analysed using one way analysis of variance by comparing the treated groups and the control and or comparing the different treated groups using the student newman keuls multiple range tests the homogeneity of variance was tested using bartlett s test the statistical analysis was performed using the statistical analysis system sas 8 2 sas institute cary nc usa all the significance levels mentioned in the text are p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherms the results of the separate adsorption isotherms of phosphate and doc on lmb and a bentonite sample are presented in fig 1 a the affinity of lmb for phosphate was high causing a vertical isotherm shape at the low initial phosphate concentrations this means that at low phosphate concentrations lmb can exhaust or uptake most of the phosphate in the water leaving a very low residual phosphate concentration specifically when the initial phosphate concentration was lower than 10 mg l 99 of the phosphate in the water can be sequestered by lmb the results in fig 1a also showed that lmb has the capability to adsorb doc however it appeared that the affinity of lmb for doc was lower than that of lmb for phosphate since only 40 of the doc in the water can be captured by lmb even when the doc concentration was low 30 mg l the complex formation of la with humic substances was previously predicted at 5 mg l tang and johannesson 2003 and experimentally demonstrated for example at 10 mg l sonke and salters 2006 tang and johannesson 2003 2010 our results suggested that the fixation of doc by the la on lmb can occur at a concentration as low as 2 5 mg l removal efficiency 40 at high concentrations however the amount of both phosphate and doc adsorbed by lmb levelled off indicating that the adsorption sites are limited and the adsorption ability reached saturation nevertheless as seen in fig 1a the bentonite sample exhibited a very low adsorption capacity for both phosphate and doc this is expected however since both the bentonite surface the phosphate ion and doc are negatively charged and repulsion between the bentonite surface and the two adsorbate species must take place therefore although the bentonite sample used in this study is different from that used for the preparation of lmb the latter bentonite is not available it is reasonable to conclude that both phosphate and doc are fixed by the lanthanum on lmb the adsorption isotherm data were fitted using the common langmuir and freundlich models which were given below 4 langmuir model q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 5 freundlich model q e k f c e 1 n where c e is the adsorbate concentration at equilibrium mg l k l is a langmuir constant related to the affinity of the binding sites l mg q max is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g k f is a freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity mg g mg l 1 n and 1 n is a constant related to the adsorption density the fitting results are given in table 2 from the correlation coefficients r2 values it can be concluded that the langmuir model gave a better fit than the freundlich model with r2 values all exceeding 0 995 from the qmax value of phosphate shown in table 2 and the la content of lmb shown in table 1 the la p molar ratio was estimated to be 1 23 1 which was slightly higher than the 1 1 binding ratio theoretically determined by assuming that lapo4 nh2o formed meaning that a small part of la was not available for phosphate binding the lanthanum speciation depends on the hydrolysis of the la ion because the ph condition used in this study was not regulated and was measured to be 7 3 0 4 the dominant la species would be mostly trivalent la ions la3 with a small proportion of divalent hydroxyl la ions laoh2 while the existence of the species la oh 2 la oh 3 and la oh 4 is unlikely kawahigashi et al 2005 on the other hand the predominant phosphate species at a ph 7 3 0 4 would be a mixture of h2po4 and hpo4 because these two species are exclusively present at ph values ranging from 5 to 10 bouyer et al 2006 therefore the surface species present due to the inner sphere complex formation of phosphate with lmb can be inferred as follows guan et al 2020 6 la hpo4 2 la hpo4 7 la h2po4 la h2po4 8 la oh hpo4 2 la po4 h2o 9 la oh h2po4 la hpo4 h2o from the qmax values of phosphate and doc it was calculated that the adsorption capacity of phosphate and doc had a c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 when their adsorption reached saturation compared with the small inorganic phosphate anion which can come close to the surface for binding the size of doc macromolecules is large for instance the diameter of humic acid is approximately 2 7 nm rahnemaie et al 2007 therefore although most of the phosphate ions can be bound to la a large part of the doc has to be positioned beyond the adsorption sites and only a small part of the carboxylate groups rcoo can interact with la to form an inner sphere complex according to the ligand exchange reaction similar to that occurring for phosphate hiemstra et al 2013 weng et al 2012 10 la rcoo la oocr 11 la oh rcooh la oocr h2o 3 2 co adsorption of phosphate and doc the results of the co adsorption isotherms of phosphate and doc coexisting in water at a c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 are given in fig 1b and the fitting results of the adsorption isotherm data to the two adsorption models are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the adsorption of both phosphate and doc was essentially not influenced by one another and their adsorption maxima differed little from their adsorption maxima obtained when they presented in water as a single adsorbate this phenomenon was surprising and may be explained by the great coordination capacity of la although both the solutes can be coordinated with la the small phosphate ion would be more competitive than doc this will be described in more detail in section 3 4 and would interact first with la however even after phosphate was adsorbed the characteristic coordination number of 12 for la still renders the adsorption of doc possible in addition the interaction of the abundant o n and s atoms of doc with the hydroxyl group of the phosphate adsorbed via hydrogen bonding may also contribute to the adsorption of doc after phosphate adsorption one more explanation is that phosphate did not occupy all the la sites as abovementioned the la p molar ratio was 1 23 1 which was larger than 1 1 and the interaction of doc with these unoccupied la sites scattered on the bentonite surface may be still possible in this case due to the large size of doc the interaction of each carboxyl group can add adsorption forces to the doc macromolecule rendering the adsorption of large doc particles possible in each case however the hydrogen bonds can occur both intra and inter molecularly between the adsorbed doc which would certainly facilitate adsorption 3 3 adsorption of phosphate in the presence of doc at different c p molar ratios as abovementioned the adsorption of phosphate was not influenced by the presence of doc and vice versa at the low c p molar ratio of 1 5 1 which was relevant to the ratio of their qmax values however it should be noted that the c p molar ratio in natural lakes would be much higher for instance dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 measured the srp and doc concentrations in both lake water and sediment pore water obtained from 16 danish lakes and found that the c p molar ratio in the lake water and pore water was as high as 165 and 70 on average respectively even assuming that the phosphorus concentration reached 0 62 mg l which is the representative phosphorus concentration level in the pore water of sediments of eutrophic lakes reitzel et al 2013 the c p molar ratio was still as high as 32 in the lake water and 48 in the pore water respectively similarly de vicente de vicente et al 2008 measured the average doc concentration in lake water obtained from 31 danish lakes to be 7 5 mg l while spears et al spears et al 2016 determined the doc concentration of 18 lakes across a wide range of lake conditions in europe and canada to be 9 95 mg l on average the doc concentrations of 7 5 and 9 95 mg l will result in c p molar ratios of 32 and 42 respectively assuming that the phosphorus concentration is 0 62 mg l considering that the srp concentration would be lower than 0 62 mg l in most cases the c p molar ratio would be higher than estimated above therefore understanding the adsorption of phosphate as a function of the doc concentration c p molar ratio is of great importance the results in fig 2 showed that the phosphate amount absorbed by lmb depended greatly on the doc concentration c p molar ratio although doc did not influence the phosphate uptake significantly at concentrations 2 mg l i e c p molar ratios 9 duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 a further increase in the doc concentration c p molar ratio caused a linear increase in the residual phosphate concentration after phosphate was adsorbed by lmb fig 2 the residual phosphate concentration continued to increase when the doc concentration exceeded 40 mg l c p molar ratio 167 but the growth rate decreased this phenomenon can be explained readily by the law of mass action which states that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two reactants for a bi reactant reaction because the collision frequency increases with increasing concentrations for the adsorption of phosphate and doc the concentration of lmb as a reactant is the same and therefore at the same phosphate concentration the higher the doc concentration the higher the adsorption amount of doc via formula 10 and 11 when compared with the phosphate adsorption amount obtained via formulas 6 to 9 the results of the 28 day incubation experiments shown in fig 3 further supported the abovementioned conclusion in pure water the capture of phosphate by lmb was completed within two days because there was no statistically significant decrease in the residual phosphate concentration at incubation times longer than two days duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 the coexistence of soluble components in the lake water including a doc concentration of 4 21 mg l corresponding to a c p molar ratio of 18 greatly reduced the performance of lmb for srp capture fig 3 however this decrease cannot be attributed solely to doc since a number of other components in the lake water may also influence srp adsorption although we believe that doc played a dominant role based on the results shown in fig 2 similar results on the importance of the doc concentration in influencing the lmb performance for phosphorus inactivation was recently pointed out by spears et al spears et al 2016 who reported that the phosphorus concentrations following lmb applications varied across the lakes and were correlated positively with the dissolved organic carbon concentrations spiking doc by adding humic acid into the lake water to achieve a concentration of 14 21 mg l further decreased the performance of lmb fig 3 which indicated that an increase in the doc concentration alone can reduce the sequestration of srp by lmb in addition the existence of doc not only decreased the adsorption amount of srp increased the residual srp concentration but also lowered the rate of the srp adsorption process the adsorption process occurring in both the lake water and doc spiked lake water was much slower than that occurring in the pure water in which phosphate adsorption reached equilibrium within two days in fact a statistically significant decline in the residual srp concentration continued until day 14 from which time on there was no significant decrease in the residual srp concentration duncan multiple comparisons p 0 05 after being applied in lakes lmb will eventually settled onto lake bed where it can continuously adsorb phosphorus from pore water in sediment i e inactivate phosphorus in lake sediments the adopted phosphate concentration in this study was 0 62 mg l which was representative of phosphorus concentration in pore water of eutrophic lake sediments and was also used in other studies dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013 however this concentration is far higher than that of the water sample taken from the lake taihu table s1 lmb can scavenge dissolved phosphorus from the water column during the settling process which may takes weeks to months under natural conditions spears et al 2013 or when settled lmb is re suspended into water column by wind induced waves and currents for the inactivation of phosphorus in water column of lakes such as the lake taihu further studies using much lower phosphate concentration may be required however the results in laboratory experiments in this study could be really applied for the phosphate binding from water column in heavily eutrophic lakes with relevant high phosphate concentrations for instance lake dianchi 24 40 25 02 n 102 36 102 47 e is one of the most eutrophicated lakes in china and high phosphorus concentration in the lake has been reported reaching 0 4 mg l in the caohai section and 0 2 mg l in the waihai section yan et al 2019 similarly xie et al 2013 found that phosphorus concentration reached 0 32 mg l in the caohai section and varied from 0 12 to 0 18 mg l in the waihai section li et al 2019 collected water samples from the waihai section for the experiments of phosphorus removal by ferric chloride and determined the initial phosphorus concentration to be 0 19 mg l 3 4 reversibility of the adsorption of phosphate and doc to determine whether phosphate or doc is more strongly adsorbed by lmb the adsorption isotherm of phosphate on lmb that was previously saturated with doc and the adsorption isotherm of doc on lmb that was previously saturated with phosphate were measured and the results are displayed in fig 4 fig 4 clearly revealed that regardless of the presence of doc on lmb the phosphate adsorption amount can reach an adsorption amount maximum as high as that of the original lmb fig 4 table 2 at the same time phosphate can replace most of the doc that was previously adsorbed on lmb fig 4 on the other hand the adsorption of doc on phosphate loaded lmb also attained nearly the same adsorption maximum as the original lmb but doc displaced little phosphate that was previously adsorbed on lmb fig 4 table 2 this clearly shows that phosphate is more competitive than doc for the la sites recently dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 conducted a long term 400 days laboratory study suggesting that the negative effect of doc on srp adsorption by lmb is obvious in the short term but probably not permanent i e srp will eventually be sequestered by lmb our results provided solid proof to support that the consideration of dithmer et al dithmer et al 2016 is very likely since the adsorption of doc is reversible in the presence of phosphate however although phosphate adsorption attained the adsorption maximum doc was not totally desorbed fig 4a possible reasons are that i displaced doc can be re adsorbed on the phosphate loaded lmb due to the high coordination capacity of la ii the o n or s atoms of doc interact with the hydroxyl group s of the phosphate adsorbed via hydrogen bonding and iii doc interacts with the la sites that were not occupied by phosphate note that the la p molar ratio was higher than 1 1 even when phosphate reached saturation as described in section 3 1 these reasons may also explain why the adsorption of doc essentially reached its adsorption maximum without the displacement of the phosphate that was previously adsorbed on lmb fig 4b to further confirm the reversibility of the adsorption of phosphate or doc in the presence of doc or phosphate the phosphate saturated lmb or doc saturated lmb was desorbed with repeated washing using a doc solution or phosphate solution the concentration of either the doc solution or phosphate solution can assure that the solutes reach their adsorption maxima provided that doc or phosphate were present in the water as a single adsorbate the results shown in table 3 indicated that both the adsorption of doc on the phosphate saturated lmb and the adsorption of phosphate on the doc saturated lmb virtually achieved their adsorption maxima by the first washing step and further washing only resulted in little adsorption what is the most important is that doc desorbed little phosphate that was pre adsorbed on lmb but most of the doc pre loaded on lmb can be displaced by phosphate therefore once the phosphate was adsorbed by lmb it is stable and will not be released into the water even in the presence of high doc concentrations these results observed in our present study showing that phosphate adsorption is advantageous at low c p ratios and the adsorbed phosphate is stable in the presence of high doc concentrations have important implications for phosphorus inactivation in lakes using lmb that is lmb can be applied during the season time when the c p ratio in lakes is low facilitating the adsorption of phosphorus which will no longer be liberated into water even after the c p ratio is increased later avoiding the application of lmb when the c p ratio is high is especially important in soft low alkalinity water lakes because of the high la dissolution in soft low alkalinity water with high doc concentration reitzel et al 2017 for instance the bloom of algae in lakes can not only increase the doc level via metabolic excretion which is the autolysis of cells or death from an external factor e g virus attack in aquatic and artificial ecosystems henderson et al 2008 hertkorn et al 2002 li et al 2019 but also decrease the srp concentration by algal uptake li et al 2019 therefore the season in which the high chlorophyll a concentration would lead to a high c p ratio should be avoided for lmb application in addition to the autochthonous material derived from algal or microbiological productivity allochthonous organic matter from terrestrial inputs also contributes to the doc in lakes and often dominates the organic carbon balance in most freshwater systems located in temperate climates mash et al 2004 onstad et al 2000 allochthonous organic matter which is derived from the decomposition of terrestrial plant debris and the humification of soil organic matter enters aquatic systems mainly from the subsequent runoff of overland water flow during rainfall events mash et al 2004 onstad et al 2000 to achieve a good removal efficiency of phosphate by lmb it would be better to avoid this season however because our experimental results revealed that the relative concentration of doc versus phosphorus determines the efficiency of the phosphorus removal by lmb it would be important to realize the dynamics of the c p ratio in a lake rather than the dynamics of the doc concentration or phosphorus concentration alone prior to the internal phosphorus load management using lmb humic substances such as humic acid and fulvic acid form the major fraction of doc in aquatic systems typically compose about 60 of the doc antelo et al 2007 stevenson 1994 and humic acid is thus used as a model doc in this study and many other studies e g de vicente et al 2008 dithmer et al 2016 hiemstra et al 2013 lürling et al 2014 however doc consists of a complex mixture of compounds as a result of its variety of sources and continual reworking by photochemical and microbial degradation processes scully et al 2004 as an example autochthonous and allochthonous docs are substantially different terrestrial or allochthonous material tends to be higher in lignin content with high aromatic content and lower nutrient n p inclusion mash et al 2004 in contrast autochthonous material derived from algal or microbiological productivity tends to be more aliphatic with much higher nutrient inclusion mash et al 2004 therefore future studies are needed to investigate how these kinds of complex doc in lakes under environmental concentration affects adsorption of phosphate by lmb 4 conclusions lmb is a widely used phosphorus inactivating agent in lakes in our present study both phosphate and doc were shown to interact with the la on lmb the influence of doc on the phosphate uptake depended greatly on the relative concentration of doc versus phosphate which can be expressed as the c p molar ratio a significant reduction in the phosphate amount captured by lmb took place at c p molar ratios exceeding 9 below which phosphate adsorption was not influenced significantly by doc on the other hand once fixed by lmb phosphate was essentially not desorbed by doc while adsorbed doc was mostly re released into water by phosphate it is presumed that phosphate can interact preferentially with la through stronger binding forces than doc but doc can be adsorbed on lmb even after it was saturated with phosphate the results obtained in this study have important implications for the inactivation of phosphorus in lakes using lmb showing that lmb should be applied in lakes when the c p molar ratios are low that is it is a good strategy to understand the dynamics of the concentration ratio of doc and phosphate in a lake prior to the use of lmb to achieve a better
