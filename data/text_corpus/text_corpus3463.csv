17315,biological activated carbon bac filtration a process widely used in drinking water treatment was recently reported to harbor antibiotic resistance genes args this emerging contamination is poorly understood this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of args and bacterial community in full scale bac filters during the backwash cycle using high throughput qpcr and high throughput sequencing a total of 178 args were detected in all biofilm samples with relative abundance ranging from 0 1 to 1 37 copies per 16s rrna and absolute abundance ranging from 4 48 107 to 3 09 109 copies g carbon biofilms sampled from different filters shared most detected args and dominant genera including bryobacter pedomicrobium reyranella and terrimonas though their bacterial community structure differed significantly after backwashing the relative args abundance increased by 1 5 to 3 8 folds and the absolute args abundance increased by 0 90 to 1 12 logs in all biofilm samples during filter ripening indicating that args accumulated in filters during this period redundancy analysis suggested that such args accumulation was mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer in winter but highly correlated with the increasing relative abundance of genera bryobacter and acidibacter in summer it was observed that 80 6 89 3 of the detected args persisted in the filters despite of the backwashing given the high richness and relative abundance of args in bac filter and the ineffectiveness of backwashing in arg removal more stringent downstream disinfection strategies are deserved and more research is necessary to assess potential human health risks due to the persistence of args in drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction the number of medical cases associated with antibiotic resistant bacteria arb is increasing at a staggering pace antibiotic development has not kept up with this rise leading to the worldwide problem of bacterial antibiotic resistance bar bar is encoded between segments of dna called antibiotic resistance genes args which are present in both environmental bacteria and pathogens found in the healthcare system rhodes et al 2000 cabello 2006 forsberg et al 2012 price et al 2012 pruden et al 2013 convincing evidence has shown that args and arb associated with clinical infections could originated from the environment for example vancomycin resistant enterococci and its resistance genes that originated from farm animals once spread to healthy human beings and hospitalised patients and causing outbreaks in european countries bonten et al 2001 in recent years args have been defined as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 and the work of investigating the prevalence of environmental args is in full swing bar in drinking water is a problem particularly worthy of attention due to the close linkage with peoples daily lives remarkable events such as the detection of the ndm 1 gene in tap water in new delhi india 2010 walsh et al 2011 and of escherichia coli carrying the extended spectrum β lactamase gene in tap water in france 2016 madec et al 2016 have highlighted the bar risk in drinking water the situation in china is hardly optimistic where diverse highly abundant args have been detected in municipal drinking water jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 the reasons for the presence of drinking water bar are various in drinking water treatment plants dwtps biofiltration particularly bac filtration has shown to largely affect the behaviour of args both the relative abundance and the richness of args were reported increased after bac filtration xu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 subsequent disinfection processes including chlorination or ultraviolet treatment cannot completely remove args at the dosage of the dwtps after disinfection some args still retain the ability to transfer horizontally mckinney and pruden 2012 chao et al 2013 yoon et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 in drinking water distribution systems arb and args could persist in pipeline biofilm which serves as an important reservoir for the spread of bar in water distribution pipelines schlüter et al 2007 szczepanowski et al 2009 stalder et al 2012 bac filters need to be backwashed to clean and restore treatment capacity by removing both retained particles and excess biomass the filter backwashing and subsequent filter ripening constitute a backwash cycle which is optimized to a relatively fixed frequency during the filter operation to improve filtration efficiency and reduce operation cost in this case the properties of the biofilm attached to the filter media would change periodically previous studies have shown that part of the filter biofilm sloughs off during backwashing and that the biomass of filter biofilm recovers to the pre backwashing level in the next backwash cycle gibert et al 2013 liao et al 2015 backwashing could also have a strong impact on the bacterial diversity and community structure of bac biofilm but they could gradually recover with the operating time after backwashing liao et al 2015 since args are mainly carried by bacterial cells and the antibiotic resistome is largely affected by the bacterial community structure jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 chen et al 2018 we hypothesized that the fluctuations in bacterial community structure of biofilm during the filter backwash cycle would also affect the occurrence of the antibiotic resistome however previous study focused on the bar problem in drinking water biofiltration usually lack data of args throughout the backwash cycle and from different depths of filter bed the purpose of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistome of two full scale bac filters in a backwash cycle filter biofilms were sampled at different carbon bed depths and at different stages during the filter ripening period after backwashing a high throughput q pcr based approach ht qpcr was used to characterize the profile of args in filter biofilm high throughput sequencing coupled with bioinformatic analysis was used to investigate the bacterial community structure and its relationship with the antibiotic resistome additionally the args in the bac filters in this study were mapped by comparing the diversity and absolute and relative abundance of args with other environmental media in published literatures the results of this study are likely to increase the understanding of the bar problem caused by drinking water bac filtration 2 material and methods 2 1 plants configuration and samples collection the experiments were conducted at two full scale dwtps a and b hangzhou china plant a uses qiantang river as its water source while plant b uses east tiaoxi river as its water source both plants follow the same water treatment processes primary ozonation coagulation and sedimentation sand filtration ozonation bac filtration and chlorination the main design and operation parameters of the dwtps are shown in table s1 the bac filter of each plant was chosen to sample its influent effluent and activated carbon considering the possible difference in samples from different dwtps and different seasons sample collection was carried out at dwtp a in june and november 2018 and dwtp b in december 2018 here we used filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter to represent the samples collected from dwtp a in june and november and dwtp b in december respectively in order to study the spatiotemporal variation of the bacterial community structure and antibiotic resistome in bac filters during the backwash cycle activated carbon samples were collected at different depths 0 20 40 60 and 100 cm of the carbon bed and at different dates after filter backwashing day 0 2 and 16 of filter a and day 0 and 7 of filter b here day 0 means sampling immediately after backwashing for each

2011 quast et al 2012 sequence analysis was performed using uparse software v7 0 1001 edgar 2013 sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus for each otu the rdp classifier version 2 2 algorithm was used against the silva database quast et al 2012 to annotate taxonomic information all sequences have been deposited in the national center for biotechnology information sequence read archive under the accession number prjna612760 2 5 data collection and normalization in order to further clarify the problem of bar in drinking water bac filters we compared the properties of the args in this study with those of args in other environments in terms of richness relative abundance and absolute abundance we used the web of knowledge database http apps webofknowledge com to retrieve publications our search terms included antibiotic resistance genes or antimicrobial resistance genes and high throughput qpcr or ht qpcr the time frame for searching papers was from 2000 to 2020 publications were then checked individually to eliminate any duplicates or irrelevant articles taking into account the need to compare the arg properties of bac filters with other actual natural or artificial environments papers based on experimental studies on the field pilot or laboratory scale were excluded moreover we screened papers that used ht qpcr as the research method and used more than 200 pairs of primers to detect args ultimately 32 relevant papers investigating the occurrence of environmental args met our criteria the basic information reported these papers is listed in table s5 data relating to the richness relative abundance and absolute abundance of args in these papers were recorded directly or extracted by using plot digitizer software plotdigitizer sourceforge net to facilitate comparison all arg data were further normalized to the same unit where the relative abundance was converted to arg copies per 16s rrna gene and the absolute abundance was converted to arg copies per liter water or arg copies per gram solid for sediment soil fecal matter manure compost and sludge klappenbach et al 2001 stalder et al 2014 2 6 statistical analysis in this study one way analysis of variance anova and paired t tests were carried out to assess the statistical difference using graphpad prism 8 http www graphpad com pearson correlation analysis was conducted using graphpad prism 8 as well principal coordinates analysis pcoa and principal component analysis pca were conducted using r3 3 3 http www r project org all figures were generated using graphpad prism 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter performance and distribution of bacterial biomass the water quality parameters of filter influent and effluent are summarized in table s3 temperature do codmn and nh4 n were monitored throughout the sampling period to characterize changes in water quality during filter ripening in both dwtps the concentration of codmn and nh4 n decreased significantly paired t test p 0 05 after passing through the bac filter indicating that bac filters were effective in purifying the water and that all filters were operating well during the sampling period the removal rate of codmn and nh4 n increased with the running time after filter backwashing the increasing removal rate of codmn is likely due to the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria which is consistent with the hpc results in filter biofilm shown below while the increasing removal rate of nh4 n may attribute to the recovery of nitrifying bacteria which has been reported in the previous study laurent et al 2003 hpc results indicated that the effluent of all filters contained more culturable bacteria 1 64 103 3 41 103 cfu ml than the influent 4 13 102 9 07 102 cfu ml with the average hpc results increased by 4 21 3 61 and 4 14 fold in the effluent of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively fig 1 throughout the backwash cycle the number of culturable bacteria remained stable in filter influents and filter effluents inside the filter the culturable bacteria ranged from 5 45 106 to 1 03 108 2 10 106 to 1 02 108 and 2 15 106 to 4 14 107 cfu g carbon in the samples of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively an obvious decline trend in biomass with the increasing depth was found in all filters which was attributed to the continuous consumption of nutrients along the filter wang et al 1995 urfer and huck 2001 the biomass remained essentially stable in deep layers 20 100 cm throughout the backwash cycle although it increased at the filter surface 0 cm with the culturable bacteria raised from 1 38 107 to 9 43 107 4 57 107 to 1 0 108 and 1 23 107 to 4 0 107 cfu g carbon in filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively suggesting that backwashing may be able to effectively reduce heterotrophic bacteria in the filter surface but has little effect on the removal of heterotrophic bacteria from deep layers similar results have also been reported in previous studies for example servais et al 1991 reported that backwashing can effectively remove the biomass on the surface of the bac filter but the removal of the biomass in the deep layer is limited liao et al 2015 found that backwashing reduced nearly half of the biomass on the surface of bac filter but after two days of operation the biomass returned to the level before the backwash in this study the increase of hpc in filter surface would consume more organic matter which would contribute to the increasing codmn removal rate during filter ripening 3 2 bacterial community in filter biofilm filter biofilms were collected and analyzed for bacterial community structure in the backwash cycle after gene sequencing assembly and quality filtering a total of 3 001 491 high quality sequences were obtained with each sample ranging between 2 355 and 93 039 the sequences were further clustered into 50 080 otus at a 3 dissimilarity level as shown in table s4 the detected otu number ranged from 957 to 1449 593 to 1294 and 1255 to 1408 with different filter depths and sampling dates for filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively vertically samples from the filter surface 0 cm contained the least otus compared to deeper depths 20 100 cm this difference in otus may have resulted from differences in the concentration and composition of the nutrients that the biofilm received as reported in previous studies filter surfaces receive nutrients that are abundant but simple in composition after entering the filter the nutrients are consumed by microorganisms which also release metabolites creating a micro environment with low nutrient concentration but complex composition such a microenvironment provides more ecological niches and in turn leads to the increase of biodiversity in addition the filter surface was affected by a higher concentration of ozone which will inhibit ozone sensitive bacteria and narrow the niche resulting in relatively low biodiversity eiler et al 2003 wan et al 2019 during the filter ripening period the otus and the shannon index increased significantly paired t test p 0 05 in filter a summer and in deep layers 40 100 cm of filter a winter but remained stable in filter b winter and the top layers 0 20 cm of filter a winter as shown in fig s1 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all filters at the genera level bryobacter pedomicrobium reyranella and terrimonas were predominant and shared among filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter all these genera were previously reported in dwtps sly et al 1988 liao et al 2012 delafont et al 2013 liao et al 2013 the relative abundance of dominant genera relative percentage 1 were compared during the filter ripening period fig 2 a as shown in fig 2b seven genera in filter a summer were significantly changed in relative abundance the genera bradyrhizobium and leptothrix were enriched while genera hyphomicrobium pirellula hydrogenophaga zavarzinella and rhodobacter were attenuated three genera in filter a winter changed significantly in abundance with genera hydrogenophaga and amphiplicatus attenuated and genus pirellula enriched the enriched genera including bradyrhizobium and pirellula were previously reported as heterotrophic bacteria van berkum p 1987 glöckner et al 2003 the dominant growth of these bacteria will increase the consumption of codmn among the dominant genera leptothrix has been reported to inhabit different types of aquatic environments and is able to oxidize both iron ii and manganese ii pringsheim 1949 and hyphomicrobium spp have been commonly identified as major players in denitrification systems timmermans and van haute 1983 both of the genera were previously detected in drinking water bac filters magic knezev et al 2009 oh et al 2018 in addition to the dominant genera legionella a pathogenic endosymbiont that is critically important to human health khan 2006 and pseudomonas which may contain infectious species such as p aeruginosa p oryzihabitans and p plecoglossicida were also detected in filters with significantly higher abundances in summer than in winter fig s2 it should be noted that legionella was detectable in all biofilm samples and there was no significant change in the relative abundance of legionella after backwashing which was consistent with a previous study that reported that legionella thrived and persisted in two full scale drinking water bac filters gerrity et al 2018 principal co ordinates analysis pcoa based on the relative abundance of all genera presented significant structural differences among samples of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter fig 2c suggesting that the water source and seasonal factors determine the composition of the bacterial community in filter biofilm for the filter a winter and filter b winter samples there were significant differences in bacterial community composition between the filter surface 0 cm and deeper layers 20 100 cm fig 2c which was likely attributed to 1 non uniform distribution of the composition and concentration of nutrients and ozone in the vertical direction of the filter boon et al 2011 wan et al 2019 and 2 a strong retention effect on influent bacteria by filter surface which may similar to that in schmutzdecke of slow sand filtration pfannes et al 2015 one notable observation found in all filters was that the bacterial community composition remained stable with operation time in the backwash cycle fig 2c previous studies have shown that filter backwashing shocked the bacterial community temporarily but the community was quickly restored during subsequent operation gibert et al 2013 kim et al 2014 liao et al 2015 3 3 changes in the bacterial antibiotic resistome during the backwash cycle a total of 178 args covering 8 categories were detected in all biofilm samples using ht qpcr with a range of 127 to 154 124 to 165 and 101 to 168 for the filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter samples respectively previous studies have reported similar results in arg richness in bac filters for example zhang et al 2018 detected 141 args in the bac filter in another dwtp of hangzhou and xu et al 2016 found that bac filtration caused a significant increase from 76 to 150 of args in drinking water treatment of all args detected in this study one hundred and one were shared among filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter fig 3 a indicating that most detected args were shared by different bac filters and in different seasons during a backwash cycle one hundred and twenty five identical args were detected in filter a summer before and after the filter ripening while the identical args were 139 and 92 in filter a winter and filter b winter respectively fig 3b these results indicated that the args richness remained stable and that most detected args persisted in the bac filter throughout the backwash cycle as shown in fig 4 a the relative abundance of args ranged from 0 10 to 1 37 copies per 16s rrna of all biofilm samples these levels covered that described by zheng et al 2018 where the arg abundance was found to be 0 86 copies per 16s rrna 0 21 copies per cell in a bac filter after backwashing the relative abundance of args increased significantly in the filter ripening period with the average level at all depths increased by 1 5 2 9 and 3 8 fold in filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively for most detected args the fold change of relative abundance before and after filter ripening was greater than 1 fig 4b suggesting that most args are enriched during the filter ripening period pcoa based on the relative abundance of all args indicated that the structure of antibiotic resistome in filter a summer and filter b winter remained stable throughout the backwash cycle and the antibiotic reisstome of filter a winter reached a stable structure after two days of operation after filter backwashing fig s3 pearson correlation analysis of all samples showed that there was a significant positive correlation between args and transposons p 0 001 and integrons p 0 05 fig s4 suggesting that horizontal gene transfer hgt may play an important role in the occurrence of args in biofilm of bac filter we further analyzed the changes in the structure of antibiotic resistome in each filter during the backwash cycle and its correlation with dominant genera and mges fig 5 after backwashing the structure of antibiotic resistome changed significantly with the operation time in each filter 90 7 95 85 and 96 87 of the variance in antibiotic resistome of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter could be explained by the selected variables the enrichment of bryobacter and acidibacter during filter ripening is significantly related to the change in antibiotic resistome structure of filter a summer while the mges especially transposases are the key to the structural changes in the antibiotic resistome of filter a winter and filter b winter biofilms are an ideal environment for hgt given their stable physical structure that is conducive to cell cell contact and the persistence of extracellular dna reviewed in søren et al 2003 and madsen et al 2012 in drinking water treatment the highest hgt frequency has been reported to occur in biofilm of bac filter compared to biofilm of sand filter and anthracite filter ehlers and bouwer 1999 xu et al 2020 based on bench scale experiments a recent study found that the transferability of conjugative plasmid decreased significantly after filter backwashing xu et al 2020 and such transferability is likely to be restored in the filter ripening period fig s5 another study reported that quorum sensing molecules such as acyl homoserine lactones could be the driving force that promotes plasmid transfer during biofilm formation zheng et al 2018 given the recovery growth of biofilm after backwashing quorum sensing molecules are likely to accumulate in biofilters which may accelerate the horizontal transfer of args and result in the increasing abundance of args as shown in fig 4a the increase in the relative abundance of args during the filter ripening period was more significant in winter samples compared to summer samples fig 5 further showed that the increase in args abundance is likely caused by hgt such results suggested that low temperatures were conducive to the hgt of args previous studies have made similar observations for example miller et al 2014 reported that the increase of arg abundance was more pronounced at a lower temperature 4 c than the ambient temperature 20 c during the storage of sludge biosolids son et al 2018 reported that the relative args abundance consistently increased in rivers and reservoirs during the coldest season in south korea as an environmental stress low temperatures induce the rpos mediated response of the bacterial cell white 2000 it was hypothesized and confirmed in some cases that rpos response could enhance the ability of bacterial cells to take up dna which has the potential to increase the horizontal transfer of args capy et al 2000 lives et al 2001 claverys et al 2006 in addition to hgt change in bacterial community structure also affects the occurrence of args and in many cases is the key di driver determining environmental antibiotic resistome forsberg et al 2014 su et al 2015 for example jia et al 2015 found bacterial community shift drives antibiotic resistance promotion during drinking water chlorination chen et al 2016 found that long term field application of sewage sludge to the soil changed the bacterial community composition which shaped the structure of antibiotic resistome and increased the abundance and diversity of args in this study the relative abundance between the dominant genera changed more in the summer samples than in winter samples during filter ripening fig 2b although the whole bacterial community compostion remained stable fig 2c four of the dominant genera with significant changes in relative abundance in filter a summer are significantly related to structural changes in the antibiotic reistome it seems that the fluctuation in relative abundance of dominant genera rather than the change in entire bacterial community contributed more to the variation of antibiotic resistome during filter ripening in summer we found genera bryobacter and acidibacter are significantly relate to the structural changes in the antibiotic resistome of filter a summer it is likely that the enrichment of genera acidibacter and bryobacter lead to the increase in relative args abundance of filter a summer a previous study using metagenomic approach found a broad spectrum of args with high abundance in the sediments of river ganges and most of the args were significantly correlated with acidibacter reddy and dubey 2019 significant positive correlation between acidibacter and suli and sulii were also found in another study that focused on the constructed wetland treating pharmaceutical wastewater li et al 2020 however few studies have reported the linkage between bryobacter and args as shown in fig s6 the biofilms of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter contained args with absolute abundances ranging from 9 33 107 to 7 49 108 2 56 108 to 2 87 109 and 5 61 107 to 7 46 108 copies g carbon respectively after backwashing the absolute abundance of args increased significantly in the filter ripening period as discussed in our previous study the horizontal transfer of args may be partly responsible for the accumulation of args in the biofilm in addition the retention of influent args by the filter and the maintenance of extracellular args by the biofilm would also increase the absolute abundance of args wan et al 2020 a gradient attenuation trend was observed in absolute arg abundance in the vertical direction in the filters this observation was consistent with our previous work on sand filters wan et al 2019 as reported by wan et al 2020 the absolute abundance of args was positively correlated with that of 16s rrna genes in filter biofilm the consumption of nutrients in the filter leads to the decline of biomass with depth and also results in the reduction of absolute arg abundance 3 4 potential bar risks caused by bac filtration to highlight the bar risks we compared the data from this study with published arg data in other environments as shown in fig 6 the arg richness in bac filters ranged from 101 to 174 in this study which was significantly higher than that of soils waters sediments manures manure composts and most wastewater sludge samples the relative abundance of args in bac filters ranged from 0 1 to 1 37 copies per 16s rrna which was comparable to that of most soils waters sediments manures manure composts and wastewater sludge samples the absolute abundance of args in bac filters ranged from 4 48 107 to 3 09 109 copies g carbon which was numerically lower than most water samples but similar to sediments and some soil samples however given that the units in different environmental samples cannot be unified the significance of this comparison on absolute arg abundance is limited it should be noted that source water reservoir water some river water and groundwater is a relatively clean environment in which the args are lower in richness and relative abundance than those in most wastewater as shown in fig 6a and 6b and the selective pressures such as antibiotics and heavy metals are usually present at extremely low ppb levels zhang et al 2018a 2018b and frequently are not even detectable simazaki et al 2015 however the args detected in drinking water bac filters in this study were more diverse and abundant than in most polluted environments we suspect such inconsistency was likely caused by three reasons first it was reported that genetic diversity in bacterial community is positively correlated with the bacterial diversity vellend and geber 2005 similar positive correlation between the diversity of args and bacteria was confirmed in the pilot scale sand filtration in our previous work wan et al 2019 in drinking water treatment the diversity of bacterial communities in bac filter is higher than other water treatment processes hou et al 2018 such diverse bacterial community has the potential to carry a variety of args secondly due to the high surface area and unique pore structure of granular activated carbon gac that induce bacterial collision and attachment gac would facilitate horizontal transfer of args compared with other filter media xu et al 2020 which not only conducive to the amplification of args but also increase the risk of influent args being transferred to the filter biofilm thirdly bar is often associated with reduced bacterial fitness usually manifested as the cost of slower growth rate or increasing generation time andersson and levin 1999 in many cases the decline in nutritional conditions will weaken such fitness cost and resulting resistant strains an advantage in intraspecific competition paulander et al 2009 lin et al 2018 at the community level the oligotrophic environment is likely conducive to the survival of arb as hypothesized in our previous study wan et al 2019 slow growing arb may have more room to survive in a low competitive environment such as biological drinking water treatment processes while get easily eliminated by rapid growing dominant bacteria in a highly competitive eutrophic environment such as biological wastewater treatment processes as the most important regulation strategy in bac filters backwashing contributes little to reduce the arg contamination in filter biofilm as shown in fig 4 args were found to maintain a high relative abundance in the backwash cycle in contrast the arg richness as shown in fig 7 remained at a stable level throughout the backwash cycle while the bacterial richness may have increased as a control which was evident in filter a summer at day 16 inside the filters the arg richness was basically the same at each depth while the bacterial richness may have increased with the depth of the bac additionally the bacterial richness in filter biofilm was different between filters and seasons while the arg richness remained a similar level in summary the arg richness of the bac filter was not affected by bacterial richness there seems to be a set of args shared by bac filter in this study and these args remained stable in filter biofilm and changed little after filter backwashing and during the filter ripening period to assess the impact of bac filtration on filter effluent we compared the bacterial community structure of filter influent and effluent with that of filter biofilm as shown in fig s7 principal component analysis pca showed obvious shifts in coordinate position between bacterial communities of the filter influent and effluent and filter effluent was much closer to filter biofilm compared with filter influent suggesting that the filtered water was substantially affected by the bac filtration with its bacterial community showing high similarities to that of filter biofilm biofiltration is criticized for having microbiological leakage problems previous studies reported that drinking water biofilters can continuously and stably release detached biofilm and bacteria proctor and hammes 2015 the bacterial taxa that colonized the filter and sloughed off in the filter effluent were able to seed and persist in the distribution system despite disinfection of finished water by chlorination pinto et al 2012 given that the bacteria released from the filter carry args and mges it is not surprising that bac filtration results in the contamination of the effluent with args these args may colonize and spread in the biofilm of the subsequent water distribution pipeline 4 conclusions recent studies have reported that bac filtration contributes to arg contamination in drinking water this full scale study investigated the occurrence of args in the biofilm of bac filters during the backwash cycle the following conclusions were drawn there were significant differences in bacterial community structure among different bac filters and among different seasons in the same bac filter there were also differences in the bacterial community structure at the filter surface 0 cm and deep layers 20 100 cm however most detected arg species were shared among filters and among seasons in the same filter and the arg richness was consistent at different depths in the filter during the filter ripening period after backwashing the args increased significantly in relative abundance by 1 5 to 3 8 folds and absolute abundance by 0 9 and 1 2 logs indicating that args accumulated in bac filters during the backwash cycle changes in relative abundance of dominant genera and hgt may be the key to such args accumulation in summer and winter respectively compared with other environments bac filters were found to harbor args with high richness and high relative abundance the significant positive correlation between args and mges highlights the potential transmission risk of args while the detection of pathogenic legionella in filter biofilm increased potential biosafety risk during drinking water bac filtration the results of this study highlight the potential bar risk of drinking water bac filtration which cannot be solved by filter backwashing given the poor removal of args by chlorination or uv disinfection and the fact that args can persist or even be enriched in water distribution pipelines the args harbored in bac filters could be a gene pool in the biofilm in the water distribution pipeline or even directly reach the point of use therefore future studies are needed to focus on and solve the problem of bar in drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17315,biological activated carbon bac filtration a process widely used in drinking water treatment was recently reported to harbor antibiotic resistance genes args this emerging contamination is poorly understood this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of args and bacterial community in full scale bac filters during the backwash cycle using high throughput qpcr and high throughput sequencing a total of 178 args were detected in all biofilm samples with relative abundance ranging from 0 1 to 1 37 copies per 16s rrna and absolute abundance ranging from 4 48 107 to 3 09 109 copies g carbon biofilms sampled from different filters shared most detected args and dominant genera including bryobacter pedomicrobium reyranella and terrimonas though their bacterial community structure differed significantly after backwashing the relative args abundance increased by 1 5 to 3 8 folds and the absolute args abundance increased by 0 90 to 1 12 logs in all biofilm samples during filter ripening indicating that args accumulated in filters during this period redundancy analysis suggested that such args accumulation was mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer in winter but highly correlated with the increasing relative abundance of genera bryobacter and acidibacter in summer it was observed that 80 6 89 3 of the detected args persisted in the filters despite of the backwashing given the high richness and relative abundance of args in bac filter and the ineffectiveness of backwashing in arg removal more stringent downstream disinfection strategies are deserved and more research is necessary to assess potential human health risks due to the persistence of args in drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction the number of medical cases associated with antibiotic resistant bacteria arb is increasing at a staggering pace antibiotic development has not kept up with this rise leading to the worldwide problem of bacterial antibiotic resistance bar bar is encoded between segments of dna called antibiotic resistance genes args which are present in both environmental bacteria and pathogens found in the healthcare system rhodes et al 2000 cabello 2006 forsberg et al 2012 price et al 2012 pruden et al 2013 convincing evidence has shown that args and arb associated with clinical infections could originated from the environment for example vancomycin resistant enterococci and its resistance genes that originated from farm animals once spread to healthy human beings and hospitalised patients and causing outbreaks in european countries bonten et al 2001 in recent years args have been defined as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 and the work of investigating the prevalence of environmental args is in full swing bar in drinking water is a problem particularly worthy of attention due to the close linkage with peoples daily lives remarkable events such as the detection of the ndm 1 gene in tap water in new delhi india 2010 walsh et al 2011 and of escherichia coli carrying the extended spectrum β lactamase gene in tap water in france 2016 madec et al 2016 have highlighted the bar risk in drinking water the situation in china is hardly optimistic where diverse highly abundant args have been detected in municipal drinking water jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 the reasons for the presence of drinking water bar are various in drinking water treatment plants dwtps biofiltration particularly bac filtration has shown to largely affect the behaviour of args both the relative abundance and the richness of args were reported increased after bac filtration xu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 subsequent disinfection processes including chlorination or ultraviolet treatment cannot completely remove args at the dosage of the dwtps after disinfection some args still retain the ability to transfer horizontally mckinney and pruden 2012 chao et al 2013 yoon et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 in drinking water distribution systems arb and args could persist in pipeline biofilm which serves as an important reservoir for the spread of bar in water distribution pipelines schlüter et al 2007 szczepanowski et al 2009 stalder et al 2012 bac filters need to be backwashed to clean and restore treatment capacity by removing both retained particles and excess biomass the filter backwashing and subsequent filter ripening constitute a backwash cycle which is optimized to a relatively fixed frequency during the filter operation to improve filtration efficiency and reduce operation cost in this case the properties of the biofilm attached to the filter media would change periodically previous studies have shown that part of the filter biofilm sloughs off during backwashing and that the biomass of filter biofilm recovers to the pre backwashing level in the next backwash cycle gibert et al 2013 liao et al 2015 backwashing could also have a strong impact on the bacterial diversity and community structure of bac biofilm but they could gradually recover with the operating time after backwashing liao et al 2015 since args are mainly carried by bacterial cells and the antibiotic resistome is largely affected by the bacterial community structure jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 chen et al 2018 we hypothesized that the fluctuations in bacterial community structure of biofilm during the filter backwash cycle would also affect the occurrence of the antibiotic resistome however previous study focused on the bar problem in drinking water biofiltration usually lack data of args throughout the backwash cycle and from different depths of filter bed the purpose of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistome of two full scale bac filters in a backwash cycle filter biofilms were sampled at different carbon bed depths and at different stages during the filter ripening period after backwashing a high throughput q pcr based approach ht qpcr was used to characterize the profile of args in filter biofilm high throughput sequencing coupled with bioinformatic analysis was used to investigate the bacterial community structure and its relationship with the antibiotic resistome additionally the args in the bac filters in this study were mapped by comparing the diversity and absolute and relative abundance of args with other environmental media in published literatures the results of this study are likely to increase the understanding of the bar problem caused by drinking water bac filtration 2 material and methods 2 1 plants configuration and samples collection the experiments were conducted at two full scale dwtps a and b hangzhou china plant a uses qiantang river as its water source while plant b uses east tiaoxi river as its water source both plants follow the same water treatment processes primary ozonation coagulation and sedimentation sand filtration ozonation bac filtration and chlorination the main design and operation parameters of the dwtps are shown in table s1 the bac filter of each plant was chosen to sample its influent effluent and activated carbon considering the possible difference in samples from different dwtps and different seasons sample collection was carried out at dwtp a in june and november 2018 and dwtp b in december 2018 here we used filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter to represent the samples collected from dwtp a in june and november and dwtp b in december respectively in order to study the spatiotemporal variation of the bacterial community structure and antibiotic resistome in bac filters during the backwash cycle activated carbon samples were collected at different depths 0 20 40 60 and 100 cm of the carbon bed and at different dates after filter backwashing day 0 2 and 16 of filter a and day 0 and 7 of filter b here day 0 means sampling immediately after backwashing for each

2011 quast et al 2012 sequence analysis was performed using uparse software v7 0 1001 edgar 2013 sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus for each otu the rdp classifier version 2 2 algorithm was used against the silva database quast et al 2012 to annotate taxonomic information all sequences have been deposited in the national center for biotechnology information sequence read archive under the accession number prjna612760 2 5 data collection and normalization in order to further clarify the problem of bar in drinking water bac filters we compared the properties of the args in this study with those of args in other environments in terms of richness relative abundance and absolute abundance we used the web of knowledge database http apps webofknowledge com to retrieve publications our search terms included antibiotic resistance genes or antimicrobial resistance genes and high throughput qpcr or ht qpcr the time frame for searching papers was from 2000 to 2020 publications were then checked individually to eliminate any duplicates or irrelevant articles taking into account the need to compare the arg properties of bac filters with other actual natural or artificial environments papers based on experimental studies on the field pilot or laboratory scale were excluded moreover we screened papers that used ht qpcr as the research method and used more than 200 pairs of primers to detect args ultimately 32 relevant papers investigating the occurrence of environmental args met our criteria the basic information reported these papers is listed in table s5 data relating to the richness relative abundance and absolute abundance of args in these papers were recorded directly or extracted by using plot digitizer software plotdigitizer sourceforge net to facilitate comparison all arg data were further normalized to the same unit where the relative abundance was converted to arg copies per 16s rrna gene and the absolute abundance was converted to arg copies per liter water or arg copies per gram solid for sediment soil fecal matter manure compost and sludge klappenbach et al 2001 stalder et al 2014 2 6 statistical analysis in this study one way analysis of variance anova and paired t tests were carried out to assess the statistical difference using graphpad prism 8 http www graphpad com pearson correlation analysis was conducted using graphpad prism 8 as well principal coordinates analysis pcoa and principal component analysis pca were conducted using r3 3 3 http www r project org all figures were generated using graphpad prism 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter performance and distribution of bacterial biomass the water quality parameters of filter influent and effluent are summarized in table s3 temperature do codmn and nh4 n were monitored throughout the sampling period to characterize changes in water quality during filter ripening in both dwtps the concentration of codmn and nh4 n decreased significantly paired t test p 0 05 after passing through the bac filter indicating that bac filters were effective in purifying the water and that all filters were operating well during the sampling period the removal rate of codmn and nh4 n increased with the running time after filter backwashing the increasing removal rate of codmn is likely due to the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria which is consistent with the hpc results in filter biofilm shown below while the increasing removal rate of nh4 n may attribute to the recovery of nitrifying bacteria which has been reported in the previous study laurent et al 2003 hpc results indicated that the effluent of all filters contained more culturable bacteria 1 64 103 3 41 103 cfu ml than the influent 4 13 102 9 07 102 cfu ml with the average hpc results increased by 4 21 3 61 and 4 14 fold in the effluent of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively fig 1 throughout the backwash cycle the number of culturable bacteria remained stable in filter influents and filter effluents inside the filter the culturable bacteria ranged from 5 45 106 to 1 03 108 2 10 106 to 1 02 108 and 2 15 106 to 4 14 107 cfu g carbon in the samples of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively an obvious decline trend in biomass with the increasing depth was found in all filters which was attributed to the continuous consumption of nutrients along the filter wang et al 1995 urfer and huck 2001 the biomass remained essentially stable in deep layers 20 100 cm throughout the backwash cycle although it increased at the filter surface 0 cm with the culturable bacteria raised from 1 38 107 to 9 43 107 4 57 107 to 1 0 108 and 1 23 107 to 4 0 107 cfu g carbon in filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively suggesting that backwashing may be able to effectively reduce heterotrophic bacteria in the filter surface but has little effect on the removal of heterotrophic bacteria from deep layers similar results have also been reported in previous studies for example servais et al 1991 reported that backwashing can effectively remove the biomass on the surface of the bac filter but the removal of the biomass in the deep layer is limited liao et al 2015 found that backwashing reduced nearly half of the biomass on the surface of bac filter but after two days of operation the biomass returned to the level before the backwash in this study the increase of hpc in filter surface would consume more organic matter which would contribute to the increasing codmn removal rate during filter ripening 3 2 bacterial community in filter biofilm filter biofilms were collected and analyzed for bacterial community structure in the backwash cycle after gene sequencing assembly and quality filtering a total of 3 001 491 high quality sequences were obtained with each sample ranging between 2 355 and 93 039 the sequences were further clustered into 50 080 otus at a 3 dissimilarity level as shown in table s4 the detected otu number ranged from 957 to 1449 593 to 1294 and 1255 to 1408 with different filter depths and sampling dates for filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively vertically samples from the filter surface 0 cm contained the least otus compared to deeper depths 20 100 cm this difference in otus may have resulted from differences in the concentration and composition of the nutrients that the biofilm received as reported in previous studies filter surfaces receive nutrients that are abundant but simple in composition after entering the filter the nutrients are consumed by microorganisms which also release metabolites creating a micro environment with low nutrient concentration but complex composition such a microenvironment provides more ecological niches and in turn leads to the increase of biodiversity in addition the filter surface was affected by a higher concentration of ozone which will inhibit ozone sensitive bacteria and narrow the niche resulting in relatively low biodiversity eiler et al 2003 wan et al 2019 during the filter ripening period the otus and the shannon index increased significantly paired t test p 0 05 in filter a summer and in deep layers 40 100 cm of filter a winter but remained stable in filter b winter and the top layers 0 20 cm of filter a winter as shown in fig s1 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all filters at the genera level bryobacter pedomicrobium reyranella and terrimonas were predominant and shared among filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter all these genera were previously reported in dwtps sly et al 1988 liao et al 2012 delafont et al 2013 liao et al 2013 the relative abundance of dominant genera relative percentage 1 were compared during the filter ripening period fig 2 a as shown in fig 2b seven genera in filter a summer were significantly changed in relative abundance the genera bradyrhizobium and leptothrix were enriched while genera hyphomicrobium pirellula hydrogenophaga zavarzinella and rhodobacter were attenuated three genera in filter a winter changed significantly in abundance with genera hydrogenophaga and amphiplicatus attenuated and genus pirellula enriched the enriched genera including bradyrhizobium and pirellula were previously reported as heterotrophic bacteria van berkum p 1987 glöckner et al 2003 the dominant growth of these bacteria will increase the consumption of codmn among the dominant genera leptothrix has been reported to inhabit different types of aquatic environments and is able to oxidize both iron ii and manganese ii pringsheim 1949 and hyphomicrobium spp have been commonly identified as major players in denitrification systems timmermans and van haute 1983 both of the genera were previously detected in drinking water bac filters magic knezev et al 2009 oh et al 2018 in addition to the dominant genera legionella a pathogenic endosymbiont that is critically important to human health khan 2006 and pseudomonas which may contain infectious species such as p aeruginosa p oryzihabitans and p plecoglossicida were also detected in filters with significantly higher abundances in summer than in winter fig s2 it should be noted that legionella was detectable in all biofilm samples and there was no significant change in the relative abundance of legionella after backwashing which was consistent with a previous study that reported that legionella thrived and persisted in two full scale drinking water bac filters gerrity et al 2018 principal co ordinates analysis pcoa based on the relative abundance of all genera presented significant structural differences among samples of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter fig 2c suggesting that the water source and seasonal factors determine the composition of the bacterial community in filter biofilm for the filter a winter and filter b winter samples there were significant differences in bacterial community composition between the filter surface 0 cm and deeper layers 20 100 cm fig 2c which was likely attributed to 1 non uniform distribution of the composition and concentration of nutrients and ozone in the vertical direction of the filter boon et al 2011 wan et al 2019 and 2 a strong retention effect on influent bacteria by filter surface which may similar to that in schmutzdecke of slow sand filtration pfannes et al 2015 one notable observation found in all filters was that the bacterial community composition remained stable with operation time in the backwash cycle fig 2c previous studies have shown that filter backwashing shocked the bacterial community temporarily but the community was quickly restored during subsequent operation gibert et al 2013 kim et al 2014 liao et al 2015 3 3 changes in the bacterial antibiotic resistome during the backwash cycle a total of 178 args covering 8 categories were detected in all biofilm samples using ht qpcr with a range of 127 to 154 124 to 165 and 101 to 168 for the filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter samples respectively previous studies have reported similar results in arg richness in bac filters for example zhang et al 2018 detected 141 args in the bac filter in another dwtp of hangzhou and xu et al 2016 found that bac filtration caused a significant increase from 76 to 150 of args in drinking water treatment of all args detected in this study one hundred and one were shared among filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter fig 3 a indicating that most detected args were shared by different bac filters and in different seasons during a backwash cycle one hundred and twenty five identical args were detected in filter a summer before and after the filter ripening while the identical args were 139 and 92 in filter a winter and filter b winter respectively fig 3b these results indicated that the args richness remained stable and that most detected args persisted in the bac filter throughout the backwash cycle as shown in fig 4 a the relative abundance of args ranged from 0 10 to 1 37 copies per 16s rrna of all biofilm samples these levels covered that described by zheng et al 2018 where the arg abundance was found to be 0 86 copies per 16s rrna 0 21 copies per cell in a bac filter after backwashing the relative abundance of args increased significantly in the filter ripening period with the average level at all depths increased by 1 5 2 9 and 3 8 fold in filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter respectively for most detected args the fold change of relative abundance before and after filter ripening was greater than 1 fig 4b suggesting that most args are enriched during the filter ripening period pcoa based on the relative abundance of all args indicated that the structure of antibiotic resistome in filter a summer and filter b winter remained stable throughout the backwash cycle and the antibiotic reisstome of filter a winter reached a stable structure after two days of operation after filter backwashing fig s3 pearson correlation analysis of all samples showed that there was a significant positive correlation between args and transposons p 0 001 and integrons p 0 05 fig s4 suggesting that horizontal gene transfer hgt may play an important role in the occurrence of args in biofilm of bac filter we further analyzed the changes in the structure of antibiotic resistome in each filter during the backwash cycle and its correlation with dominant genera and mges fig 5 after backwashing the structure of antibiotic resistome changed significantly with the operation time in each filter 90 7 95 85 and 96 87 of the variance in antibiotic resistome of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter could be explained by the selected variables the enrichment of bryobacter and acidibacter during filter ripening is significantly related to the change in antibiotic resistome structure of filter a summer while the mges especially transposases are the key to the structural changes in the antibiotic resistome of filter a winter and filter b winter biofilms are an ideal environment for hgt given their stable physical structure that is conducive to cell cell contact and the persistence of extracellular dna reviewed in søren et al 2003 and madsen et al 2012 in drinking water treatment the highest hgt frequency has been reported to occur in biofilm of bac filter compared to biofilm of sand filter and anthracite filter ehlers and bouwer 1999 xu et al 2020 based on bench scale experiments a recent study found that the transferability of conjugative plasmid decreased significantly after filter backwashing xu et al 2020 and such transferability is likely to be restored in the filter ripening period fig s5 another study reported that quorum sensing molecules such as acyl homoserine lactones could be the driving force that promotes plasmid transfer during biofilm formation zheng et al 2018 given the recovery growth of biofilm after backwashing quorum sensing molecules are likely to accumulate in biofilters which may accelerate the horizontal transfer of args and result in the increasing abundance of args as shown in fig 4a the increase in the relative abundance of args during the filter ripening period was more significant in winter samples compared to summer samples fig 5 further showed that the increase in args abundance is likely caused by hgt such results suggested that low temperatures were conducive to the hgt of args previous studies have made similar observations for example miller et al 2014 reported that the increase of arg abundance was more pronounced at a lower temperature 4 c than the ambient temperature 20 c during the storage of sludge biosolids son et al 2018 reported that the relative args abundance consistently increased in rivers and reservoirs during the coldest season in south korea as an environmental stress low temperatures induce the rpos mediated response of the bacterial cell white 2000 it was hypothesized and confirmed in some cases that rpos response could enhance the ability of bacterial cells to take up dna which has the potential to increase the horizontal transfer of args capy et al 2000 lives et al 2001 claverys et al 2006 in addition to hgt change in bacterial community structure also affects the occurrence of args and in many cases is the key di driver determining environmental antibiotic resistome forsberg et al 2014 su et al 2015 for example jia et al 2015 found bacterial community shift drives antibiotic resistance promotion during drinking water chlorination chen et al 2016 found that long term field application of sewage sludge to the soil changed the bacterial community composition which shaped the structure of antibiotic resistome and increased the abundance and diversity of args in this study the relative abundance between the dominant genera changed more in the summer samples than in winter samples during filter ripening fig 2b although the whole bacterial community compostion remained stable fig 2c four of the dominant genera with significant changes in relative abundance in filter a summer are significantly related to structural changes in the antibiotic reistome it seems that the fluctuation in relative abundance of dominant genera rather than the change in entire bacterial community contributed more to the variation of antibiotic resistome during filter ripening in summer we found genera bryobacter and acidibacter are significantly relate to the structural changes in the antibiotic resistome of filter a summer it is likely that the enrichment of genera acidibacter and bryobacter lead to the increase in relative args abundance of filter a summer a previous study using metagenomic approach found a broad spectrum of args with high abundance in the sediments of river ganges and most of the args were significantly correlated with acidibacter reddy and dubey 2019 significant positive correlation between acidibacter and suli and sulii were also found in another study that focused on the constructed wetland treating pharmaceutical wastewater li et al 2020 however few studies have reported the linkage between bryobacter and args as shown in fig s6 the biofilms of filter a summer filter a winter and filter b winter contained args with absolute abundances ranging from 9 33 107 to 7 49 108 2 56 108 to 2 87 109 and 5 61 107 to 7 46 108 copies g carbon respectively after backwashing the absolute abundance of args increased significantly in the filter ripening period as discussed in our previous study the horizontal transfer of args may be partly responsible for the accumulation of args in the biofilm in addition the retention of influent args by the filter and the maintenance of extracellular args by the biofilm would also increase the absolute abundance of args wan et al 2020 a gradient attenuation trend was observed in absolute arg abundance in the vertical direction in the filters this observation was consistent with our previous work on sand filters wan et al 2019 as reported by wan et al 2020 the absolute abundance of args was positively correlated with that of 16s rrna genes in filter biofilm the consumption of nutrients in the filter leads to the decline of biomass with depth and also results in the reduction of absolute arg abundance 3 4 potential bar risks caused by bac filtration to highlight the bar risks we compared the data from this study with published arg data in other environments as shown in fig 6 the arg richness in bac filters ranged from 101 to 174 in this study which was significantly higher than that of soils waters sediments manures manure composts and most wastewater sludge samples the relative abundance of args in bac filters ranged from 0 1 to 1 37 copies per 16s rrna which was comparable to that of most soils waters sediments manures manure composts and wastewater sludge samples the absolute abundance of args in bac filters ranged from 4 48 107 to 3 09 109 copies g carbon which was numerically lower than most water samples but similar to sediments and some soil samples however given that the units in different environmental samples cannot be unified the significance of this comparison on absolute arg abundance is limited it should be noted that source water reservoir water some river water and groundwater is a relatively clean environment in which the args are lower in richness and relative abundance than those in most wastewater as shown in fig 6a and 6b and the selective pressures such as antibiotics and heavy metals are usually present at extremely low ppb levels zhang et al 2018a 2018b and frequently are not even detectable simazaki et al 2015 however the args detected in drinking water bac filters in this study were more diverse and abundant than in most polluted environments we suspect such inconsistency was likely caused by three reasons first it was reported that genetic diversity in bacterial community is positively correlated with the bacterial diversity vellend and geber 2005 similar positive correlation between the diversity of args and bacteria was confirmed in the pilot scale sand filtration in our previous work wan et al 2019 in drinking water treatment the diversity of bacterial communities in bac filter is higher than other water treatment processes hou et al 2018 such diverse bacterial community has the potential to carry a variety of args secondly due to the high surface area and unique pore structure of granular activated carbon gac that induce bacterial collision and attachment gac would facilitate horizontal transfer of args compared with other filter media xu et al 2020 which not only conducive to the amplification of args but also increase the risk of influent args being transferred to the filter biofilm thirdly bar is often associated with reduced bacterial fitness usually manifested as the cost of slower growth rate or increasing generation time andersson and levin 1999 in many cases the decline in nutritional conditions will weaken such fitness cost and resulting resistant strains an advantage in intraspecific competition paulander et al 2009 lin et al 2018 at the community level the oligotrophic environment is likely conducive to the survival of arb as hypothesized in our previous study wan et al 2019 slow growing arb may have more room to survive in a low competitive environment such as biological drinking water treatment processes while get easily eliminated by rapid growing dominant bacteria in a highly competitive eutrophic environment such as biological wastewater treatment processes as the most important regulation strategy in bac filters backwashing contributes little to reduce the arg contamination in filter biofilm as shown in fig 4 args were found to maintain a high relative abundance in the backwash cycle in contrast the arg richness as shown in fig 7 remained at a stable level throughout the backwash cycle while the bacterial richness may have increased as a control which was evident in filter a summer at day 16 inside the filters the arg richness was basically the same at each depth while the bacterial richness may have increased with the depth of the bac additionally the bacterial richness in filter biofilm was different between filters and seasons while the arg richness remained a similar level in summary the arg richness of the bac filter was not affected by bacterial richness there seems to be a set of args shared by bac filter in this study and these args remained stable in filter biofilm and changed little after filter backwashing and during the filter ripening period to assess the impact of bac filtration on filter effluent we compared the bacterial community structure of filter influent and effluent with that of filter biofilm as shown in fig s7 principal component analysis pca showed obvious shifts in coordinate position between bacterial communities of the filter influent and effluent and filter effluent was much closer to filter biofilm compared with filter influent suggesting that the filtered water was substantially affected by the bac filtration with its bacterial community showing high similarities to that of filter biofilm biofiltration is criticized for having microbiological leakage problems previous studies reported that drinking water biofilters can continuously and stably release detached biofilm and bacteria proctor and hammes 2015 the bacterial taxa that colonized the filter and sloughed off in the filter effluent were able to seed and persist in the distribution system despite disinfection of finished water by chlorination pinto et al 2012 given that the bacteria released from the filter carry args and mges it is not surprising that bac filtration results in the contamination of the effluent with args these args may colonize and spread in the biofilm of the subsequent water distribution pipeline 4 conclusions recent studies have reported that bac filtration contributes to arg contamination in drinking water this full scale study investigated the occurrence of args in the biofilm of bac filters during the backwash cycle the following conclusions were drawn there were significant differences in bacterial community structure among different bac filters and among different seasons in the same bac filter there were also differences in the bacterial community structure at the filter surface 0 cm and deep layers 20 100 cm however most detected arg species were shared among filters and among seasons in the same filter and the arg richness was consistent at different depths in the filter during the filter ripening period after backwashing the args increased significantly in relative abundance by 1 5 to 3 8 folds and absolute abundance by 0 9 and 1 2 logs indicating that args accumulated in bac filters during the backwash cycle changes in relative abundance of dominant genera and hgt may be the key to such args accumulation in summer and winter respectively compared with other environments bac filters were found to harbor args with high richness and high relative abundance the significant positive correlation between args and mges highlights the potential transmission risk of args while the detection of pathogenic legionella in filter biofilm increased potential biosafety risk during drinking water bac filtration the results of this study highlight the potential bar risk of drinking water bac filtration which cannot be solved by filter backwashing given the poor removal of args by chlorination or uv disinfection and the fact that args can persist or even be enriched in water distribution pipelines the args harbored in bac filters could be a gene pool in the biofilm in the water distribution pipeline or even directly reach the point of use therefore future studies are needed to focus on and solve the problem of bar in drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17316,drinking water treatment processes are capable of removing microcystins but consistent operation of processes optimized for cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom chab conditions is not fiscally feasible therefore utilities must ready themselves and start the chab processes as a reactionary response predictive analytics and modelling are impactful tools to prepare water systems for chabs but are still in early stages of development until those prospective models are completed a method to determine best actions in advance of a bloom event thus improving system resiliency is needed in this study an adaptation of the quantitative microbial risk analysis qmra methodology was applied to develop this method this method and resulting models were developed around the toledo ohio usa water crisis of 2014 but being mechanistic they are easily adaptable to other systems process operations data results from this internally validated model demonstrate how rapid action using both powdered activated carbon and measured increases in chlorine dose can mitigate health risks our research also demonstrates the importance of modelling the cellular status of the toxins toxins either in an intact cell or in the water from a lysed cell risks were characterized using hazard quotients hq and at the peak of the crisis ranged from a minimum of 0 00244 to a maximum of 2 84 for adults in simulations where chab specific treatment was used this decreased to 0 00057 and 0 236 respectively we further outline how this methodology can be used to simulate water system resiliency to likely and aberrant microbial hazard events to plan for the best interventions to protect public health this method can be used for other hazards expected to be variable in the future where system prepatory planning is critical to continued public health protection considering the water quantity and quality fluctuations occurring and likely to intensify under climate change this type of computationally supported preparedness is vital to maintaining robust water system resiliency keywords qmra microcystins water treatment resiliency human health bayesian simulation 1 introduction 1 1 problem statement cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms chab are a continuing issue for drinking water supplies globally carmichael and boyer 2016 while there are efforts to predict chabs forecasting capabilities remain highly uncertain and difficult to use for preparatory and long term planning it is understood that drinking water systems are capable of removing cyanotoxins but they can become overwhelmed if all of the toxins are released from lysed cells too early in the process hitzfeld et al 2000 further preparatory planning is a vital component to system resiliency which water utilities impacted by prior chab events know quite well consequently this research has developed a generalized method to simulate the treatment efficacy and resulting health risk reduction which can be applied to simulate and test water treatment system resiliency to chab events as will be discussed in further detail the status of the chab either growing or decaying treatment processes and human exposure factors ingestion rate etc need to be considered for a complete picture of microcystin risk reduction therefore a method to incorporate these critical components was developed as an adaptation of the quantitative microbial risk analysis paradigm due to its success and established use in practice for risk analysis and decision support for water infrastructure to demonstrate the implementation of this method we have developed a risk model under two scenarios pre and post toledo water crisis this crisis was chosen because it has complete data to include monitoring of the chab and pre and post treatment microcystins concentration 1 2 chabs and human health impacts cyanobacteria are ubiquitous prokaryotes found in surface waters across the globe these photosynthetic gram negative microorganisms present significant public health and engineering challenges due to their potential for expansive growth and synthesis of cyanotoxins which are a human health hazard surface water eutrophication processes coupled with climate change can create ideal growth conditions for chabs events epa 2015 there are different classes of cyanotoxins with varying toxicities and target organs most notably the hepatotoxins microcystins nodularins and cylindrospermopsins and the neurotoxins saxitoxins and anatoxin a nienaber and steinitz kannan 2018 some genera and or species produce only one type of toxin while others are known to produce multiple types although any cyanotoxin could potentially be synthesized within a chab the most widely distributed and reported cyanotoxin is microcystin rastogi et al 2014 microcystins are a class of cyclic peptides that are comprised of seven different amino acids because of the immense variation in chemical structure there are over 100 microcystin congeners currently known carmichael and boyer 2016 of the known congeners microcystin lr mclr typified by leucine at x position and arginine at z position red circles in fig 1 is the most abundant studied and toxic form lone et al 2015 microcystins are primarily hepatotoxins with acute low dose exposure being most common but chronic exposure is possible via drinking water nienaber and steinitz kannan 2018 symptoms of acute intoxication include diarrhea vomiting piloerection fatigue and parlor microcystins inhibit serine threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2a liver enzymes these enzymes remove phosphates from proteins which is an important step in many biochemical pathways inhibition leads to hyperphosphorylation of proteins associated with the cytoskeleton of hepatocytes creating hemorrhaging and progressive liver necrosis humbert 2009 longer term and chronic exposures have been linked to disease outcomes in humans however these studies are limited mainly because it is very difficult to quantify individual exposure or duration in one study it was found that significant clusters of deaths related to non alcoholic liver disease were identified in us counties where chabs were present in local surface waters a bayesian regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between chab coverage and the risk of nonalcoholic liver disease deaths svir cev et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 1 3 water treatment and chabs 1 3 1 cellular status of microcystins impact water treatment efficacy and modeling the efficacy of cyanotoxin removal in water treatment is dependent on whether the toxin is intracellular still within the cell or extracellular outside of a lysed cell it is more efficient and cost effective to remove intracellular toxins since the processes to remove them are the same to remove other microbiological hazards this is a reason why algaecide is not recommended as a response action for chabs by using algaecides extracellular toxin concentrations dramatically increase which increases the need for chemical oxidant removal with subsequent increased likelihood of hazardous disinfection byproduct generation hitzfeld et al 2000 additionally laboratory experiments using mirocystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa demonstrated significant differences in toxin status based on the growth phase for a chab in the growth phase intracellular toxins comprise 75 to 90 of total microcystins contrary to this for a m aeruginosa chab in decay phase intracellular toxins comprise 30 to 40 of the total microcystins chorus and bartram 1999 furthermore pietsch et al 2002 demonstrated that intracellular toxin generation reached a peak of 25µg l at 13 days after the initial growth phase 0 to 9 days followed by a stationary phase in days 9 to 16 pietsch et al 2002 as the m aeruginosa moved into the decay phase around day 20 extracellular toxin concentrations peaked at 35µg l pietsch et al 2002 these data reinforce the importance of assessing the chab health status growth or decay in the decision making process for water treatment utilities consequently for any risk model developed to simulate or estimate water treatment efficacy during a chab the health status of the bloom is a vital component 1 3 2 removal of microcystins via drinking water treatment the toledo water crisis of 2014 demonstrated that for a large scale bloom traditional water treatment systems are not optimized or prepared to remove bloom level microcystins the ohio epa ohepa identified that the following processes are most efficacious for extracellular toxins toxins outside of the cell due to the greater difficulty of their removal from source water epa 2016b clarification and filtration these treatment processes are most efficient at removing intracellular microcystins however caution is needed especially when chab cell counts are very high in the raw water to prevent algae build up on the filters plant 2018b powdered activated carbon pac pac has demonstrated high efficacy in removing extracellular microcystins due to pac s greater effective surface area providing better adsorption kinetics ho et al 2011 adequate removal via adsorption is dependent on detention times and natural organic matter nom concentrations pietsch et al 2002 chemical oxidants primary examples of which are potassium permaganate kmno4 which is commonly used by water treatment plants wtps as a pre oxidant to control for taste and odor water color biofilms or zebra mussels at the intake it is ph independent and exhibits a greater kinetic rate in warmer temperatures rodríguez et al 2007 its use in the degradation of microcystins will be discussed and incorporated into the exmpale models later but does require careful assessment of its use to limit the amount of extracellular microcystins produced chlorine is another powerful oxidant capable of degrading microcystins at relatively low doses the effectiveness of chlorine is directly related to its ct disinfection improves as ph levels decrease 8 0 and water temperatures increase epa 2016a ozone is one of the most powerful oxidants available to a wtp and is also ct dependent but also dependent on water quality constituents specifically total organic carbon toc that can increase the water s ozone demand ozonation is capable of complete cell lysis and thus destruction of both intra and extracellular cyanotoxins 2 modeling methods 2 1 qmra framework all modelling inferences and plotting were conducted in the statistical programming language r the qmra framework is an adaptive computational methodology that uses mixed modeling methods to estimate the health effects from exposures to environmental hazards the qmra methodology can either generate point estimates or in modern qmra models the monte carlo or another stochastic method provides a means of incorporating the uncertainty of model variables bichai and smeets 2013 haas et al 2014 in this study due to the uncertainties of the input variables of the model the monte carlo method is used this method requires the optimization or choice of probability distributions for each variable in the model that is considered uncertain ross 2007 the probability distributions are parameterized using data from the open literature or expert elicitation haas et al 2014 for cyanotoxins the dose response will not be a mechanistic dose response model like in typical qmra models but rather it will be the calculated oral reference dose rfdo subsequently a hazard quotient hq will be used to characterize the risks for rapid risk estimates that can be compared over diverse populations since cyanotoxins are only a suspected carcinogen it is not appropriate to perform a cancer risk estimate therefore the hq will assess the risk based on liver function degeneration which is the basis of the lowest observed adverse effect level loael which is the basis of the rfdo epa 2015 mechanistic modeling is an approach to describe the inner workings of a complex system by accounting for and modeling the individual parts of the system without relying on empirical relationships to be used for the models these types of models mechanistic provide for a more generalizable model that can be udpated and adapted as desired for other systems constraints and input data therefore the models that are developed to work within this method are developed as mechanistic where possible given knowledge of and pertinent data for the processes in the system in this research two risk models are developed one for the toledo water crisis of 2014 twc and one for the collins park plant cpp operations post water crisis pwtc both models incorporate an inovative means of modeling cellular status of the toxin relative to a healthy or decaying bloom this portion of the model does not predict a growing or decaying bloom rather it provides the needed inclusion of the likley cellular status of the toxin prior to entering the plant this research has developed three models to incorporate this new method of modeling the cellular status of the bloom using minimal information combined these models provide a means of relative risk comparison to determine the risk reduction potential during water treatment subsequently because the method is developed around simulation methods inerventions can be experimented with computationally and decision makers can refer to associated sentitivty analyses to assess the resiliency of their plants to chab events 2 2 exposure scenario and water treatment modeling in the case of chabs in surface waters used as a drinking water source the primary exposure is direct ingestion consequently as is shown in fig 2 the model is developed to estimate the health risks from the associated cyanotoxins after their reduction via drinking water treatment when regarding cellular status of the toxin there are more intracellular toxins from a bloom in growth as opposed to more extracellular toxins from decaying bloom fig 2 this is critical for an accurate simulation of the finished water microcystins concentration due to differences in treatment process efficacy based on cellular status of the toxin concurrent with modeling the direct ingestion secondary exposures from food preparation and brushing teeth are incorporated into overall drinking water ingestion because children are typically more susceptible to environmental hazards modeling health effects to both adults 21 years and children 6 years is performed as introduced already two broad scenarios are modeled twc and ptwc but for relative risk comparison purposes both begin with an initial condition at the height of the twc where the maximum microcystins concentration was 14µg l table 1 plant 2018a subsequently this also allows for comparison of how effective the treatment plant improvements would be to a similar bloom from the 2014 crisis 2 3 bloom status and water treatment modeling 2 3 1 hab status and extracellular veruss intracellular toxin modeling three options to simulate the health status of the bloom were developed the first method uses available data for the ratio of extracellular to intracellular microcystins e i ratio the e i ratio method assumes that the e i ratio accurately depicts a decaying or growing chab the e i ratio was drawn from 5 studies where the e i concentrations were reported boutte et al 2008 chorus 2001 park et al 2018 sakai et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 these data were digitized and a total of 116 data points were used to optimize probability distributions therefore the central limit theorem was used to assume a normal distribution the normal distribution was optimized to the data using the fitdistr function in r as shown in table 1 using a μ of 0 159 and σ of 0 262 the normal distribution was truncated to a lower limit of 0 and upper limit of 1 75 which was the highest e i ratio from the combined sources data since the normal distribution is a symetric continuous probability density function pdf truncation is necessary to ensure that unreasonable values of the e i ratio e g negative values are not sampled during each monte carlo iteration this random variate is used as the relative proportion of extracellular toxins e i ratio r in eq 1 where c m 0 is the initial toxin concentration 14µg l that is used to calculate the concentration of microcystins that are either extracellular or intracellular c m x because the c m x is calculated relative to the extracellular toxin percentage r d calculating the intracellular toxin concentration c m i uses the compliment of r d 1 c m x c m e c m 0 r d c m i c m 0 1 r d for the second and third methods eq 2 is used to model c m x these methods expand on the e i ratio method by incorporating information regarding if the bloom is healthy or decaying a highly generalizable method requiring the least amount of data on the bloom uses a boolean switch depicted in the pseudo code below this method provides equal probability of chab growth or decay phases which is a closer simulation of dynamics before the chab can be sampled than compared to the e i ratio alone a bloom simulated in the growth phase when a 1 in eq 2 uses a generalized growing bloom extracellular toxin percentage r h in eq 2 values shown in table 1 then when a 0 the decaying bloom extracellular percentage r d in eq 2 is used to model the extracellular toxin concentration c m e again because the r h and r d are both in terms of extracellular toxins their compliment is used to model the intracellular microcystins concentration c m i the third method combines the e i ratio with the boolean switch referred to e i boolean in this method just the mean of the truncated normal distribution of the e i ratio is used as a general probability of a decaying bloom essentially the e i boolean no longers models the likelihood of a healthy or decaying bloom as a 50 probability and makes an approximately 16 likelihood that the bloom is decaying this would require a moderate amount of data for the utility to generate on the status of the bloom and can be updated regularly this also removes the 50 probability in the method that uses the boolean switch alone making it more descriptive of realistic blooms if data characterizing the bloom s health status is available this e i boolean method uses the uniform distribution to generate a random variate between 0 and 1 to not impart shape limitations to this random variate pseudo code below using this random variate from the uniform distribution at each monte carlo iteration if a 0 16 then then r h is used to model the growing bloom and r d is used otherwise both the boolean switch and the e i boolean informs which part of the conditional function in eq 2 to use for the concentration of microcystins that are either extracellular or intracellular c m x where r d and r h are the relative proportion of extracellular toxins from a decaying or healthy chab respectively for example using the boolean switch when a 1 the bloom is decaying thus c m e c m 0 r d and c m i c m 0 1 r d to simulate a decaying bloom concentration of extracellular c m e and intracellular c m i microcystins likewise in the e i boolean method with a 0 16 c m e c m 0 r d etc both r h and r d are uncertain variables which are modeled using uniform distributions with parameters shown in table 1 2 c m x b o o l e a n e i b o o l e a n c m e c m i r d c m i c m i 1 r d if a 0 if a 0 16 c m e c m i r h c m i c m i 1 r h otherwise to determine which of the cellular status methods is best to use a non parametric means in assessing the simulation s stability based on the homogeneity of risk estimate was developed this method uses the wilcoxon ranked sum test for a non parametic means of assessing the degree of similarity within the computational data from the simulations of each method essentially if the homogeneity of risk estimates is maintained throughout multiple iteration levels greater credence is given to the method simulation as compared to the other cellular status modeling methods by completing this analysis based on number of iterations it can also be used to determine if there is a trend or change in conclusions on homogeneity of risk estimates based on iterations simulated when modeling intracellular toxin treatment c m i from equation 2 needs to be converted to an equivalent number of cells eq 3 is developed to estimate the cell abundance n c dependent on c m i the microcystin quota typically encountered per cell m c q and the molecular weight of microcystins mw m c q is an uncertain variable modeled as a uniform distribution with parameters in table 1 3 n c c m i m c q m w 2 3 2 water treatment efficacy modeling when the water reaches chlorine treatment the chlorine lyses remaining cells and oxidizes the microcystins plant 2018b zamyadi et al 2013 therefore by removing intracellular toxins prior to chlorine the chlorine dose can be lower to achieve both of these aims subsequently to model removal of microcystins the treatment model outputs are divided into concentration of intracellular microcystins delivered for chlorine to lyse c m i c l c e l l and concentration of extracellular microcystins delivered for chlorine removal c m e c l clarification and filtration for clarification treatment efficicency a point value was used η c l a due to the limited data available eq 4 table 1 filtration s removal efficiency η f i l t eq 4 of intracellular toxins at cpp during the twc is modeled as a uniform distribution with a minimum of 85 6 and maximum of 96 table 1 ptwc simulations have greater granularity for both clarification and filtration based on improved sampling after the twc uniform distributions are used for both clarification and filtration for the ptwc simulation parameters eq 4 table 1 pac cpp reports that during the twc a typical pac dose of 15 mg l at the entry into the wtp exhibited an extracellular toxin removal efficiency in the range of 19 to 99 with a median of 61 a triangular distribution is applied to model the large fluctuations in pac treatment efficacy η p a c table 1 and incorporated into eq 5 cpp reports maximum pac efficiencies of 82 99 for ptwc seasons using a feeding system capable of 40mg l this range was modeled as a uniform distribution table 1 kmno4 due to lake erie being the cpp source water they use kmno4 to abide by ohepa regulations for zebra muscle control ohepa recommends 0 5 to 2 5 mg l of kmno4 to control for adult zebra mussels epa 2016a no kmno4 dose was obtained from cpp so a removal efficiency of 40 60 corresponding to findings using a dose of 0 6 mg l of kmno4 was chosen rodríguez et al 2007 the reduction efficiencies associated with this dose are modeled using uniform distributions as parameterized in table 1 and included in eq 5 η k m n o 4 cpp wtp does not report a change in kmno4 feeds ptwc therfore this uncertain variable is not changed for the ptwc simulations 4 c m i c l c e l l n c 1 η c l a η f i l t 5 c m e c l c m e 1 η k m n o 4 η p a c 6 c m i c l c m i c l c e l l m c q m w chlorine during chlorination it is assumed in the designs that all intracellular toxins are converted to extracellular due to the lysis efficiency of cl on algal cells consequently c m i c l c e l l is converted back into a concentration of microcystins by solving eq 3 for microcystins concentration c m i c l eq 6 subsequently the concentration of toxins that are delivered to the chlorination process is the sum of the intracellular and extracellular toxins that reach the end of treatment c m t t eq 7 7 c m t t c m i c l c m e c l chlorination removal efficiencies under those twc and ptwc conditions were

exposure to adults 21 years and children 6 years separately consumer only daily water ingestion rates that consider both drinking and food preparation vw f eq 10 are used from the united states environmental protection agency usepa exposure factors handbook epa 2011 table 1 relevant water ingestion data for tooth brushing events is limited one qmra study considered tooth brushing exposure by assuming a uniform ingestion rate of 1 5 ml of water schijven et al 2016 however when consulting the dental literature a wider range of volumes is possible especially when considering that most rinse water is spit out and only the remaining salivary film from the rinse water remains to be ingested therefore it was chosen to model the volume of salivary film that the toothbrushing rinse water would create eq 9 shows that using the internal surface area of the mouth a s and salivary film thickness x s f for children and adults separately and the toothbrushing frequency in a day λ t b the volume of water v t b in l entrapped in the salivary film which can be injested is then modeled the distributions for a s for adults and children both are the truncated normal table 1 and the x s f are uniform distributions for both adults and children table 1 frequency of brushing teeth is assumed to be between 0 2 times a day based on results of previous studies liu et al 2007 9 v t b a s 1 m 2

based on the loael that is adjusted based on an uncertainty factor uf therefore the rfdo is a variable which relates the concentration of a toxin to the health outcome that is monitored for in experiments calculating the loael because of the aggressive toxicological response resulting in liver degeneration disease in mammals heinze 1999 the usepa set the rfdo for microcystins quite low at just 0 05 mg kg day epa 2015 body weights are needed to model the hq which are drawn from the usepa exposure factors handbook with a mean adult body weight of 80 kg and a mean child body weight of 18 6 kg epa 2011 the seed in r was set at 24 using set seed 24 this will be needed for reproducible results from this model and the simulation is run for 10 000 iterations to invoke the law of large numbers for a converged simulation ross 2007 10 h q c m d i s t v w f v t b r f d o b w 1 d a y 3 results at each iteration the model algorithm operates a decision node to randomly assign the cellular status of the microcystin from the chab fig 3 with an estimate of the percentage of toxins that are intracellular and extracellular treatment of them is modeled and a concentration of finished water microcystins is estimated then from this concentration estimate the average daily dose numerator of eq 10 is estimated to determine the hq results are then saved in a central dataframe and the model iterates 3 1 2014 toledo water crisis compared to post 2014 fig 4 shows the results from the risk simulations for adults and children for both twc and ptwc conditions in these figures a hq of 1 is highlihted with a solid red line a hq of 1 is indicative of a excessivly high risk and significant likelihood that health effects will be experienced therefore the model is demonstrating that the 2014 twc was a significant public health event and significant progress has been made ptwc the peak microcystins concentration in the finished water during the twc is shown in fig 5 a as can be seen in fig 5a the peak twc microcystins concentration blue line is much higher than the ohepa red line furthermore fig 5a demosntrates the simulation estimates close alignment within the known peak concentration during the twc with the estimated 95th percentile concentration being closely aligned with the known twc peak and the model s estimated peak overlapping the known twc peak further examination of the results in fig 5 demonstrates that during the 2014 crisis there was an 85 probability that the concentration would be above the threshold set by ohepa of 0 3µg l contrastingly there is only a 6 probability of exceeding the action level if the same size bloom and peak concentration of microcystins impacted cpp wtp again with the upgraded chab optimized system fig 5b 3 2 examination of importance of cellular status of toxin in risk modeling when the microcystins were set to only extracellular red boxes or intracellular green boxes there is a 1 5 log difference in risk estimates highlighting the importance of toxin cellular status moreover there is consistently higher risk to children relative to adults as can also be seen in fig 6 the violin plots incorporate the outliers into the tails of the density of the estimates the violin plots show a consistent alignment of the median and the means further the medians are well alligned with the area of highest density demonstrating a converged simulation overall we can also see that all extracellular toxins simulations increases the low range tails and focuses the largest density to the high risk range finally fig 6 shows that for twc simulations where toxins were both intracellular and extracellular the densities are very difuse and bimodal with the alignment of the mean and median between these peaks still demonstrating a converged simulation bimodality is indicative of two groups which is sensible since there are two cellular status groups operating within a split function in eq 2 this bimodality is reduced during the ptwc simulations demonstrating a likely lessened impact of the cellular status on the optimized treatment system designed as a response to the chab crisis descriptive statistics of the risk results are reported in table 2 the results are all right skewed meaning that the results are biased to higher risk ranges with the greatest bias occuring when extracellular is allowed to dominate the cellular status of the toxin the three methods developed to model the cellular status of the microcystins are compared to eachother in table 3 for twc simulations and table 4 for ptwc simulations as can be seen in tables 3 and 4 the standard boolean switch method provides for a better agreement in compuational data for twc conditions and the combined method e i boolean method provides much greater agreement in computaional data for the ptwc simulations tables 3 and 4 these results can also be a reason behind the bimodal outcomes from the twc combined intracellular and extracellular simulations since a less informed decision node boolean switch was the better functioning method for that event 3 3 sensitivity analysis a parital rank correlation coefficient sensitivity analysis was undertaken for each of the simulations operated the ability to conduct this type of sensitivity analysis assumes that the trend between uncertain variable and model estimate are monotonic over the entire range of model outputs fig 7 demonstrates for ptwc intraceullular and extracellular conditions overall monotonic trends demonstrated with the loess smoothed lines a consistency for all other models when the micorcystins were modeled as combined intracellular and extracellular the percent of microcystins that are extracellular rd was the most impactful variable on the model fig 8 a when the toxins are simulated as either completely extracellular or intracellular this variable will not impact the model estimates since it is not used in those simulations this was followed by the η p a c for the adult ptwc simulations fig 8 b and drinking water ingestion volume fig 8 a d this demonstrates that the intensified emphasis of pac injection and use at cpp for future chab treatment has a direct effect on the simulated risks also as can be seen in figs 8 c and d the higher risks to children are driven by the ingestion rates for those simulations where the microcystins were entirely intracellular fig 9 η p a c no longer has a significant impact on the model because pac is an extracellular toxin process for both adults and children during the twc the drinking water ingestion volume was the most impactful variable when simulating the toxins as intracellular only because the ptwc cpp system has upgraded filters and clarification for cellular removal fig 9 b and d from the ptwc simulations the filter is the second most impactful variable behind clarification for adults fig 9 b and c again we see for children the drinking water exposure variables drive the simulated risks this is particularly clear when we see how much more impactful the v t b variable is for children as compared to adults again the η p a c returned to being the most impactful variable when simulating the microcystins as only extracellular for adults fig 10 a and b while children risks continued to be dominated by the exposure variables fig 10 c and d as with all plots in fig 8 the improved pac implementation at cpp is showing to have a significant impact on decreasing the estimated risks in all cases where pac and cl are compared to each other in the sensitvity plots η c l which is the final removal step of microcystins consistently has a lower impact on the model results this further reinforces the important role pac plays in microcystins control 4 discussion the twc was a major public health event that occured on 15 august 2014 the peak finished water microcystins concentration was measured at 3 19µg l our model estimated an equivalent 3 20µg l at the 95th percentile when simulating the twc this result demonstrates the validity of adapting qmra modeling methods for microbiologically derived toxins that are a human health hazard it also provides validity to the methods developed and tested to simulate the cellular status of the toxin further the modeling methods used are straight forward and can be readily applied without significant advanced mathematics training allowing for wider applicability for human health protection and system optimization the actual totality of the deleterious health effects attributable to the 2014 twc will continue to be difficult to ascertain however a follow up assessment by mccarty 2016 sheds some light on the matter cpp municipal water consumers were surveyed in september of 2014 to assess their water use habits adherence to issued public health advisories and incidence of illness a total of 171 households were interviewed and local census data was used to extrapolate findings to the entire population mccarty et al conclude that a maximum of 40 5 of the estimated 103 058 households were potentially exposed to harmful levels of mcs this health assessment also surveyed onset of illness but these illnesses were not tested for their association to specific microcystins exposures nevertheless the results show that 16 2 of households 17 431 reported at least one physical illness with diarrhea being the most common illness 12 1 mccarty 2016 these findings demonstrate the ineffectiveness that can plague public health advisories and support the risk of deleterious health outcomes estimated by the models in this study it is important to note however that reported illness from the survey are mostly related to gi distress disease and not related to liver degeneration the rfdo we used is specific to liver degeneration is the only established rfd to date while diarrhea and other gi distress can be related symptoms they are different health outcomes can be conflated with other underlying infections or diseases therefore to model risk of overall illness the data suggest a need for a new rfdo that would most likely be more protective causing our estimated hqs to increase it is also important to recognize that small changes in the values used to calculate both the ingested dose and hq have major consequences to risk estimates for example if the tolerable daily intake tdi of 0 04 µg kg day equivalent to the rfdo mandated by the world health organization who was used our estimated hqs would be much higher falconer and humpage 2005 schmidt et al 2002 reported an empirical model to estimate microcystins cellular breakthrough during treatment they defined breakthrough as intracellular toxins becoming extracellular during different water treatment processes schmidt et al 2002 several of their findings are consistent with ours including flocculation filtration are an efficient means of removing intracellular toxins however cellular breakthrough is possible given the conditions of the filter pac provides an effective means of extracellular toxins removal however with difusivity in the efficacy range and kmno4 used as a pre oxidant can result in significant cell lysis schmidt et al 2002 also demonstrated that relatively excessive breakthrough is possible during preoxidation using kmno4 or ozone large variability in breakthrough was observed and is most likely explained by variability in cell stability during different growth phases schmidt et al 2002 our model did not account for cellular breakthrough during the treatment steps due to the variability of these estimates based on inlet water quality and a lack of such data from cpp the empirical model in schmidt et al 2002 couldn t be used for cpp or this research due to the differences in source water process controls and empirical model constraints in our model once the toxin s cellular status was determined by the boolean switch or e i boolean method they remained separated until chlorination at which time all toxins were considered from lysed cells or already externlized by the time they reached chlorination our model was still capable of making accurate estimates of the microcystins concentration in the finished water during the twc therefore the methods we have developed are accomplishing the same outcomes as modeling cellular breakthrough but with less uncertainty and variability in the microcystins concentration estimates in the finished water further for future models developed using this method recommend generating process specific microcystins concentration reduction to estimate the toxin reduction at each process more precisely an inclusion for which no data currently exists xiao et al 2018 published a stochastic risk model for microcystins in the yongjiang river in china xiao et al 2018 in their risk model drinking water was the exposure route and a hazard index hi was used to assess health risks results of their study indicated no health risk present as none of their hi exceeded 0 34 it is important to note however that initial microcystins concentrations in the xiao et al 2018 study were very low nearly at or below the oepa 0 3 µg l threshold so the lack of risk is logical further there is no specificity to the water treatment system s reduction of microcystins in the finished drinking water this limits the decision support capacity of their model and makes resiliency simulations of the water treatment system impossible our model corroborates the significant difference between intracellular and extracellular removal effectiveness and assocaited hqs demonstrating that early detection and preparedness for chab events are vital as the literature suggests most microcystins in a healthy growing chab are intracellular therefore health risks from these chab events are minimal there are major concerns however if the majority of microcystins are extracellular results from the models demonstrate the difficulty of efficiently removing extracellular microcystins from the water for ptwc water treatment processes demonstrated the ability to effectively eliminate risks however children and vulnerable populations will consistently demonstrate higher risks even to lower concentrations of microcystins fig 6 the comparison of the three methods to simulate cellular status of the bloom shows that for this limited trial when simulating chab conditions or crisis conditions in a wtp that is not optimzed to chab events the boolean switch should be used and for systems where processes can be optimzied for chab events the e i boolean method should be used this needs to be tested further with more data however as a chab approaches crisis level there are internal and externalized stresses on the cyanobacterial cells thus possibly increasing the amount of extracellular toxins which may explain this discrepancy in using our method for resiliency planning and simulations these methods for cellular status should be used to simulate the chab as the water plant operates these high microcystins events such as during the twc occurr due to poor chab source water management activities such as improper algicide application and or unoptimized treatment processes result in excessive cell lysis and thus much higher extracellular microcystins concentrations additionally chabs can quickly develop without notice making the time to prepare the optimized processes dangerously short this qmra model is useful for any microcystins and or chab event that may impact drinking water supplies and can be amended to simulate unique scenarios providing a means of simulating the resiliency of the cpp and other water systems further granularity of process specific modeling in this qmra model supports the system s process specific optimization with resiliency capable of being modeled for the processes individually and system as a whole the 2014 twc demonstrated that even a large wtp with ample funding can quickly become compromised by microcystins if unprepared this method provides a means of improving system resiliency by improved system preparation for a chab event but will be most impactful when coupled with a prospective bloom model subsequently due to the need to understand bloom managment and preparation of optimzied microcystins removal processes predictive bloom models are a vital need cpp made several improvements and optimizations ptwc to ensure a similar crisis never happens again results from the models indicate that the stated changes have a major impact on removal efficiencies of microcystins under the new treatment scheme there is approximately a 90 probability that a finished water detection will be below the oepa threshold 0 3µg l and not a single hq crested 0 50 for both adults and children amidst simulated twc conditions these results do not suggest that all aberrant health risks have been eliminated but rather there is increased confidence that deleterious health effects will not develop in the exposed population cpp wtp will soon be finishing their ozonation installation which pilot tests demonstrate 99 microcystins reduction efficiencies if those efficacy levels can be continually maintained and achieved this will provide for a near elimination of the microcytins risks this method is developed primarily to account for the following cellular status of the mcirocystins treatment processes through a wtp and estimate the final concentration of microcystins and associated acute health risks to the population additionally chronic exposure to microcystins has been previously associated with colorectal and liver cancers and liver disease ueno et al 1996 zhou et al 2002 yu and chen 1994 although chronic effects were not the focus of this study the method developed here is independent on this issue and the models using it can be adapted in the future to provide information for evaluating how particular treatment processes or interventions may affect longer term risk specifically modifications to two components of the models using this method would be needed for this application 1 the current hazard quotient approach would need to be modified to reflect the risk of a person developing cancer or other disease outcomes over a lifetime of exposure here in the case of risk of colorectal or liver cancers a cancer slope factor estimated from population cancer rates and environmental doses would be needed to calculate the increase in risk given a daily dose of microcystins likewise similar information would be needed linking liver disease rates to toxin levels unfortunately this type of information is limited in the case of microcystins exposure 2 the model would also need to incorporate variability in terms of microcystin concentrations and exposure during non peak conditions this would include capturing day to day fluctuations in water concentrations and ingestion rates to date the linkage between longer term microcystins exposures and disease outcomes is primarily based on epidemiological studies thus more studies are warranted to confirm these linkages and to provide relevant data that could be used to develop such chronic health risk models no model is without its limitations and needed improvements more accurate data are needed to improve the output of these models several assumptions in the treatment and exposure models were made related to removal efficiencies and water characteristics ph temperature consistent assessments of treatment dosing ct values and effectiveness need to be conducted routinely in order to establish a model specific to a wtp the exposures from toothbrushing are a complex exposure pathway especially for toxins such as microcystins for toxins with such low rfd values requires a systematic assessment of drinking water ingestion during toothbrushing although microcystins concentrations vary with time the twc data are point estimates from grab samples therefore these qmra models cannot depict the temporal changes in risk temporality is impacted by two factors sampling timing and rfd o for the sampling this is mainly because most microcystins data are point estimates from grab samples thus significantly limiting the ability to depict the temporality changes in bloom and toxin concentrations for the rfd o this limitation revolves around how it is used in risk assessments and that its reference is to the volume of water ingested essentially in the devleopment of a rfd o it is assumed that all members of a population only use municipal drinking water as their only source of water rather than other sources such as bottled water while this is controlled for as much as possible in the exposure modeling and incorporation of ingestion uncertainty in the exposure this fundamental limitation in rfd o development remains despite this limitation in the temporality results from using this method will serve as a baseline to include temporality based exposure models finally whilst empirical modeling wtp processes for cell lysis rates is inappropriate for mechanistic modeling such as in this research these rates will be a valuable addition the boolean switch and e i boolean methods combined with the overall method of maintaining computational separation between the intra and extracellular toxins provides a very accurate simulation method for cyanobacteria however it should be evaluated to determine if the lysis rates per process can increase model precision wihtout undue effects to the uncertainty and variability of the microcystins and associated risk estimates 5 conclusions harmful microcystins exposures characterized by an hq 1 0 were likely during the 2014 twc especially for children and vulnerable populations acute health effects such as diarrhea and vomiting are expected but greater health concerns relate to liver complications carcinogenic effects can t be captured for this hazard since it not a confirmed carcinogen the exposure model that included simulating the treatment system at cpp was able to achieve validated outputs the peak discharge and upper 95th percentile of the simulated drinking water discharge microcystin concentrations were nearly equivalent this will require future work to model daily operations of the cpp to provide a time series of microcystins reduction wihtin each treatment process of the system the structure of our model allows for the vital inclusion of cellular status of the microcystins further due to how the model is structured simulating system resiliency to a range of likely and disaster level chab events can be conducted the qmra framework was adapted to this research because it provides a vital tool for water systems to prepare and plan

17316,drinking water treatment processes are capable of removing microcystins but consistent operation of processes optimized for cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom chab conditions is not fiscally feasible therefore utilities must ready themselves and start the chab processes as a reactionary response predictive analytics and modelling are impactful tools to prepare water systems for chabs but are still in early stages of development until those prospective models are completed a method to determine best actions in advance of a bloom event thus improving system resiliency is needed in this study an adaptation of the quantitative microbial risk analysis qmra methodology was applied to develop this method this method and resulting models were developed around the toledo ohio usa water crisis of 2014 but being mechanistic they are easily adaptable to other systems process operations data results from this internally validated model demonstrate how rapid action using both powdered activated carbon and measured increases in chlorine dose can mitigate health risks our research also demonstrates the importance of modelling the cellular status of the toxins toxins either in an intact cell or in the water from a lysed cell risks were characterized using hazard quotients hq and at the peak of the crisis ranged from a minimum of 0 00244 to a maximum of 2 84 for adults in simulations where chab specific treatment was used this decreased to 0 00057 and 0 236 respectively we further outline how this methodology can be used to simulate water system resiliency to likely and aberrant microbial hazard events to plan for the best interventions to protect public health this method can be used for other hazards expected to be variable in the future where system prepatory planning is critical to continued public health protection considering the water quantity and quality fluctuations occurring and likely to intensify under climate change this type of computationally supported preparedness is vital to maintaining robust water system resiliency keywords qmra microcystins water treatment resiliency human health bayesian simulation 1 introduction 1 1 problem statement cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms chab are a continuing issue for drinking water supplies globally carmichael and boyer 2016 while there are efforts to predict chabs forecasting capabilities remain highly uncertain and difficult to use for preparatory and long term planning it is understood that drinking water systems are capable of removing cyanotoxins but they can become overwhelmed if all of the toxins are released from lysed cells too early in the process hitzfeld et al 2000 further preparatory planning is a vital component to system resiliency which water utilities impacted by prior chab events know quite well consequently this research has developed a generalized method to simulate the treatment efficacy and resulting health risk reduction which can be applied to simulate and test water treatment system resiliency to chab events as will be discussed in further detail the status of the chab either growing or decaying treatment processes and human exposure factors ingestion rate etc need to be considered for a complete picture of microcystin risk reduction therefore a method to incorporate these critical components was developed as an adaptation of the quantitative microbial risk analysis paradigm due to its success and established use in practice for risk analysis and decision support for water infrastructure to demonstrate the implementation of this method we have developed a risk model under two scenarios pre and post toledo water crisis this crisis was chosen because it has complete data to include monitoring of the chab and pre and post treatment microcystins concentration 1 2 chabs and human health impacts cyanobacteria are ubiquitous prokaryotes found in surface waters across the globe these photosynthetic gram negative microorganisms present significant public health and engineering challenges due to their potential for expansive growth and synthesis of cyanotoxins which are a human health hazard surface water eutrophication processes coupled with climate change can create ideal growth conditions for chabs events epa 2015 there are different classes of cyanotoxins with varying toxicities and target organs most notably the hepatotoxins microcystins nodularins and cylindrospermopsins and the neurotoxins saxitoxins and anatoxin a nienaber and steinitz kannan 2018 some genera and or species produce only one type of toxin while others are known to produce multiple types although any cyanotoxin could potentially be synthesized within a chab the most widely distributed and reported cyanotoxin is microcystin rastogi et al 2014 microcystins are a class of cyclic peptides that are comprised of seven different amino acids because of the immense variation in chemical structure there are over 100 microcystin congeners currently known carmichael and boyer 2016 of the known congeners microcystin lr mclr typified by leucine at x position and arginine at z position red circles in fig 1 is the most abundant studied and toxic form lone et al 2015 microcystins are primarily hepatotoxins with acute low dose exposure being most common but chronic exposure is possible via drinking water nienaber and steinitz kannan 2018 symptoms of acute intoxication include diarrhea vomiting piloerection fatigue and parlor microcystins inhibit serine threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2a liver enzymes these enzymes remove phosphates from proteins which is an important step in many biochemical pathways inhibition leads to hyperphosphorylation of proteins associated with the cytoskeleton of hepatocytes creating hemorrhaging and progressive liver necrosis humbert 2009 longer term and chronic exposures have been linked to disease outcomes in humans however these studies are limited mainly because it is very difficult to quantify individual exposure or duration in one study it was found that significant clusters of deaths related to non alcoholic liver disease were identified in us counties where chabs were present in local surface waters a bayesian regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between chab coverage and the risk of nonalcoholic liver disease deaths svir cev et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 1 3 water treatment and chabs 1 3 1 cellular status of microcystins impact water treatment efficacy and modeling the efficacy of cyanotoxin removal in water treatment is dependent on whether the toxin is intracellular still within the cell or extracellular outside of a lysed cell it is more efficient and cost effective to remove intracellular toxins since the processes to remove them are the same to remove other microbiological hazards this is a reason why algaecide is not recommended as a response action for chabs by using algaecides extracellular toxin concentrations dramatically increase which increases the need for chemical oxidant removal with subsequent increased likelihood of hazardous disinfection byproduct generation hitzfeld et al 2000 additionally laboratory experiments using mirocystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa demonstrated significant differences in toxin status based on the growth phase for a chab in the growth phase intracellular toxins comprise 75 to 90 of total microcystins contrary to this for a m aeruginosa chab in decay phase intracellular toxins comprise 30 to 40 of the total microcystins chorus and bartram 1999 furthermore pietsch et al 2002 demonstrated that intracellular toxin generation reached a peak of 25µg l at 13 days after the initial growth phase 0 to 9 days followed by a stationary phase in days 9 to 16 pietsch et al 2002 as the m aeruginosa moved into the decay phase around day 20 extracellular toxin concentrations peaked at 35µg l pietsch et al 2002 these data reinforce the importance of assessing the chab health status growth or decay in the decision making process for water treatment utilities consequently for any risk model developed to simulate or estimate water treatment efficacy during a chab the health status of the bloom is a vital component 1 3 2 removal of microcystins via drinking water treatment the toledo water crisis of 2014 demonstrated that for a large scale bloom traditional water treatment systems are not optimized or prepared to remove bloom level microcystins the ohio epa ohepa identified that the following processes are most efficacious for extracellular toxins toxins outside of the cell due to the greater difficulty of their removal from source water epa 2016b clarification and filtration these treatment processes are most efficient at removing intracellular microcystins however caution is needed especially when chab cell counts are very high in the raw water to prevent algae build up on the filters plant 2018b powdered activated carbon pac pac has demonstrated high efficacy in removing extracellular microcystins due to pac s greater effective surface area providing better adsorption kinetics ho et al 2011 adequate removal via adsorption is dependent on detention times and natural organic matter nom concentrations pietsch et al 2002 chemical oxidants primary examples of which are potassium permaganate kmno4 which is commonly used by water treatment plants wtps as a pre oxidant to control for taste and odor water color biofilms or zebra mussels at the intake it is ph independent and exhibits a greater kinetic rate in warmer temperatures rodríguez et al 2007 its use in the degradation of microcystins will be discussed and incorporated into the exmpale models later but does require careful assessment of its use to limit the amount of extracellular microcystins produced chlorine is another powerful oxidant capable of degrading microcystins at relatively low doses the effectiveness of chlorine is directly related to its ct disinfection improves as ph levels decrease 8 0 and water temperatures increase epa 2016a ozone is one of the most powerful oxidants available to a wtp and is also ct dependent but also dependent on water quality constituents specifically total organic carbon toc that can increase the water s ozone demand ozonation is capable of complete cell lysis and thus destruction of both intra and extracellular cyanotoxins 2 modeling methods 2 1 qmra framework all modelling inferences and plotting were conducted in the statistical programming language r the qmra framework is an adaptive computational methodology that uses mixed modeling methods to estimate the health effects from exposures to environmental hazards the qmra methodology can either generate point estimates or in modern qmra models the monte carlo or another stochastic method provides a means of incorporating the uncertainty of model variables bichai and smeets 2013 haas et al 2014 in this study due to the uncertainties of the input variables of the model the monte carlo method is used this method requires the optimization or choice of probability distributions for each variable in the model that is considered uncertain ross 2007 the probability distributions are parameterized using data from the open literature or expert elicitation haas et al 2014 for cyanotoxins the dose response will not be a mechanistic dose response model like in typical qmra models but rather it will be the calculated oral reference dose rfdo subsequently a hazard quotient hq will be used to characterize the risks for rapid risk estimates that can be compared over diverse populations since cyanotoxins are only a suspected carcinogen it is not appropriate to perform a cancer risk estimate therefore the hq will assess the risk based on liver function degeneration which is the basis of the lowest observed adverse effect level loael which is the basis of the rfdo epa 2015 mechanistic modeling is an approach to describe the inner workings of a complex system by accounting for and modeling the individual parts of the system without relying on empirical relationships to be used for the models these types of models mechanistic provide for a more generalizable model that can be udpated and adapted as desired for other systems constraints and input data therefore the models that are developed to work within this method are developed as mechanistic where possible given knowledge of and pertinent data for the processes in the system in this research two risk models are developed one for the toledo water crisis of 2014 twc and one for the collins park plant cpp operations post water crisis pwtc both models incorporate an inovative means of modeling cellular status of the toxin relative to a healthy or decaying bloom this portion of the model does not predict a growing or decaying bloom rather it provides the needed inclusion of the likley cellular status of the toxin prior to entering the plant this research has developed three models to incorporate this new method of modeling the cellular status of the bloom using minimal information combined these models provide a means of relative risk comparison to determine the risk reduction potential during water treatment subsequently because the method is developed around simulation methods inerventions can be experimented with computationally and decision makers can refer to associated sentitivty analyses to assess the resiliency of their plants to chab events 2 2 exposure scenario and water treatment modeling in the case of chabs in surface waters used as a drinking water source the primary exposure is direct ingestion consequently as is shown in fig 2 the model is developed to estimate the health risks from the associated cyanotoxins after their reduction via drinking water treatment when regarding cellular status of the toxin there are more intracellular toxins from a bloom in growth as opposed to more extracellular toxins from decaying bloom fig 2 this is critical for an accurate simulation of the finished water microcystins concentration due to differences in treatment process efficacy based on cellular status of the toxin concurrent with modeling the direct ingestion secondary exposures from food preparation and brushing teeth are incorporated into overall drinking water ingestion because children are typically more susceptible to environmental hazards modeling health effects to both adults 21 years and children 6 years is performed as introduced already two broad scenarios are modeled twc and ptwc but for relative risk comparison purposes both begin with an initial condition at the height of the twc where the maximum microcystins concentration was 14µg l table 1 plant 2018a subsequently this also allows for comparison of how effective the treatment plant improvements would be to a similar bloom from the 2014 crisis 2 3 bloom status and water treatment modeling 2 3 1 hab status and extracellular veruss intracellular toxin modeling three options to simulate the health status of the bloom were developed the first method uses available data for the ratio of extracellular to intracellular microcystins e i ratio the e i ratio method assumes that the e i ratio accurately depicts a decaying or growing chab the e i ratio was drawn from 5 studies where the e i concentrations were reported boutte et al 2008 chorus 2001 park et al 2018 sakai et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 these data were digitized and a total of 116 data points were used to optimize probability distributions therefore the central limit theorem was used to assume a normal distribution the normal distribution was optimized to the data using the fitdistr function in r as shown in table 1 using a μ of 0 159 and σ of 0 262 the normal distribution was truncated to a lower limit of 0 and upper limit of 1 75 which was the highest e i ratio from the combined sources data since the normal distribution is a symetric continuous probability density function pdf truncation is necessary to ensure that unreasonable values of the e i ratio e g negative values are not sampled during each monte carlo iteration this random variate is used as the relative proportion of extracellular toxins e i ratio r in eq 1 where c m 0 is the initial toxin concentration 14µg l that is used to calculate the concentration of microcystins that are either extracellular or intracellular c m x because the c m x is calculated relative to the extracellular toxin percentage r d calculating the intracellular toxin concentration c m i uses the compliment of r d 1 c m x c m e c m 0 r d c m i c m 0 1 r d for the second and third methods eq 2 is used to model c m x these methods expand on the e i ratio method by incorporating information regarding if the bloom is healthy or decaying a highly generalizable method requiring the least amount of data on the bloom uses a boolean switch depicted in the pseudo code below this method provides equal probability of chab growth or decay phases which is a closer simulation of dynamics before the chab can be sampled than compared to the e i ratio alone a bloom simulated in the growth phase when a 1 in eq 2 uses a generalized growing bloom extracellular toxin percentage r h in eq 2 values shown in table 1 then when a 0 the decaying bloom extracellular percentage r d in eq 2 is used to model the extracellular toxin concentration c m e again because the r h and r d are both in terms of extracellular toxins their compliment is used to model the intracellular microcystins concentration c m i the third method combines the e i ratio with the boolean switch referred to e i boolean in this method just the mean of the truncated normal distribution of the e i ratio is used as a general probability of a decaying bloom essentially the e i boolean no longers models the likelihood of a healthy or decaying bloom as a 50 probability and makes an approximately 16 likelihood that the bloom is decaying this would require a moderate amount of data for the utility to generate on the status of the bloom and can be updated regularly this also removes the 50 probability in the method that uses the boolean switch alone making it more descriptive of realistic blooms if data characterizing the bloom s health status is available this e i boolean method uses the uniform distribution to generate a random variate between 0 and 1 to not impart shape limitations to this random variate pseudo code below using this random variate from the uniform distribution at each monte carlo iteration if a 0 16 then then r h is used to model the growing bloom and r d is used otherwise both the boolean switch and the e i boolean informs which part of the conditional function in eq 2 to use for the concentration of microcystins that are either extracellular or intracellular c m x where r d and r h are the relative proportion of extracellular toxins from a decaying or healthy chab respectively for example using the boolean switch when a 1 the bloom is decaying thus c m e c m 0 r d and c m i c m 0 1 r d to simulate a decaying bloom concentration of extracellular c m e and intracellular c m i microcystins likewise in the e i boolean method with a 0 16 c m e c m 0 r d etc both r h and r d are uncertain variables which are modeled using uniform distributions with parameters shown in table 1 2 c m x b o o l e a n e i b o o l e a n c m e c m i r d c m i c m i 1 r d if a 0 if a 0 16 c m e c m i r h c m i c m i 1 r h otherwise to determine which of the cellular status methods is best to use a non parametric means in assessing the simulation s stability based on the homogeneity of risk estimate was developed this method uses the wilcoxon ranked sum test for a non parametic means of assessing the degree of similarity within the computational data from the simulations of each method essentially if the homogeneity of risk estimates is maintained throughout multiple iteration levels greater credence is given to the method simulation as compared to the other cellular status modeling methods by completing this analysis based on number of iterations it can also be used to determine if there is a trend or change in conclusions on homogeneity of risk estimates based on iterations simulated when modeling intracellular toxin treatment c m i from equation 2 needs to be converted to an equivalent number of cells eq 3 is developed to estimate the cell abundance n c dependent on c m i the microcystin quota typically encountered per cell m c q and the molecular weight of microcystins mw m c q is an uncertain variable modeled as a uniform distribution with parameters in table 1 3 n c c m i m c q m w 2 3 2 water treatment efficacy modeling when the water reaches chlorine treatment the chlorine lyses remaining cells and oxidizes the microcystins plant 2018b zamyadi et al 2013 therefore by removing intracellular toxins prior to chlorine the chlorine dose can be lower to achieve both of these aims subsequently to model removal of microcystins the treatment model outputs are divided into concentration of intracellular microcystins delivered for chlorine to lyse c m i c l c e l l and concentration of extracellular microcystins delivered for chlorine removal c m e c l clarification and filtration for clarification treatment

environmental protection agency usepa exposure factors handbook epa 2011 table 1 relevant water ingestion data for tooth brushing events is limited one qmra study considered tooth brushing exposure by assuming a uniform ingestion rate of 1 5 ml of water schijven et al 2016 however when consulting the dental literature a wider range of volumes is possible especially when considering that most rinse water is spit out and only the remaining salivary film from the rinse water remains to be ingested therefore it was chosen to model the volume of salivary film that the toothbrushing rinse water would create eq 9 shows that using the internal surface area of the mouth a s and salivary film thickness x s f for children and adults separately and the toothbrushing frequency in a day λ t b the volume of water v t b in l entrapped in the salivary film which can be injested is then modeled the distributions for a s for adults and children both are the truncated normal table 1 and the x s f are uniform distributions for both adults and children table 1 frequency of brushing teeth is assumed to be between 0 2 times a day based on results of previous studies liu et al 2007 9 v t b a s 1 m 2

based on the loael that is adjusted based on an uncertainty factor uf therefore the rfdo is a variable which relates the concentration of a toxin to the health outcome that is monitored for in experiments calculating the loael because of the aggressive toxicological response resulting in liver degeneration disease in mammals heinze 1999 the usepa set the rfdo for microcystins quite low at just 0 05 mg kg day epa 2015 body weights are needed to model the hq which are drawn from the usepa exposure factors handbook with a mean adult body weight of 80 kg and a mean child body weight of 18 6 kg epa 2011 the seed in r was set at 24 using set seed 24 this will be needed for reproducible results from this model and the simulation is run for 10 000 iterations to invoke the law of large numbers for a converged simulation ross 2007 10 h q c m d i s t v w f v t b r f d o b w 1 d a y 3 results at each iteration the model algorithm operates a decision node to randomly assign the cellular status of the microcystin from the chab fig 3 with an estimate of the percentage of toxins that are intracellular and extracellular treatment of them is modeled and a concentration of finished water microcystins is estimated then from this concentration estimate the average daily dose numerator of eq 10 is estimated to determine the hq results are then saved in a central dataframe and the model iterates 3 1 2014 toledo water crisis compared to post 2014 fig 4 shows the results from the risk simulations for adults and children for both twc and ptwc conditions in these figures a hq of 1 is highlihted with a solid red line a hq of 1 is indicative of a excessivly high risk and significant likelihood that health effects will be experienced therefore the model is demonstrating that the 2014 twc was a significant public health event and significant progress has been made ptwc the peak microcystins concentration in the finished water during the twc is shown in fig 5 a as can be seen in fig 5a the peak twc microcystins concentration blue line is much higher than the ohepa red line furthermore fig 5a demosntrates the simulation estimates close alignment within the known peak concentration during the twc with the estimated 95th percentile concentration being closely aligned with the known twc peak and the model s estimated peak overlapping the known twc peak further examination of the results in fig 5 demonstrates that during the 2014 crisis there was an 85 probability that the concentration would be above the threshold set by ohepa of 0 3µg l contrastingly there is only a 6 probability of exceeding the action level if the same size bloom and peak concentration of microcystins impacted cpp wtp again with the upgraded chab optimized system fig 5b 3 2 examination of importance of cellular status of toxin in risk modeling when the microcystins were set to only extracellular red boxes or intracellular green boxes there is a 1 5 log difference in risk estimates highlighting the importance of toxin cellular status moreover there is consistently higher risk to children relative to adults as can also be seen in fig 6 the violin plots incorporate the outliers into the tails of the density of the estimates the violin plots show a consistent alignment of the median and the means further the medians are well alligned with the area of highest density demonstrating a converged simulation overall we can also see that all extracellular toxins simulations increases the low range tails and focuses the largest density to the high risk range finally fig 6 shows that for twc simulations where toxins were both intracellular and extracellular the densities are very difuse and bimodal with the alignment of the mean and median between these peaks still demonstrating a converged simulation bimodality is indicative of two groups which is sensible since there are two cellular status groups operating within a split function in eq 2 this bimodality is reduced during the ptwc simulations demonstrating a likely lessened impact of the cellular status on the optimized treatment system designed as a response to the chab crisis descriptive statistics of the risk results are reported in table 2 the results are all right skewed meaning that the results are biased to higher risk ranges with the greatest bias occuring when extracellular is allowed to dominate the cellular status of the toxin the three methods developed to model the cellular status of the microcystins are compared to eachother in table 3 for twc simulations and table 4 for ptwc simulations as can be seen in tables 3 and 4 the standard boolean switch method provides for a better agreement in compuational data for twc conditions and the combined method e i boolean method provides much greater agreement in computaional data for the ptwc simulations tables 3 and 4 these results can also be a reason behind the bimodal outcomes from the twc combined intracellular and extracellular simulations since a less informed decision node boolean switch was the better functioning method for that event 3 3 sensitivity analysis a parital rank correlation coefficient sensitivity analysis was undertaken for each of the simulations operated the ability to conduct this type of sensitivity analysis assumes that the trend between uncertain variable and model estimate are monotonic over the entire range of model outputs fig 7 demonstrates for ptwc intraceullular and extracellular conditions overall monotonic trends demonstrated with the loess smoothed lines a consistency for all other models when the micorcystins were modeled as combined intracellular and extracellular the percent of microcystins that are extracellular rd was the most impactful variable on the model fig 8 a when the toxins are simulated as either completely extracellular or intracellular this variable will not impact the model estimates since it is not used in those simulations this was followed by the η p a c for the adult ptwc simulations fig 8 b and drinking water ingestion volume fig 8 a d this demonstrates that the intensified emphasis of pac injection and use at cpp for future chab treatment has a direct effect on the simulated risks also as can be seen in figs 8 c and d the higher risks to children are driven by the ingestion rates for those simulations where the microcystins were entirely intracellular fig 9 η p a c no longer has a significant impact on the model because pac is an extracellular toxin process for both adults and children during the twc the drinking water ingestion volume was the most impactful variable when simulating the toxins as intracellular only because the ptwc cpp system has upgraded filters and clarification for cellular removal fig 9 b and d from the ptwc simulations the filter is the second most impactful variable behind clarification for adults fig 9 b and c again we see for children the drinking water exposure variables drive the simulated risks this is particularly clear when we see how much more impactful the v t b variable is for children as compared to adults again the η p a c returned to being the most impactful variable when simulating the microcystins as only extracellular for adults fig 10 a and b while children risks continued to be dominated by the exposure variables fig 10 c and d as with all plots in fig 8 the improved pac implementation at cpp is showing to have a significant impact on decreasing the estimated risks in all cases where pac and cl are compared to each other in the sensitvity plots η c l which is the final removal step of microcystins consistently has a lower impact on the model results this further reinforces the important role pac plays in microcystins control 4 discussion the twc was a major public health event that occured on 15 august 2014 the peak finished water microcystins concentration was measured at 3 19µg l our model estimated an equivalent 3 20µg l at the 95th percentile when simulating the twc this result demonstrates the validity of adapting qmra modeling methods for microbiologically derived toxins that are a human health hazard it also provides validity to the methods developed and tested to simulate the cellular status of the toxin further the modeling methods used are straight forward and can be readily applied without significant advanced mathematics training allowing for wider applicability for human health protection and system optimization the actual totality of the deleterious health effects attributable to the 2014 twc will continue to be difficult to ascertain however a follow up assessment by mccarty 2016 sheds some light on the matter cpp municipal water consumers were surveyed in september of 2014 to assess their water use habits adherence to issued public health advisories and incidence of illness a total of 171 households were interviewed and local census data was used to extrapolate findings to the entire population mccarty et al conclude that a maximum of 40 5 of the estimated 103 058 households were potentially exposed to harmful levels of mcs this health assessment also surveyed onset of illness but these illnesses were not tested for their association to specific microcystins exposures nevertheless the results show that 16 2 of households 17 431 reported at least one physical illness with diarrhea being the most common illness 12 1 mccarty 2016 these findings demonstrate the ineffectiveness that can plague public health advisories and support the risk of deleterious health outcomes estimated by the models in this study it is important to note however that reported illness from the survey are mostly related to gi distress disease and not related to liver degeneration the rfdo we used is specific to liver degeneration is the only established rfd to date while diarrhea and other gi distress can be related symptoms they are different health outcomes can be conflated with other underlying infections or diseases therefore to model risk of overall illness the data suggest a need for a new rfdo that would most likely be more protective causing our estimated hqs to increase it is also important to recognize that small changes in the values used to calculate both the ingested dose and hq have major consequences to risk estimates for example if the tolerable daily intake tdi of 0 04 µg kg day equivalent to the rfdo mandated by the world health organization who was used our estimated hqs would be much higher falconer and humpage 2005 schmidt et al 2002 reported an empirical model to estimate microcystins cellular breakthrough during treatment they defined breakthrough as intracellular toxins becoming extracellular during different water treatment processes schmidt et al 2002 several of their findings are consistent with ours including flocculation filtration are an efficient means of removing intracellular toxins however cellular breakthrough is possible given the conditions of the filter pac provides an effective means of extracellular toxins removal however with difusivity in the efficacy range and kmno4 used as a pre oxidant can result in significant cell lysis schmidt et al 2002 also demonstrated that relatively excessive breakthrough is possible during preoxidation using kmno4 or ozone large variability in breakthrough was observed and is most likely explained by variability in cell stability during different growth phases schmidt et al 2002 our model did not account for cellular breakthrough during the treatment steps due to the variability of these estimates based on inlet water quality and a lack of such data from cpp the empirical model in schmidt et al 2002 couldn t be used for cpp or this research due to the differences in source water process controls and empirical model constraints in our model once the toxin s cellular status was determined by the boolean switch or e i boolean method they remained separated until chlorination at which time all toxins were considered from lysed cells or already externlized by the time they reached chlorination our model was still capable of making accurate estimates of the microcystins concentration in the finished water during the twc therefore the methods we have developed are accomplishing the same outcomes as modeling cellular breakthrough but with less uncertainty and variability in the microcystins concentration estimates in the finished water further for future models developed using this method recommend generating process specific microcystins concentration reduction to estimate the toxin reduction at each process more precisely an inclusion for which no data currently exists xiao et al 2018 published a stochastic risk model for microcystins in the yongjiang river in china xiao et al 2018 in their risk model drinking water was the exposure route and a hazard index hi was used to assess health risks results of their study indicated no health risk present as none of their hi exceeded 0 34 it is important to note however that initial microcystins concentrations in the xiao et al 2018 study were very low nearly at or below the oepa 0 3 µg l threshold so the lack of risk is logical further there is no specificity to the water treatment system s reduction of microcystins in the finished drinking water this limits the decision support capacity of their model and makes resiliency simulations of the water treatment system impossible our model corroborates the significant difference between intracellular and extracellular removal effectiveness and assocaited hqs demonstrating that early detection and preparedness for chab events are vital as the literature suggests most microcystins in a healthy growing chab are intracellular therefore health risks from these chab events are minimal there are major concerns however if the majority of microcystins are extracellular results from the models demonstrate the difficulty of efficiently removing extracellular microcystins from the water for ptwc water treatment processes demonstrated the ability to effectively eliminate risks however children and vulnerable populations will consistently demonstrate higher risks even to lower concentrations of microcystins fig 6 the comparison of the three methods to simulate cellular status of the bloom shows that for this limited trial when simulating chab conditions or crisis conditions in a wtp that is not optimzed to chab events the boolean switch should be used and for systems where processes can be optimzied for chab events the e i boolean method should be used this needs to be tested further with more data however as a chab approaches crisis level there are internal and externalized stresses on the cyanobacterial cells thus possibly increasing the amount of extracellular toxins which may explain this discrepancy in using our method for resiliency planning and simulations these methods for cellular status should be used to simulate the chab as the water plant operates these high microcystins events such as during the twc occurr due to poor chab source water management activities such as improper algicide application and or unoptimized treatment processes result in excessive cell lysis and thus much higher extracellular microcystins concentrations additionally chabs can quickly develop without notice making the time to prepare the optimized processes dangerously short this qmra model is useful for any microcystins and or chab event that may impact drinking water supplies and can be amended to simulate unique scenarios providing a means of simulating the resiliency of the cpp and other water systems further granularity of process specific modeling in this qmra model supports the system s process specific optimization with resiliency capable of being modeled for the processes individually and system as a whole the 2014 twc demonstrated that even a large wtp with ample funding can quickly become compromised by microcystins if unprepared this method provides a means of improving system resiliency by improved system preparation for a chab event but will be most impactful when coupled with a prospective bloom model subsequently due to the need to understand bloom managment and preparation of optimzied microcystins removal processes predictive bloom models are a vital need cpp made several improvements and optimizations ptwc to ensure a similar crisis never happens again results from the models indicate that the stated changes have a major impact on removal efficiencies of microcystins under the new treatment scheme there is approximately a 90 probability that a finished water detection will be below the oepa threshold 0 3µg l and not a single hq crested 0 50 for both adults and children amidst simulated twc conditions these results do not suggest that all aberrant health risks have been eliminated but rather there is increased confidence that deleterious health effects will not develop in the exposed population cpp wtp will soon be finishing their ozonation installation which pilot tests demonstrate 99 microcystins reduction efficiencies if those efficacy levels can be continually maintained and achieved this will provide for a near elimination of the microcytins risks this method is developed primarily to account for the following cellular status of the mcirocystins treatment processes through a wtp and estimate the final concentration of microcystins and associated acute health risks to the population additionally chronic exposure to microcystins has been previously associated with colorectal and liver cancers and liver disease ueno et al 1996 zhou et al 2002 yu and chen 1994 although chronic effects were not the focus of this study the method developed here is independent on this issue and the models using it can be adapted in the future to provide information for evaluating how particular treatment processes or interventions may affect longer term risk specifically modifications to two components of the models using this method would be needed for this application 1 the current hazard quotient approach would need to be modified to reflect the risk of a person developing cancer or other disease outcomes over a lifetime of exposure here in the case of risk of colorectal or liver cancers a cancer slope factor estimated from population cancer rates and environmental doses would be needed to calculate the increase in risk given a daily dose of microcystins likewise similar information would be needed linking liver disease rates to toxin levels unfortunately this type of information is limited in the case of microcystins exposure 2 the model would also need to incorporate variability in terms of microcystin concentrations and exposure during non peak conditions this would include capturing day to day fluctuations in water concentrations and ingestion rates to date the linkage between longer term microcystins exposures and disease outcomes is primarily based on epidemiological studies thus more studies are warranted to confirm these linkages and to provide relevant data that could be used to develop such chronic health risk models no model is without its limitations and needed improvements more accurate data are needed to improve the output of these models several assumptions in the treatment and exposure models were made related to removal efficiencies and water characteristics ph temperature consistent assessments of treatment dosing ct values and effectiveness need to be conducted routinely in order to establish a model specific to a wtp the exposures from toothbrushing are a complex exposure pathway especially for toxins such as microcystins for toxins with such low rfd values requires a systematic assessment of drinking water ingestion during toothbrushing although microcystins concentrations vary with time the twc data are point estimates from grab samples therefore these qmra models cannot depict the temporal changes in risk temporality is impacted by two factors sampling timing and rfd o for the sampling this is mainly because most microcystins data are point estimates from grab samples thus significantly limiting the ability to depict the temporality changes in bloom and toxin concentrations for the rfd o this limitation revolves around how it is used in risk assessments and that its reference is to the volume of water ingested essentially in the devleopment of a rfd o it is assumed that all members of a population only use municipal drinking water as their only source of water rather than other sources such as bottled water while this is controlled for as much as possible in the exposure modeling and incorporation of ingestion uncertainty in the exposure this fundamental limitation in rfd o development remains despite this limitation in the temporality results from using this method will serve as a baseline to include temporality based exposure models finally whilst empirical modeling wtp processes for cell lysis rates is inappropriate for mechanistic modeling such as in this research these rates will be a valuable addition the boolean switch and e i boolean methods combined with the overall method of maintaining computational separation between the intra and extracellular toxins provides a very accurate simulation method for cyanobacteria however it should be evaluated to determine if the lysis rates per process can increase model precision wihtout undue effects to the uncertainty and variability of the microcystins and associated risk estimates 5 conclusions harmful microcystins exposures characterized by an hq 1 0 were likely during the 2014 twc especially for children and vulnerable populations acute health effects such as diarrhea and vomiting are expected but greater health concerns relate to liver complications carcinogenic effects can t be captured for this hazard since it not a confirmed carcinogen the exposure model that included simulating the treatment system at cpp was able to achieve validated outputs the peak discharge and upper 95th percentile of the simulated drinking water discharge microcystin concentrations were nearly equivalent this will require future work to model daily operations of the cpp to provide a time series of microcystins reduction wihtin each treatment process of the system the structure of our model allows for the vital inclusion of cellular status of the microcystins further due to how the model is structured simulating system resiliency to a range of likely and disaster level chab events can be conducted the qmra framework was adapted to this research because it provides a vital tool for water systems to prepare and plan

17317,in feedstocks containing high ammonia nh3 concentration removal of the nh3 during the anaerobic digestion ad process can improve ad process performance in the present study the effect of nh3 removal using gas permeable membrane gpm technology on ad process performance and biogas production was investigated using swine manure feedstock batch and semi continuous ad experiments were carried out under mesophilic conditions in the reactor with nh3 recovery total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration was reduced 28 in batch experiments and 23 on average in the semicontinuous experiment compared with the reactor without nh3 recovery free ammonia fa concentrations were also decreased by 23 and 4 on average in batch and semicontinuous experiments respectively these reductions in tan and fa by gpm system positively impacted both the quality and quantity of the biogas produced by ad of swine manure specifically the specific methane yield increased 9 in the batch experiment and 17 on average in the semicontinuous experiment furthermore higher percentages of methane in biogas were obtained during ad retrofitted with gpm system 24 increase in the batch experiment and 11 on average in the semicontinuous experiment range 8 3 13 6 simultaneously a uniform tan recovery rate of 6 7 g n tan per m2 of membrane and per day was obtained for the 205 days of semicontinuous operation ammonia nitrogen was recovered in the form of ammonium sulphate solution therefore the ad gpm configuration produces beneficial results on biogas quantity and quality while recovering ammonia nitrogen in form of ammonium sulphate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion gas permeable membrane ammonia recovery swine manure 1 introduction the amount of entire manure production in the eu27 is about 1 4 billion tonnes amec 2014 anaerobic digestion ad is a powerful strategy to minimize the negative environmental impacts of manure management hijazi et al 2020 ad has been largely studied and it is widely applied for manure treatment in europe the major benefit of ad is the production of renewable energy in the form of methane whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions from manure management grando et al 2017 however ad treatment does not reduce total n concentration in the manure and therefore it does not solve the problem of excesive n in the surplus areas of the eu and similar regions of intensive animal production around the world another problem with ad of manure is the inhibition of methanogens by high ammonia nh3 concentration in these residues that severely reduces the production of biogas angelidaki and ahring 1993 it is suggested that the methanogens inhibition is due to free ammonia fa that can freely permeate microbial cellular membrane chen et al 2008 different approaches have been used to decrease nh3 inhibition of ad due to high ammonia nitrogen concentration 1 through the adaptation of ad microorganisms 2 the co digestion with carbon rich wastes 3 the dilution of the reactor content and 4 the reduction and recovery of total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration from the raw material prior or during the ad process lauterbock et al 2012 methods that reduce tan concentration from ad by recovering it are desirable for economic and environmental reasons darestani et al 2017 romero et al 2016 such approach could not only improve the ad process due to removal of one of the main inhibitors but also transform waste in valuable by products allowing a circular flow of the n cycle robles et al 2020 toopa et al 2017 different methodologies have been recently developed to recover tan in the ad process serna maza et al 2015 reported side stream stripping during ad of domestic food waste using a stripping extraction column that treated the content of the reactor and the biogas the recovery of ammonium with phosphate species from aqueous residues using struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation has been also researched uludag demirer et al 2005 however in livestock wastewater less than 15 of the n contained in the influent could potentially be recovered through struvite because of the very high n to p ratio in these effluents vanotti et al 2017 gas permeable membrane gpm separation has been successfully applied for n recovery from manure before ad and after ad from anaerobically digested effluents garcía gonzález et al 2015a garcía gonzález et al 2015b molinuevo salces et al 2018 riaño et al 2019 vanotti and szogi 2010 vanotti and szogi 2015 in this vein munasinghe arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2020 used a multicriterion analysis to rank five n recovery technologies ammonia stripping ultrafiltration and ion exchange struvite precipitation ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis and gpm separation considering 10 performance criteria giving priority to energy and economic aspects results of this analysis indicated the gpm technology as the preferred option for n recovery from waste streams followed by struvite precipitation similarly beckinghausen et al 2020 indicated gpm technology had lower energy requirements per kg of n recovered 0 22 to 1 2 kwh kgn 1 compared to typical ammonia stripping acid absorption 23 6 to 49 6 kwh kgn 1 in the gpm process gaseous nh3 in manure passes through a hydrophobic gas permeable membrane and is concentrated in an acidic solution circulating on the other side of the membrane the availability of nh3 in the waste where nh3 and nh4 are in equilibrium determines the efficiency of this technology main factors affecting the process are the ph temperature and tan concentration in the livestock waste riaño et al 2019 few studies have investigated the use of gpm systems inside ad reactors to eliminate ammonia inhibition and improve biogas production shi et al 2019 studied the combination of ad with gpm technology using food wastes they found that a reduction of 57 free ammonia fa concentration inside the ad reactor due to n capture by gpm favoured methanogens abundance and increased biogas production by 58 lauterböck et al 2012 also studied the combination of ad with gpm separation using slaughterhouse waste it led to a reduction of 70 fa concentration in the mixed liquor and a higher biogas yield averaging 57 increase compared with a control ad reactor without n recovery the present study also investigated the combination of ad with gpm technology and its effectiveness to relieve ammonia inhibition and improve ad process performance and biogas production but it differs from previous studies in the substrate used swine manure this is another high ammonia strategically important waste requiring solutions the ad gpm experiments with swine manure were conducted using batch and semi continuous operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 origin of manure and inoculum swine manure sm was collected from a finishing farm located in salamanca spain the collected manure was put in plastic containers transported the same day to itacyl laboratory in valladolid spain and stored in the laboratory at 4 c for further use table 1 shows the chemical characteristics of the sm used it contained high concentrations of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 1679 to 3623 mg n l 1 mg l 1 tan 802 to 2078 mg n l 1 and alkalinity 8412 to 12119 mg caco3 l 1 alkalinity is important to sustain n removal by gas permeable membrane process because the n uptake by the gpm acidifies the manure daguerre martini et al 2018 the inoculum used was obtained from an anaerobic digester of the municipal wastewater treatment plant in valladolid spain the inoculum had a concentration of 16 3 g vs volatile solids l 1 2 2 experimental set up two laboratory scale stirred tank ad reactors working volume of 2000 ml were first operated in batch mode 10 days and then in semicontinuous mode 205 days fig 1 reactor r1 was the reference reactor control treatment that provided ad treatment to swine manure without nh3 recovery reactor r2 was the membrane reactor nh3 removal and recovery treatment that provided ad of swine manure coupled with gpm recovery of the nh3 two ports placed on the top of each reactor were used one for influent feeding and effluent withdrawing and the other one for biogas collecting the biogas production was measured daily by displacement of water the temperature of both reactors was kept constant 38 c using a water jacket connected to a temperature controlled water bath the methane volumes were converted to standard temperature and pressure std 0 c and 1 atm the gpm module retrofitted to the ad membrane reactor consisted of 1 a tubular gas permeable membrane submerged in the anaerobic reactor liquid 2 a peristaltic pump and 3 a stripping acidic solution reservoir n concentration tank the tubular gas permeable membrane was made of e ptfe material hydrophobic with a length of 53 cm an outer diameter of 5 2 mm and a wall thickness of 0 56 mm the e ptfe membrane density was 0 95 g cm 3 and the ratio of membrane area exposed to the anaerobic reactor liquid per reactor volume was 0 004 m2 l 1 the peristaltic pump pumpdrive 5001 heidolph schwabach germany continuously recirculated in a closed loop an acidic solution between the inside of the membrane and the n concentration tank fig 1 the acidic solution flow rate was 12 l d 1 the n concentration tank consisted of a 570 ml glass vessel hermetically sealed containing an acidic solution 150 ml of 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 it was replaced with bigger vessels during the experiments to accommodate the increase of the volume of the acidic solution with time as a consequence of the occurrence of osmotic distillation as previously reported by riaño et al 2019 the ph of the acidic solution was monitored daily and whenever the ph reached 2 concentrated h2so4 96 98 panreac was added into the n concentration tank to an endpoint of ph 2 the ph 2 was selected as the upper set point based on vanotti and szogi 2015 that indicated that nh3 recovery in closed loop gpm system is optimized when the ph of the stripping tank solution is kept below 2 2 3 batch experiment an ad batch experiment was carried out for 10 days both ad reactors membrane and reference were fed using the same 1 1 substrate so to inoculum xo ratio expressed as g vs g vs the 1 1 so xo ratio was recommended by molinuevo salces et al 2018 to study the effect of ammonia recovery on anaerobic digestion under stable operation in order to achieve this ratio in anaerobic reactors and due to the different vs concentrations of inoculum and swine manure table 1 the volume of inoculum and substrate swine manure added in each reactor were 1 l and 0 35 l respectively the amounts of vs added from inoculum and swine manure were thus identical 16 3 g vs the addition of water was required to get a final volume of 2 l achieving the desired so xo ratio the reactors were continuously agitated using magnetic stirrers and the mixing speed was kept between 500 and 700 rpm the volume of biogas produced was daily monitored and biogas composition was weekly analysed the specific methane yield was calculated as n ml ch4 produced per g vs added in the substrate initial and final samples of the content of the reactors were taken for tan determination acidic solution samples of 3 ml were daily collected from the n concentration tank and analysed for ph and tan determinations in the batch experiment ph of the stripping solution did not reach 2 and addition of concentrated h2so4 was not needed 2 4 semi continuous experiment the semi continuous experiment was carried out for 205 days both reactors were initially filled with 2 l of inoculum after that manure was added to the reactors once per day every weekday using manual feeding both reactors were fed with the same mixed manure substrate and amount the reactors were continuously agitated with magnetic stirrers in the first stage of the experiment at a mixing speed between 500 and 700 rpm and thereafter they were daily agitated using manual stirring due to the high content of fibers and solids in the manure prior to each feeding event a volume equal to the feeding volume was removed to maintain a constant reactor volume the volume of the membrane reactor was daily checked and any water loss due to osmotic distillation was replenished three different periods i to iii were established for the ad semi continuous experiment based on the organic loading rate olr and the hydraulic retention time hrt the same conditions were applied to both reactors during period i 0 62 days the reactors were operated with hrt 20 days olr 3 7 0 8 g vs l 1 d 1 and feeding rate 100 ml d 1 during period ii 63 128 d the hrt was decreased to 15 days and olr increased to 4 3 4 6 g vs l 1 d 1 with a feeding rate of 133 ml d 1 the composition of manure varied greatly among the two different batches received during period ii as a result of swine manure production table 1 for this reason period ii was separated in the data analysis into period iia with a high ratio total volatile acids tvfa soluble chemichal demand scod of 0 64 and low ammonia content and period iib with a low ratio tvfa scod ratio of 0 18 and high ammonia content table 1 the olr was similar 4 6 0 4 and 4 3 0 4 g vs l 1d 1 for periods iia and iib respectively during period iii 129 205 d hrt was increased back to 20 days with olr 2 8 0 4 g vs l 1 d 1 with a feeding rate of 100 ml d 1 the volume of biogas produced was daily measured and the biogas composition was weekly measured influent and effluent samples were taken twice a week and analysed for total alkalinity ta partial alkalinity pa total solids ts vs tvfa scod tan and tkn within each period data collected after one hrt were used for average calculations of ad process parameters acidic solution samples of 3 ml were daily collected from the n concentration tank to monitor ph and tan to maintain the ph under 2 concentrated h2so4 was added in the acidic solution whenever it was needed a total volume of 102 ml of acid was used 10 ml in period i 12 ml in period iia 20 ml in period iib and 60 ml in period iii the volume of the acidic solution was also daily measured in order to calculate the mass of tan recovered by the gpm system in the membrane reactor 2 5 analytical methods and statistical analysis analyses of scod ts vs tan tkn and tvfa were performed in duplicate in accordance with apha 2005 for the analysis of scod a closed reflux colorimetric method was used ts content was determined by drying the sample to a constant weight at 103 105 c the ts residue was ignited at 550 c to constant weight and the weight lost on ignition was the vs content tan was measured according to the distillation and titration method tkn was measured according to the kjeldahl digestion distillation and titration method both tan and tkn concentrations are expressed in n units the volatile fatty acids concentrations acetate propionate butyrate iso butyrate valerate iso valerate and caproate were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa equipped with a teknokroma trb ffap column of 30 m length and 0 25 mm i d followed by a flame ionization detector fid the carrier gas was helium 1 ml min 1 the temperature of the detector and the injector was 280 c the temperature of the oven was set at 100 c for 4 min then increased to 155 c for 2 min and thereafter increased to 210 c tvfa were calculated as the sum of those acids concentration after applying the cod conversion factor to measure total and partial alkalinity ta pa a ph meter crison basic 20 crison instruments s a barcelona spain was used ta and pa were obtained by measuring the amount of 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 needed to bring the sample to a ph of 4 3 and 5 75 respectively and expressed as mg caco3 l 1 intermediate alkalinity ia was calculated by subtracting pa from ta the optimal ia pa ratio would be of 0 3 ripley et al 1986 biogas composition was analysed using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa with a thermal conductivity detector provided by a hp plot column 30 m 0 53 mm 40 μm followed by a hp molesieve column 30 m 0 53 mm 50 μm the carrier gas was helium 7 ml min 1 the injection port temperature was set at 250 c and the detector temperature was 200 c the temperature of the oven was set at 40 c for 4 min and thereafter increased to 115 c free ammonia fa was calculated as un ionized ammonia using the equation of hansen et al 1998 eq 1 1 n h 3 tn h 3 1 10 p h 10 0 09018 2729 92 t 1 where nh3 was the fa content tnh3 is the total nh3 concentration t was the manure reactor temperature in kelvin and ph was measured in the effluent resistances against nh3 gas diffusion by the membrane structure and pores is defined by the km value samani majd and mukhtar 2013 the mass transfer coefficient km m d 1 was calculated using eq 2 samani majd and mukhtar 2013 2 j k m c 1 c 2 where j is the mass flux per area g m 2 d 1 and c1 and c2 are the fa concentrations in the membrane reactor and in the n concentration tank respectively c2 was assumed to be zero for calculations since ph of the acidic solution was maintained below 2 during the whole experiment and consequently fa concentration was zero results obtained were analysed using one way analysis of variance anova with significance at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch ad experiment at the beginning of the ad experiment tan concentration in both reactors was 1166 mg n l 1 by coupling a gpm system to the anaerobic reactor tan was consistently removed from the membrane reactor and recovered as nh4 2so4 in the acidic solution up to 548 mg n at day 10 fig 2 the slope present in fig 2 leads to a rate of tan captured of 50 2 mg n per day in terms of membrane area the tan recovery rate obtained was 5 8 g n m 2 d 1 tan concentration in the acidic solution increased to 1227 mg l 1 at day10 after 10 days the membrane reactor had a lower concentration of tan compared with the reference 749 16 mg n l 1 vs 1033 27 mg n l 1 which implied a reduction of 28 similarly a reduction of fa concentration of 23 was evidenced in the membrane reactor when comparing with the reference reactor 121 mg l 1 vs 157 mg l 1 the ph in the membrane reactor after 10 days was 8 05 the reductions in tan and fa by gpm impacted the biogas quantity and quality the accumulated specific methane yields expressed as nml ch4 produced per gram of vs added in the substrate are presented in fig 3 specific methane yield for the membrane reactor with nh3 recovery was 9 higher compared to the reference reactor without nh3 recovery more specifically the membrane reactor presented a methane yield of 70 nml ch4 g vs 1 compared with a yield of 64 nml ch4 g vs 1 by the reference reactor furthermore the biogas obtained in the membrane reactor had a higher percentage of ch4 78 compared to the reference reactor 63 the results of this batch experiment confirmed that the ad gpm combination can produce beneficial results on both the biogas quantity and quality using swine manure feedstocks 3 2 semi continuous ad experiment 3 2 1 ammonia concentration in the reactors semi continuous reactors membrane and reference reactors were operated for 205 days through three periods the continuous ammonia capture by the gas permeable system in the membrane reactor worked well and throughout the experiment thus tan in the membrane reactor was lower than in the reference reactor during the whole experimental period fig 4 maximum tan concentration in the reference reactor was 2040 mg n l 1 whereas in the membrane reactor was 1666 mg n l 1 tan concentration in the membrane reactor with an active ammonia capture system was reduced by 23 range 19 33 compared to the reference reactor without tan recovery table 2 free ammonia concentrations in the membrane reactor were also lower than those obtained in the reference reactor table 2 a reduction of fa concentration up to 54 was detected in the membrane reactor compared with the reference reactor inhibitory concentrations for methanogenic microorganisms range between 1500 and 7000 mg l 1 for tan and between 53 and 1450 mg l 1 for fa shi et al 2019 yenigün and demirel 2013 in the present study the recovery of nh3 in the membrane reactor allowed mantaining tan and fa concentrations below these reported inhibition levels for most of the experimental time 3 2 2 influence of nh3 recovery on methane yield and biogas composition the reactors were semi continuously operated for 205 days through three periods under different olr and hrt fig 5 shows the daily methane yields for both reactors during the whole study the average methane produced average specific methane yield and average methane content for each reactor in each experimental period are listed in table 3 both the daily methane produced and the specific methane yield obtained were higher in the membrane reactor compared with that obtained in the reference reactor in all the studied conditions fig 5 table 3 the specific methane yield is one of the most relevant process performance parameters in ad due to its direct relation with the economic efficiency of the process regarding period i average specific methane yield for the membrane reactor with nh3 recovery was significantly higher p 0 05 than for the reference reactor accounting for 138 27 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 and 126 21 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 respectively a decrease in the hrt from 20 to 15 days in period iia resulted in a reduction in methane yield to values of 125 15 and 98 13 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for the membrane reactor and the reference reactor respectively fig 5 table 3 significant differences p 0 03 were found between reactors where the membrane reactor presented a higher methane production than the reference reactor although a drastic drop in methane production occurred in period iib with an average methane of 24 10 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for membrane reactor and 22 11 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for reference reactor the reduction in methane production was no related with the performance of the gpm system because the reduction affected both membrane and reference reactors this reduction was due to a new batch of sm influent with a different composition than in period iia table 1 in period iia manure presented a tvfa scod ratio of 0 64 and it decreased to 0 18 in period iib leading to a reduction in biodegradability period iia showed a considerable higher methane production and stable operation than period iib working at the same hrt 15 days and olr 4 4 4 5 g vs l 1 d 1 thus in this study the reduction in methane yield from period iia to period iib was not due to the low hrt and subsequent low srt inside the reactor this result was in agreement with that obtained by bayrakdar et al 2018 who also experienced sudden and unexpected changes in methane production during ad of chicken manure when the manure batch was changed from day 129 in the period iii the hrt was increased again to the previous value in period i of 20 days to try to recover the anaerobic process from this point methane production gradually increased in both reactors fig 5 achieving an average methane yield of 81 37 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for membrane reactor and 66 28 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for reference reactor thus methane yield was 1 2 fold higher in the membrane reactor than in the reference reactor with a similar behaviour than that obtained in period i and period iia as an overall the methane produced and the specific methane yield increased 17 higher range 10 28 on average in the membrane reactor than in the reference reactor these results are in accordance with those found in literature who indicated that the combination of ad with gpm could increase methane yield by 13 129 depending on operational conditions and digested feedstocks lauterböck et al 2012 shi et al 2019 an evaluation of the ad with and without n recovery on the basis of energy was carried out to assess if the improvements reported here in terms of methane volume and methane composition are justified in relation to the extra energy expended in acid recirculation in the gpm process the calculations are based on a biogas plant for a medium size pig farm with 2800 sows and an annual manure production of 17136 m3 6 12 m3 of manure per saw per year and the following conditions a methane yield of 75 3 nml g vs 1 for the system without n recovery and 88 3 nml g vs 1 for the system with n recovery this study table 3 the ad is carried out at 38 c with an hrt of 20 days and wet conditions 6 5 the biogas plant works 7500 hours per year i e 313 days a methane calorific value of 10 kwh nm 3 was chosen the power recovery system was estimated to have an efficiency of 30 for electricity the system with n recovery requires extra energy for the recirculation of the acidic solution with an electrical consumption of 13 2 kwh per day molinuevo salces et al 2020 the daily methane production obtained after treating on farm the produced swine manure is 266 nm3 ch4 per day for the ad reactor without n recovery and 278 nm3 ch4 per day for the ad reactor with n recovery these would represent a net electricity production of 795 and 832 kwh day 1 for the ad reactors without and with n recovery respectively thus the difference in the net electricity production between both systems would be 37 kwh per day higher in the ad system with n recovery the system with n recovery would need extra energy 13 2 kwh per day for the recirculation of the acidic solution therefore a positive energy balance 23 8 kwh per day was obtained from ad coupled with n recovery using gpm technology the performance of anaerobic process was also evaluated in terms of ph ratio ia pa and tvfa concentration table 4 no significant differences were found between membrane and reference reactors in these parameters average ph values in both reactors remained in the range of 7 1 7 4 table 4 no significant differences were found between membrane and reference reactors in ia pa ratios for any experimental period and the value of this parameter presented a high variability during each experimental period for these reasons the effect of this parameter on ammonia removal could not be clearly discussed tvfa concentrations were very variable with no significant differences between reactors although lower concentrations of tvfa were detected in membrane reactor exception made for the period i the removal efficiencies of scod and vs were similar in both reactors with no significant differences except for period iib when the membrane reactor had a vs removal of 43 1 in contrast with the reference reactor with a vs removal of 27 2 which implies a better removal efficiency 58 for the membrane reactor table 5 the biogas quality methane percentage was also monitored and the results are shown in table 3 results showed a higher methane content in the membrane reactor with nh3 recovery system than in the reference reactor in all experimental periods more specifically methane content was up to 14 higher in the membrane reactor than in the reference reactor this result obtained with manure agreed with those reported by shi et al 2019 who observed higher methane content in a reactor that combined ad with gpm technology using food wastes compared with a reference reactor without nh3 recovery the highest methane content in biogas was obtained during period i in both reactors 52 for the reference reactor and 56 for the membrane reactor 3 2 3 performance of the n recovery system by coupling a gas permeable membrane system in the membrane reactor ammonia was consistently removed from the reactor and recovered as ammonium sulphate in the acidic solution tan concentration in the acidic solution increased slowly from the start to a value of 2008 mg n l 1 on day 24 and it continued increasing to reach a final value of tan captured of 3525 mg n l 1 on day 205 of the experiment data not shown during the experiment the volume of the acidic solution increased from an initial value of 150 ml to a final value of 3000 ml due to the diffusion of water vapor through the membrane i e osmotic distillation that occurs as a consequence of the differences in vapor pressure between both sides of the membrane the water capture rate was 1 7 l of water per day and per m2 of membrane surface and it led to a continuous dilution of the acidic solution and consequently to a decrease in its tan concentration the difference of temperature between the liquids acidic solution and digestate in both sides of the membranes highly influences on osmotic distillation water capture by the membrane could highly influence on the economy of the process the resultant acidic solution could not present a nitrogen concentration as high as expected being required a further process to concentrate ammonium sulphate and to reduce transportation cost of this fertilizer in addition the design of the n concentration tank that must foresee increasing volume of the acidic solution heating the acidic solution has been proposed as an effective strategy to counteract osmotic distillation allowing the obtention of a higher tan concentration in the acidic solution for its use as fertilizer riaño et al 2019 the ammonium sulphate can be used as fertilizer in its liquid form for fertigation not being necessary to precipitate it for application and thus avoiding the use of extra energy and only being necessary a system of storage and transport for its further use there are two main considerations with regards to the performance of the membrane one is the long term functionality and the other is the specific n removal rate per membrane area regarding the functionality over time a uniform linear r2 0 9744 tan recovery rate by the gas permeable membrane that led to an average mass recovery rate of 6 7 g n m 2 d 1 during the whole experimentation time of 205 days was evidenced regardless of the ammonium loading rate and tan content in membrane reactor experienced during this long run fig 6 this result agreed with those reported by riaño et al 2019 who also obtained a uniform tan recovery rate when treating swine manure using a gas permeable membrane technology in a semi continuous mode for 50 days in contrast shi et al 2019 detected membrane fouling and hydrophobicity loss during ad combined with gpm technology using food waste feedstocks for 146 days it should be highlighted that no cleaning measures were applied on the membrane in the present study regarding the tan recovery rate per membrane area the values obtained in this study 4 8 to 6 6 g n m 2 d 1 were lower than obtained in other studies for instance garcía gonzález et al 2015 obtained an average tan recovery rate of 9 5 g m 2 d 1 when treating raw swine manure with gpm at batch fed mode riaño et al 2019 reported a tan recovery rate of 27 1 g n m 2 d 1 from swine manure using gpm technology at semi continuous fed mode the low tan recovery rate in the present study could be explained by the low ph values in the membrane reactor during the semi continuous experiment the ph is the most critical variable influencing the amount of free nh3 available to pass through the gas permeable membrane therefore it is crucial for tan recovery garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 adjusted the ph of the manure to 8 5 9 0 whenever the ph of the manure decreased below 7 7 using sodium hydroxide riaño et al 2019 were able to obtain a ph of 8 5 during their experiment using aeration as method to increase the ph in the reactor in the present study the values of ph in the membrane reactor were under 8 during the whole experimental period table 4 however it was preferable not to use aeration or alkali addition methods to increase the ph in this study due to the ad operation conditions the mass transfer coefficient km m s 1 has been calculated using eq 2 resulting in values of 1 1 10 6 3 9 10 6 1 5 10 6 and 3 1 10 6 for period i iia iib and iii respectively an average value of 2 2 10 6 m s 1 was obtained these values are comparable to other km values in the range of 1 0 9 2 10 6 m s 1 calculated in other studies using e ptfe membranes for ammonia recovery from livestock manure riaño et al 2019 samani majd and mukhtar 2013 the km coefficient is dependent on membrane morphology including thickness porosity and pore size as well as the flow rate of the acidic solution and it is indepent on the tan concentration in the wastewater samani majd and mukhtar 2013 the results of the present study indicated that gpm technology can successfully perform inside ad reactors with a comparable mass transfer coefficient than that obtained in other gpm reactor configurations 4 conclusions results showed a great potential of gas permeable membrane technology to improve ad of swine manure while recovering ammonia from the digestate in the form of an ammonium salt under different operational conditions by coupling gpm system in the ad digester working under semi continuous operation an increase in the methane yield up to 27 6 on average 16 7 was detected compared to a control treatment in addition higher percentages of methane in biogas up to 14 were found during ad with nh3 recovery tan was recovered and transformed in an ammonun sulphate solution at a uniform rate of 6 7 g n m 2 d 1 therefore the ad

17317,in feedstocks containing high ammonia nh3 concentration removal of the nh3 during the anaerobic digestion ad process can improve ad process performance in the present study the effect of nh3 removal using gas permeable membrane gpm technology on ad process performance and biogas production was investigated using swine manure feedstock batch and semi continuous ad experiments were carried out under mesophilic conditions in the reactor with nh3 recovery total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration was reduced 28 in batch experiments and 23 on average in the semicontinuous experiment compared with the reactor without nh3 recovery free ammonia fa concentrations were also decreased by 23 and 4 on average in batch and semicontinuous experiments respectively these reductions in tan and fa by gpm system positively impacted both the quality and quantity of the biogas produced by ad of swine manure specifically the specific methane yield increased 9 in the batch experiment and 17 on average in the semicontinuous experiment furthermore higher percentages of methane in biogas were obtained during ad retrofitted with gpm system 24 increase in the batch experiment and 11 on average in the semicontinuous experiment range 8 3 13 6 simultaneously a uniform tan recovery rate of 6 7 g n tan per m2 of membrane and per day was obtained for the 205 days of semicontinuous operation ammonia nitrogen was recovered in the form of ammonium sulphate solution therefore the ad gpm configuration produces beneficial results on biogas quantity and quality while recovering ammonia nitrogen in form of ammonium sulphate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion gas permeable membrane ammonia recovery swine manure 1 introduction the amount of entire manure production in the eu27 is about 1 4 billion tonnes amec 2014 anaerobic digestion ad is a powerful strategy to minimize the negative environmental impacts of manure management hijazi et al 2020 ad has been largely studied and it is widely applied for manure treatment in europe the major benefit of ad is the production of renewable energy in the form of methane whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions from manure management grando et al 2017 however ad treatment does not reduce total n concentration in the manure and therefore it does not solve the problem of excesive n in the surplus areas of the eu and similar regions of intensive animal production around the world another problem with ad of manure is the inhibition of methanogens by high ammonia nh3 concentration in these residues that severely reduces the production of biogas angelidaki and ahring 1993 it is suggested that the methanogens inhibition is due to free ammonia fa that can freely permeate microbial cellular membrane chen et al 2008 different approaches have been used to decrease nh3 inhibition of ad due to high ammonia nitrogen concentration 1 through the adaptation of ad microorganisms 2 the co digestion with carbon rich wastes 3 the dilution of the reactor content and 4 the reduction and recovery of total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration from the raw material prior or during the ad process lauterbock et al 2012 methods that reduce tan concentration from ad by recovering it are desirable for economic and environmental reasons darestani et al 2017 romero et al 2016 such approach could not only improve the ad process due to removal of one of the main inhibitors but also transform waste in valuable by products allowing a circular flow of the n cycle robles et al 2020 toopa et al 2017 different methodologies have been recently developed to recover tan in the ad process serna maza et al 2015 reported side stream stripping during ad of domestic food waste using a stripping extraction column that treated the content of the reactor and the biogas the recovery of ammonium with phosphate species from aqueous residues using struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation has been also researched uludag demirer et al 2005 however in livestock wastewater less than 15 of the n contained in the influent could potentially be recovered through struvite because of the very high n to p ratio in these effluents vanotti et al 2017 gas permeable membrane gpm separation has been successfully applied for n recovery from manure before ad and after ad from anaerobically digested effluents garcía gonzález et al 2015a garcía gonzález et al 2015b molinuevo salces et al 2018 riaño et al 2019 vanotti and szogi 2010 vanotti and szogi 2015 in this vein munasinghe arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2020 used a multicriterion analysis to rank five n recovery technologies ammonia stripping ultrafiltration and ion exchange struvite precipitation ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis and gpm separation considering 10 performance criteria giving priority to energy and economic aspects results of this analysis indicated the gpm technology as the preferred option for n recovery from waste streams followed by struvite precipitation similarly beckinghausen et al 2020 indicated gpm technology had lower energy requirements per kg of n recovered 0 22 to 1 2 kwh kgn 1 compared to typical ammonia stripping acid absorption 23 6 to 49 6 kwh kgn 1 in the gpm process gaseous nh3 in manure passes through a hydrophobic gas permeable membrane and is concentrated in an acidic solution circulating on the other side of the membrane the availability of nh3 in the waste where nh3 and nh4 are in equilibrium determines the efficiency of this technology main factors affecting the process are the ph temperature and tan concentration in the livestock waste riaño et al 2019 few studies have investigated the use of gpm systems inside ad reactors to eliminate ammonia inhibition and improve biogas production shi et al 2019 studied the combination of ad with gpm technology using food wastes they found that a reduction of 57 free ammonia fa concentration inside the ad reactor due to n capture by gpm favoured methanogens abundance and increased biogas production by 58 lauterböck et al 2012 also studied the combination of ad with gpm separation using slaughterhouse waste it led to a reduction of 70 fa concentration in the mixed liquor and a higher biogas yield averaging 57 increase compared with a control ad reactor without n recovery the present study also investigated the combination of ad with gpm technology and its effectiveness to relieve ammonia inhibition and improve ad process performance and biogas production but it differs from previous studies in the substrate used swine manure this is another high ammonia strategically important waste requiring solutions the ad gpm experiments with swine manure were conducted using batch and semi continuous operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 origin of manure and inoculum swine manure sm was collected from a finishing farm located in salamanca spain the collected manure was put in plastic containers transported the same day to itacyl laboratory in valladolid spain and stored in the laboratory at 4 c for further use table 1 shows the chemical characteristics of the sm used it contained high concentrations of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 1679 to 3623 mg n l 1 mg l 1 tan 802 to 2078 mg n l 1 and alkalinity 8412 to 12119 mg caco3 l 1 alkalinity is important to sustain n removal by gas permeable membrane process because the n uptake by the gpm acidifies the manure daguerre martini et al 2018 the inoculum used was obtained from an anaerobic digester of the municipal wastewater treatment plant in valladolid spain the inoculum had a concentration of 16 3 g vs volatile solids l 1 2 2 experimental set up two laboratory scale stirred tank ad reactors working volume of 2000 ml were first operated in batch mode 10 days and then in semicontinuous mode 205 days fig 1 reactor r1 was the reference reactor control treatment that provided ad treatment to swine manure without nh3 recovery reactor r2 was the membrane reactor nh3 removal and recovery treatment that provided ad of swine manure coupled with gpm recovery of the nh3 two ports placed on the top of each reactor were used one for influent feeding and effluent withdrawing and the other one for biogas collecting the biogas production was measured daily by displacement of water the temperature of both reactors was kept constant 38 c using a water jacket connected to a temperature controlled water bath the methane volumes were converted to standard temperature and pressure std 0 c and 1 atm the gpm module retrofitted to the ad membrane reactor consisted of 1 a tubular gas permeable membrane submerged in the anaerobic reactor liquid 2 a peristaltic pump and 3 a stripping acidic solution reservoir n concentration tank the tubular gas permeable membrane was made of e ptfe material hydrophobic with a length of 53 cm an outer diameter of 5 2 mm and a wall thickness of 0 56 mm the e ptfe membrane density was 0 95 g cm 3 and the ratio of membrane area exposed to the anaerobic reactor liquid per reactor volume was 0 004 m2 l 1 the peristaltic pump pumpdrive 5001 heidolph schwabach germany continuously recirculated in a closed loop an acidic solution between the inside of the membrane and the n concentration tank fig 1 the acidic solution flow rate was 12 l d 1 the n concentration tank consisted of a 570 ml glass vessel hermetically sealed containing an acidic solution 150 ml of 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 it was replaced with bigger vessels during the experiments to accommodate the increase of the volume of the acidic solution with time as a consequence of the occurrence of osmotic distillation as previously reported by riaño et al 2019 the ph of the acidic solution was monitored daily and whenever the ph reached 2 concentrated h2so4 96 98 panreac was added into the n concentration tank to an endpoint of ph 2 the ph 2 was selected as the upper set point based on vanotti and szogi 2015 that indicated that nh3 recovery in closed loop gpm system is optimized when the ph of the stripping tank solution is kept below 2 2 3 batch experiment an ad batch experiment was carried out for 10 days both ad reactors membrane and reference were fed using the same 1 1 substrate so to inoculum xo ratio expressed as g vs g vs the 1 1 so xo ratio was recommended by molinuevo salces et al 2018 to study the effect of ammonia recovery on anaerobic digestion under stable operation in order to achieve this ratio in anaerobic reactors and due to the different vs concentrations of inoculum and swine manure table 1 the volume of inoculum and substrate swine manure added in each reactor were 1 l and 0 35 l respectively the amounts of vs added from inoculum and swine manure were thus identical 16 3 g vs the addition of water was required to get a final volume of 2 l achieving the desired so xo ratio the reactors were continuously agitated using magnetic stirrers and the mixing speed was kept between 500 and 700 rpm the volume of biogas produced was daily monitored and biogas composition was weekly analysed the specific methane yield was calculated as n ml ch4 produced per g vs added in the substrate initial and final samples of the content of the reactors were taken for tan determination acidic solution samples of 3 ml were daily collected from the n concentration tank and analysed for ph and tan determinations in the batch experiment ph of the stripping solution did not reach 2 and addition of concentrated h2so4 was not needed 2 4 semi continuous experiment the semi continuous experiment was carried out for 205 days both reactors were initially filled with 2 l of inoculum after that manure was added to the reactors once per day every weekday using manual feeding both reactors were fed with the same mixed manure substrate and amount the reactors were continuously agitated with magnetic stirrers in the first stage of the experiment at a mixing speed between 500 and 700 rpm and thereafter they were daily agitated using manual stirring due to the high content of fibers and solids in the manure prior to each feeding event a volume equal to the feeding volume was removed to maintain a constant reactor volume the volume of the membrane reactor was daily checked and any water loss due to osmotic distillation was replenished three different periods i to iii were established for the ad semi continuous experiment based on the organic loading rate olr and the hydraulic retention time hrt the same conditions were applied to both reactors during period i 0 62 days the reactors were operated with hrt 20 days olr 3 7 0 8 g vs l 1 d 1 and feeding rate 100 ml d 1 during period ii 63 128 d the hrt was decreased to 15 days and olr increased to 4 3 4 6 g vs l 1 d 1 with a feeding rate of 133 ml d 1 the composition of manure varied greatly among the two different batches received during period ii as a result of swine manure production table 1 for this reason period ii was separated in the data analysis into period iia with a high ratio total volatile acids tvfa soluble chemichal demand scod of 0 64 and low ammonia content and period iib with a low ratio tvfa scod ratio of 0 18 and high ammonia content table 1 the olr was similar 4 6 0 4 and 4 3 0 4 g vs l 1d 1 for periods iia and iib respectively during period iii 129 205 d hrt was increased back to 20 days

twice a week and analysed for total alkalinity ta partial alkalinity pa total solids ts vs tvfa scod tan and tkn within each period data collected after one hrt were used for average calculations of ad process parameters acidic solution samples of 3 ml were daily collected from the n concentration tank to monitor ph and tan to maintain the ph under 2 concentrated h2so4 was added in the acidic solution whenever it was needed a total volume of 102 ml of acid was used 10 ml in period i 12 ml in period iia 20 ml in period iib and 60 ml in period iii the volume of the acidic solution was also daily measured in order to calculate the mass of tan recovered by the gpm system in the membrane reactor 2 5 analytical methods and statistical analysis analyses of scod ts vs tan tkn and tvfa were performed in duplicate in accordance with apha 2005 for the analysis of scod a closed reflux colorimetric method was used ts content was determined by drying the sample to a constant weight at 103 105 c the ts residue was ignited at 550 c to constant weight and the weight lost on ignition was the vs content tan was measured according to the distillation and titration method tkn was measured according to the kjeldahl digestion distillation and titration method both tan and tkn concentrations are expressed in n units the volatile fatty acids concentrations acetate propionate butyrate iso butyrate valerate iso valerate and caproate were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa equipped with a teknokroma trb ffap column of 30 m length and 0 25 mm i d followed by a flame ionization detector fid the carrier gas was helium 1 ml min 1 the temperature of the detector and the injector was 280 c the temperature of the oven was set at 100 c for 4 min then increased to 155 c for 2 min and thereafter increased to 210 c tvfa were calculated as the sum of those acids concentration after applying the cod conversion factor to measure total and partial alkalinity ta pa a ph meter crison basic 20 crison instruments s a barcelona spain was used ta and pa were obtained by measuring the amount of 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 needed to bring the sample to a ph of 4 3 and 5 75 respectively and expressed as mg caco3 l 1 intermediate alkalinity ia was calculated by subtracting pa from ta the optimal ia pa ratio would be of 0 3 ripley et al 1986 biogas composition was analysed using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa with a thermal conductivity detector provided by a hp plot column 30 m 0 53 mm 40 μm followed by a hp molesieve column 30 m 0 53 mm 50 μm the carrier gas

free ammonia fa was calculated as un ionized ammonia using the equation of hansen et al 1998 eq 1 1 n h 3 tn h 3 1 10 p h 10 0 09018 2729 92 t 1 where nh3 was the fa content tnh3 is the total nh3 concentration t was the manure reactor temperature in kelvin and ph was measured in the effluent resistances against nh3 gas diffusion by the membrane structure and pores is defined by the km value samani majd and mukhtar 2013 the mass transfer coefficient km m d 1 was calculated using eq 2 samani majd and mukhtar 2013 2 j k m c 1 c 2 where j is the mass flux per area g m 2 d 1 and c1 and c2 are the fa concentrations in the membrane reactor and in the n concentration tank respectively c2 was assumed to be zero for calculations since ph of the acidic solution was maintained below 2 during the whole experiment and consequently fa concentration was zero results obtained were analysed using one way analysis of variance anova with significance at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch ad experiment at the beginning of the ad experiment tan concentration in both reactors was 1166 mg n l 1 by coupling a gpm system to the anaerobic reactor tan was consistently removed from the membrane reactor and recovered as nh4 2so4 in the acidic solution up to 548 mg n at day 10 fig 2 the slope present in fig 2 leads to a rate of tan captured of 50 2 mg n per day in terms of membrane area the tan recovery rate obtained was 5 8 g n m 2 d 1 tan concentration in the acidic solution increased to 1227 mg l 1 at day10 after 10 days the membrane reactor had a lower concentration of tan compared with the reference 749 16 mg n l 1 vs 1033 27 mg n l 1 which implied a reduction of 28 similarly a reduction of fa concentration of 23 was evidenced in the membrane reactor when comparing with the reference reactor 121 mg l 1 vs 157 mg l 1 the ph in the membrane reactor after 10 days was 8 05 the reductions in tan and fa by gpm impacted the biogas quantity and quality the accumulated specific methane yields expressed as nml ch4 produced per gram of vs added in the substrate are presented in fig 3 specific methane yield for the membrane reactor with nh3 recovery was 9 higher compared to the reference reactor without nh3 recovery more specifically the membrane reactor presented a methane yield of 70 nml ch4 g vs 1 compared with a yield of 64 nml ch4 g vs 1 by the reference reactor furthermore the biogas obtained in the membrane reactor had a higher percentage of ch4 78 compared to the reference reactor 63 the results of this batch experiment confirmed that the ad gpm combination can produce beneficial results on both the biogas quantity and quality using swine manure feedstocks 3 2 semi continuous ad experiment 3 2 1 ammonia concentration in the reactors semi continuous reactors membrane and reference reactors were operated for 205 days through three periods the continuous ammonia capture by the gas permeable system in the membrane reactor worked well and throughout the experiment thus tan in the membrane reactor was lower than in the reference reactor during the whole experimental period fig 4 maximum tan concentration in the reference reactor was 2040 mg n l 1 whereas in the membrane reactor was 1666 mg n l 1 tan concentration in the membrane reactor with an active ammonia capture system was reduced by 23 range 19 33 compared to the reference reactor without tan recovery table 2 free ammonia concentrations in the membrane reactor were also lower than those obtained in the reference reactor table 2 a reduction of fa concentration up to 54 was detected in the membrane reactor compared with the reference reactor inhibitory concentrations for methanogenic microorganisms range between 1500 and 7000 mg l 1 for tan and between 53 and 1450 mg l 1 for fa shi et al 2019 yenigün and demirel 2013 in the present study the recovery of nh3 in the membrane reactor allowed mantaining tan and fa concentrations below these reported inhibition levels for most of the experimental time 3 2 2 influence of nh3 recovery on methane yield and biogas composition the reactors were semi continuously operated for 205 days through three periods under different olr and hrt fig 5 shows the daily methane yields for both reactors during the whole study the average methane produced average specific methane yield and average methane content for each reactor in each experimental period are listed in table 3 both the daily methane produced and the specific methane yield obtained were higher in the membrane reactor compared with that obtained in the reference reactor in all the studied conditions fig 5 table 3 the specific methane yield is one of the most relevant process performance parameters in ad due to its direct relation with the economic efficiency of the process regarding period i average specific methane yield for the membrane reactor with nh3 recovery was significantly higher p 0 05 than for the reference reactor accounting for 138 27 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 and 126 21 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 respectively a decrease in the hrt from 20 to 15 days in period iia resulted in a reduction in methane yield to values of 125 15 and 98 13 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for the membrane reactor and the reference reactor respectively fig 5 table 3 significant differences p 0 03 were found between reactors where the membrane reactor presented a higher methane production than the reference reactor although a drastic drop in methane production occurred in period iib with an average methane of 24 10 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for membrane reactor and 22 11 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for reference reactor the reduction in methane production was no related with the performance of the gpm system because the reduction affected both membrane and reference reactors this reduction was due to a new batch of sm influent with a different composition than in period iia table 1 in period iia manure presented a tvfa scod ratio of 0 64 and it decreased to 0 18 in period iib leading to a reduction in biodegradability period iia showed a considerable higher methane production and stable operation than period iib working at the same hrt 15 days and olr 4 4 4 5 g vs l 1 d 1 thus in this study the reduction in methane yield from period iia to period iib was not due to the low hrt and subsequent low srt inside the reactor this result was in agreement with that obtained by bayrakdar et al 2018 who also experienced sudden and unexpected changes in methane production during ad of chicken manure when the manure batch was changed from day 129 in the period iii the hrt was increased again to the previous value in period i of 20 days to try to recover the anaerobic process from this point methane production gradually increased in both reactors fig 5 achieving an average methane yield of 81 37 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for membrane reactor and 66 28 nml ch4 g vs 1 d 1 for reference reactor thus methane yield was 1 2 fold higher in the membrane reactor than in the reference reactor with a similar behaviour than that obtained in period i and period iia as an overall the methane produced and the specific methane yield increased 17 higher range 10 28 on average in the membrane reactor than in the reference reactor these results are in accordance with those found in literature who indicated that the combination of ad with gpm could increase methane yield by 13 129 depending on operational conditions and digested feedstocks lauterböck et al 2012 shi et al 2019 an evaluation of the ad with and without n recovery on the basis of energy was carried out to assess if the improvements reported here in terms of methane volume and methane composition are justified in relation to the extra energy expended in acid recirculation in the gpm process the calculations are based on a biogas plant for a medium size pig farm with 2800 sows and an annual manure production of 17136 m3 6 12 m3 of manure per saw per year and the following conditions a methane yield of 75 3 nml g vs 1 for the system without n recovery and 88 3 nml g vs 1 for the system with n recovery this study table 3 the ad is carried out at 38 c with an hrt of 20 days and wet conditions 6 5 the biogas plant works 7500 hours per year i e 313 days a methane calorific value of 10 kwh nm 3 was chosen the power recovery system was estimated to have an efficiency of 30 for electricity the system with n recovery requires extra energy for the recirculation of the acidic solution with an electrical consumption of 13 2 kwh per day molinuevo salces et al 2020 the daily methane production obtained after treating on farm the produced swine manure is 266 nm3 ch4 per day for the ad reactor without n recovery and 278 nm3 ch4 per day for the ad reactor with n recovery these would represent a net electricity production of 795 and 832 kwh day 1 for the ad reactors without and with n recovery respectively thus the difference in the net electricity production between both systems would be 37 kwh per day higher in the ad system with n recovery the system with n recovery would need extra energy 13 2 kwh per day for the recirculation of the acidic solution therefore a positive energy balance 23 8 kwh per day was obtained from ad coupled with n recovery using gpm technology the performance of anaerobic process was also evaluated in terms of ph ratio ia pa and tvfa concentration table 4 no significant differences were found between membrane and reference reactors in these parameters average ph values in both reactors remained in the range of 7 1 7 4 table 4 no significant differences were found between membrane and reference reactors in ia pa ratios for any experimental period and the value of this parameter presented a high variability during each experimental period for these reasons the effect of this parameter on ammonia removal could not be clearly discussed tvfa concentrations were very variable with no significant differences between reactors although lower concentrations of tvfa were detected in membrane reactor exception made for the period i the removal efficiencies of scod and vs were similar in both reactors with no significant differences except for period iib when the membrane reactor had a vs removal of 43 1 in contrast with the reference reactor with a vs removal of 27 2 which implies a better removal efficiency 58 for the membrane reactor table 5 the biogas quality methane percentage was also monitored and the results are shown in table 3 results showed a higher methane content in the membrane reactor with nh3 recovery system than in the reference reactor in all experimental periods more specifically methane content was up to 14 higher in the membrane reactor than in the reference reactor this result obtained with manure agreed with those reported by shi et al 2019 who observed higher methane content in a reactor that combined ad with gpm technology using food wastes compared with a reference reactor without nh3 recovery the highest methane content in biogas was obtained during period i in both reactors 52 for the reference reactor and 56 for the membrane reactor 3 2 3 performance of the n recovery system by coupling a gas permeable membrane system in the membrane reactor ammonia was consistently removed from the reactor and recovered as ammonium sulphate in the acidic solution tan concentration in the acidic solution increased slowly from the start to a value of 2008 mg n l 1 on day 24 and it continued increasing to reach a final value of tan captured of 3525 mg n l 1 on day 205 of the experiment data not shown during the experiment the volume of the acidic solution increased from an initial value of 150 ml to a final value of 3000 ml due to the diffusion of water vapor through the membrane i e osmotic distillation that occurs as a consequence of the differences in vapor pressure between both sides of the membrane the water capture rate was 1 7 l of water per day and per m2 of membrane surface and it led to a continuous dilution of the acidic solution and consequently to a decrease in its tan concentration the difference of temperature between the liquids acidic solution and digestate in both sides of the membranes highly influences on osmotic distillation water capture by the membrane could highly influence on the economy of the process the resultant acidic solution could not present a nitrogen concentration as high as expected being required a further process to concentrate ammonium sulphate and to reduce transportation cost of this fertilizer in addition the design of the n concentration tank that must foresee increasing volume of the acidic solution heating the acidic solution has been proposed as an effective strategy to counteract osmotic distillation allowing the obtention of a higher tan concentration in the acidic solution for its use as fertilizer riaño et al 2019 the ammonium sulphate can be used as fertilizer in its liquid form for fertigation not being necessary to precipitate it for application and thus avoiding the use of extra energy and only being necessary a system of storage and transport for its further use there are two main considerations with regards to the performance of the membrane one is the long term functionality and the other is the specific n removal rate per membrane area regarding the functionality over time a uniform linear r2 0 9744 tan recovery rate by the gas permeable membrane that led to an average mass recovery rate of 6 7 g n m 2 d 1 during the whole experimentation time of 205 days was evidenced regardless of the ammonium loading rate and tan content in membrane reactor experienced during this long run fig 6 this result agreed with those reported by riaño et al 2019 who also obtained a uniform tan recovery rate when treating swine manure using a gas permeable membrane technology in a semi continuous mode for 50 days in contrast shi et al 2019 detected membrane fouling and hydrophobicity loss during ad combined with gpm technology using food waste feedstocks for 146 days it should be highlighted that no cleaning measures were applied on the membrane in the present study regarding the tan recovery rate per membrane area the values obtained in this study 4 8 to 6 6 g n m 2 d 1 were lower than obtained in other studies for instance garcía gonzález et al 2015 obtained an average tan recovery rate of 9 5 g m 2 d 1 when treating raw swine manure with gpm at batch fed mode riaño et al 2019 reported a tan recovery rate of 27 1 g n m 2 d 1 from swine manure using gpm technology at semi continuous fed mode the low tan recovery rate in the present study could be explained by the low ph values in the membrane reactor during the semi continuous experiment the ph is the most critical variable influencing the amount of free nh3 available to pass through the gas permeable membrane therefore it is crucial for tan recovery garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 adjusted the ph of the manure to 8 5 9 0 whenever the ph of the manure decreased below 7 7 using sodium hydroxide riaño et al 2019 were able to obtain a ph of 8 5 during their experiment using aeration as method to increase the ph in the reactor in the present study the values of ph in the membrane reactor were under 8 during the whole experimental period table 4 however it was preferable not to use aeration or alkali addition methods to increase the ph in this study due to the ad operation conditions the mass transfer coefficient km m s 1 has been calculated using eq 2 resulting in values of 1 1 10 6 3 9 10 6 1 5 10 6 and 3 1 10 6 for period i iia iib and iii respectively an average value of 2 2 10 6 m s 1 was obtained these values are comparable to other km values in the range of 1 0 9 2 10 6 m s 1 calculated in other studies using e ptfe membranes for ammonia recovery from livestock manure riaño et al 2019 samani majd and mukhtar 2013 the km coefficient is dependent on membrane morphology including thickness porosity and pore size as well as the flow rate of the acidic solution and it is indepent on the tan concentration in the wastewater samani majd and mukhtar 2013 the results of the present study indicated that gpm technology can successfully perform inside ad reactors with a comparable mass transfer coefficient than that obtained in other gpm reactor configurations 4 conclusions results showed a great potential of gas permeable membrane technology to improve ad of swine manure while recovering ammonia from the digestate in the form of an ammonium salt under different operational conditions by coupling gpm system in the ad digester working under semi continuous operation an increase in the methane yield up to 27 6 on average 16 7 was detected compared to a control treatment in addition higher percentages of methane in biogas up to 14 were found during ad with nh3 recovery tan was recovered and transformed in an ammonun sulphate solution at a uniform rate of 6 7 g n m 2 d 1 therefore the ad gpm configuration produces beneficial results on both biogas quantity and quality while also recovering ammonia nitrogen in marketable ammonium sulphate declaration of competing interest the authors

17318,this study for the first time investigated the advanced treatment of bio treated landfill leachate effluent using a novel reactive electrochemical membrane rem technology at the laboratory and pilot scales at the laboratory scale ruo2 ir rem ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem featured similar properties in pore size and water flux although ruo2 ir rem holds more reactive sites than the other two rems β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem featured higher oxidation ability than ruo2 ir rem causing their high yield of hydroxyl radical consequently β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem performed better than ruo2 ir rem which removed total organic carbon and ammonia nitrogen by 70 76 and 100 respectively after 45 minutes of treatment fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed that humic acid like substances were oxidized by the rem treatment using the β pbo2 rem in the lab scale setup with the solutions circulated we observed a greater removal of chemical oxygen demand cod at a higher applied current or a faster water flux the pilot system with four large size of β pbo2 rems modules in series was developed based on the lab scale setup which steadily treated landfill leachate in compliance with the disposal regulations of china at an energy consumption of 3 6 kwh m3 also a single pass rem can effectively prevent the transformation of chloride to chlorate and perchlorate our study showed rem technology is a powerful and promising process for the advanced treatment of landfill leachate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive electrochemical membrane bio treated landfill leachate pilot scale advanced treatment energy efficient 1 introduction sanitary landfill is widely used for the disposal of urban solid waste around the world due to its simplicity and economic advantages yao p 2017 one of the main disadvantages of this practice is the formation of landfill leachate that has a complex composition and contains toxic or bio refractory compounds e g ammonia heavy metals organic halogens and humic and fulvic acids fernandes et al 2015 yao p 2017 mandal et al 2017 direct discharge of landfill leachate without proper treatment can result in serious pollution of soil groundwater surface water and nearby air because of its complex recalcitrant and varied composition efficient treatment of landfill leachate remains a major challenge to date mandal et al 2017 fernandes et al 2015 biological treatment followed by membrane processes and advanced oxidation processes aops has been tested effective in treating landfill leachate moraes et al 2005 omar et al 2015 kamaruddin et al 2017 however this treatment train is expensive due to the high mechanical pressure used in nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro moreover leachate concentrate is challenging to be treated feng et al 2020 recently electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop is a promising technology to replace nf ro for the advanced treatment of bio treated landfill leachate and it exhibited high efficiency in removing organic matters color and ammonia anglada et al 2009 2010 fernandes et al 2015 mandal et al 2017 ukundimana et al 2018 asaithambi et al 2020 anglada et al 2010 achieved an 83 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod initial 860 mg l from a bio treated landfill leachate effluent using boron doped diamond bdd operated in flow by mode at a pilot scale plant a recent study by feng et al 2020 showed that eaops can effectively increase the biodegradability of pre treated leachate and achieve simultaneous removal of ammonia and cod the electrochemical mineralization of contaminants usually occurs in a narrow zone 1 μm on the electrode surface chaplin b p 2014 until now the eaop treatment of landfill leachate is mostly operated in batch and flow by modes because of the slow interphase mass transferfor contaminants from the bulk solution to the reaction zone on the anode surface the overall efficiency of eaop systems is restricted and the complete mineralization of organic matters requires high energy consumption fernandes et al 2015 mandal et al 2017 kateb et al 2019 to address the mass transfer limitations a reactive electrochemical membrane rem technology operated in flow through mode was developed based on porous electrode materials chaplin b p 2014 mameda et al 2018 the rem electrode is a three dimensional material containing a large specific surface area with abundant reactive sites for electrochemical reactions moreover the inner pores in rem electrodes minimize the thickness of the boundary layer thus greatly enhancing the mass transfer rate of

comprehensive study of applying rem to the treatment of bio treated landfill leachate effluent at both laboratory and pilot scales three electrochemical devices including one lab scale unit and two pilot systems were built and tested three macro porous rems ruo2 ir rem ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem were chosen as the flow through porous anodes because they can be prepared in large sizes and feature good stability and reactivity first the three rems were characterized and their efficiency in removing organic matters ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen and toxicity of bio treated landfill leachate was analyzed and compared using the lab scale unit second we explored the mechanism of organic oxidation for the three different rems fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy were employed to analyze the conversion of organic components during rem treatment the effects of operating factors including applied current density and water flux on the removal of cod and nh4 n were also examined using the lab scale unit lastly the pilot systems were developed based on the scaling up of the lab scale unit and its removal efficiency of cod and nh4 n was tested the feasibility of applying rem in practical leachate treatment was assessed by monitoring the removal of toxic heavy metals and the formation of toxic chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 by analyzing the energy consumption and investment cost and by discussing the fouling issues 2 method and materials 2 1 landfill leachate characterization the landfill leachate was collected from a municipal landfill site in dongguan guangdong province china the city of dongguan is one of the world s manufacturing centers generating a huge amount of municipal and industrial solid wastes every day a bio treated landfill leachate effluent after anaerobic process and membrane bioreactor mbr was collected and its water characteristics are shown in table 1 the major water quality indicators such as cod and total nitrogen tn of the leachate samples greatly exceeded the disposal regulations of china for instance the cod was 212 283 mg l while the regulation of cod is less than 100 mg l additionally the landfill leachate features a high concentration of chloride ion of 1 2 1 3 g l and high conductivity of 8 3 ms cm table 1 2 2 rem electrodes fabrication all three rem electrodes were prepared on porous titanium with a median pore diameter of 50 μm as the substrate both ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem were prepared by two steps firstly the load of sno2 sb as an intermediate layer on ti tubular filter by sol gel method and then the load of ti4o7 or β pbo2 on sno2 sb intermediate layer as the catalytic layer details concerning the preparation of β pbo2 rem have been reported in our previous studies lin et al 2011 yang et

lin et al 2018 the ruo2 ir rem synthesized by a sol gel method was obtained from yunxuan metal material co ltd china 2 3 rem electrodes characterization the surface morphology and the crystalline phases of the rem electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan and x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max 3c japan the pore size distributions of the electrodes were characterized by mercury porosimetry autopore iv 9500 micromeritics linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry of the rem electrodes was carried out in conventional three electrode electrochemical cells driven by an auto lab m204 electrochemical workstation metrohm netherlands with a platinum foil 3cm 3 cm and ag agcl 0 22 v vs she as the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively the values of oxygen evolution potential oep of the three rems were estimated from linear sweep voltammetry using slope extension method tafel region meng et al 2019 the electrolyte solution is 0 5 m na2so4 water permeation of the rem electrodes was calculated according to the different water fluxes upon their corresponding pressure in flow through mode high concentrations of model probes including fe cn 6 4 and salicylic acid sa were used to assess the reactivity of the rem electrodes experiments with 20 mm k4fe cn 6 were conducted using the lab scale rem in a single pass filtration mode without circulating at a water flux of 10 m3 m2 h an applied current of 9 3 214 a cm2 was applied and regulated during the experiments similarly the oxidation experiments of salicylic acid 5 mm sa were performed to estimate the oh yield of rems yang et al 2020 2 4 lab scale rem experiments rem electrodes with the outer and inner diameters of 35 mm and 29 mm respectively and a length of 50 mm were used in the lab scale rem unit figure s1 unless otherwise specified the experiments for the lab scale rem unit were performed using a closed loop operation at room temperature 25 1 c the leachate was continuously flowed through the rem unit and recirculated for each experiment 800 ml of leachate sample was used all ruo2 ir rem ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem were tested the effects of applied current 50 400 a m2 and water flux 2 0 10 m3 m2 h were investigated 2 5 pilot scale rem experiments the schematic of the pilot scale rem module is shown in figure s2 which is designed as dead end filtration and all water entering the module exits as permeate only β pbo2 rem was used due to its best performance in removing cod and nh4 n a large β pbo2 rem was fabricated with outer and inner diameters of 60 mm and 54 mm respectively and a length of 500 mm the stainless steel perforated tube outer diameter 10 mm and length 500 mm and the stainless steel tube inner diameter 80 mm and length 500 mm were used as the inner cathode and the outer cathode respectively the inner cathode was also the water inlet that uniformly distributes water the setup of the pilot rem system no 1 is shown in figure s3 which comprises a single β pbo2 rem model this system has been used in experiments to evaluate the stability of the pilot rem in pollutant removal for each experiment 45 l sample was pumped through the system no 1 and recirculated at the flux of 5 m3 m2 h 7 5 l min in a closed loop operation at room temperature 25 1 c and a constant current density at 150 a m2 was applied using a dh1798 dc power 80v 60a the pilot rem system no 2 comprising a system of four pilot rem modules in series is shown in figure s4 the details of the system are described in text s1 briefly the electrochemical oxidation unit consists of four identical pilot rem modules connected in series the rem modules are powered in parallel to ensure that the current applied to each rem module is consistent and the influent pressure was controlled and monitored experiments were conducted in a single pass filtration mode and a sample of 300 370 l was treated in each experiment without circulating triplicate experiments were conducted at the applied current of 150 220 or 320 a m2 and the effluent water quality was continuously analyzed by every 5 minutes the experiments started with 10 minutes of stabilization without applied current afterward the procedure is different depending on the applied current for the experiment at 150 a m2 three water fluxes 5 3 5 and 2 m3 m2 h were tested successively one by one at each water flux the test was conducted for 30 minutes to obtain a stabilized effluent quality for the other two experiments at high current densities of 220 and 320 a m2 water fluxes of 3 5 5 and 5 m3 m2 h were tested respectively cod removal rates r cod g h were calculated by eq 1 1 r cod cod influent cod effluent q where codinfluent g l and codeffluent g l are the cod concentrations of landfill leachate at influent and effluent respectively and q l h is the water flow the hydraulic retention time t hr s of the pilot rem system no 2 can be calculated by eq 2 2 t hr 4 d j where 4 is the number of the rem modules in series j m s is the water flux and d m is the thickness of a single rem anode 3 mm 2 6 current efficiency and energy consumption

spectroscopy briefly total organic carbon toc and tn concentrations were measured by a multi n c uv toc analyzer analytic jena germany using a catalytic combustion method at 800 c chinese national standard methods for the examination of wastewater were used to determine the cod values the concentrations of nh4 mg2 ca2 cl no3 no2 clo3 and clo4 were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher icap rq was employed to determine the concentration of toxic heavy metals including cu ni cr cd as and pb the change of organic matters after treatment was investigated using uv vis spectrum inesa l5s china and excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy analysis horiba fluoromax 4 japan the light emission of the luminescent bacterium v qinghaiensis was measured using aportable water toxicity analyzer hach ecloxtm usa to determine the toxicity of the bio treated landfill leachate samples before and after treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different rems in treating the bio treated landfill leachate effluent 3 1 1 characterization of rems xrd results as shown in figure s5 confirmed that the electrocatalysts β pbo2 ti4o7 and ruo2 ir were successfully loaded in β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem respectively with the loading mass of 1400 600 and 21 1 g m2 physical properties of three rems were characterized using sem mercury intrusion porosimetry and water flux test to evaluate thematerial morphology pore size distribution and water permeability rate respectively sem images showed that all β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem feature the porous structure and the aperture size fig 1 which allow them to be operated in a filtration mode in electrochemical treatment of wastewaters similar inner pore diameter distribution 30 60 μm porosity 32 34 and median pore size 42 49 μm were observed among these three different rems fig 2 a indicating that a large internal surface area is available for electrochemical reaction natural colloidal particles and suspended particles are widely present in real wastewater moreover soluble chemicals such as organic matter and metallic ions i e ca2 mg2 al3 and fe3 can also be transformed to insoluble particles through redox reactions in an electrochemical system the large pore size of the three rems helps prevent its surface fouling caused by trapped particles in addition the large pore size and high porosity also help increase water flux and reduce operating pressure as shown in fig 2b the water permeation rate of β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem was determined to be 19 21 and 22 m3 m2 h bar at 0 1 bar respectively dozens to thousand times of the other reported rems yang et al 2020 as a result all three rems fabricated in this study are practical for leachate treatment at a high water treatment capacity under a low pressure it should be noted that water penetration performance of rems will decrease when the current is applied which is caused by the gas produced from water splitting fig 2b oxygen evolution potential oep a parameter indicating the electrochemical oxidation property of electrodes was obtained for the rems using linear sweep voltammetry as shown in fig 2c β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem exhibited high oep at 2 0 and 2 2 v vs she respectively followed by ruo2 ir rem with oep at 1 58v vs she and the values are well concordance with other literature chen g h 2004 because the oxidation potential of most organic contaminants is lower than 1 9 vvs she weinberg and weinberg 1968 the high oep of β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem suggest that they are more powerful than ruo2 ir rem to completely mineralize refractory organic contaminants moreover the standard reduction potentials of reactive oxygen species ross such as hydroxyl radical oh and other powerful oxidative species are lower than or similar to the oep of β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem fig 2c suggesting that these rems feature a high ability to generate the powerful ross 3 1 2 removal of organic matters total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen based on the lab scale experiments β pbo2 rem exhibited better performance than ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem fig 3 fig 3a shows that the cod removal using β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem followed pseudo first decay kinetics the decay rate constant of cod for β pbo2 rem was 0 035 min 1 1 2 and 1 8 times higher than those of ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem respectively after 45 minutes β pbo2 rem mineralized 76 2 of toc better than ti4o7 rem 69 6 and ruo2 ir rem 46 3 fig 3b although the ruo2 ir electrode is the most commonly used dimensionally stable anode dsa it has a low oep and thus a weak oxidization power as shown in fig 2c therefore ruo2 ir exhibited poor ability in mineralizing refractory contaminants chen g h 2004 panizza et al 2009 the non active anodes such as doped sno2 β pbo2 ti4o7 and bdd electrodes with strong oxidation ability are more suitable than ruo2 ir for degrading persistent organic pollutants chen g h 2004 panizza et al 2009 these results indicated that β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem are more energy efficient than ruo2 ir rem to remove organics the three rems behaved similarly in removing nitrogen contaminants as shown in fig 3b nh4 n was completely removed after 45 min electrolysis while tn was removed at low extents by 36 7 3 4 38 2 4 9 and 33 4 2 respectively for β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem it is known that nh4 n oxidation may occur in an electrochemical process via indirect oxidation by active chlorine reaction 1 rather than anode direct oxidation or indirect oxidation by oh cabeza et al 2007 anglada et al 2009 reaction 1 3clo 2nh4 n2 2h 3cl 3h2o reaction 2 cl h2o 2e 2h clo the active chlorine can be produced in a large amount by a chlorine evolution reaction reaction 2 then chlorine can diffuse to the bulk solution to react with nh4 due to its long lifetime thus the rapid oxidation of nh4 n in our study can be attributed to the high concentration of cl 1 2 1 3 g l and the high reaction rate between active chlorine and nh4 cabeza et al 2007 anglada et al 2009 the low removal of tn might be because that the nitrogen in the bio treated landfill leachate effluent is mainly present in the forms of nitrate and nitrite table 1 that cannot be reduced by the stainless steel cathode this is consistent with the findings from previous studies pérez g 2012 fernandes a 2016 that reported the removal of tn in landfill leachate was mainly achieved by the transformation of ammonia to nitrogen through reaction 1 in an electrochemical system for future study it is necessary to further improve the efficiency of nitrate and nitrite removal likely by using a special cathode material with high electrocatalytic reduction activity 3 1 3 evaluation of toxicity toxicity of untreated and treated landfill leachate was assessed by the inhibition of photobacteria fluorescence fig 3c shows that the bio treated landfill leachate effluent was highly biotoxic with an inhibition as high as 78 4 this result is consistent with a recent finding by feng et al 2020 that bio pretreated ultrafiltration landfill leachate effluent mainly contains toxic and non biodegradable organics with a very low bod cod ratio of 0 03 after rem treatment the photobacteria fluorescence inhibition decreased to 10 8 by β pbo2 rem suggesting that the biotoxic components in the bio treated landfill leachate effluent were effectively removed the detoxification efficiency of ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem was lower than that of β pbo2 rem with the inhibition of 15 1 and 31 2 respectively 3 2 mechanisms of organic matter removal by rem treatment 3 2 1 direct oxidation and oh mediated indirect oxidation the main reaction mechanisms reactions 3 5 for organic matters oxidation in an electrochemical system include direct oxidation by direct electron transfer det at the anode and indirect oxidation by ross most likely oh panizza et al 2009 reaction 3 contaminants ne products reaction 4 h2o e h oh reaction 5 contaminants oh products the reactive sites in anodes can directly oxidize organic contaminants or react with water to generate oh to evaluate the roles of direct oxidation and indirect oxidation by oh in different rems we first used fe cn 6 4 as a probe to estimate the total reactive sites that are available for both organic oxidation and oh generation then salicylic acid sa was selected as a oh probe to assess oh generation liang et al 2018 i e the amount of sites generating oh the details of these two probes and the calculation of reaction rates are described in text s3 fig 4 a shows that the maximum oxidation rate of fe cn 6 4 k fe cn 6 4 mol cm2 min was approximately 11 5 10 6 8 5 10 6 and 7 5 10 6 mol cm2 min for ruo2 ir rem β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem respectively suggesting that ruo2 ir rem has the highest limiting current j limit for the oxidation of fe cn 6 4 the decrease of k fe cn 6 4 at the high current density could be attributed to that water splitting generated bubbles that blocked reactive sites zaky et al 2013 yang et al 2020 the limiting current of an electrochemical system depends on the mass transfer coefficient k f m s electroactive area i e total reactive sites and the concentration of the target compound chaplin et al 2013 meng et al 2019 5 j l i m i t z f c b a i k f where z is the number of electron transfer f 96485 c mol is the faraday s constant c b mol l is the bulk concentration of the target compound and a i m2 is the electroactive area the k f values are assumed to be the same of three rems because the three rems have similar pore size and are under the same hydrodynamic conditions therefore the reason for the highest direct oxidation of fe cn 6 4 for ruo2 ir rem is that it featured more reactive sites than the other two rems which was suggested by its smaller ruo2 ir particles as shown in sem images fig 1 the cyclic voltammetry tests also supported that the ruo2 ir rem has a larger electroactive area than β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem figure s6 it should also be noted that the reactive sites for fe cn 6 4 oxidation are the total available oxidation sites which include weak oxidation sites that are unable to oxidize the target organic contaminants in landfill leachate especially compounds requiring much higher oxidation potential than fe cn 6 4 as for the oxidation by oh β pbo2 rem exhibited the highest oh yield of 14 10 8mol cm2 min among the three rems at 215 a m2 fig 4b which was 5 and 23 times greater than those of ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem respectively these results suggested that the reactive sites in β pbo2 rem are more powerful to generate oh than ruo2 ir rem which features the most abundant reactive sites observed from k4fe cn 6 oxidation these results are consistent with the findings observed in previous studies martínez huitle and ferro 2006 bejan et al 2012 1 the oh yield of ti4o7 is insufficient compared with pbo2 and 2 ruo2 ir is ineffective in oh generation the role of direct and indirect oxidation in the rem treatment of landfill leachate was dependent on the electrochemical properties of these three rems for ruo2 ir rem that features low oh generation ability its performance in removing organics fig 3 is potentially caused by direct oxidation moreover ruo2 ir rem exhibited a relatively high toc removal 46 3 compared with plate ruo2 electrode 20 in treating bio treated landfill leachate after the same time and at the similar applied current luu 2020 generally direct oxidation is ineffective in mineralizing organics xie et al 2020 this high toc removal is likely due to the enhancement of direct electron transfer by the high water flux in the flow through mode zaky et al 2013 xie et al 2020 for β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem they exhibited better performance in removing organics than ruo2 ir rem fig 3a which is inconsistent with their relative total reactive sites fig 4a these two rems feature a much higher oh generation rate than ruo2 ir rem fig 4b hence indirect oxidation by oh may play a key role in oxidizing organics for these two rems comparison between β pbo2 rem and ruo2 ir rem also shows that the 23 times higher oh yield for β pbo2 rem only resulted in a 1 8 times greater decay rate of cod one of the possible reasons is that oh can be quenched by other constituents which inhibited the oh mediated indirect oxidation process for example chloride in landfill leachate can react with oh through the following pathway liao et al 2001 reaction 6 cl oh cl oh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 therefore it could be concluded that the oxidation mechanisms of organics for the three rems are dependent on their electrochemical properties and water qualities 3 2 2 change in excitation emission matrix and uv vis absorbance by rem treatment humic substances including humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa are the major compounds of the refractory organics present in landfill leachate wang et al 2014 because both ha and fa feature strong fluorescent signals hao et al 2012 excitation emission matrix eem has been widely used to characterize organic matters in landfill leachate samples ding et al 2018 lee and hur 2016 li et al 2013 accordingly fluorescence spectroscopy of leachate samples before and after treatment using β pbo2 rem was analyzed to provide the mechanistic insights of dissolved organic matter dom removal the fluorescence eem spectra at different ex em regions that represent different dom types chen et al 2003 1 aromatic proteins region e g tyrosine and tryptophan at ex em of 250 nm 380 nm 2 fulvic acid like region at ex em of 250 nm 380 nm 3 soluble microbial byproduct like region at ex em of 250 280 nm 380 nm and 4 humic acid like region at ex em of 250 nm 380 nm as shown in fig 5 a the high intensity fluorescence region of the untreated leachate sample was located at ex em of 300 385nm 450 500 nm which was a region of humic acid like moieties at the end of treatment the high intensity fluorescence region was in ex em of 250 300 nm 330 370 nm which is the region of soluble microbial byproduct like components fig 5d the disappearance of fluorescence intensity at the humic acid like region indicated that rem treatment removed humic acid like compounds however the fluorescence intensity at the soluble microbial byproduct like region was still there after the rem treatment suggesting that soluble microbial byproducts are more resistant to rem oxidation than humic acid like compounds additionally tryptophan like compounds trapped in humic acid were likely released when humic acid was broken down to small substances admittedly one limitation of using eem is that non fluorescent compounds in landfill leachate samples are unable to be analyzed future studies are warranted to characterize the change of non fluorescent compounds by rem treatment especially those toxic and carcinogenic contaminants e g chlorinated hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organochlorine pesticides clarke et al 2015 that can be degraded by electrochemical oxidation the uv vis absorbance in 200 500 nm was analyzed to assess the changes in organic matters figure s7 shows that the absorbance of the bio treated landfill leachate effluent was continuously removed by rem treatment after 45 min furthermore the absorbance values or ratios at specific wavelengths are listed in table s2 including uv250 uv365 uv254 and uv410 the uv250 uv365 ratio of the untreated leachate increased from 4 72 to 16 87 suggesting that the humic like substance has been converted to small molecular organics yan et al 2019 both uv254 and uv410 greatly decreased after treatment indicating that rem can effectively decompose the aromatic compounds and conjugated macromolecules in landfill leachate respectively the untreated leachate was dark brownish yellow and its color quickly attenuated to colorless during rem treatment see the inset photograph in figure s7 3 2 3 optimizing rem operating conditions on cod removal in practical applications applied current and water flux are two key operating parameters affecting the removal kinetics of contaminants in rem systems their effects on cod decay were evaluated using β pbo2 rem due to its best performance and low material cost table s3 fig 6 a shows that an increase in the applied current from 50 to 400 a m2 caused the increase of the pseudo first order decay rate constant from 0 026 to 0 059 min 1 table s4 especially when the current increased from 50 to 150 a m2 the rate constant sharply increased by 2 times to 0 05 min 1 whereas when the current was higher than 150 a m2 the effect of current is minor which was likely due to the presence of the mass transfer limitation at a certain water flux as mentioned earlier a large amount of bubbles generated by water splitting at high current density can block reactive sites on the rem surface and reduce the oxidation efficiency the effect of water flux was also investigated fig 6b shows that as the water flux increased from 2 to 5 m3 m2 h the decay rate of cod increased from 0 039 to 0 049 min 1 table s4 which is caused by the enhancement of mass transfer efficiency when it is higher than 5 m3 m2 h water flux weakly affected the removal rate of cod suggesting operating experiments above 5 m3 m2 h already reached the maximum mass transfer coefficient of the β pbo2 rem used in this study overall after taking the treatment efficiency the treatment capacity and the energy consumption for details see text s4 and table s4 into account the applied current of 150 a m2 and the water flux of 5 m3 m2 h were selected as the optimal operation conditions 3 3 pilot scale rem treatment of the bio treated landfill leachate 3 3 1 removal of cod and nh4 n by pilot systems among the three rems the β pbo2 rem exhibited the best performance in removing cod and nh4 n so the pilot scale system was built based on β pbo2 rem for the pilot scale rem treatment test the stability of rem in contaminates removal was first assessed by conducting 5 repeated electrolysis experiments using one large β pbo2 rem module the pilot rem system no 1 with the leachate circulated figure s8a shows the concentrations of cod with respect to electrolysis treatment time during the 5 continuous tests over 80 removal of cod was achieved after 90 min electrolysis treatment and there was only a slight difference in the decay rate constant k cod min 1 between the five tests ranging from 2 1 10 2 to 2 3 10 2 min 1 this result is 2 2 times lower than the value of 4 9 10 2 min 1 obtained from the lab scale experiment at the same operating conditions which is because a larger volume of leachate was treated in the pilot scale experiment for the lab scale study 800 ml of leachate sample was treated by the lab scale β pbo2 rem with an anode area of 50 3 cm2 the total anode area volume of the leachate to be treated ratio a v was determined to be 6 3 10 4 m 1 in the pilot no 1 system 45 l of leachate sample was treated by the pilot rem system no 1 with an anode area of 895 cm2 so the a v is 2 0 10 4 m 1 3 times lower than the lab scale setup in addition consistent with the results from earlier lab scale studies nh4 n removal occurred at a much faster rate than that of cod figure s8b over 96 nh4 n was removed after 30 min of treatment to meet the disposal regulations for landfill leachate by a single pass treatment without circulating a four stage modules in series system pilot rem system no 2 was built based on the decay kinetic constant of cod from the pilot rem system no 1 and the system pressure for details see text s5 as shown in fig 7 both the improvement of applied current and the reduction of water flux increased cod removal to achieve steady compliance with the disposal regulation of 100 mg l at the water flux of 5 0 m3 m2 h only 35 cod was removed in a single pass at 150 a m2 while at 320 a m2 the cod concentration was decreased by 62 with an average concentration at 86 mg l at an applied current of 220 a m2 reducing the water flux from 5 0 m3 m2 h to 3 5 m3 m2 h decreased the effluent cod concentration from 120 mg l to below 100 mg l which was insteady compliance with the disposal regulation in comparison to cod nh4 n behaved similarly but featured a faster removal rate at the water flux of 5 0 m3 m2 h nh4 n was removed by 69 and 98 at 150 and 320 a m2 respectively the cod decay rate and the hydraulic retention time t hr s are the two key aspects to explore the mechanism of increased cod decay by increasing applied current and reducing flux for the applied current its increase can enhance the decay rate of contaminants for example at the water flux of 5 0 m3 m2 h cod removal rates were about 37 8 49 5 and 62 5 g h for the applied current of 150 a m2 220 a m2 and 320 a m2 figure s10a respectively for the water flux it can affect both the cod decay rate and the hydraulic retention time our previous research showed that a water flux of 3 6 m3 m2 h was the threshold of whether the mass transfer of contaminants to the porous anode plays a role in limiting the contaminant oxidation for β pbo2 rem with a median pore of 30 μm yang et al 2020 when the water flux is higher than 3 6 m3 m2 h the decrease of water flux does not influence the cod decay rate but leads to a longer reaction time for contaminants in the rem and hence a high cod removal for example at the current of 150 a m2 the cod decay rates at both 5 and 3 5 m3 m2 h were similarly about 31 2 g h figure s10b while the t hr value increased from 8 6 to 12 3 s as the water flux decreased from 5 to 3 5 m3 m2 h resulting in a long reaction time on the other hand when the water flux is lower than 3 6 m3 m2 h the reduction of water flux can cause the decrease of decay rate due to the mass transfer limit at the current of 150 a m2 the cod decay rate decreased from 31 2 to 23 4 g l when the water flux decreased from 3 5 to 2 m3 m2 h figure s10b however the t hr value increased from 12 3 to 21 6 s still maintaining a high cod removal barely in compliance with the disposal regulation fig 7 therefore in practical applications a design of rem inseries system can be optimized by coordinating the few key parameters collectively including the number of rem units the applied current and the water flux 3 3 2 removal of toxic metals and formation of inorganic chlorinated byproducts for toxic metals the concentration of cu ni cr and pb in leachate samples did not change much after pilot rem system no 2 treatment while the concentration of as decreased by about 40 table s5 as iii with high toxicity can be oxidized to weakly toxic as v by rem treatment and as v may further be removed by adsorption on electrode surface or transformation to insoluble precipitates i e the formation of feaso4 with fe3 that is widely present in the leachate at high concentration vilar et al 2011 the formation of toxic inorganic chlorinated byproducts chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 is of critical concern for electrochemical wastewater treatment bergmann et al 2014 clo3 and clo4 are on the u s epa list of unregulated contaminants monitoring rule for drinking water due to their adverse effects on thyroid gland function and hemoglobin in humans alfredo et al 2015 usepa 2012 the health advisory level for clo3 and clo4 are 700 μg l and 15 μg l usepa 2012 respectively in rem systems cl can be converted to clo3 and clo4 by electro oxidation as shown below chaplin 2014 lin et al 2020 reaction 7 cl clo clo2 clo3 clo4 for electrochemical wastewater treatment high current density and long hydraulic retention time are required to maintain high efficiency in contaminant removal however it can cause a high formation of clo3 and clo4 in the presence of chloride chaplin 2014 wang et al 2020 feng et al 2020 this phenomenon has been observed from the treatment of landfill leachate using traditional eaops anglada et al 2009 found that 38 26 of cl initial 850 mg l in landfill leachate was converted to clo3 at 300 1200 a m2 by pilot experiments with parallel bdd electrodes operated in flow by mode a recent study by kateb et al 2019 reported that 150 mg l of clo3 was formed from the treatment of nanofiltration concentrate of landfill leachates using ti4o7 electrode interestingly less than 1 of cl in our study was transformed to clo3 and clo4 in a single pass of the pilot rem system no 2 figure s11 and their concentrations were less than 23 04 mg l and 2 12 mg l respectively the low formation may be attributed to the short hydraulic retention time t hr of the pilot rem system no 2 the t hr of a traditional parallel plate electro oxidation reactor ranges from minutes to hours fernandes et al 2015 mandal et al 2017 while the t hr of the pilot rem system no 2 was 21 6 8 6 s at water fluxes of 2 5 m3 m2 h hence the time is limited for the oxidation of chloride in rem our results also indicate that the formation of clo3 and clo4 can be prevented by increasing the water flux when the water flux increased from 2 to 5 m3 m2 h the concentrations of clo3 and clo4 decreased from 23 04 to 9 36 mg l and from 2 12 to 1 26 mg l respectively figure s11 a recent study by lin et al lin et al 2020 using ti4o7 rem reported that 0 07 of feed cl at 5 mm 0 18 g l was converted to clo3 which is 10 times less than our findings this difference is mainly attributable to two reasons first a long hydraulic retention time 21 6 s was used in our study to achieve high removal of organics in leachate while lin et al lin et al 2020 used a short retention time 13 s to test the formation of clo3 from nacl solution second β pbo2 rem featured a higher oh yield than ti4o7 rem fig 4b which can enhance the formation of clo3 future studies were warranted to thoroughly assess the formation of clo3 and clo4 in different rems considering the elimination of clo3 and clo4 is extremely challenging future work should develop advanced strategies in inhibiting their formation 3 3 3 energy consumption and cost analysis under the optimized conditions of 220 a m2 and 3 5m3 m2 h the energy consumption e kwh m3 was 3 6 kwh m3 to meet the national disposal regulations of china as summarized in table s6 the energy consumption in our study is 3 42 times lower than those 10 to 150 kwh m3 reported for the advanced treatment of pre treated landfill leachate effluent using traditional eaops although the samples in these studies have higher cod concentrations than the sample in our study their current efficiency ce for organic oxidation is much lower than ours table s6 based on the cod removal data at an applied current of 220 a m2 and a water flux of 3 5 m3 m2 h in fig 7 ce was calculated to be 68 3 5 times of the value 19 3 reported by zhao et al 2010 in which landfill leachate was treated by a bdd electrode operated in flow by mode such a high current efficiency confirms that rem is more energy efficient than traditional eaops operated in flow by or batch mode moreover the normalized treatment capacity per m2 rem of the pilot rem system no 2 is 875 l h calculated using equation s7 which is 9 84 times higher than the values reported for traditional eaop systems table s6 suggesting that a high capacity can be achieved by fewer materials in our system the overall cost of applying the pilot rem system no 2 to the advanced treatment of bio treated landfill leachate was estimated with the consideration of energy consumption pumping cost and capital cost the details were described in text s6 assuming a service lifetime of 5 years yang et al 2020 the cost is approximately 0 447 u s m3 it was estimated that the cost of the up to date landfill leachate treatment varies between 4 5 and 12 u s m3 in practical applications wu et al 2016 therefore the cost of applying the rem as a supplementary step for treating pre treated landfill leachate 0 45 u s m3 is less than 10 of the total cost of the overall treatment processes it should be noted that the varying labor cost and capital cost should be taken into account for different countries or locations generally if the rem technology is properly combined with cheap conventional biological and physicochemical processes it is possible to treat landfill leachates in compliance with direct disposal regulations in a cost effective manner 3 3 4 fouling in rem systems fouling is of major concern for the application of rem for the treatment of wastewater in our pilot scale experiments using one β pbo2 rem module the cod removal rate is consistent in a continuous five treatment cycles figure s8 indicating that the bio treated landfill leachate effluent did not cause fouling of the porous anode in this study and hence stable treatment performance was maintained these results are likely due to the following four reasons first the landfill leachate has been pretreated by biological processes so less organic matter is present second the operating pressure is very low 0 3 bar to achieve a high water flux 2 m3 m2 h for the no 2 system with four rem modules figure s9 this is because rems feature large pores median pore size of 42 49 μm fig 2a compared with microfiltration mf the pores in rem are 50 200 times larger than those of mf membranes 0 2 1 μm ince et al 2010 visvanathan et al 1994 hence the no 2 system can obtain at least 10 times higher water flux than mf 0 2 m3 m2 h at a 3 6 times lower pressure than mf 0 9 1 75 bar for the treatment of landfill leachate ince et al 2010 visvanathan et al 1994 third the high water flux can facilitate the movement of foulants through the large pores in rems and prevent the fouling formation by strong shear stress lastly organic foulants in the rems can be easily oxidized due to the strong oxidizing ability however it should be admitted that other inorganic foulant may cause fouling in both anode and cathode we have observed that 10 15 of hardness ions were removed table s5 because ca2 and mg2 can precipitate on the surface of cathode mainly in the form of caco3 and mgco3 respectively jaouhari et al 2000 the rem system is fully enclosed so the cathode scaling may affect its service lifetime hence a long term operation is needed in the future to systematically evaluate the fouling issues for the rem system 4 conclusion electro oxidation advanced treatment by the reactive electrochemical membrane rem is promising to treat bio treated landfill leachate this work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the rem process in treating landfill leachate at the laboratory and pilot scales the lab scale experiments show that β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem exhibited better performance than and ruo2 ir rem in mineralizing bio refractory organics removing ammonium nitrogen and reducing toxicity which is likely attributed to their strong ability to produce hydroxyl radical oh as for the oxidation mechanism the rem process preferentially removed humic like substances over soluble microbial byproduct like components based on the lab scale studies a pilot rem system no 2 with four β pbo2 rem modules in series was built which efficiently removed cod and nh4 n achieving compliance with the disposal regulations moreover the pilot rem system no 2 reduced the formation of toxic inorganic chlorinated byproducts due to its short hydraulic retention time and removed toxic metals compared with the widely reported traditional electro oxidation systems operated in batch or flow by mode the pilot rem system consumed 3 42 times less energy featured high current efficiency at 68 and achieved 9 84 times higher treatment capacity in summary this study suggested that the rem process is a more energy efficient way than current electrochemical technologies to remove refractory organics and ammonium nitrogen in landfill leachate and it is practical to be applied

17318,this study for the first time investigated the advanced treatment of bio treated landfill leachate effluent using a novel reactive electrochemical membrane rem technology at the laboratory and pilot scales at the laboratory scale ruo2 ir rem ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem featured similar properties in pore size and water flux although ruo2 ir rem holds more reactive sites than the other two rems β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem featured higher oxidation ability than ruo2 ir rem causing their high yield of hydroxyl radical consequently β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem performed better than ruo2 ir rem which removed total organic carbon and ammonia nitrogen by 70 76 and 100 respectively after 45 minutes of treatment fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed that humic acid like substances were oxidized by the rem treatment using the β pbo2 rem in the lab scale setup with the solutions circulated we observed a greater removal of chemical oxygen demand cod at a higher applied current or a faster water flux the pilot system with four large size of β pbo2 rems modules in series was developed based on the lab scale setup which steadily treated landfill leachate in compliance with the disposal regulations of china at an energy consumption of 3 6 kwh m3 also a single pass rem can effectively prevent the transformation of chloride to chlorate and perchlorate our study showed rem technology is a powerful and promising process for the advanced treatment of landfill leachate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive electrochemical membrane bio treated landfill leachate pilot scale advanced treatment energy efficient 1 introduction sanitary landfill is widely used for the disposal of urban solid waste around the world due to its simplicity and economic advantages yao p 2017 one of the main disadvantages of this practice is the formation of landfill leachate that has a complex composition and contains toxic or bio refractory compounds e g ammonia heavy metals organic halogens and humic and fulvic acids fernandes et al 2015 yao p 2017 mandal et al 2017 direct discharge of landfill leachate without proper treatment can result in serious pollution of soil groundwater surface water and nearby air because of its complex recalcitrant and varied composition efficient treatment of landfill leachate remains a major challenge to date mandal et al 2017 fernandes et al 2015 biological treatment followed by membrane processes and advanced oxidation processes aops has been tested effective in treating landfill leachate moraes et al 2005 omar et al 2015 kamaruddin et al 2017 however this treatment train is expensive due to the high mechanical pressure used in nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro moreover leachate concentrate is challenging to be treated feng et al 2020 recently electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop is a promising technology to replace nf ro for the advanced treatment of bio treated landfill leachate and it exhibited high efficiency in removing organic matters color and ammonia anglada et al 2009 2010 fernandes et al 2015 mandal et al 2017 ukundimana et al 2018 asaithambi et al 2020 anglada et al 2010 achieved an 83 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod initial 860 mg l from a bio treated landfill leachate effluent using boron doped diamond bdd operated in flow by mode at a pilot scale plant a recent study by feng et al 2020 showed that eaops can effectively increase the biodegradability of pre treated leachate and achieve simultaneous removal of ammonia and cod the electrochemical mineralization of contaminants usually occurs in a narrow zone 1 μm on the electrode surface chaplin b p 2014 until now the eaop treatment of landfill leachate is mostly operated in batch and flow by modes because of the slow interphase mass transferfor contaminants from the bulk solution to the reaction zone on the anode surface the overall efficiency of eaop systems is restricted and the complete mineralization of organic matters requires high energy consumption fernandes et al 2015 mandal et al 2017 kateb et al 2019 to address the mass transfer limitations a reactive electrochemical membrane rem technology operated in flow through mode was developed based on porous electrode materials chaplin b p 2014 mameda et al 2018 the rem electrode is a three dimensional material containing a large specific surface area with abundant reactive sites for electrochemical reactions moreover the inner pores in rem electrodes minimize the thickness of the boundary layer thus greatly enhancing the mass transfer rate of contaminants moving towards the reaction zone yang et al 2020 the normalized mass transfer rate k m achieved by the rems was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than the highest reported k m 10 5 m s of traditional eaop systems chaplin b p 2014 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2020 zhi et al 2020 current studies have evaluated the degradation of specific contaminantsin synthetic water by lab scale rem experiments chaplin b p 2019 the application of the rem technology to the treatment of complex real wastewater at a pilot scale has not been reported to date here for the first time we report a comprehensive study of applying rem to the treatment of bio treated landfill leachate effluent at both laboratory and pilot scales three electrochemical devices including one lab scale unit and two pilot systems were built and tested three macro porous rems ruo2 ir rem ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem were chosen as the flow through porous anodes because they can be prepared in large sizes and feature good stability and reactivity first the three rems were characterized and their efficiency in removing organic matters ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen and toxicity of bio treated landfill leachate was analyzed and compared using the lab scale unit second we explored the mechanism of organic oxidation for the three different rems fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy were employed to analyze the conversion of organic components during rem treatment the effects of operating factors including applied current density and water flux on the removal of cod and nh4 n were also examined using the lab scale unit lastly the pilot systems were developed based on the scaling up of the lab scale unit and its removal efficiency of cod and nh4 n was tested the feasibility of applying rem in practical leachate treatment was assessed by monitoring the removal of toxic heavy metals and the formation of toxic chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 by analyzing the energy consumption and investment cost and by discussing the fouling issues 2 method and materials 2 1 landfill leachate characterization the landfill leachate was collected from a municipal landfill site in dongguan guangdong province china the city of dongguan is one of the world s manufacturing centers generating a huge amount of municipal and industrial solid wastes every day a bio treated landfill leachate effluent after anaerobic process and membrane bioreactor mbr was collected and its water characteristics are shown in table 1 the major water quality indicators such as cod and total nitrogen tn of the leachate samples greatly exceeded the disposal regulations of china for instance the cod was 212 283 mg l while the regulation of cod is less than 100 mg l additionally the landfill leachate features a high concentration of chloride ion of 1 2 1 3 g l and high conductivity of 8 3 ms cm table 1 2 2 rem electrodes fabrication all three rem electrodes were prepared on porous titanium with a median pore diameter of 50 μm as the substrate both ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem were prepared by two steps firstly the load of sno2 sb as an intermediate layer on ti tubular filter by sol gel method and then the load of ti4o7 or β pbo2 on sno2 sb intermediate layer as the catalytic layer details concerning the preparation of β pbo2 rem have been reported in our previous studies lin et al 2011 yang et al 2020 the ti4o7 catalytic layer was prepared by vacuum plasma spraying technique using an xm 80sk system xiuma co ltd shanghai china ti4o7 powder was prepared by reducing tio2 in the h2 atmosphere lin et al 2018 the ruo2 ir rem synthesized by a sol gel method was obtained from yunxuan metal material co ltd china 2 3 rem electrodes characterization the surface morphology and the crystalline phases of the rem electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan and x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max 3c japan the pore size distributions of the electrodes were characterized by mercury porosimetry autopore iv 9500 micromeritics linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry of the rem electrodes was carried out in conventional three electrode electrochemical cells driven by an auto lab m204 electrochemical workstation metrohm netherlands with a platinum foil 3cm 3 cm and ag agcl 0 22 v vs she as the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively the values of oxygen evolution potential oep of the three rems were estimated from linear sweep voltammetry using slope extension method tafel region meng et al 2019 the electrolyte solution is 0 5 m na2so4 water permeation of the rem electrodes was calculated according to the different water fluxes upon their corresponding pressure in flow through mode high concentrations of model probes including fe cn 6 4 and salicylic acid sa were used to assess the reactivity of the rem electrodes experiments with 20 mm k4fe cn 6 were conducted using the lab scale rem in a single pass filtration mode without circulating at a water flux of 10 m3 m2 h an applied current of 9 3 214 a cm2 was applied and regulated during the experiments similarly the oxidation experiments of salicylic acid 5 mm sa were performed to estimate the oh yield of rems yang et al 2020 2 4 lab scale rem experiments rem electrodes with the outer and inner diameters of 35 mm and 29 mm respectively and a length of 50 mm were used in the lab scale rem unit figure s1 unless otherwise specified the experiments for the lab scale rem unit were performed using a closed loop operation at room temperature 25 1 c the leachate was continuously flowed through the rem unit and recirculated for each experiment 800 ml of leachate sample was used all ruo2 ir rem ti4o7 rem and β pbo2 rem were tested the effects of applied current 50 400 a m2 and water flux 2 0 10 m3 m2 h were investigated 2 5 pilot scale rem experiments the schematic of the pilot scale rem module is shown in figure s2 which is designed as dead end filtration and all water entering the module exits as permeate only β pbo2 rem was used due to its best performance in removing cod and nh4 n a large β pbo2 rem was fabricated with outer and inner diameters of 60 mm and 54 mm respectively and a length of 500 mm the stainless steel perforated tube outer diameter 10 mm and length 500 mm and the stainless steel tube inner diameter 80 mm and length 500 mm were used as the inner cathode and the outer cathode respectively the inner cathode was also the water inlet that uniformly distributes water the setup of the pilot rem system no 1 is shown in figure s3 which comprises a single β pbo2 rem model this system has been used in experiments to evaluate the stability of the pilot rem in pollutant removal for each experiment 45 l sample was pumped through the system no 1 and recirculated at the flux of 5 m3 m2 h 7 5 l min in a closed loop operation at room temperature 25 1 c and a constant current density at 150 a m2 was applied using a dh1798 dc power 80v 60a the pilot rem system no 2 comprising a system of four pilot rem modules in series is shown in figure s4 the details of the system are described in text s1 briefly the electrochemical oxidation unit consists of four identical pilot rem modules connected in series the rem modules are powered in parallel to ensure that the current applied to each rem module is consistent and the influent pressure was controlled and monitored experiments were conducted in a single pass filtration mode and a sample of 300 370 l was treated in each experiment without circulating triplicate experiments were conducted at the applied current of 150 220 or 320 a m2 and the effluent water quality was continuously analyzed by every 5 minutes the experiments started with 10 minutes of stabilization without applied current afterward the procedure is different depending on the applied current for the experiment at 150 a m2 three water fluxes 5 3 5 and 2 m3 m2 h were tested successively one by one at each water flux the test was conducted for 30 minutes to obtain a stabilized effluent quality for the other two experiments at high current densities of 220 and 320 a m2 water fluxes of 3 5 5 and 5 m3 m2 h were tested respectively cod removal rates r cod g h were calculated by eq 1 1 r cod cod influent cod effluent q where codinfluent g l and codeffluent g l are the cod concentrations of landfill leachate at influent and effluent respectively and q l h is the water flow the hydraulic retention time t hr s of the pilot rem system no 2 can be calculated by eq 2 2 t hr 4 d j where 4 is the number of the rem modules in series j m s is the water flux and d m is the thickness of a single rem anode 3 mm 2 6 current efficiency and energy consumption calculations for the pilot no 2 system current efficiency ce for the oxidation of organics was determined using eq 3 3 c e cod influent cod effluent 8 i t f v 100 where i a is the input current v is the treated volume in a duration of t and 8 is the equivalent mass of oxygen the energy consumption e kwh m3 was estimated by eq 4 4 e 10 3 u i q where u v is the average cell voltage i a is the input current and q m3 h is the water flow 2 7 analytical method the details of the analytical methods are shown in text s2 including various water properties toxicity uv vis spectrum and fluorescence spectroscopy briefly total organic carbon toc and tn concentrations were measured by a multi n c uv toc analyzer analytic jena germany using a catalytic combustion method at 800 c chinese national standard methods for the examination of wastewater were used to determine the cod values the concentrations of nh4 mg2 ca2 cl no3 no2 clo3 and clo4 were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher icap rq was employed to determine the concentration of toxic heavy metals including cu ni cr cd as and pb the change of organic matters after treatment was investigated using uv vis spectrum inesa l5s china and excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy analysis horiba fluoromax 4 japan the light emission of the luminescent bacterium v qinghaiensis was measured using aportable water toxicity analyzer hach ecloxtm usa to determine the toxicity of the bio treated landfill leachate samples before and after treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different rems in treating the bio treated landfill leachate effluent 3 1 1 characterization of rems xrd results as shown in figure s5 confirmed that the electrocatalysts β pbo2 ti4o7 and ruo2 ir were successfully loaded in β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem respectively with the loading mass of 1400 600 and 21 1 g m2 physical properties of three rems were characterized using sem mercury intrusion porosimetry and water flux test to evaluate thematerial morphology pore size distribution and water permeability rate respectively sem images showed that all β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem feature the porous structure and the aperture size fig 1 which allow them to be operated in a filtration mode in electrochemical treatment of wastewaters similar inner pore diameter distribution 30 60 μm porosity 32 34 and median pore size 42 49 μm were observed among these three different rems fig 2 a indicating that a large internal surface area is available for electrochemical reaction natural colloidal particles and suspended particles are widely present in real wastewater moreover soluble chemicals such as organic matter and metallic ions i e ca2 mg2 al3 and fe3 can also be transformed to insoluble particles through redox reactions in an electrochemical system the large pore size of the three rems helps prevent its surface fouling caused by trapped particles in addition the large pore size and high porosity also help increase water flux and reduce operating pressure as shown in fig 2b the water permeation rate of β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem was determined to be 19 21 and 22 m3 m2 h bar at 0 1 bar respectively dozens to thousand times of the other reported rems yang et al 2020 as a result all three rems fabricated in this study are practical for leachate treatment at a high water treatment capacity under a low pressure it should be noted that water penetration performance of rems will decrease when the current is applied which is caused by the gas produced from water splitting fig 2b oxygen evolution potential oep a parameter indicating the electrochemical oxidation property of electrodes was obtained for the rems using linear sweep voltammetry as shown in fig 2c β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem exhibited high oep at 2 0 and 2 2 v vs she respectively followed by ruo2 ir rem with oep at 1 58v vs she and the values are well concordance with other literature chen g h 2004 because the oxidation potential of most organic contaminants is lower than 1 9 vvs she weinberg and weinberg 1968 the high oep of β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem suggest that they are more powerful than ruo2 ir rem to completely mineralize refractory organic contaminants moreover the standard reduction potentials of reactive oxygen species ross such as hydroxyl radical oh and other powerful oxidative species are lower than or similar to the oep of β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem fig 2c suggesting that these rems feature a high ability to generate the powerful ross 3 1 2 removal of organic matters total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen based on the lab scale experiments β pbo2 rem exhibited better performance than ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem fig 3 fig 3a shows that the cod removal using β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem followed pseudo first decay kinetics the decay rate constant of cod for β pbo2 rem was 0 035 min 1 1 2 and 1 8 times higher than those of ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem respectively after 45 minutes β pbo2 rem mineralized 76 2 of toc better than ti4o7 rem 69 6 and ruo2 ir rem 46 3 fig 3b although the ruo2 ir electrode is the most commonly used dimensionally stable anode dsa it has a low oep and thus a weak oxidization power as shown in fig 2c therefore ruo2 ir exhibited poor ability in mineralizing refractory contaminants chen g h 2004 panizza et al 2009 the non active anodes such as doped sno2 β pbo2 ti4o7 and bdd electrodes with strong oxidation ability are more suitable than ruo2 ir for degrading persistent organic pollutants chen g h 2004 panizza et al 2009 these results indicated that β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem are more energy efficient than ruo2 ir rem to remove organics the three rems behaved similarly in removing nitrogen contaminants as shown in fig 3b nh4 n was completely removed after 45 min electrolysis while tn was removed at low extents by 36 7 3 4 38 2 4 9 and 33 4 2 respectively for β pbo2 rem ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem it is known that nh4 n oxidation may occur in an electrochemical process via indirect oxidation by active chlorine reaction 1 rather than anode direct oxidation or indirect oxidation by oh cabeza et al 2007 anglada et al 2009 reaction 1 3clo 2nh4 n2 2h 3cl 3h2o reaction 2 cl h2o 2e 2h clo the active chlorine can be produced in a large amount by a chlorine evolution reaction reaction 2 then chlorine can diffuse to the bulk solution to react with nh4 due to its long lifetime thus the rapid oxidation of nh4 n in our study can be attributed to the high concentration of cl 1 2 1 3 g l and the high reaction rate between active chlorine and nh4 cabeza et al 2007 anglada et al 2009 the low removal of tn might be because that the nitrogen in the bio treated landfill leachate effluent is mainly present in the forms of nitrate and nitrite table 1 that cannot be reduced by the stainless steel cathode this is consistent with the findings from previous studies pérez g 2012 fernandes a 2016 that reported the removal of tn in landfill leachate was mainly achieved by the transformation of ammonia to nitrogen through reaction 1 in an electrochemical system for future study it is necessary to further improve the efficiency of nitrate and nitrite removal likely by using a special cathode material with high electrocatalytic reduction activity 3 1 3 evaluation of toxicity toxicity of untreated and treated landfill leachate was assessed by the inhibition of photobacteria fluorescence fig 3c shows that the bio treated landfill leachate effluent was highly biotoxic with an inhibition as high as 78 4 this result is consistent with a recent finding by feng et al 2020 that bio pretreated ultrafiltration landfill leachate effluent mainly contains toxic and non biodegradable organics with a very low bod cod ratio of 0 03 after rem treatment the photobacteria fluorescence inhibition decreased to 10 8 by β pbo2 rem suggesting that the biotoxic components in the bio treated landfill leachate effluent were effectively removed the detoxification efficiency of ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem was lower than that of β pbo2 rem with the inhibition of 15 1 and 31 2 respectively 3 2 mechanisms of organic matter removal by rem treatment 3 2 1 direct oxidation and oh mediated indirect oxidation the main reaction mechanisms reactions 3 5 for organic matters oxidation in an electrochemical system include direct oxidation by direct electron transfer det at the anode and indirect oxidation by ross most likely oh panizza et al 2009 reaction 3 contaminants ne products reaction 4 h2o e h oh reaction 5 contaminants oh products the reactive sites in anodes can directly oxidize organic contaminants or react with water to generate oh to evaluate the roles of direct oxidation and indirect oxidation by oh in different rems we first used fe cn 6 4 as a probe to estimate the total reactive sites that are available for both organic oxidation and oh generation then salicylic acid sa was selected as a oh probe to assess oh generation liang et al 2018 i e the amount of sites generating oh the details of these two probes and the calculation of reaction rates are described in text s3 fig 4 a shows that the maximum oxidation rate of fe cn 6 4 k fe cn 6 4 mol cm2 min was approximately 11 5 10 6 8 5 10 6 and 7 5 10 6 mol cm2 min for ruo2 ir rem β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem respectively suggesting that ruo2 ir rem has the highest limiting current j limit for the oxidation of fe cn 6 4 the decrease of k fe cn 6 4 at the high current density could be attributed to that water splitting generated bubbles that blocked reactive sites zaky et al 2013 yang et al 2020 the limiting current of an electrochemical system depends on the mass transfer coefficient k f m s electroactive area i e total reactive sites and the concentration of the target compound chaplin et al 2013 meng et al 2019 5 j l i m i t z f c b a i k f where z is the number of electron transfer f 96485 c mol is the faraday s constant c b mol l is the bulk concentration of the target compound and a i m2 is the electroactive area the k f values are assumed to be the same of three rems because the three rems have similar pore size and are under the same hydrodynamic conditions therefore the reason for the highest direct oxidation of fe cn 6 4 for ruo2 ir rem is that it featured more reactive sites than the other two rems which was suggested by its smaller ruo2 ir particles as shown in sem images fig 1 the cyclic voltammetry tests also supported that the ruo2 ir rem has a larger electroactive area than β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem figure s6 it should also be noted that the reactive sites for fe cn 6 4 oxidation are the total available oxidation sites which include weak oxidation sites that are unable to oxidize the target organic contaminants in landfill leachate especially compounds requiring much higher oxidation potential than fe cn 6 4 as for the oxidation by oh β pbo2 rem exhibited the highest oh yield of 14 10 8mol cm2 min among the three rems at 215 a m2 fig 4b which was 5 and 23 times greater than those of ti4o7 rem and ruo2 ir rem respectively these results suggested that the reactive sites in β pbo2 rem are more powerful to generate oh than ruo2 ir rem which features the most abundant reactive sites observed from k4fe cn 6 oxidation these results are consistent with the findings observed in previous studies martínez huitle and ferro 2006 bejan et al 2012 1 the oh yield of ti4o7 is insufficient compared with pbo2 and 2 ruo2 ir is ineffective in oh generation the role of direct and indirect oxidation in the rem treatment of landfill leachate was dependent on the electrochemical properties of these three rems for ruo2 ir rem that features low oh generation ability its performance in removing organics fig 3 is potentially caused by direct oxidation moreover ruo2 ir rem exhibited a relatively high toc removal 46 3 compared with plate ruo2 electrode 20 in treating bio treated landfill leachate after the same time and at the similar applied current luu 2020 generally direct oxidation is ineffective in mineralizing organics xie et al 2020 this high toc removal is likely due to the enhancement of direct electron transfer by the high water flux in the flow through mode zaky et al 2013 xie et al 2020 for β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem they exhibited better performance in removing organics than ruo2 ir rem fig 3a which is inconsistent with their relative total reactive sites fig 4a these two rems feature a much higher oh generation rate than ruo2 ir rem fig 4b hence indirect oxidation by oh may play a key role in oxidizing organics for these two rems comparison between β pbo2 rem and ruo2 ir rem also shows that the 23 times higher oh yield for β pbo2 rem only resulted in a 1 8 times greater decay rate of cod one of the possible reasons is that oh can be quenched by other constituents which inhibited the oh mediated indirect oxidation process for example chloride in landfill leachate can react with oh through the following pathway liao et al 2001 reaction 6 cl oh cl oh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 therefore it could be concluded that the oxidation mechanisms of organics for the three rems are dependent on their electrochemical properties and water qualities 3 2 2 change in excitation emission matrix and uv vis absorbance by rem treatment humic substances including humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa are the major compounds of the refractory organics present in landfill leachate wang et al 2014 because both ha and fa feature strong fluorescent signals hao et al 2012 excitation emission matrix eem has been widely used to characterize organic matters in landfill leachate samples ding et al 2018 lee and hur 2016 li et al 2013 accordingly fluorescence spectroscopy of leachate samples before and after treatment using β pbo2 rem was analyzed to provide the mechanistic insights of dissolved organic matter dom removal the fluorescence eem spectra at different ex em regions that represent different dom types chen et al 2003 1 aromatic proteins region e g tyrosine and tryptophan at ex em of 250 nm 380 nm 2 fulvic acid like region at ex em of 250 nm 380 nm 3 soluble microbial byproduct like region at ex em of 250 280 nm 380 nm and 4 humic acid like region at ex em of 250 nm 380 nm as shown in fig 5 a the high intensity fluorescence region of the untreated leachate sample was located at ex em of 300 385nm 450 500 nm which was a region of humic acid like moieties at the end of treatment the high intensity fluorescence region was in ex em of 250 300 nm 330 370 nm which is the region of soluble microbial byproduct like components fig 5d the disappearance of fluorescence intensity at the humic acid like region indicated that rem treatment removed humic acid like compounds however the fluorescence intensity at the soluble microbial byproduct like region was still there after the rem treatment suggesting that soluble microbial byproducts are more resistant to rem oxidation than humic acid like compounds additionally tryptophan like compounds trapped in humic acid were likely released when humic acid was broken down to small substances admittedly one limitation of using eem is that non fluorescent compounds in landfill leachate samples are unable to be analyzed future studies are warranted to characterize the change of non fluorescent compounds by rem treatment especially those toxic and carcinogenic contaminants e g chlorinated hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organochlorine pesticides clarke et al 2015 that can be degraded by electrochemical oxidation the uv vis absorbance in 200 500 nm was analyzed to assess the changes in organic matters figure s7 shows that the absorbance of the bio treated landfill leachate effluent was continuously removed by rem treatment after 45 min furthermore the absorbance values or ratios at specific wavelengths are listed in table s2 including uv250 uv365 uv254 and uv410 the uv250 uv365 ratio of the untreated leachate increased from 4 72 to 16 87 suggesting that the humic like substance has been converted to small molecular organics yan et al 2019 both uv254 and uv410 greatly decreased after treatment indicating that rem can effectively decompose the aromatic compounds and conjugated macromolecules in landfill leachate respectively the untreated leachate was dark brownish yellow and its color quickly attenuated to colorless during rem treatment see the inset photograph in figure s7 3 2 3 optimizing rem operating conditions on cod removal in practical applications applied current and water flux are two key operating parameters affecting the removal kinetics of contaminants in rem systems their effects on cod decay were evaluated using β pbo2 rem due to its best performance and low material cost table s3 fig 6 a shows that an increase in the applied current from 50 to 400 a m2 caused the increase of the pseudo first order decay rate constant from 0 026 to 0 059 min 1 table s4 especially when the current increased from 50 to 150 a m2 the rate constant sharply increased by 2 times to 0 05 min 1 whereas when the current was higher than 150 a m2 the effect of current is minor which was likely due to the presence of the mass transfer limitation at a certain water flux as mentioned earlier a large amount of bubbles generated by water splitting at high current density can block reactive sites on the rem surface and reduce the oxidation efficiency the effect of water flux was also investigated fig 6b shows that as the water flux increased from 2 to 5 m3 m2 h the decay rate of cod increased from 0 039 to 0 049 min 1 table s4 which is caused by the enhancement of mass transfer efficiency when it is higher than 5 m3 m2 h water flux weakly affected the removal rate of cod suggesting operating experiments above 5 m3 m2 h already reached the maximum mass transfer coefficient of the β pbo2 rem used in this study overall after taking the treatment efficiency the treatment capacity and the energy consumption for details see text s4 and table s4 into account the applied current of 150 a m2 and the water flux of 5 m3 m2 h were selected as the optimal operation conditions 3 3 pilot scale rem treatment of the bio treated landfill leachate 3 3 1 removal of cod and nh4 n by pilot systems among the three rems the β pbo2 rem exhibited the best performance in removing cod and nh4 n so the pilot scale system was built based on β pbo2 rem for the pilot scale rem treatment test the stability of rem in contaminates removal was first assessed by conducting 5 repeated electrolysis experiments using one large β pbo2 rem module the pilot rem system no 1 with the leachate circulated figure s8a shows the concentrations of cod with respect to electrolysis treatment time during the 5 continuous tests over 80 removal of cod was achieved after 90 min electrolysis treatment and there was only a slight difference in the decay rate constant k cod min 1 between the five tests ranging from 2 1 10 2 to 2 3 10 2 min 1 this result is 2 2 times lower than the value of 4 9 10 2 min 1 obtained from the lab scale experiment at the same operating conditions which is because a larger volume of leachate was treated in the pilot scale experiment for the lab scale study 800 ml of leachate sample was treated by the lab scale β pbo2 rem with an anode area of 50 3 cm2 the total anode area volume of the leachate to be treated ratio a v was determined to be 6 3 10 4 m 1 in the pilot no 1 system 45 l of leachate sample was treated by the pilot rem system no 1 with an anode area of 895 cm2 so the a v is 2 0 10 4 m 1 3 times lower than the lab scale setup in addition consistent with the results from earlier lab scale studies nh4 n removal occurred at a much faster rate than that of cod figure s8b over 96 nh4 n was removed after 30 min of treatment to meet the disposal regulations for landfill leachate by a single pass treatment without circulating a four stage modules in series system pilot rem system no 2 was built based on the decay kinetic constant of cod from the pilot rem system no 1 and the system pressure for details see text s5 as shown in fig 7 both the improvement of applied current and the reduction of water flux increased cod removal to achieve steady compliance with the disposal regulation of 100 mg l at the water flux of 5 0 m3 m2 h only 35 cod was removed in a single pass at 150 a m2 while at 320 a m2 the cod concentration was decreased by 62 with an average concentration at 86 mg l at an applied current of 220 a m2 reducing the water flux from 5 0 m3 m2 h to 3 5 m3 m2 h decreased the effluent cod concentration from 120 mg l to below 100 mg l which was insteady compliance with the disposal regulation in comparison to cod nh4 n behaved similarly but featured a faster removal rate at the water flux of 5 0 m3 m2 h nh4 n was removed by 69 and 98 at 150 and 320 a m2 respectively the cod decay rate and the hydraulic retention time t hr s are the two key aspects to explore the mechanism of increased cod decay by increasing applied current and reducing flux for the applied current its increase can enhance the decay rate of contaminants for example at the water flux of 5 0 m3 m2 h cod removal rates were about 37 8 49 5 and 62 5 g h for the applied current of 150 a m2 220 a m2 and 320 a m2 figure s10a respectively for the water flux it can affect both the cod decay rate and the hydraulic retention time our previous research showed that a water flux of 3 6 m3 m2 h was the threshold of whether the mass transfer of contaminants to the porous anode plays a role in limiting the contaminant oxidation for β pbo2 rem with a median pore of 30 μm yang et al 2020 when the water flux is higher than 3 6 m3 m2 h the decrease of water flux does not influence the cod decay rate but leads to a longer reaction time for contaminants in the rem and hence a high cod removal for example at the current of 150 a m2 the cod decay rates at both 5 and 3 5 m3 m2 h were similarly about 31 2 g h figure s10b while the t hr value increased from 8 6 to 12 3 s as the water flux decreased from 5 to 3 5 m3 m2 h resulting in a long reaction time on the other hand when the water flux is lower than 3 6 m3 m2 h the reduction of water flux can cause the decrease of decay rate due to the mass transfer limit at the current of 150 a m2 the cod decay rate decreased from 31 2 to 23 4 g l when the water flux decreased from 3 5 to 2 m3 m2 h figure s10b however the t hr value increased from 12 3 to 21 6 s still maintaining a high cod removal barely in compliance with the disposal regulation fig 7 therefore in practical applications a design of rem inseries system can be optimized by coordinating the few key parameters collectively including the number of rem units the applied current and the water flux 3 3 2 removal of toxic metals and formation of inorganic chlorinated byproducts for toxic metals the concentration of cu ni cr and pb in leachate samples did not change much after pilot rem system no 2 treatment while the concentration of as decreased by about 40 table s5 as iii with high toxicity can be oxidized to weakly toxic as v by rem treatment and as v may further be removed by adsorption on electrode surface or transformation to insoluble precipitates i e the formation of feaso4 with fe3 that is widely present in the leachate at high concentration vilar et al 2011 the formation of toxic inorganic chlorinated byproducts chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 is of critical concern for electrochemical wastewater treatment bergmann et al 2014 clo3 and clo4 are on the u s epa list of unregulated contaminants monitoring rule for drinking water due to their adverse effects on thyroid gland function and hemoglobin in humans alfredo et al 2015 usepa 2012 the health advisory level for clo3 and clo4 are 700 μg l and 15 μg l usepa 2012 respectively in rem systems cl can be converted to clo3 and clo4 by electro oxidation as shown below chaplin 2014 lin et al 2020 reaction 7 cl clo clo2 clo3 clo4 for electrochemical wastewater treatment high current density and long hydraulic retention time are required to maintain high efficiency in contaminant removal however it can cause a high formation of clo3 and clo4 in the presence of chloride chaplin 2014 wang et al 2020 feng et al 2020 this phenomenon has been observed from the treatment of landfill leachate using traditional eaops anglada et al 2009 found that 38 26 of cl initial 850 mg l in landfill leachate was converted to clo3 at 300 1200 a m2 by pilot experiments with parallel bdd electrodes operated in flow by mode a recent study by kateb et al 2019 reported that 150 mg l of clo3 was formed from the treatment of nanofiltration concentrate of landfill leachates using ti4o7 electrode interestingly less than 1 of cl in our study was transformed to clo3 and clo4 in a single pass of the pilot rem system no 2 figure s11 and their concentrations were less than 23 04 mg l and 2 12 mg l respectively the low formation may be attributed to the short hydraulic retention time t hr of the pilot rem system no 2 the t hr of a traditional parallel plate electro oxidation reactor ranges from minutes to hours fernandes et al 2015 mandal et al 2017 while the t hr of the pilot rem system no 2 was 21 6 8 6 s at water fluxes of 2 5 m3 m2 h hence the time is limited for the oxidation of chloride in rem our results also indicate that the formation of clo3 and clo4 can be prevented by increasing the water flux when the water flux increased from 2 to 5 m3 m2 h the concentrations of clo3 and clo4 decreased from 23 04 to 9 36 mg l and from 2 12 to 1 26 mg l respectively figure s11 a recent study by lin et al lin et al 2020 using ti4o7 rem reported that 0 07 of feed cl at 5 mm 0 18 g l was converted to clo3 which is 10 times less than our findings this difference is mainly attributable to two reasons first a long hydraulic retention time 21 6 s was used in our study to achieve high removal of organics in leachate while lin et al lin et al 2020 used a short retention time 13 s to test the formation of clo3 from nacl solution second β pbo2 rem featured a higher oh yield than ti4o7 rem fig 4b which can enhance the formation of clo3 future studies were warranted to thoroughly assess the formation of clo3 and clo4 in different rems considering the elimination of clo3 and clo4 is extremely challenging future work should develop advanced strategies in inhibiting their formation 3 3 3 energy consumption and cost analysis under the optimized conditions of 220 a m2 and 3 5m3 m2 h the energy consumption e kwh m3 was 3 6 kwh m3 to meet the national disposal regulations of china as summarized in table s6 the energy consumption in our study is 3 42 times lower than those 10 to 150 kwh m3 reported for the advanced treatment of pre treated landfill leachate effluent using traditional eaops although the samples in these studies have higher cod concentrations than the sample in our study their current efficiency ce for organic oxidation is much lower than ours table s6 based on the cod removal data at an applied current of 220 a m2 and a water flux of 3 5 m3 m2 h in fig 7 ce was calculated to be 68 3 5 times of the value 19 3 reported by zhao et al 2010 in which landfill leachate was treated by a bdd electrode operated in flow by mode such a high current efficiency confirms that rem is more energy efficient than traditional eaops operated in flow by or batch mode moreover the normalized treatment capacity per m2 rem of the pilot rem system no 2 is 875 l h calculated using equation s7 which is 9 84 times higher than the values reported for traditional eaop systems table s6 suggesting that a high capacity can be achieved by fewer materials in our system the overall cost of applying the pilot rem system no 2 to the advanced treatment of bio treated landfill leachate was estimated with the consideration of energy consumption pumping cost and capital cost the details were described in text s6 assuming a service lifetime of 5 years yang et al 2020 the cost is approximately 0 447 u s m3 it was estimated that the cost of the up to date landfill leachate treatment varies between 4 5 and 12 u s m3 in practical applications wu et al 2016 therefore the cost of applying the rem as a supplementary step for treating pre treated landfill leachate 0 45 u s m3 is less than 10 of the total cost of the overall treatment processes it should be noted that the varying labor cost and capital cost should be taken into account for different countries or locations generally if the rem technology is properly combined with cheap conventional biological and physicochemical processes it is possible to treat landfill leachates in compliance with direct disposal regulations in a cost effective manner 3 3 4 fouling in rem systems fouling is of major concern for the application of rem for the treatment of wastewater in our pilot scale experiments using one β pbo2 rem module the cod removal rate is consistent in a continuous five treatment cycles figure s8 indicating that the bio treated landfill leachate effluent did not cause fouling of the porous anode in this study and hence stable treatment performance was maintained these results are likely due to the following four reasons first the landfill leachate has been pretreated by biological processes so less organic matter is present second the operating pressure is very low 0 3 bar to achieve a high water flux 2 m3 m2 h for the no 2 system with four rem modules figure s9 this is because rems feature large pores median pore size of 42 49 μm fig 2a compared with microfiltration mf the pores in rem are 50 200 times larger than those of mf membranes 0 2 1 μm ince et al 2010 visvanathan et al 1994 hence the no 2 system can obtain at least 10 times higher water flux than mf 0 2 m3 m2 h at a 3 6 times lower pressure than mf 0 9 1 75 bar for the treatment of landfill leachate ince et al 2010 visvanathan et al 1994 third the high water flux can facilitate the movement of foulants through the large pores in rems and prevent the fouling formation by strong shear stress lastly organic foulants in the rems can be easily oxidized due to the strong oxidizing ability however it should be admitted that other inorganic foulant may cause fouling in both anode and cathode we have observed that 10 15 of hardness ions were removed table s5 because ca2 and mg2 can precipitate on the surface of cathode mainly in the form of caco3 and mgco3 respectively jaouhari et al 2000 the rem system is fully enclosed so the cathode scaling may affect its service lifetime hence a long term operation is needed in the future to systematically evaluate the fouling issues for the rem system 4 conclusion electro oxidation advanced treatment by the reactive electrochemical membrane rem is promising to treat bio treated landfill leachate this work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the rem process in treating landfill leachate at the laboratory and pilot scales the lab scale experiments show that β pbo2 rem and ti4o7 rem exhibited better performance than and ruo2 ir rem in mineralizing bio refractory organics removing ammonium nitrogen and reducing toxicity which is likely attributed to their strong ability to produce hydroxyl radical oh as for the oxidation mechanism the rem process preferentially removed humic like substances over soluble microbial byproduct like components based on the lab scale studies a pilot rem system no 2 with four β pbo2 rem modules in series was built which efficiently removed cod and nh4 n achieving compliance with the disposal regulations moreover the pilot rem system no 2 reduced the formation of toxic inorganic chlorinated byproducts due to its short hydraulic retention time and removed toxic metals compared with the widely reported traditional electro oxidation systems operated in batch or flow by mode the pilot rem system consumed 3 42 times less energy featured high current efficiency at 68 and achieved 9 84 times higher treatment capacity in summary this study suggested that the rem process is a more energy efficient way than current electrochemical technologies to remove refractory organics and ammonium nitrogen in landfill leachate and it is practical to be applied

17319,peracetic acid paa has been widely used as a disinfectant in many industries its use in poultry processing is steadily increasing however information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions paa and h2o2 on biological wastewater treatment processes used by the poultry processing industry is extremely limited the work reported here assessed the long term effect of paa solution on aerobic degradation and nitrification in three bioreactors fed with poultry processing wastewater by quantifying the extent of cod removal and nitrification rates changes in culture viability intracellular reactive oxygen species ros and microbial community structure were also evaluated cod removal and nitrification were not affected by h2o2 and paa solutions added to the wastewater before feeding indirect addition however both processes were significantly affected by high levels of h2o2 i e 27 mg l and paa solution i e 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 directly added to the reactors directly added paa h2o2 at 40 5 6 mg l was the lowest dose resulting in nitrification inhibition fast recovery of cod removal and nitrification was observed when direct addition of h2o2 and paa solution ended cell viability measurements revealed that the negative impact on nitrification was predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition rather than to loss of cell viability the impact on nitrification was not related to intracellular ros levels microbiome analysis showed major shifts in community composition during the long term addition of h2o2 and even more with paa addition no significant time trend change in the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria or nitrite oxidizing bacteria was observed further supporting the conclusion that the negative impact on nitrification was attributed mainly to enzyme inhibition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrogen peroxide aerobic degradation nitrification inhibition culture viability

range from 15 to 23 from 33 to 50 and from 5 to 11 respectively it is noteworthy that paa solutions used in poultry processing have relatively low h2o2 weight fractions to avoid oxidation and

the fate of paa in poultry processing waste streams paa concentrations in excess of 1 000 and 75 mg l were detected in the main chiller tank and chiller overflow respectively while paa was not detected in daf influent and underflow i e effluent wastewater during the normal plant operation chen and pavlostathis 2019 however 25 to 30 mg l paa was detected in the daf underflow wastewater at the end of the poultry processing plant daily operational shift which coincided with the emptying of chiller tanks industry reports make reference to paa in poultry processing wastewater causing severe upsets to biological wastewater treatment processes thus making it difficult to meet effluent discharge requirements however information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions on biological wastewater treatment processes commonly used by the poultry processing industry is extremely limited thus evaluation of the effect of paa on biological wastewater treatment processes typically used by the poultry processing industry is urgently needed it should be pointed out that information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions on biological processes is also relevant to treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater when paa is used in the treatment process train the overall goal of this study was to assess the long term effect of paa solution on aerobic organic matter degradation and nitrification biological processes commonly used for the treatment of poultry processing wastewater the following questions needed to be answered a do paa solutions and associated h2o2 inhibit aerobic degradation and nitrification in the treatment of poultry processing wastewater and if they do what are paa and h2o2 inhibitory levels b is the impact of paa solution on aerobic degradation and nitrification associated with enzyme inhibition and or decreased microbial culture viability c is the impact of paa and h2o2 reversible and does microbial acclimation take place over the long term operation with addition of paa and h2o2 to address these questions the following tasks were carried out aerobic bioreactors semi continuously fed with poultry processing wastewater amended with paa solution and h2o2 at increasing concentrations were operated for 166 d the effect of paa and h2o2 on aerobic degradation and nitrification was evaluated quantified in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal and nitrification rates microbial responses to paa solution such as culture viability and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were also evaluated complementary aerobic batch assays were conducted with single direct paa addition to determine potential acclimation taking place over the long term operation with addition of paa solution finally the microbial community diversity and composition over the long term operation with paa and h2o2 addition were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and wastewater peracetic acid 32 paa 45 acetic acid 6 h2o2 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa this paa solution closely matches typical paa solutions used in poultry processing which have relatively low h2o2 weight fractions as mentioned above h2o2 30 w w was purchased from vwr pittsburgh pa usa the paa and h2o2 stock and working solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c daf underflow wastewater was collected twice over a 6 month period at a poultry processing plant in the southeast us at mid plant operation shift chen and pavlostathis 2019 the daf wastewater was stored at 4 c in completely filled plastic containers with zero headspace the characteristics of the daf wastewater are discussed in text s1 supplementary material during storage at 4 c the daf wastewater cod concentration decreased by as much as 35 and its ammonium n concentration increased by as much as 100 the result of low microbial activity even at 4 c poultry processing in the study plant follows typical practices for the processing of broilers which in sequence include slaughtering scalding and plucking evisceration and organ removal carcass washing chilling and rinsing the wastewater streams from the above mentioned processes are combined and passed through the daf unit a typical primary treatment of poultry processing wastewater as mentioned above daf underflow wastewater is typically treated biologically in unit processes such as activated sludge and anaerobic lagoons the specific types varying from plant to plant in the case of the poultry processing plant used in this study daf underflow wastewater is discharged to a municipal sewer under an industrial pretreatment permit 2 3 setup and operation of bioreactors three semi continuously fed aerobic bioreactors r1 r2 and r3 were set up and maintained at room temperature 22 1 c the reactors started with stock culture from a lab scale reactor fed with daf wastewater over 2 5 years details of the stock culture are presented in text s2 and fig s1 the reactors were 2 8 l spinner cell flasks bellco glass inc vineland nj with a total culture volume of 1 5 l mixed with externally driven magnetic impeller assemblies aeration was achieved with pre humidified compressed air at a flow rate of 1 0 standard cubic feet per hour scfh the three reactors were fed as follows r1 daf wastewater only r2 daf wastewater and h2o2 added either in the feed indirect addition or directly in the reactor direct addition and r3 daf wastewater and paa solution indirect or direct addition indirect paa and h2o2 addition simulated treatment of wastewater devoid of residual paa and or h2o2 whereas direct addition simulated treatment of residual paa and h2o2 barring wastewater the reactors were fed every 2 d after settling for 1 h and removing 1 l supernatant 0 5 l mixed liquor was removed every 6 d the resulting hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt was 3 and 18 d respectively preliminary nitrification tests showed that for the stock culture used in this study and the levels of ammonium resulting from the aerobic degradation of daf wastewater the ph dropped below 6 5 which adversely affected the nitrification rate as a result at each feeding 500 mg l nahco3 was added to provide inorganic carbon to nitrifying bacteria and sufficient alkalinity to maintain a ph above 7 0 the long term operation of the reactors consisted of four phases fig s2 in phase i control the reactors were fed for 40 d with paa and h2o2 free daf wastewater operation of r1 was the same throughout the four phases in phase ii indirect h2o2 and paa solution addition before feeding the wastewater feed to r2 was amended with h2o2 at gradually increasing concentrations corresponding to the h2o2 concentrations in the paa solution amended feed to r3 aliquots of h2o2 and paa working solutions were added to the r2 and r3 wastewater feed respectively 40 min before feeding under these conditions h2o2 and paa were completely decomposed in the wastewater feed ph 6 5 to 7 0 the resulting nominal reactor h2o2 and paa initial concentrations were increased stepwise over time from 0 7 to 8 4 mg l h2o2 in r2 and from 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 in r3 fig s2 it should be noted that to above mentioned nominal reactor h2o2 and paa concentrations correspond to feed h2o2 and paa concentrations 1 5 fold higher equal to the ratio of culture and feed volume 1 5 1 0 thus the range of equivalent feed concentrations was 1 05 to 13 65 mg h2o2 l and 7 5 to 90 mg paa l in phase iii direct h2o2 and paa solution addition both r2 and r3 were fed as in phase ii but with direct addition of h2o2 and paa working solutions to the reactors immediately after adding the daf wastewater it should be noted that preliminary tests conducted with either direct or indirect followed by direct addition of paa h2o2 did not result in any significant difference relative to cod removal and nitrification inhibition the equivalent weight of paa and h2o2 is equal to their molecular weight paa 76 g mole h2o2 34 g mole thus in terms of equivalents one mole of h2o2 is 2 235 fold stronger oxidant than one mole of paa based on the above towards the end of phase iii and in order to match the oxidation capacity of paa in r3 after the last feeding of r2 with 8 4 mg l h2o2 27 mg l h2o2 were added directly to r2 which is equivalent to 60 mg l paa in terms of electron transfer during decomposition it should be noted that a nominal reactor concentration of 27 mg h2o2 l is equivalent to 40 5 mg h2o2 l in the feed in phase iv recovery phase all three reactors were maintained as in phase i fed with h2o2 and paa free daf wastewater the following parameters were monitored over the long term operation ph do soluble cod scod ammonium nitrite nitrate total and volatile suspended solids tss vss culture viability and intracellular ros 2 4 short term batch assays the purpose of these aerobic batch assays was to evaluate possible increased inhibitory effect of the paa solution on aerobic degradation and nitrification in r3 direct addition of paa solution and culture acclimation at different stages during the long term operation the batch assays were carried out in 580 ml glass aspirator bottles at the end of several feeding cycles during the long term operation of r1 450 ml of r1 mixed liquor was transferred to the bottle allowed to settle for 1 h and then 300 ml supernatant was replaced with an equal volume of daf wastewater along with 500 mg l nahco3 paa solution was directly added to the bottle resulting in initial paa h2o2 concentrations from 0 0 to 60 8 4 mg l the bottle contents were aerated with pre humidified compressed air incubation was carried at room temperature 22 1 c the following parameters were monitored over the incubation time ph do scod ammonium nitrite and nitrate initial and final tss and vss were also measured for all batch series 2 5 culture viability and intracellular ros culture viability based on cell membrane integrity and intracellular ros were measured in all three long term reactors at the end of phase ii iii and iv ros production is an important indicator of oxidative stress it has been used to evaluate the effect of strong oxidants e g h2o2 ma et al 2019 nanoparticles e g ceo2 nps wang et al 2016 and quantum dots yang et al 2012 both paa and h2o2 are strong reactive oxidants involved in ros producing chain reactions tolleson et al 2012 thus measurement of intracellular ros after addition of paa and or h2o2 was crucial in assessing how microbial cells respond to paa and h2o2 batch assays were also conducted with mixed liquor samples withdrawn from the long term control reactor r1 to measure culture viability and intracellular ros after direct addition of paa and h2o2 solutions up to 60 mg l each culture viability evaluated using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit cat no l7012 and intracellular ros determined using cellrox green reagent cat no c10444 molecular probes invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca were measured following standard protocols 2 6 analytical methods total solids ts volatile solids vs tss vss ph and cod were

measurements i e total n minus ammonium nitrite and nitrate multiplied by a conversion factor of 6 25 equivalent to 0 16 g nitrogen per gram of protein based on the general formula of c16h24o5n4 for protein the fraction of heterotrophic bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the stock mixed heterotrophic autotrophic culture was determined by using sodium azide nan3 and allylthiourea atu to inhibit aob and nob respectively and then measuring oxygen uptake rates as previously described surmacz gorska et al 1996 for relatively low paa and h2o2 concentrations i e 10 4 5 mg l paa h2o2 paa and h2o2 were measured by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha 2012 for relatively high i e 10 mg l paa and h2o2 the iodometric method was used apha 2012 bacterial dna extraction quantification sequencing as well bioinformatic analysis were performed as described in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactors performance operation of the three reactors r1 r2 and r3 lasted for 166 d fig s2 divided into four phases section 2 3 throughout the entire operation all three reactors were fed with daf wastewater every 2 d while r2 and r3 received h2o2 or paa solution respectively added to the feed 40 min ahead of feeding phase ii or directly added to the reactors after feeding with daf wastewater phase iii 3 1 1 phase i during phase i 40 d twenty 2 d feeding cycles all three reactors reached stable and similar performance the mean ph and do in the three reactors ranged from 8 1 to 8 4 and from 8 0 to 8 2 mg l respectively at 40 d of operation end of phase i the vss concentration was comparable across the three reactors ranging from 2 00 to 2 08 g l fig s3 the mean extent of soluble cod removal was not significantly different among all three reactors 93 2 1 5 p 0 05 table s2 the initial ammonium removal rate arr was also not significantly different among all three reactors 28 3 0 8 mg n l d p 0 05 at the end of phase i table s3 it should be noted that the reported arr is the net result of three simultaneous processes organic matter degradation leading to ammonification ammonium uptake due to microbial growth and ammonium oxidation to nitrite nitrite levels in all three reactors were always below 0 5 mg n l during phase i because nitrite was simultaneously produced from ammonium and oxidized to nitrate the rate of nitrate production indirectly reflects the nitrite oxidation rate the mean nitrate production rate npr across all three reactors was 62 1 3 3 mg n l d during phase i overall the performance of the three reactors was stable and similar during phase i 3 1 2 phase ii during phase ii day 40 to 94 twenty seven 2 d feeding cycles the performance of the three reactors was evaluated at five gradually increased h2o2 and paa levels 0 7 to 8 4 mg h2o2 l 5 to 60 mg paa l both added to the daf wastewater prior to feeding indirect addition the mean ph and do concentration in the three reactors were 8 8 2 and 7 8 8 1 mg l respectively at the end of phase ii the vss concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was 2 13 0 13 2 02 0 04 and 1 79 0 11 g l compared to the end of phase i the vss concentration in both r1 and r2 was similar but decreased by ca 14 in r3 the extent of scod removal and the initial net arr ranged from 92 to 97 and from 30 to 35 mg n l d across all three reactors during phase ii respectively the arr was not significantly different p 0 05 tables s2 and s3 nitrite concentrations were below 0 5 mg n l in all three reactors throughout phase ii along with the decrease in ammonium nitrate increased almost linearly fig s4b the npr ranged from 58 8 to 63 9 mg n l d across all three reactors and was not significantly different p 0 05 table s3 taken all together indirect addition of h2o2 and or paa solution at the above stated concentration range did not significantly affect organic matter degradation and nitrification 3 1 3 phase iii during phase iii day 94 to 160 twenty five to twenty seven feeding cycles h2o2 and paa h2o2 were added directly to r2 and r3 respectively after feeding with daf wastewater fig 1 a h2o2 and paa were not detected in r2 and r3 after feeding a result of fast decomposition in the complex matrix of the reactors feed and contents chen and pavlostathis 2019 the ph in r2 immediately upon h2o2 addition ranged from 7 5 to 7 8 as the h2o2 dose increased from 0 7 to 27 mg l the ph in r3 immediately upon paa addition varied from 7 5 to 6 8 as the paa h2o2 dose increased from 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l it should be noted that the above mentioned ph values are over an order of magnitude lower than the paa pka value of 8 2 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 thus for the short time paa lasted in the culture less than 15 min at a dose of 60 mg paa l paa existed in its un dissociated form ch3coooh which is considered to be the most effective form in terms of its biocidal activity luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 mcfadden et al 2017 the do was maintained at 7 8 to 8 1 mg l in both r2 and r3 the scod removal in r1 control ranged from 92 3 to 96 7 comparable to that during phase i and ii table s2 the scod removal in r2 varied from 92 6 to 99 6 up to 8 4 mg h2o2 l then decreased to between 86 9 and 87 5 at 27 mg h2o2 l the scod removal in r3 varied from 92 2 to 98 8 up to 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 then decreased to as low as 88 0 at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 4th feeding cycle table s2 thus given scod removal in r2 was not impacted by 8 4 mg l h2o2 the lower scod removal in r3 at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 is attributed to paa or paa in combination with h2o2 rather than to h2o2 in a previous study wet oxidation of a high strength pharmaceutical wastewater using h2o2 resulted in decreased cod as the h2o2 concentration increased zeng et al 2017 table s3 summarizes the initial arr at different stages of phase iii the relative arr rarr i e arr rates in r2 and r3 normalized to that in r1 are shown in fig 1b the rarr in r2 varied from 0 98 to 1 12 up to 8 4 mg h2o2 l and gradually decreased to as low as 0 43 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 27 mg h2o2 l the rarr in r3 varied between 0 82 and 1 12 up to the first feeding with 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 but declined to ca 0 36 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 given that h2o2 up to 8 4 mg l did not negatively affect the arr in r2 the observed decrease of arr in r3 at 40 5 6 and even more at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 is predominantly attributed to paa or the combination of paa and h2o2 therefore directly added paa solution negatively affected arr and the impact is predominantly attributed to paa pedersen et al 2009 reported that the arr in recirculating aquaculture systems was not affected by 1 mg paa l but decreased significantly at 2 and 3 mg paa l in addition pedersen et al 2012 reported that 64 mg h2o2 l significantly decreased the arr from 0 60 to 0 13 g n m2 d by a biofilter in a commercial recirculating aquaculture system nitrite in r1 was below 0 5 mg n l throughout phase iii table s3 in contrast the nitrite concentration in r2 increased with increased concentration of directly added h2o2 reaching ca 23 mg n l after the 4th direct addition of 27 mg h2o2 l fig s4h table s3 which represents ca 50 of the feed ammonium n concentration the nitrite concentration in r3 increased dramatically with increased concentration of direct addition of paa solution reaching ca 42 mg n l after the 4th direct addition with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 fig s4g table s3 which represents ca 90 of the feed ammonium n concentration therefore although 8 4 mg l h2o2 did not affect ammonium removal it affected nitrite removal however the effect of paa on nitrite oxidation was much more pronounced than that of h2o2 although in the study of pedersen et al 2012 64 mg l of h2o2 only marginally affected nitrite oxidation it resulted in significant scod release in the biofilter as a result of organic matter degradation solubilization given that h2o2 reacts with organic matter which quenches its oxidative effect combined with the fact that the biofilter biomass was attached as opposed to suspended the negative impact of h2o2 on biofilter nitrification was minimal compared to that observed in the present study suurnakki et al 2020 also reported that the nitrite oxidation rate in a biofilter at recirculating aquaculture systems was not affected by 1 1 mg paa l applied once per week but decreased significantly when paa was applied two and four times per week concluding that the impact of paa on nitrite oxidation was greater as the paa application frequency increased the relative npr rnpr i e npr rates in r2 and r3 normalized to that in r1 are shown in fig 1d similar to the effect of h2o2 on rarr in r2 the rnpr in r2 varied from 0 9 to 1 1 up to 8 4 mg h2o2 l and gradually decreased to as low as 0 3 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 27 mg h2o2 l the rnpr in r3 varied between 1 0 and 1 1 up to the first feeding with 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 and then declined to ca 0 2 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 given that h2o2 up to 8 4 mg l did not inhibit the npr in r2 the observed decrease of npr in r3 at 40 5 6 and even more at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 is predominantly attributed to paa or the combination of paa and h2o2 at the end of direct addition of 5 6 mg l h2o2 in r2 and 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 in r3 during phase iii the concentration of tss and vss in all three reactors was close to that at the end of phase ii fig s3 thus direct addition of h2o2 to r2 up to 5 6 mg l and paa solution to r3 up to 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 did not affect the biomass concentration however by the end of phase iii the vss concentration decreased by ca 6 7 and 20 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively compared to the vss at the mid of phase iii the higher vss loss in r3 is attributed to solids solubilization as well as bacteria lysis primarily caused by paa in the study of shang and hou 2009 when municipal sludge was pretreated with paa before anaerobic digestion the tss concentration decreased by 20 to 28 at a paa dose between 127 and 3059 mg l respectively suurnakki et al 2020 reported that the tss concentration of biofilters in recirculating aquaculture systems decreased by ca 33 to 45 after 1 1 mg paa l was directly applied four times a week 3 1 4 phase iv during phase iv i e recovery phase feeding daf wastewater only day 160 to 166 scod removal in r2 and r3 increased from the first to the third feeding and reached a value comparable to that of r1 table s2 the rarr in both r2 and r3 gradually increased and reached 1 02 and 1 01 respectively by the end of the 3rd feeding cycle table s3 fig 1b nitrite concentration in both r2 and r3 decreased to below 0 5 mg n l after the 3rd feeding cycle with h2o2 and paa free feed fig s4i the rnpr in both r2 and r3 gradually increased and reached 1 0 and 1 1 respectively by the end of the 3rd feeding cycle fig 1d thus fast recovery of organic matter degradation and complete nitrification was restored in both r2 and r3 when direct addition of h2o2 and paa solution ended 3 2 short term aerobic batch assays table s4 summarizes the extent of scod removal initial arr maximum observed nitrite level and npr during the short term batch assays conducted over time with mixed liquor from the long term r1 reactor then directly amended with paa solution up to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 the ph do soluble cod and nitrogen species trend during the short term batch assays is shown in fig 2 the do level immediately after feeding was low as the do concentration in the daf feed over the storage was low but increased with increased paa solution dose as a result of do released due to paa and h2o2 decomposition then the do level rapidly increased as a result of aeration with compressed air fig 2b the time trend of scod fig 2c and scod removal table s4 were comparable among all batch series and similar to those achieved by the long term r3 reactor upon the first direct addition of 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 however slightly lower scod removal 88 table s2 was observed during the last fourth feeding cycle of r3 with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 which is attributed to the long term operation of r3 with addition of the paa solution the tss and vss in the batch series with 5 0 7 and 10 1 4 mg l initial paa h2o2 were comparable to those in the control while the vss in series with 20 2 8 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l initial paa h2o2 direct addition was 10 18 and 29 lower than in the control respectively suggesting that paa h2o2 20 2 8 mg l caused cell lysis fig s5 complete ammonium removal was achieved within 30 h of incubation in all test series fig 2d and the arr ranged from 33 4 to 46 4 mg n l d without any particular trend relative to the added paa solution level table s4 the specific arr arr normalized to the mean vss of each series ranged from 18 1 to 26 3 mg n g vss d in contrast the specific arr in the long term r3 gradually decreased from 20 1 to 8 6 mg n g vss d with direct addition of 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 it is noteworthy that although the vss in both the batch assay series and the long term r3 decreased as the directly added paa solution level increased fig s5 the observed extent of decrease of the specific arr in the long term r3 was more than the decrease in its vss concentration thus over the long term operation of r3 with directly added increased paa and h2o2 levels its ammonium oxidation rate decreased showing an increasingly negative effect of the paa solution on the reactor s performance transient nitrite concentrations below 0 5 mg n l were observed in all batch series with initial paa h2o2 20 2 8 mg l while nitrite reached ca 20 and 28 mg n l in the series amended with 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l initial paa h2o2 respectively fig 2e table s4 complete nitrite removal was achieved in all batch series within 50 h of incubation fig 2e in contrast the maximum observed nitrite levels in the long term r3 after the first feeding with 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 were ca 60 and 30 higher respectively than in the batch series at the same initial paa h2o2 concentrations tables s3 and s4 the npr ranged from 63 to 74 mg n l d in series with paa h2o2 up to 40 5 6 mg l without any particular trend relative to the initial paa solution level while was ca 39 mg n l d in series with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 a decrease by 38 to 47 compared to the other batch series table s4 as discussed in section 3 1 the npr in the long term r3 gradually decreased from 66 0 to 14 1 mg n l d with direct addition of 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 table s3 thus over the long term operation of r3 with directly added increased paa and h2o2 levels npr increasingly decreased similar to the specific arr the decrease in the specific npr in the long term r3 by the end of phase iii was much higher than that observed with the batch series with direct addition of 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 suggesting that the observed extent of decrease of the npr in r3 over its long term operation was higher than the decrease in its vss concentration therefore the nitrification activity of the bioreactors declined over time during the long term operation with addition of paa solution indicating that acclimation of the microbial community to the paa solution did not take place in contrast to this observation rapid microbial acclimation to benzalkonium chlorides bacs common components in quaternary ammonium compounds qacs used as sanitizers in poultry processing plants was observed in a continuous flow biological nitrogen removal system while treating poultry processing daf wastewater amended with a mixture of bacs hajaya and pavlostathis 2012 2013 3 3 culture viability the viability i e fraction of live cells of the microbial communities in the three long term operated bioreactors was evaluated at the end of phase ii iii and iv with results shown in fig 3 a culture viability in r1 control was relatively the same across the three phases ranging from 85 to 87 at the end of phase ii culture viability in the three bioreactors was comparable ranging from 86 to 88 thus indirect addition of solutions up to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 and 8 4 mg h2o2 l did not impact culture viability in contrast viability in r2 and r3 at the end of phase iii was 8 and 22 lower than in r1 respectively thus direct addition of paa and or h2o2 decreased culture viability the paa effect was much greater than that of h2o2 it should be emphasized that reported culture viability values refer to the entire mixed bacterial communities given that the fraction of the heterotrophic bacterial population was over 90 text s2 the impact of paa and or h2o2 specifically on the nitrifier population size is difficult to determine by the end of phase iii the arr npr and culture viability in in r2 decreased by 60 58 and 8 and in r3 decreased by 67 77 and 22 respectively thus the long term impact of h2o2 in r2 and paa solution in r3 on nitrification is predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition rather than loss of cell viability at the end of phase iv culture viability in both r2 and r3 increased by 8 and 20 respectively both reaching a level comparable to the mean value in r1 ca 86 indicating that the impact on culture viability was fast reversed after direct addition of paa and or h2o2 ended thus given that the arr and npr in both r2 and r3 increased rapidly during phase iv and the increase was much more significant than the increase of culture viability it is concluded that the impact of h2o2 and paa on nitrification is predominantly attributed to their inhibitory effect on enzymes such as ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase and secondarily on the loss of cell viability over the long term operation in order to further evaluate culture viability in response to directly added paa and h2o2 culture viability was measured by conducting a batch assay with r1 mixed liquor amended with a range of initial paa solution or h2o2 levels with results shown in fig 3b compared to the control culture viability slightly increased in the culture series amended with paa solution at 5 0 7 to 20 2 8 mg l paa h2o2 attributed to the positive effect of acetic acid in the paa solution as well as that produced as a result of paa decomposition chen and pavlostathis 2019 thus acetate compensated for the negative effect of paa and h2o2 on culture viability compared to the control culture viability in series directly amended with paa solution at 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 was lower by ca 10 and 30 respectively therefore as the paa h2o2 concentration increased above 40 5 6 mg l the negative effect of paa on culture viability could not be offset by the positive effect of acetic acid culture viability in series amended with 5 to 60 mg l h2o2 decreased by 2 to 20 compared to the control thus direct addition of h2o2 also decreased culture viability but the decrease was lower compared to paa especially at 60 mg l lee et al 2016 demonstrated that cell membrane integrity was significantly and increasingly compromised by 5 000 mg l paa for contact time from 15 to 120 s wang et al 2020 demonstrated that cell membrane integrity of morganella psychrotolerans was increasingly compromised by 20 to 80 mg l paa for a 5 min contact time zhang et al 2019 showed holes formed in the center of e coli top10p cells with 8 to 60 mg l paa treatment for 15 min contact time direct addition of 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 resulted in comparable decrease of culture viability in the long term r3 and in the batch series 22 vs 30 but arr and npr decreased more in the long term r3 than in the batch series 64 vs 18 and 80 vs 45 respectively thus inhibition of nitrification related enzymes worsened over the long term operation of r3 with direct addition of paa solution 3 4 intracellular ros intracellular ros of the microbial communities in the three long term operated bioreactors was evaluated at the end of phase ii iii and iv with results shown in fig 4 a at the end of phase ii intracellular ros in r2 and r3 cultures was 6 and 19 lower than in r1 control respectively suggesting indirect addition of paa and or h2o2 either inhibited intracellular ros production or induced production of ros quenching enzymes e g catalase and superoxidase imlay 2008 or both at the end of phase iii the intracellular ros in r2 and r3 cultures was 13 lower and 8 higher than in r1 respectively suggesting that direct addition of 27 mg h2o2 l did not cause excess cell oxidative stress to the r2 microbial community but direct addition of 60 mg paa l caused a slight increase in cell oxidative stress to the r3 microbial community fig 4a overall h2o2 and paa did not significantly affect the intracellular ros of the h2o2 exposed r2 and paa h2o2 exposed r3 communities over the long term operation of these reactors in contrast nitrification was affected by the long term addition of h2o2 and even more by the addition of paa section 3 2 to a higher extent than intracellular ros thus intracellular ros did not affect nitrification rates as discussed in section 3 3 the decrease in nitrification rates over the long term operation with addition of h2o2 and paa h2o2 to r2 and r3 was predominantly the result of enzyme inhibition in order to further evaluate intracellular ros in response to added paa and h2o2 intracellular ros was measured in a batch assay conducted with r1 mixed liquor and direct addition of paa or h2o2 up to 60 mg l each with results shown in fig 4b the relative intracellular ros of the long term r1 culture directly exposed to h2o2 decreased as the h2o2 concentration increased reaching the lowest value of 0 13 at 20 mg l h2o2 then gradually increased to 0 94 at 60 mg l h2o2 in contrast the relative intracellular ros of the long term r1 culture directly exposed to paa solution decreased as the paa concentration increased reaching the lowest value of 0 60 at 10 1 4 mg l paa h2o2 then sharply increased to 2 2 at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 overall the r1 culture intracellular ros was much higher in response to the paa solution than to h2o2 the decrease of intracellular ros in r1 culture upon addition of low concentrations of h2o2 and paa solution is attributed to two factors a increased activity of intracellular enzymes e g catalase peroxides and superoxidase and b no or minor extracellular ros diffusion into the cells the increase in intracellular ros with increased concentration of h2o2 or paa solution is attributed to extracellular paa and h2o2 diffusion into the cells as well as other ros produced intracellularly by them such as oh a higher extent of cell membrane damage or both while the ros degrading enzymes of damaged cells could not quench them most ros have very short half life 10 6 s for o2 and 10 9 s for oh dickinson and change 2012 thus when formed extracellularly will not last long enough to diffuse into the cell however the half life of h2o2 and paa in the culture used in this study was 4 to 5 min h2o2 diffuses into cells across cell membrane as previously demonstrated seaver and imlay 2001 paa may also diffuse into cells fast paa diffusion into gram negative escherichia coli and gram positive enterococcus durans and staphylococcus epidermidis resulting in intracellular oxidative stress was recently demonstrated by zhang et al 2020 it is noteworthy that although the intracellular ros in the batch series of r1 culture directly amended with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 increased by 2 2 fold compared to the control the arr was comparable to that of the control thus the increased intracellular ros did not result in a decrease of arr the relative intracellular ros of the r1 culture exposed to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 was much higher than that of the long term r3 culture at the end of phase iii 2 2 vs 1 08 suggesting that the capacity of the long term r3 culture to manage cell oxidative stress increased during the long term operation with paa addition thus the observed significant decrease in nitrification rates both arr and npr over the long term operation of r3 with addition of paa solution was not related to intracellular ros 3 5 microbial community structure the results of microbial community analysis are discussed in detail in text s3 based on the shannon index the microbial community diversity in r1 control remained relatively constant throughout the 166 d of operation compared to r1 the diversity of the r2 and r3 communities was slightly higher at the end of phase ii indirect addition of h2o2 and paa solution but decreased at the end of phase iii direct addition of h2o2 and paa solution the decrease was significantly higher in the paa h2o2 amended reactor r3 than the h2o2 amended reactor r2 table s5 based on principle component analysis pca at order level from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii 94 to 160 d the microbial communities shifted significantly in the three reactors fig s6 on pc1 57 42 the communities shifted from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii especially in r1 indicating that the shifts on pc1 were attributed to the long term operation of the reactors under completely aerobic conditions compared to the stock mixed culture which was subjected to alternating aerobic anoxic aerobic phases weekly fig s1 on pc2 35 72 at the end of phase ii the r2 and r3 communities were clustered closely and away from the r1 community indicating that indirect addition of h2o2 and paa solutions resulted in a similar shift of the r2 and r3 communities respectively compared to the r1 community furthermore on pc2 35 72 the r1 community did not shift from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii however the r2 and r3 communities shifted significantly especially in r3 fig s6 suggesting that direct addition of paa solution to r3 led to a greater change of the microbial community composition than the direct addition of h2o2 in r2 table s6 summarizes the relative abundance of the top 30 abundant orders in the communities of the three reactors at the end of phase ii iii and iv fig 5 shows the relative abundance of the communities at order level across the three reactors the most abundant orders were flavobacteriales 9 to 41 rhodocyclales 5 to 11 rhizobiales 5 to 11 rhodobacterales 3 to 10 unclassified α proteobacteria 4 to 10 and unclassified acidobacteria gp4 1 to 9 from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii the relative abundance of flavobacteriales whose main function is organic matter degradation in r1 r2 and r3 decreased by 50 53 and 81 respectively the highest decrease in r3 suggests that flavobacteriales were negatively impacted by the long term operation with direct addition of paa solution by the end of phase iii the relative abundance of bdellovibrionales in r3 increased from 0 1 to 1 4 suggesting enrichment in response to paa solution addition from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii the relative abundance of rhodocyclales whose main function is fatty acids degradation increased by 7 in r1 and 17 in r2 but decreased by 53 in r3 suggesting that rhodocyclales were negatively affected by paa addition by the end of phase ii the relative abundance of nitrosomonadales whose main function is ammonium oxidation was 1 93 2 27 and 1 55 in r1 r2 r3 respectively the relative abundance of nitrospirales whose main function is nitrite oxidation was 2 22 2 55 and 1 79 in r1 r2 r3 respectively table s6 it should be noted that the relative abundance of both nitrosomonadales and nitrospirales was very low throughout the entire long term operation from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii there was no significant time trend change in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadales and nitrospirales in the three reactors however the relative abundance of both orders followed the series r2 r1 r3 thus as mentioned above the observed significant decrease in nitrification rates in r2 and r3 during phase iii was not associated with loss of nitrifiers 4 conclusions indirect and direct addition of h2o2 and paa at gradually increased concentrations up to 60 mg paa l and up to 27 mg h2o2 l did not significantly affect the aerobic degradation of poultry processing daf wastewater quantified as the extent of scod removal although h2o2 alone mildly affected nitrite oxidation to nitrate the effect of paa solution on nitrification was predominantly attributed to paa alone or in combination with h2o2 the impact of the paa solution on nitrification worsened and microbial acclimation did not take place over the long term operation both aerobic organic matter degradation and nitrification recovered fast after paa and or h2o2 direct addition ended the observed decrease in nitrification rates is predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition than to loss of nitrifiers intracellular ros was not the cause of the observed deterioration of nitrification over the long term operation with addition of h2o2 or paa h2o2 the capacity of the microbial community to manage paa induced cell oxidative stress increased over the long term operation with addition of paa solution though microbial diversity decreased significantly the microbial community composition shifted over the long term operation with addition of h2o2 and even more with addition of paa solution overall the results of this study suggest that aerobic organic matter degradation and nitrification of poultry processing wastewater will not be affected during the normal plant operation when residual paa and h2o2 are not present in the wastewater however nitrification will be affected when wastewater with high residual paa concentrations are expected at the end of the plant operation

17319,peracetic acid paa has been widely used as a disinfectant in many industries its use in poultry processing is steadily increasing however information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions paa and h2o2 on biological wastewater treatment processes used by the poultry processing industry is extremely limited the work reported here assessed the long term effect of paa solution on aerobic degradation and nitrification in three bioreactors fed with poultry processing wastewater by quantifying the extent of cod removal and nitrification rates changes in culture viability intracellular reactive oxygen species ros and microbial community structure were also evaluated cod removal and nitrification were not affected by h2o2 and paa solutions added to the wastewater before feeding indirect addition however both processes were significantly affected by high levels of h2o2 i e 27 mg l and paa solution i e 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 directly added to the reactors directly added paa h2o2 at 40 5 6 mg l was the lowest dose resulting in nitrification inhibition fast recovery of cod removal and nitrification was observed when direct addition of h2o2 and paa solution ended cell viability measurements revealed that the negative impact on nitrification was predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition rather than to loss of cell viability the impact on nitrification was not related to intracellular ros levels microbiome analysis showed major shifts in community composition during the long term addition of h2o2 and even more with paa addition no significant time trend change in the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria or nitrite oxidizing bacteria was observed further supporting the conclusion that the negative impact on nitrification was attributed mainly to enzyme inhibition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrogen peroxide aerobic degradation nitrification inhibition culture viability intracellular ros 1 introduction peracetic acid paa is a commonly used sanitizer by many industries such as food processing healthcare water and wastewater treatment and pulp and paper markets and

costa et al 2014 xue et al 2017 commercially available paa solutions are quaternary equilibrium mixtures of paa ch3coooh acetic acid ch3cooh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and water the h2o2 and paa weight fractions in commercial solutions range from 10 to 40 and from 3 to 40 respectively kim and huang 2020 paa acetic acid and h2o2 weight fractions in paa solutions typically used in poultry processing range from 15 to 23 from 33 to 50 and from 5 to 11 respectively it is noteworthy that paa solutions used in poultry processing have relatively low h2o2 weight fractions to avoid oxidation and darkening of the finished poultry carcasses paa in aqueous solutions decomposes mainly producing acetic acid and oxygen o2 or h2o2 zhao et al 2007 pereira da silva et al 2020 paa spontaneously and or

attributed to reaction with organics in particular proteins whereas reaction with inorganics such as transition metals is relatively slower domínguez henao et al 2018 in poultry processing wastewater

the fate of paa in poultry processing waste streams paa concentrations in excess of 1 000 and 75 mg l were detected in the main chiller tank and chiller overflow respectively while paa was not detected in daf influent and underflow i e effluent wastewater during the normal plant operation chen and pavlostathis 2019 however 25 to 30 mg l paa was detected in the daf underflow wastewater at the end of the poultry processing plant daily operational shift which coincided with the emptying of chiller tanks industry reports make reference to paa in poultry processing wastewater causing severe upsets to biological wastewater treatment processes thus making it difficult to meet effluent discharge requirements however information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions on biological wastewater treatment processes commonly used by the poultry processing industry is extremely limited thus evaluation of the effect of paa on biological wastewater treatment processes typically used by the poultry processing industry is urgently needed it should be pointed out that information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions on biological processes is also relevant to treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater when paa is used in the treatment process train the overall goal of this study was to assess the long term effect of paa solution on aerobic organic matter degradation and nitrification biological processes commonly used for the treatment of poultry processing wastewater the following questions needed to be answered a do paa solutions and associated h2o2 inhibit aerobic degradation and nitrification in the treatment of poultry processing wastewater and if they do what are paa and h2o2 inhibitory levels b is the impact of paa solution on aerobic degradation and nitrification associated with enzyme inhibition and or decreased microbial culture viability c is the impact of paa and h2o2 reversible and does microbial acclimation take place over the long term operation with addition of paa and h2o2 to address these questions the following tasks were carried out aerobic bioreactors semi continuously fed with poultry processing wastewater amended with paa solution and h2o2 at increasing concentrations were operated for 166 d the effect of paa and h2o2 on aerobic degradation and nitrification was evaluated quantified in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal and nitrification rates microbial responses to paa solution such as culture viability and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were also evaluated complementary aerobic batch assays were conducted with single direct paa addition to determine potential acclimation taking place over the long term operation with addition of paa solution finally the microbial community diversity and composition over the long term operation with paa and h2o2 addition were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and wastewater peracetic acid 32 paa 45 acetic acid 6 h2o2 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa this paa solution closely matches typical paa solutions used in poultry processing which have relatively low h2o2 weight fractions as mentioned above h2o2 30 w w was purchased from vwr pittsburgh pa usa the paa and h2o2 stock and working solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c daf underflow wastewater was collected twice over a 6 month period at a poultry processing plant in the southeast us at mid plant operation shift chen and pavlostathis 2019 the daf wastewater was stored at 4 c in completely filled plastic containers with zero headspace the characteristics of the daf wastewater are discussed in text s1 supplementary material during storage at 4 c the daf wastewater cod concentration decreased by as much as 35 and its ammonium n concentration increased by as much as 100 the result of low microbial activity even at 4 c poultry processing in the study plant follows typical practices for the processing of broilers which in sequence include slaughtering scalding and plucking evisceration and organ removal carcass washing chilling and rinsing the wastewater streams from the above mentioned processes are combined and passed through the daf unit a typical primary treatment of poultry processing wastewater as mentioned above daf underflow wastewater is typically treated biologically in unit processes such as activated sludge and anaerobic lagoons the specific types varying from plant to plant in the case of the poultry processing plant used in this study daf underflow wastewater is discharged to a municipal sewer under an industrial pretreatment permit 2 3 setup and operation of bioreactors three semi continuously fed aerobic bioreactors r1 r2 and r3 were set up and maintained at room temperature 22 1 c the reactors started with stock culture from a lab scale reactor fed with daf wastewater over 2 5 years details of the stock culture are presented in text s2 and fig s1 the reactors were 2 8 l spinner cell flasks bellco glass inc vineland nj with a total culture volume of 1 5 l mixed with externally driven magnetic impeller assemblies aeration was achieved with pre humidified compressed air at a flow rate of 1 0 standard cubic feet per hour scfh the three reactors were fed as follows r1 daf wastewater only r2 daf wastewater and h2o2 added either in the feed indirect addition or directly in the reactor direct addition and r3 daf wastewater and paa solution indirect or direct addition indirect paa and h2o2 addition simulated treatment of wastewater devoid of residual paa and or h2o2 whereas direct addition simulated treatment of residual paa and h2o2 barring wastewater the reactors were fed every 2 d after settling for 1 h and removing 1 l supernatant 0 5 l mixed liquor was removed every 6 d the resulting hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt was 3 and 18 d respectively preliminary nitrification tests showed that for the stock culture used in this study and the levels of ammonium resulting from the aerobic degradation of daf wastewater the ph dropped below 6 5 which adversely affected the nitrification rate as a result at each feeding 500 mg l nahco3 was added to provide inorganic carbon to nitrifying bacteria and sufficient alkalinity to maintain a ph above 7 0 the long term operation of the reactors consisted of four phases fig s2 in phase i control the reactors were fed for 40 d with paa and h2o2 free daf wastewater operation of r1 was the same throughout the four phases in phase ii indirect h2o2 and paa solution addition before feeding the wastewater feed to r2 was amended with h2o2 at gradually increasing concentrations corresponding to the h2o2 concentrations in the paa solution amended feed to r3 aliquots of h2o2 and paa working solutions were added to the r2 and r3 wastewater feed respectively 40 min before feeding under these conditions h2o2 and paa were completely decomposed in the wastewater feed ph 6 5 to 7 0 the resulting nominal reactor h2o2 and paa initial concentrations were increased stepwise over time from 0 7 to 8 4 mg l h2o2 in r2 and from 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 in r3 fig s2 it should be noted that to above mentioned nominal reactor h2o2 and paa concentrations correspond to feed h2o2 and paa concentrations 1 5 fold higher equal to the ratio of culture and feed volume 1 5 1 0 thus the range of equivalent feed concentrations was 1 05 to 13 65 mg h2o2 l and 7 5 to 90 mg paa l in phase iii direct h2o2 and paa solution addition both r2 and r3 were fed as in phase ii but with direct addition of h2o2 and paa working solutions to the reactors immediately after adding the daf wastewater it should be noted that preliminary tests conducted with either direct or indirect followed by direct addition of paa h2o2 did not result in any significant difference relative to cod removal and nitrification inhibition the equivalent weight of paa and h2o2 is equal to their molecular weight paa 76 g mole h2o2 34 g mole thus in terms of equivalents one mole of h2o2 is 2 235 fold stronger oxidant than one mole of paa based on the above towards the end of phase iii and in order to match the oxidation capacity of paa in r3 after the last feeding of r2 with 8 4 mg l h2o2 27 mg l h2o2 were added directly to r2 which is equivalent to 60 mg l paa in terms of electron transfer during decomposition it should be noted that a nominal reactor concentration of 27 mg h2o2 l is equivalent to 40 5 mg h2o2 l in the feed in phase iv recovery phase all three reactors were maintained as in phase i fed with h2o2 and paa free daf wastewater the following parameters were monitored over the long term operation ph do soluble cod scod ammonium nitrite nitrate total and volatile suspended solids tss vss culture viability and intracellular ros 2 4 short term batch assays the purpose of these aerobic batch assays was to evaluate possible increased inhibitory effect of the paa solution on aerobic degradation and nitrification in r3 direct addition of paa solution and culture acclimation at different stages during the long term operation the batch assays were carried out in 580 ml glass aspirator bottles at the end of several feeding cycles during the long term operation of r1 450 ml of r1 mixed liquor was transferred to the bottle allowed to settle for 1 h and then 300 ml supernatant was replaced with an equal volume of daf wastewater along with 500 mg l nahco3 paa solution was directly added to the bottle resulting in initial paa h2o2 concentrations from 0 0 to 60 8 4 mg l the bottle contents were aerated with pre humidified compressed air incubation was carried at room temperature 22 1 c the following parameters were monitored over the incubation time ph do scod ammonium nitrite and nitrate initial and final tss and vss were also measured for all batch series 2 5 culture viability and intracellular ros culture viability based on cell membrane integrity and intracellular ros were measured in all three long term reactors at the end of phase ii iii and iv ros production is an important indicator of oxidative stress it has been used to evaluate the effect of strong oxidants e g h2o2 ma et al 2019 nanoparticles e g ceo2 nps wang et al 2016 and quantum dots yang et al 2012 both paa and h2o2 are strong reactive oxidants involved in ros producing chain reactions tolleson et al 2012 thus measurement of intracellular ros after addition of paa and or h2o2 was crucial in assessing how microbial cells respond to paa and h2o2 batch assays were also conducted with mixed liquor samples withdrawn from the long term control reactor r1 to measure culture viability and intracellular ros after direct addition of paa and h2o2 solutions up to 60 mg l each culture viability evaluated using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit cat no l7012 and intracellular ros determined using cellrox green reagent cat no c10444 molecular probes invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca were measured following standard protocols 2 6 analytical methods total solids ts volatile solids vs tss vss ph and cod were measured following procedures outlined in standard methods apha 2012 do was measured by luminescence using a hach do meter hach loveland co usa volatile fatty acids vfas c1 to c7 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography zeng et al 2015 total n and total p were measured by the persulfate and ascorbic acid method respectively hach ammonium nitrite and nitrate were measured by the salicylate ferrous sulfate and chromotropic acid method respectively hach total carbohydrates were measured by the anthrone method gaudy 1962 crude protein was estimated based on organic n measurements i e total n minus ammonium nitrite and nitrate multiplied by a conversion factor of 6 25 equivalent to 0 16 g nitrogen per gram of protein based on the general formula of c16h24o5n4 for protein the fraction of heterotrophic bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the stock mixed heterotrophic autotrophic culture was determined by using sodium azide nan3 and allylthiourea atu to inhibit aob and nob respectively and then measuring oxygen uptake rates as previously described surmacz gorska et al 1996 for relatively low paa and h2o2 concentrations i e 10 4 5 mg l paa h2o2 paa and h2o2 were measured by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha 2012 for relatively high i e 10 mg l paa and h2o2 the iodometric method was used apha 2012 bacterial dna extraction quantification sequencing as well bioinformatic analysis were performed as described in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactors performance operation of the three reactors r1 r2 and r3 lasted for 166 d fig s2 divided into four phases section 2 3 throughout the entire operation all three reactors were fed with daf wastewater every 2 d while r2 and r3 received h2o2 or paa solution respectively added to the feed 40 min ahead of feeding phase ii or directly added to the reactors after feeding with daf wastewater phase iii 3 1 1 phase i during phase i 40 d twenty 2 d feeding cycles all three reactors reached stable and similar performance the mean ph and do in the three reactors ranged from 8 1 to 8 4 and from 8 0 to 8 2 mg l respectively at 40 d of operation end of phase i the vss concentration was comparable across the three reactors ranging from 2 00 to 2 08 g l fig s3 the mean extent of soluble cod removal was not significantly different among all three reactors 93 2 1 5 p 0 05 table s2 the initial ammonium removal rate arr was also not significantly different among all three reactors 28 3 0 8 mg n l d p 0 05 at the end of phase i table s3 it should be noted that the reported arr is the net result of three simultaneous processes organic matter degradation leading to ammonification ammonium uptake due to microbial growth and ammonium oxidation to nitrite nitrite levels in all three reactors were always below 0 5 mg n l during phase i because nitrite was simultaneously produced from ammonium and oxidized to nitrate the rate of nitrate production indirectly reflects the nitrite oxidation rate the mean nitrate production rate npr across all three reactors was 62 1 3 3 mg n l d during phase i overall the performance of the three reactors was stable and similar during phase i 3 1 2 phase ii during phase ii day 40 to 94 twenty seven 2 d feeding cycles the performance of the three reactors was evaluated at five gradually increased h2o2 and paa levels 0 7 to 8 4 mg h2o2 l 5 to 60 mg paa l both added to the daf wastewater prior to feeding indirect addition the mean ph and do concentration in the three reactors were 8 8 2 and 7 8 8 1 mg l respectively at the end of phase ii the vss concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was 2 13 0 13 2 02 0 04 and 1 79 0 11 g l compared to the end of phase i the vss concentration in both r1 and r2 was similar but decreased by ca 14 in r3 the extent of scod removal and the initial net arr ranged from 92 to 97 and from 30 to 35 mg n l d across all three reactors during phase ii respectively the arr was not significantly different p 0 05 tables s2 and s3 nitrite concentrations were below 0 5 mg n l in all three reactors throughout phase ii along with the decrease in ammonium nitrate increased almost linearly fig s4b the npr ranged from 58 8 to 63 9 mg n l d across all three reactors and was not significantly different p 0 05 table s3 taken all together indirect addition of h2o2 and or paa solution at the above stated concentration range did not significantly affect organic matter degradation and nitrification 3 1 3 phase iii during phase iii day 94 to 160 twenty five to twenty seven feeding cycles h2o2 and paa h2o2 were added directly to r2 and r3 respectively after feeding with daf wastewater fig 1 a h2o2 and paa were not detected in r2 and r3 after feeding a result of fast decomposition in the complex matrix of the reactors feed and contents chen and pavlostathis 2019 the ph in r2 immediately upon h2o2 addition ranged from 7 5 to 7 8 as the h2o2 dose increased from 0 7 to 27 mg l the ph in r3 immediately upon paa addition varied from 7 5 to 6 8 as the paa h2o2 dose increased from 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l it should be noted that the above mentioned ph values are over an order of magnitude lower than the paa pka value of 8 2 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 thus for the short time paa lasted in the culture less than 15 min at a dose of 60 mg paa l paa existed in its un dissociated form ch3coooh which is considered to be the most effective form in terms of its biocidal activity luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 mcfadden et al 2017 the do was maintained at 7 8 to 8 1 mg l in both r2 and r3 the scod removal in r1 control ranged from 92 3 to 96 7 comparable to that during phase i and ii table s2 the scod removal in r2 varied from 92 6 to 99 6 up to 8 4 mg h2o2 l then decreased to between 86 9 and 87 5 at 27 mg h2o2 l the scod removal in r3 varied from 92 2 to 98 8 up to 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 then decreased to as low as 88 0 at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 4th feeding cycle table s2 thus given scod removal in r2 was not impacted by 8 4 mg l h2o2 the lower scod removal in r3 at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 is attributed to paa or paa in combination with h2o2 rather than to h2o2 in a previous study wet oxidation of a high strength pharmaceutical wastewater using h2o2 resulted in decreased cod as the h2o2 concentration increased zeng et al 2017 table s3 summarizes the initial arr at different stages of phase iii the relative arr rarr i e arr rates in r2 and r3 normalized to that in r1 are shown in fig 1b the rarr in r2 varied from 0 98 to 1 12 up to 8 4 mg h2o2 l and gradually decreased to as low as 0 43 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 27 mg h2o2 l the rarr in r3 varied between 0 82 and 1 12 up to the first feeding with 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 but declined to ca 0 36 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 given that h2o2 up to 8 4 mg l did not negatively affect the arr in r2 the observed decrease of arr in r3 at 40 5 6 and even more at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 is predominantly attributed to paa or the combination of paa and h2o2 therefore directly added paa solution negatively affected arr and the impact is predominantly attributed to paa pedersen et al 2009 reported that the arr in recirculating aquaculture systems was not affected by 1 mg paa l but decreased significantly at 2 and 3 mg paa l in addition pedersen et al 2012 reported that 64 mg h2o2 l significantly decreased the arr from 0 60 to 0 13 g n m2 d by a biofilter in a commercial recirculating aquaculture system nitrite in r1 was below 0 5 mg n l throughout phase iii table s3 in contrast the nitrite concentration in r2 increased with increased concentration of directly added h2o2 reaching ca 23 mg n l after the 4th direct addition of 27 mg h2o2 l fig s4h table s3 which represents ca 50 of the feed ammonium n concentration the nitrite concentration in r3 increased dramatically with increased concentration of direct addition of paa solution reaching ca 42 mg n l after the 4th direct addition with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 fig s4g table s3 which represents ca 90 of the feed ammonium n concentration therefore although 8 4 mg l h2o2 did not affect ammonium removal it affected nitrite removal however the effect of paa on nitrite oxidation was much more pronounced than that of h2o2 although in the study of pedersen et al 2012 64 mg l of h2o2 only marginally affected nitrite oxidation it resulted in significant scod release in the biofilter as a result of organic matter degradation solubilization given that h2o2 reacts with organic matter which quenches its oxidative effect combined with the fact that the biofilter biomass was attached as opposed to suspended the negative impact of h2o2 on biofilter nitrification was minimal compared to that observed in the present study suurnakki et al 2020 also reported that the nitrite oxidation rate in a biofilter at recirculating aquaculture systems was not affected by 1 1 mg paa l applied once per week but decreased significantly when paa was applied two and four times per week concluding that the impact of paa on nitrite oxidation was greater as the paa application frequency increased the relative npr rnpr i e npr rates in r2 and r3 normalized to that in r1 are shown in fig 1d similar to the effect of h2o2 on rarr in r2 the rnpr in r2 varied from 0 9 to 1 1 up to 8 4 mg h2o2 l and gradually decreased to as low as 0 3 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 27 mg h2o2 l the rnpr in r3 varied between 1 0 and 1 1 up to the first feeding with 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 and then declined to ca 0 2 by the end of the 4th feeding cycle with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 given that h2o2 up to 8 4 mg l did not inhibit the npr in r2 the observed decrease of npr in r3 at 40 5 6 and even more at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 is predominantly attributed to paa or the combination of paa and h2o2 at the end of direct addition of 5 6 mg l h2o2 in r2 and 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 in r3 during phase iii the concentration of tss and vss in all three reactors was close to that at the end of phase ii fig s3 thus direct addition of h2o2 to r2 up to 5 6 mg l and paa solution to r3 up to 40 5 6 mg l paa h2o2 did not affect the biomass concentration however by the end of phase iii the vss concentration decreased by ca 6 7 and 20 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively compared to the vss at the mid of phase iii the higher vss loss in r3 is attributed to solids solubilization as well as bacteria lysis primarily caused by paa in the study of shang and hou 2009 when municipal sludge was pretreated with paa before anaerobic digestion the tss concentration decreased by 20 to 28 at a paa dose between 127 and 3059 mg l respectively suurnakki et al 2020 reported that the tss concentration of biofilters in recirculating aquaculture systems decreased by ca 33 to 45 after 1 1 mg paa l was directly applied four times a week 3 1 4 phase iv during phase iv i e recovery phase feeding daf wastewater only day 160 to 166 scod removal in r2 and r3 increased from the first to the third feeding and reached a value comparable to that of r1 table s2 the rarr in both r2 and r3 gradually increased and reached 1 02 and 1 01 respectively by the end of the 3rd feeding cycle table s3 fig 1b nitrite concentration in both r2 and r3 decreased to below 0 5 mg n l after the 3rd feeding cycle with h2o2 and paa free feed fig s4i the rnpr in both r2 and r3 gradually increased and reached 1 0 and 1 1 respectively by the end of the 3rd feeding cycle fig 1d thus fast recovery of organic matter degradation and complete nitrification was restored in both r2 and r3 when direct addition of h2o2 and paa solution ended 3 2 short term aerobic batch assays table s4 summarizes the extent of scod removal initial arr maximum observed nitrite level and npr during the short term batch assays conducted over time with mixed liquor from the long term r1 reactor then directly amended with paa solution up to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 the ph do soluble cod and nitrogen species trend during the short term batch assays is shown in fig 2 the do level immediately after feeding was low as the do concentration in the daf feed over the storage was low but increased with increased paa solution dose as a result of do released due to paa and h2o2 decomposition then the do level rapidly increased as a result of aeration with compressed air fig 2b the time trend of scod fig 2c and scod removal table s4 were comparable among all batch series and similar to those achieved by the long term r3 reactor upon the first direct addition of 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 however slightly lower scod removal 88 table s2 was observed during the last fourth feeding cycle of r3 with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 which is attributed to the long term operation of r3 with addition of the paa solution the tss and vss in the batch series with 5 0 7 and 10 1 4 mg l initial paa h2o2 were comparable to those in the control while the vss in series with 20 2 8 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l initial paa h2o2 direct addition was 10 18 and 29 lower than in the control respectively suggesting that paa h2o2 20 2 8 mg l caused cell lysis fig s5 complete ammonium removal was achieved within 30 h of incubation in all test series fig 2d and the arr ranged from 33 4 to 46 4 mg n l d without any particular trend relative to the added paa solution level table s4 the specific arr arr normalized to the mean vss of each series ranged from 18 1 to 26 3 mg n g vss d in contrast the specific arr in the long term r3 gradually decreased from 20 1 to 8 6 mg n g vss d with direct addition of 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 it is noteworthy that although the vss in both the batch assay series and the long term r3 decreased as the directly added paa solution level increased fig s5 the observed extent of decrease of the specific arr in the long term r3 was more than the decrease in its vss concentration thus over the long term operation of r3 with directly added increased paa and h2o2 levels its ammonium oxidation rate decreased showing an increasingly negative effect of the paa solution on the reactor s performance transient nitrite concentrations below 0 5 mg n l were observed in all batch series with initial paa h2o2 20 2 8 mg l while nitrite reached ca 20 and 28 mg n l in the series amended with 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l initial paa h2o2 respectively fig 2e table s4 complete nitrite removal was achieved in all batch series within 50 h of incubation fig 2e in contrast the maximum observed nitrite levels in the long term r3 after the first feeding with 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 were ca 60 and 30 higher respectively than in the batch series at the same initial paa h2o2 concentrations tables s3 and s4 the npr ranged from 63 to 74 mg n l d in series with paa h2o2 up to 40 5 6 mg l without any particular trend relative to the initial paa solution level while was ca 39 mg n l d in series with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 a decrease by 38 to 47 compared to the other batch series table s4 as discussed in section 3 1 the npr in the long term r3 gradually decreased from 66 0 to 14 1 mg n l d with direct addition of 5 0 7 to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 table s3 thus over the long term operation of r3 with directly added increased paa and h2o2 levels npr increasingly decreased similar to the specific arr the decrease in the specific npr in the long term r3 by the end of phase iii was much higher than that observed with the batch series with direct addition of 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 suggesting that the observed extent of decrease of the npr in r3 over its long term operation was higher than the decrease in its vss concentration therefore the nitrification activity of the bioreactors declined over time during the long term operation with addition of paa solution indicating that acclimation of the microbial community to the paa solution did not take place in contrast to this observation rapid microbial acclimation to benzalkonium chlorides bacs common components in quaternary ammonium compounds qacs used as sanitizers in poultry processing plants was observed in a continuous flow biological nitrogen removal system while treating poultry processing daf wastewater amended with a mixture of bacs hajaya and pavlostathis 2012 2013 3 3 culture viability the viability i e fraction of live cells of the microbial communities in the three long term operated bioreactors was evaluated at the end of phase ii iii and iv with results shown in fig 3 a culture viability in r1 control was relatively the same across the three phases ranging from 85 to 87 at the end of phase ii culture viability in the three bioreactors was comparable ranging from 86 to 88 thus indirect addition of solutions up to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 and 8 4 mg h2o2 l did not impact culture viability in contrast viability in r2 and r3 at the end of phase iii was 8 and 22 lower than in r1 respectively thus direct addition of paa and or h2o2 decreased culture viability the paa effect was much greater than that of h2o2 it should be emphasized that reported culture viability values refer to the entire mixed bacterial communities given that the fraction of the heterotrophic bacterial population was over 90 text s2 the impact of paa and or h2o2 specifically on the nitrifier population size is difficult to determine by the end of phase iii the arr npr and culture viability in in r2 decreased by 60 58 and 8 and in r3 decreased by 67 77 and 22 respectively thus the long term impact of h2o2 in r2 and paa solution in r3 on nitrification is predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition rather than loss of cell viability at the end of phase iv culture viability in both r2 and r3 increased by 8 and 20 respectively both reaching a level comparable to the mean value in r1 ca 86 indicating that the impact on culture viability was fast reversed after direct addition of paa and or h2o2 ended thus given that the arr and npr in both r2 and r3 increased rapidly during phase iv and the increase was much more significant than the increase of culture viability it is concluded that the impact of h2o2 and paa on nitrification is predominantly attributed to their inhibitory effect on enzymes such as ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase and secondarily on the loss of cell viability over the long term operation in order to further evaluate culture viability in response to directly added paa and h2o2 culture viability was measured by conducting a batch assay with r1 mixed liquor amended with a range of initial paa solution or h2o2 levels with results shown in fig 3b compared to the control culture viability slightly increased in the culture series amended with paa solution at 5 0 7 to 20 2 8 mg l paa h2o2 attributed to the positive effect of acetic acid in the paa solution as well as that produced as a result of paa decomposition chen and pavlostathis 2019 thus acetate compensated for the negative effect of paa and h2o2 on culture viability compared to the control culture viability in series directly amended with paa solution at 40 5 6 and 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 was lower by ca 10 and 30 respectively therefore as the paa h2o2 concentration increased above 40 5 6 mg l the negative effect of paa on culture viability could not be offset by the positive effect of acetic acid culture viability in series amended with 5 to 60 mg l h2o2 decreased by 2 to 20 compared to the control thus direct addition of h2o2 also decreased culture viability but the decrease was lower compared to paa especially at 60 mg l lee et al 2016 demonstrated that cell membrane integrity was significantly and increasingly compromised by 5 000 mg l paa for contact time from 15 to 120 s wang et al 2020 demonstrated that cell membrane integrity of morganella psychrotolerans was increasingly compromised by 20 to 80 mg l paa for a 5 min contact time zhang et al 2019 showed holes formed in the center of e coli top10p cells with 8 to 60 mg l paa treatment for 15 min contact time direct addition of 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 resulted in comparable decrease of culture viability in the long term r3 and in the batch series 22 vs 30 but arr and npr decreased more in the long term r3 than in the batch series 64 vs 18 and 80 vs 45 respectively thus inhibition of nitrification related enzymes worsened over the long term operation of r3 with direct addition of paa solution 3 4 intracellular ros intracellular ros of the microbial communities in the three long term operated bioreactors was evaluated at the end of phase ii iii and iv with results shown in fig 4 a at the end of phase ii intracellular ros in r2 and r3 cultures was 6 and 19 lower than in r1 control respectively suggesting indirect addition of paa and or h2o2 either inhibited intracellular ros production or induced production of ros quenching enzymes e g catalase and superoxidase imlay 2008 or both at the end of phase iii the intracellular ros in r2 and r3 cultures was 13 lower and 8 higher than in r1 respectively suggesting that direct addition of 27 mg h2o2 l did not cause excess cell oxidative stress to the r2 microbial community but direct addition of 60 mg paa l caused a slight increase in cell oxidative stress to the r3 microbial community fig 4a overall h2o2 and paa did not significantly affect the intracellular ros of the h2o2 exposed r2 and paa h2o2 exposed r3 communities over the long term operation of these reactors in contrast nitrification was affected by the long term addition of h2o2 and even more by the addition of paa section 3 2 to a higher extent than intracellular ros thus intracellular ros did not affect nitrification rates as discussed in section 3 3 the decrease in nitrification rates over the long term operation with addition of h2o2 and paa h2o2 to r2 and r3 was predominantly the result of enzyme inhibition in order to further evaluate intracellular ros in response to added paa and h2o2 intracellular ros was measured in a batch assay conducted with r1 mixed liquor and direct addition of paa or h2o2 up to 60 mg l each with results shown in fig 4b the relative intracellular ros of the long term r1 culture directly exposed to h2o2 decreased as the h2o2 concentration increased reaching the lowest value of 0 13 at 20 mg l h2o2 then gradually increased to 0 94 at 60 mg l h2o2 in contrast the relative intracellular ros of the long term r1 culture directly exposed to paa solution decreased as the paa concentration increased reaching the lowest value of 0 60 at 10 1 4 mg l paa h2o2 then sharply increased to 2 2 at 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 overall the r1 culture intracellular ros was much higher in response to the paa solution than to h2o2 the decrease of intracellular ros in r1 culture upon addition of low concentrations of h2o2 and paa solution is attributed to two factors a increased activity of intracellular enzymes e g catalase peroxides and superoxidase and b no or minor extracellular ros diffusion into the cells the increase in intracellular ros with increased concentration of h2o2 or paa solution is attributed to extracellular paa and h2o2 diffusion into the cells as well as other ros produced intracellularly by them such as oh a higher extent of cell membrane damage or both while the ros degrading enzymes of damaged cells could not quench them most ros have very short half life 10 6 s for o2 and 10 9 s for oh dickinson and change 2012 thus when formed extracellularly will not last long enough to diffuse into the cell however the half life of h2o2 and paa in the culture used in this study was 4 to 5 min h2o2 diffuses into cells across cell membrane as previously demonstrated seaver and imlay 2001 paa may also diffuse into cells fast paa diffusion into gram negative escherichia coli and gram positive enterococcus durans and staphylococcus epidermidis resulting in intracellular oxidative stress was recently demonstrated by zhang et al 2020 it is noteworthy that although the intracellular ros in the batch series of r1 culture directly amended with 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 increased by 2 2 fold compared to the control the arr was comparable to that of the control thus the increased intracellular ros did not result in a decrease of arr the relative intracellular ros of the r1 culture exposed to 60 8 4 mg l paa h2o2 was much higher than that of the long term r3 culture at the end of phase iii 2 2 vs 1 08 suggesting that the capacity of the long term r3 culture to manage cell oxidative stress increased during the long term operation with paa addition thus the observed significant decrease in nitrification rates both arr and npr over the long term operation of r3 with addition of paa solution was not related to intracellular ros 3 5 microbial community structure the results of microbial community analysis are discussed in detail in text s3 based on the shannon index the microbial community diversity in r1 control remained relatively constant throughout the 166 d of operation compared to r1 the diversity of the r2 and r3 communities was slightly higher at the end of phase ii indirect addition of h2o2 and paa solution but decreased at the end of phase iii direct addition of h2o2 and paa solution the decrease was significantly higher in the paa h2o2 amended reactor r3 than the h2o2 amended reactor r2 table s5 based on principle component analysis pca at order level from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii 94 to 160 d the microbial communities shifted significantly in the three reactors fig s6 on pc1 57 42 the communities shifted from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii especially in r1 indicating that the shifts on pc1 were attributed to the long term operation of the reactors under completely aerobic conditions compared to the stock mixed culture which was subjected to alternating aerobic anoxic aerobic phases weekly fig s1 on pc2 35 72 at the end of phase ii the r2 and r3 communities were clustered closely and away from the r1 community indicating that indirect addition of h2o2 and paa solutions resulted in a similar shift of the r2 and r3 communities respectively compared to the r1 community furthermore on pc2 35 72 the r1 community did not shift from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii however the r2 and r3 communities shifted significantly especially in r3 fig s6 suggesting that direct addition of paa solution to r3 led to a greater change of the microbial community composition than the direct addition of h2o2 in r2 table s6 summarizes the relative abundance of the top 30 abundant orders in the communities of the three reactors at the end of phase ii iii and iv fig 5 shows the relative abundance of the communities at order level across the three reactors the most abundant orders were flavobacteriales 9 to 41 rhodocyclales 5 to 11 rhizobiales 5 to 11 rhodobacterales 3 to 10 unclassified α proteobacteria 4 to 10 and unclassified acidobacteria gp4 1 to 9 from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii the relative abundance of flavobacteriales whose main function is organic matter degradation in r1 r2 and r3 decreased by 50 53 and 81 respectively the highest decrease in r3 suggests that flavobacteriales were negatively impacted by the long term operation with direct addition of paa solution by the end of phase iii the relative abundance of bdellovibrionales in r3 increased from 0 1 to 1 4 suggesting enrichment in response to paa solution addition from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii the relative abundance of rhodocyclales whose main function is fatty acids degradation increased by 7 in r1 and 17 in r2 but decreased by 53 in r3 suggesting that rhodocyclales were negatively affected by paa addition by the end of phase ii the relative abundance of nitrosomonadales whose main function is ammonium oxidation was 1 93 2 27 and 1 55 in r1 r2 r3 respectively the relative abundance of nitrospirales whose main function is nitrite oxidation was 2 22 2 55 and 1 79 in r1 r2 r3 respectively table s6 it should be noted that the relative abundance of both nitrosomonadales and nitrospirales was very low throughout the entire long term operation from the end of phase ii to the end of phase iii there was no significant time trend change in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadales and nitrospirales in the three reactors however the relative abundance of both orders followed the series r2 r1 r3 thus as mentioned above the observed significant decrease in nitrification rates in r2 and r3 during phase iii was not associated with loss of nitrifiers 4 conclusions indirect and direct addition of h2o2 and paa at gradually increased concentrations up to 60 mg paa l and up to 27 mg h2o2 l did not significantly affect the aerobic degradation of poultry processing daf wastewater quantified as the extent of scod removal although h2o2 alone mildly affected nitrite oxidation to nitrate the effect of paa solution on nitrification was predominantly attributed to paa alone or in combination with h2o2 the impact of the paa solution on nitrification worsened and microbial acclimation did not take place over the long term operation both aerobic organic matter degradation and nitrification recovered fast after paa and or h2o2 direct addition ended the observed decrease in nitrification rates is predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition than to loss of nitrifiers intracellular ros was not the cause of the observed deterioration of nitrification over the long term operation with addition of h2o2 or paa h2o2 the capacity of the microbial community to manage paa induced cell oxidative stress increased over the long term operation with addition of paa solution though microbial diversity decreased significantly the microbial community composition shifted over the long term operation with addition of h2o2 and even more with addition of paa solution overall the results of this study suggest that aerobic organic matter degradation and nitrification of poultry processing wastewater will not be affected during the normal plant operation when residual paa and h2o2 are not present in the wastewater however nitrification will be affected when wastewater with high residual paa concentrations are expected at the end of the plant operation
