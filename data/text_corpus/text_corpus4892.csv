therefore key components of various fish habitat models however hsc are developed at large scales e g river or regional scales that do not consider the differences that exist in available habitat conditions at smaller scales to address this problem a new look at hsc is taken through functional data analysis fda it is an appropriate framework adapted for hsc construction because in fda each observation is a curve or a function to illustrate the potential of fda for hsc a dataset of atlantic salmon salmo salar parr density and habitat variables constructed on two rivers was used functional regression models frm were built to predict site specific hsc based on the available habitat conditions for three salmon parr habitat variables water depth mean flow velocity and median substrate size frm explained a greater proportion of the variation in site specific hsc respectively 38 0 53 3 and 45 5 for depth substrate size and velocity compared to traditional hsc developed at the scale of each river or regionally that poorly fitted site specific hsc when hsc were aggregated into habitat suitability indices hsi weak relationships were found between hsi and parr density r 2 5 for all models traditional hsc and frm this study demonstrates that fda is an innovative framework that can be used to predict more representative site specific hsc adapted to differences in local available habitat the results suggested that its potential should be further exploited in habitat modelling keywords ecological modelling habitat suitability curves functional data analysis functional regression model fish habitat juvenile atlantic salmon 1 introduction habitat suitability curves hsc are used to model habitat preferences of a given species degraaf and bain 1986 morantz et al 1987 heggenes 1996 hsc are then used as a key component of habitat simulation models bovee 1982 leclerc et al 1995 in river ecology for example hsc are combined with outputs from a hydraulic model in tools such as phabsim bovee 1982 bovee et al 1998 habsim parasiewicz 2001 or casimir jorde et al 2001 habitat models are frequently used in river management allowing for the estimation of the potential fish production of a river to predict the effect of changes in flow regime on fish habitat or to simulate stream restoration measures e g leclerc et al 2003 tharme 2003 annear et al 2004 poff and zimmerman 2010 mocq et al 2013 hence hsc remain key components of habitat models ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 yi et al 2017 hsc are built using physical and biological measurements from either a single river hereafter referred to as river specific hsc leclerc et al 1996 guay et al 2000 or by combining data originating from multiple rivers hereafter referred to as regional hsc lamouroux et al 1999 mäki petäys et al 2002 hedger et al 2004 while best practices for habitat modelling recommend the use of river specific hsc such hsc are not always available due to their costly and time consuming development practitioners therefore often use hsc from other rivers or curves that were built using data and knowledge gathered at a regional scale according to the literature river specific hsc have shown poor transferability to other rivers groshens and orth 1993 leftwich et al 1997 guay et al 2003 strakosh et al 2003 moir et al 2005 except for a few situations freeman et al 1997 lamouroux et al 1999 mäki petäys et al 2002 in some studies river specific hsc even had weak predictive power for different reaches of the same river on which they were developed scott and shirvell 1987 bourgeois et al 1996 guay et al 2000 in general regional hsc increase the transferability between rivers but lead to relatively low predictive power hedger et al 2004 given the poor performance and transferability of river or regional hsc some studies have proposed the development of hsc from experts knowledge rather than physical and biological measurements jorde et al 2001 ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 mocq et al 2013 beaupré et al 2020 expert models have shown good potential for model improvement when applied to new rivers e g mocq et al 2013 however these models were mostly applied on only one or few rivers which limits the conclusions that can be drawn in terms of performance and transferability hsc are most often developed from averaging habitat conditions across many sites in a stream e g guay et al 2000 hedger et al 2004 or from experts knowledge of general habitat preferences e g jorde et al 2001 mocq et al 2013 consequently these models are not designed to account for site specific differences that exist in available habitat that can cause local divergence in habitat selection rosenfeld et al 2011 when a stream or a reach has more of less suitable habitat because of the geomorphic conditions and or fragmented habitat fish may be forced to occupy suboptimal habitat at higher frequencies this will result in a shift of the locally calibrated hsc toward a different optimum than those established in streams with a wider range of suitable habitat conditions leading to a poor fit of hsc when transferred among sites or streams that differ in available habitat not considering local differences in available habitat may thus explain the low predictive power e g guay et al 2000 hedger et al 2004 and relatively low transferability e g leftwich et al 1997 guay et al 2003 of traditional habitat models to our knowledge all hsc that were considered in the literature have ignored these local differences in available habitat conditions one justification for this oversight may be linked to the fact that systematically adapting models to various scenarios of available habitat conditions could become difficult if not impossible to apply in an operational context i e in habitat model implementations fortunately recent developments in some statistical methods and their implementation in modern software e g ramsay and silverman 2005 open the possibility of producing site specific hsc that naturally account for differences that exist in habitat conditions at smaller scales without complicating subsequent analyses the actual definition of an hsc i e a curve makes it conducive to the development of a new approach using the functional data analysis fda framework ramsay 1982 fda allows observations to be treated as curves or functions rather than scalar or vector observations in traditional contexts ramsay and silverman 2005 fda has become very popular in recent years both in hydrology e g chebana et al 2012 masselot et al 2016 ternynck et al 2016 larabi et al 2017 boudreault et al 2019 and ecology e g ainsworth et al 2011 embling et al 2012 stewart koster et al 2014 yen et al 2015 di battista et al 2016 boudreault et al 2021 enabling several types of novel analyses such as functional clustering jacques and preda 2014 functional analysis of variance górecki and smaga 2019 and functional regression morris 2015 functional regression models frm appear to be the most appropriate tool in our context by allowing to model a response variable curve like an hsc from inputs that are either scalar values scalar on function models curves function on function models or both morris 2015 frm can thus capture the variation in hsc between reaches by creating a function that modifies the shape of the hsc the response in frm based on reach specific predictors e g depth velocity related to intersite variation in available habitat this makes frm ideally suited for modelling hsc based on available habitat conditions furthermore function on function frm allows the predictor variable to also be included in the model as a curve hence it becomes possible to create a model that links the hsc response curve to the local distribution of available habitat conditions predictor curve by design this frm accounts for local differences that exist in available habitat conditions compared to traditional hsc construction that aggregates habitat conditions and preferences across all sampled sites indeed traditional model fitting generate a single average curve to predict hsc using data integrated across multiple sites that most likely differ in available habitats and their use on the other hand frm can fit individual curves to each site allowing for local prediction of hsc that functionally accounts for differences in available habitat thus addressing an important challenge in fish habitat modelling the benefits associated with site specific hsc could lead to better performance at both river and regional scales i e increased performance and transferability and less field work required to develop locally adapted hsc based on available habitat in this study we apply functional regression to build predictive models for site specific hsc using juvenile atlantic salmon salmo salar as an example to test and compare the proposed approach traditional hsc are also developed at river and regional scales 2 material and methods 2 1 data collection data on juvenile atlantic salmon salmo salar were collected during the summer of 2017 on two rivers located in the province of quebec canada figure 1 the first river is the sainte marguerite river which flows into the saguenay river a tributary of the st lawrence river the sainte marguerite river consists of two main branches main and northeast of similar sub basins sizes and a total watershed of 2118 km2 discharge was only recorded on the northeast branch 48 16 5 n 69 54 33 w 1 km from the main branch confluence with the northeast branch and 3 km from the sainte marguerite s mouth with a mean annual value of 30 1 m3 s based on records from 1999 to 2019 all measurements in this study were made on the main branch the second river is the petite cascapedia river it flows into the baie des chaleurs in the gaspésie region at its gauging station 48 13 56 n 65 43 59 w located 11 km upstream of its mouth it has a drainage basin area of 1340 km2 and a mean annual discharge of 30 6 m3 s based on records from 1982 2004 and 2012 2020 for each river several small reaches hereafter referred to as sites were surveyed with biological and physical measurements as described in section 2 1 of boudreault et al 2021 for the sainte marguerite river and section 2 4 2 of beaupré et al 2020 for the sainte marguerite and petite cascapedia rivers each site consisted of 30 habitat patches of 4 m2 equally distributed along 5 transects i e six patches per transect figure 1 studied sites were 75 m long and had the same width as the river all sites were at least 500 m apart along the river to ensure independence sites were semi systematically selected to cover a wide diversity of habitat conditions such as pools riffles glides etc habitat patches were fished using a smith root lr24 electrofisher with a single pass open net technique beaupré et al 2020 boudreault et al 2021 all fish caught were identified to species except for cyprinids but only juvenile salmon were measured at fork length and then classified as fry 0 or parr 1 2 prior to release on the sainte marguerite river juvenile salmon 30 54 mm long were classified as 0 55 87 mm long as 1 and 88 125 mm long as 2 figure 2 a on the petite cascapedia river fish 42 62 mm long were classified as 0 63 92 mm long as 1 and 93 132 mm long as 2 figure 2b for all patches physical measurements such as water depth mean flow velocity and median substrate size d50 were measured after electrofishing to ensure that enough fish were observed to build site specific hsc only sites with at least four observed juvenile salmon were kept for the analysis this criterion was chosen as a trade off between 1 having as many sites as possible and 2 having enough observations at each site to build credible site specific hsc this criterion has led us to combine data for parr of ages 1 and 2 hereafter referred to as parr indeed parr was the juvenile atlantic salmon life stage having the highest number of sites fulfilling our criterion with n 36 sites compared to fry n 30 1 parr n 28 and 2 parr n 8 hence this study solely focused on parr and considered 1 and 2 parr together as done in recent literature e g mocq et al 2018 beaupré et al 2020 to develop the models presented in the following sections the three most important and commonly studied habitat variables for juvenile atlantic salmon habitat were considered depth d50 and velocity e g guay et al 2000 hedger et al 2004 mocq et al 2013 these measured physical habitat variables were then categorized into two classes available and selected the first class available corresponded to all physical measurements regardless of parr presence or absence the second class selected corresponded only to the physical measurements at patches where parr were observed summary statistics of physical and biological measurements collected on the two rivers are reported in table 1 2 2 traditional habitat suitability curves hsc hsc are defined in different ways in the literature ranging from experts knowledge category i frequency of habitat use category ii and preference category iii bovee et al 1998 preference hsc are favored against frequency of use hsc because they are corrected for available habitat characteristics manly et al 2007 various methods exist to derive preference hsc such as forage ratio bovee et al 1998 jacobs index jacobs 1974 and ivlev electivity index ivlev 1961 forage ratio is the most popular and familiar index of preference according to bovee et al 1998 and jowett et al 2008 it is calculated by dividing the frequency of selected habitat by the frequency of available habitat variable in each class of a variable and by normalising the result to a maximum value of 1 that represents the most preferred habitat condition manly et al 2007 forage ratios were used in this study hereafter referred to simply as hsc frequencies of selected and available habitat were estimated by kernel density estimates kde hayes and jowett 1994 jowett et al 2008 a kde is defined as follows tukey 1977 1 f s 1 n h i 1 n k s s i h where f s is the estimated kde s 1 s n are univariate independent and identically distributed random variables with unknown probability density function n is the number of observations k is the kernel often the standard normal density function and h is called the bandwidth and is a parameter that can be adjusted for smoothness rudemo 1982 before adjusting kde habitat variables were right censored to 99 percentile of their whole distribution to avoid right wavy tails in the kde estimates where only very few observations were made for consistency of the kde with the observed empirical distributions kde were plotted along with the histograms to validate the choice of the bandwidth parameter as done in boudreault et al 2021 a unique bandwidth value was chosen for each habitat variable hsc were computed by dividing the frequency of selected habitat by the frequency of available habitat and then scaled to a maximum value of 1 as explained above hayes and jowett 1994 for each of the considered habitat variable depth d50 and velocity three hsc were developed based on measurements from 1 the sainte marguerite river hsc sm 2 the petite cascapedia river hsc pc and 3 both rivers hsc reg the objective behind developing hsc at various scales i e river and regional was to correctly assess performance of traditional hsc and their transferability to other rivers compared to the newly introduced method described below finally once univariate hsc are built they can be combined into a unique multivariate habitat suitability index hsi using multiplication e g vadas and orth 2001 arithmetic or geometric means e g gard 2014 or other more sophisticated ways such as regression e g guay et al 2000 hsi were computed at each patch using the standard method of multiplication to further validate our results 2 3 functional data analysis fda and functional regression models frm in fda curves or functions represent the response variable to be modelled and or the predictor variable s and need to be constructed from the observed discrete data a usual initial step in fda is to fit a known function e g a linear combination of basis functions to the observations ramsay and silverman 2005 2 f s m 1 m c m φ m s s ω where f is a continuous function ϕm are the known basis functions cm are the coefficients to be estimated m is the number of basis functions and ω is the domain over which f is constructed equation 2 is the traditional way to estimate a functional observation from discrete observations however new approaches for fitting frm can now directly use the observed points on the continuous function without the need to first estimate the underlying continuous function brockhaus et al 2015 hence this prior step was not performed for the current application of frm there were two curves to be estimated for each site i the response curve y i which represents the local hsc at site i and the predictor curve x i which represents the local available habitat a natural choice for xi was to consider the kde of the available habitat conditions for the same variable used to build the hsc for example the kde of available depths was used as a predictor to model the hsc for depth the logic here is that depths chosen by fish and therefore the empirical hsc for depth are influenced by the depths that are available which becomes the predictor function the same applies for the velocity and d50 models function on function frm were used morris 2015 the simplest model of this class is called the concurrent model e g goldsmith and schwartz 2017 it is the equivalent of the linear model but with both response and predictor functional variables 3 y i s α s β s x i s ε i s s ω where y i and x i represent respectively the hsc and the kde of available habitat conditions for a given habitat variable for the studied site i 1 2 36 ω is the domain over which y and x are observed and ε i is the error term in this model the intercept α and the regression coefficient β are also functions their definition is the same as f in eq 2 a linear combination of known basis functions and coefficients to be estimated model 3 only allows the predictor x i at point s or at a fixed lag s l to be used to predict y i at s ramsay and silverman 2005 in order to take into account the complete information on the available habitat conditions all the values of the predictor curves need to be used to predict y at s hence the fully functional linear model is introduced 4 y i s α s ω 2 β r s x i r dr ε i s s ω 1 where β r s is now a surface that represents the effect of x i at any point r on y i and ω1 and ω2 are respectively the domains of y i and x i in our case ω1 ω2 in model 4 all the values of x i are now being used to model the value of y i at s which is more adapted to our current study than model 3 one can note that model 3 is a special case of model 4 where β r s only takes values on the diagonal s r hence only model 4 was considered in this study hereafter referred to simply as frm all analyses were conducted in r r core team 2021 to calibrate frm defined in 4 the fdboost package was used brockhaus et al 2017b the parameters of the regression coefficients were estimated with a component wise gradient boosting algorithm and the minimized loss function was the mean square error bühlmann and hothorn 2007 brockhaus et al 2017a 5 i 1 n ω 1 y i s y i s 2 d s optimal parameters of the model were found with a method called early stopping brockhaus et al 2017a briefly the iterative procedure was stopped when the mean square error calculated with cross validation stops decreasing and begins to increase early stopping avoids overfitting the model and leads to more regularized coefficients brockhaus et al 2017c to assess the uncertainty of the estimated effects standard errors of the intercept and the regression coefficients surface were computed using bootstrapping with 1000 replications as done in masselot et al 2018 it can be seen that traditional hsc described in section 2 2 can be defined as a very simple frm such as equation 3 with no predictor and only an intercept function α this similarity demonstrates that the fda framework is well suited for hsc construction and that performance metrics described in the next section can be calculated for both frm and traditional hsc 2 4 performance criteria to assess the performance of the models to predict site specific hsc two functional equivalents of the traditional r 2 were calculated ramsay and silverman 2005 the first one denoted fr 2 measures the percentage of variation in the data explained by the model adapted for functional observations fr 2 is calculated as follows 6 f r 2 1 i 1 n ω y i s y i s 2 d s i 1 n ω y i s y 2 d s where y i s and y i s are respectively the observed and predicted response curve y is the mean observation ω is the domain over which y is observed and n is the number of functional observations in addition to the fr 2 an alternate version was also calculated altfr 2 in case studies working with functional data it is of interest to know how the model performs compared to a model containing only a functional intercept α in our case the model with the functional intercept only is the average hsc that does not account for variation among sites as explained above altfr 2 was computed as follows 7 a l t f r 2 1 i 1 n ω y i s y i s 2 d s i 1 n ω y i s y s 2 d s where the mean observation y in the denominator of equation 6 is replaced the mean functional observation y s i 1 n y i s n note that in the functional context both fr 2 and altfr 2 can take on negative values if the fit is worse with y i s compared to y and y s respectively ramsay and silverman 2005 the two above criteria were also calculated with cross validation given that the number of studied sites was small n 36 functional observations a leave one out cross validation procedure was performed quenouille 1949 basically one site was removed from the dataset prior to fitting the model then the resulting model was used to predict the hsc at the removed site this procedure was repeated for all sites to calculate performance measures with leave one out cross validation y i s was replaced by y i s in eqs 6 and 7 where y i s is the predicted hsc for site i when this site was removed from the dataset prior to fitting the model apart from cross validation all performance metrics were calculated separately for the sites studied on the sainte marguerite river the petite cascapedia river and both simultaneously these additional results were helpful to check the adequacy of the models on the same river as they were calibrated but also on the river on which they were not developed this refers to the concept of transferability as discussed in the introduction of the paper as a final validation of the developed hsc hsi values were regressed against observed fish densities e g guay et al 2000 2003 beaupré et al 2020 r 2 values were reported as a measure of the ability of hsi to explain fish density 3 results 3 1 traditional habitat suitability curves hsc results traditional habitat suitability curves are reproduced in fig 3 on the sainte marguerite and petite cascapedia rivers two preferred depths ranges were noted fig 3 left panels 20 25 cm and 55 65 cm shallow waters 15 cm were mostly avoided by parr these results were consistent across rivers preferred d50 values ranged from 60 mm to 130 mm on the sainte marguerite river fig 3 top center on the petite cascapedia river the available substrate sizes were smaller than on the sainte marguerite river however the hsc of the petite cascapedia river also showed that parr appeared to prefer larger 80 110 mm substrate sizes fig 3 middle center after combining measurements from the sainte marguerite and petite cascapedia rivers for the regional model the 60 130 mm range remained the most preferred d50 values among the two rivers fig 3 bottom center parr mostly avoided smaller substrates 50 mm for velocity preferred values were between 0 25 and 0 35 m s fig 3 right panels on both rivers velocities greater than 1 m s were less available and did not seem to be preferred by parr 3 2 functional regression models frm results resulting hsc and kde for three sites two on the petite cascapedia river and one on the sainte marguerite river along with histograms of available and selected habitat characteristics are reproduced in fig 4 an illustration of all hsc and kde is available in supplementary material kde of available habitat and hsc were used as direct inputs for frm described in this section frm for the three habitat variables are reproduced in fig 5 for the intercept left panels the regression coefficients surface center panels and its standard error right panels to correctly read and interpret the frm regression surfaces and their standard error some explanations must first be given the x axis corresponds to the values of the available habitat variable while the y axis corresponds to the values of the hsc the regression coefficient surface shows the relationship between an increase or a decrease in the availability of the habitat variable x axis and the hsc for values on the y axis a red region indicates a positive relation between availability and hsc an increase decrease in habitat variable availability is correlated to an increase decrease in the hsc on the other hand a blue region indicates a negative relation the conditional tense is used through the results as these relations are correlation rather than causation 3 2 1 frm for depth as for traditional hsc frm for depth also showed that two ranges of depths were preferred by parr 25 35 mm and 50 60 mm and that both shallowest 10 cm and deepest 70 cm waters were avoided as illustrated by the intercept function fig 5 top left the red region at the bottom left of the surface indicated that increasing availability of shallow water depths 0 15 cm may be linked to an increased hsc for slightly higher values of depths 0 25 cm fig 5 top center also available depths in the range 60 80 cm seemed to favor higher values of hsc for depths in the range 40 80 mm while reducing the hsc for shallower depths 0 20 cm the standard error of the surface was relatively low fig 5 top right 3 2 2 frm for median substrate size d50 according to the intercept function the range of preferred d50 values for parr was from 50 mm to 70 mm fig 5 middle left parr seemed to avoid low 25 mm and high 175 mm values of d50 the regression coefficients surface showed that availability of substrate ranging from 100 mm to 200 mm tended to increase the hsc for such values and decrease the hsc for smaller substrate sizes 100 mm blue region on the surface fig 5 middle center a smaller effect was the increased availability of small substrates 10 60 mm that tended to reduce the hsc for higher values 70 mm to 150 mm the standard error of the surface was greater for high values of available substrate sizes i e 170 mm fig 5 middle right 3 2 3 frm for velocity velocities from 0 20 m s to 0 40 m s were preferred by parr as shown by the intercept function fig 5 bottom left faster currents 1 m s were mostly avoided the regression coefficient surface indicated that increasing the availability of high velocities 1 m s may increase the hsc for slightly smaller values of velocities in the range of 0 40 m s to 1 m s as illustrated by the red region fig 5 bottom center the regression coefficient surface was close to 0 elsewhere for very high values of velocities 1 25 m s the regression coefficient surface had a higher standard error fig 5 bottom right 3 3 performance metrics and comparison 3 3 1 site specific habitat suitability curves hsc performance the performance of site specific hsc modelling expressed by fr 2 values are reported in table 2 the performance on the sainte marguerite river was the highest with the frm for all three habitat variables fr 2 of 0 480 0 543 and 0 511 respectively for depth d50 and velocity for all traditional hsc hsc sm hsc pc and hsc reg these models performed poorly to explain variation in site specific hsc with negative values of fr 2 these results suggest that traditional river or regional hsc are not adapted for local differences in site specific hsc on the petite cascapedia river the same conclusions apply frm explained a large proportion of the variability for all three site specific hsc fr 2 of 0 278 0 499 and 0 404 for depth d50 and velocity while all traditional hsc performed poorly among traditional hsc applied to the petite cascapedia river the hsc developed on the petite cascapedia river hsc pc performed better than the others for depth and d50 while the hsc developed regionally hsc reg performed better for velocity however all fr 2 values were negative for traditional hsc so hsc developed at the river or regional scale did not fit well site specific hsc on the petite cascapedia river when all sites from the two rivers were considered the frm again performed better than regional hsc at modelling site specific hsc with higher fr 2 values 0 380 0 533 and 0 455 for depth d50 and velocity versus negative values for the regional hsc when looking at the performance metrics calculated with the leave one out cross validation the same conclusions apply suggesting that frm were not overfitted in conclusion frm correctly modelled the differences in local hsc observed at each site with high values of fr 2 while none of the traditional hsc was able to represent these local differences in site specific hsc to further validate the different models altfr 2 was also computed table 2 with lower values than fr 2 values recall that altfr 2 compares the predicted hsc to a mean functional observation which already explains a great proportion of the variability in hsc when comparing traditional hsc and frm based on altfr 2 values the same conclusions as above apply regarding frm altfr 2 highlighted the added value of considering available habitat in the models versus using only a functional intercept with altfr 2 values ranging from 0 036 to 0 414 both depth and d50 frm obtained higher values of altfr 2 when applied to one or two rivers however two frm had lower altfr 2 values the d50 frm applied to the petite cascapedia river altfr 2 of 0 036 and the velocity frm applied to the sainte marguerite river altfr 2 of 0 026 such results may signify that local differences in available substrate and velocity values among sites were lower on the sainte marguerite and the petite cascapedia rivers respectively such that parr were exposed to the optimal values that they could use at will in cross validation the altfr 2 for the velocity frm was slightly negative meaning that the velocity frm may not be better than an frm with a unique intercept function this was also the case for the d50 frm but only when applied to the petite cascapedia river this frm was still relevant on the sites of the sainte marguerite river for which the value of altfr 2 in cross validation was higher 0 283 3 3 2 habitat suitability index hsi performance hsi values were computed at each surveyed patch of 4 m2 and regressed against observed parr density r 2 values for this relationship are reported in table 3 while all r 2 values were very low i e below 0 05 traditional hsc seemed to perform slightly better than frm to explain local fish density at each habitat patch when aggregated into hsi on the sainte marguerite river the r 2 between hsi and parr density was 0 029 which is slightly higher than the results of the regional hsc r 2 of 0 022 and of the frm r 2 of 0 018 on the petite cascapedia river the r 2 between hsi and fish density was 0 040 while it was 0 037 for the regional hsc and 0 030 for the frm it can be noted that on each river separately river specific hsc performed better than hsc developed on the other river in explaining fish density both traditional hsc and frm regional models performed better but did not outperform river specific hsc to explain parr density when both rivers were considered r 2 was slightly higher for the traditional hsc than for the frm 4 discussion our results showed that functional regression models frm were powerful tools for constructing site specific habitat suitability curves hsc in small river reaches frm were used to model local hsc based on the distribution of available habitat conditions for three key habitat variables of atlantic salmon parr water depth median substrate size d50 and mean flow velocity frm explained a large proportion of the variation in site specific hsc for parr fr 2 between 38 and 53 in comparison frm had greater performance to model site specific hsc than traditional hsc developed at the scale of each river or regionally which had negative fr 2 values when looking at altfr 2 values ranging from 10 7 to 39 5 when calculated on both rivers the benefits of frm were further demonstrated over traditional approaches a cross validation leave one out showed that frm still outperformed traditional hsc models these results highlight that frm have correctly represented the fact that different available habitat conditions within a river reach can lead to different habitat choices therefore different local hsc and show the need to consider these divergences in hsc construction this was only made possible by taking a new look at hsc through functional data analysis fda and linking hsc to the distribution of available habitat conditions in frm when looking at transferability of traditional hsc performance on the petite cascapedia river was generally better for the hsc developed with the measurements from the same river compared to the hsc developed with the measurements from the other river or the regional hsc indeed these results were expected e g hedger et al 2004 as it is recommended to use river specific hsc when available in habitat modelling however such results were not found on the sainte marguerite river where hsc from the petite cascapedia river or regional hsc were more adapted to site specific hsc than the hsc developed on the sainte marguerite river in all cases the newly introduced frm outperformed all traditional hsc when applied to the sainte marguerite river the petite cascapedia river or both the fact that frm developed with the measurements of the two rivers combined outperformed river specific hsc is a promising finding in terms of improved transferability considering local differences in available habitat among sites or rivers in frm may thus increase transferability of hsc which is reported to be low for traditional hsc e g groshens and orth 1993 leftwich et al 1997 guay et al 2003 strakosh et al 2003 hedger et al 2004 moir et al 2005 despite better results for performance measured on site specific hsc directly the combined habitat suitability index hsi was not a good indicator of parr density r 2 0 05 for all models considered in fact r 2 values were a little higher for traditional hsi using river specific hsc than for hsi calculated from predicted site specific hsc by the frm frm have allowed assessing the relation between the available habitat conditions and the resulting hsc for example an increase in available deep waters 60 cm seemed to increase the hsc towards water depths ranging from 60 cm to 80 cm while reducing the hsc for smaller depths 0 20 cm also an increase in bigger substrate availability 100 mm may reduce the hsc values for smaller substrate sizes 20 80 mm these findings were only made possible by introducing frm to model site specific hsc by employing more information curves frm also provides new results that could not be obtained from traditional models however these associations will need to be further validated with more data in order to derive functional relationships i e causation nonetheless this study shows the potential of frm to provide ecologically valuable information in habitat modelling while this study demonstrates the advantages of using frm to build site specific hsc some future avenues must also be discussed first even though site specific hsc were better predicted by frm compared to traditional river or regional hsc this improved performance did not translate into stronger relations between hsi and fish density i e all r 2 values were below 0 05 improving the hsi is another topic of interest in the literature because traditional ways to summarize hsc into hsi e g multiplication as used in this study have been criticized for a long time for its mixed performance e g guay et al 2000 2003 and its assumption of independence between individual hsc railsback 2016 our study which introduced the fda framework for hsc construction opens the door to refine the hsi computation by using frm to directly predict the hsi from available habitat conditions and taking into account interactions building on the recent work of boudreault et al 2021 second due to the low number of studied sites n 36 our frm only included one predictor curve and thus considered hsc in a univariate manner the sample size is a limitation of fda and suggests continuing measuring and collecting data with recent technologies such as airborne sensors video analysis or high quality satellite images e g smith et al 2005 hedger et al 2006 dugdale et al 2013 as habitat selection depends on other habitat variables that need to be jointly considered railsback 2016 multivariate frm should be further exploited to produce more biologically representative hsc based on several predictors third all of our models traditional hsc and frm were based on observed frequency of use habitat which can be influenced a myriad of factors our electrofishing sampling technique i e single pass with open parcels can bring some bias in the obtained results bain et al 1985 even though it has shown good correlation with the multiple pass technique bateman et al 2005 fish sizes will affect habitat needs with greater sizes associated with preference toward slightly deeper waters and bigger substrates heggenes et al 1999 such differences may however not impact too much our results as considering 1 and 2 parr together is common in the literature e g mocq et al 2013 beaupré et al 2020 other factors such as fish density competition territoriality and predation can influence habitat selection and consequently the resulting hsc e g gabler and amundsen 1999 dionne and dodson 2002 also stream temperature could be considered in future developments of frm especially when the temperature exceeds a threshold and forces fish to migrate toward thermal refuges beaupré et al 2020 in our database the intra site variability of stream temperature was low boudreault et al 2021 which is the reason for not developing individual hsc for stream temperature recent methods also suggest the use of bioenergetics based hsc against preference hsc e g rosenfeld et al 2016 naman et al 2020 nevertheless preference hsc are still being widely used and the proposed methodology can at least cope with some of the drawbacks of traditional hsc finally the developed frm have not yet been applied in an operational context to calculate for example the weighted usable area e g lamouroux et al 1998 mocq et al 2013 therefore it is suggested that hydraulic models be coupled with frm developed in this study which could better serve the needs of river managers and decision makers by providing a better set of hsc adapted to local differences in available habitat conditions among sites or reaches 5 conclusion our study showed that functional data analysis fda is a suitable framework for developing habitat suitability curves hsc that are key components of various fish habitat models indeed fda naturally treated hsc as curves allowing various functional statistical analyses without complicating the subsequent steps we used functional regression models frm to build models producing site specific hsc that took into account the differences in local available habitat our study opens the door to various innovations and performance improvements for the biological component of habitat models therefore it is suggested that the potential of fda is further exploited to consider hsc modelling in a multivariate manner to refine the hsi calculation or to combine the developed frm with hydraulic models credit authorship

therefore key components of various fish habitat models however hsc are developed at large scales e g river or regional scales that do not consider the differences that exist in available habitat conditions at smaller scales to address this problem a new look at hsc is taken through functional data analysis fda it is an appropriate framework adapted for hsc construction because in fda each observation is a curve or a function to illustrate the potential of fda for hsc a dataset of atlantic salmon salmo salar parr density and habitat variables constructed on two rivers was used functional regression models frm were built to predict site specific hsc based on the available habitat conditions for three salmon parr habitat variables water depth mean flow velocity and median substrate size frm explained a greater proportion of the variation in site specific hsc respectively 38 0 53 3 and 45 5 for depth substrate size and velocity compared to traditional hsc developed at the scale of each river or regionally that poorly fitted site specific hsc when hsc were aggregated into habitat suitability indices hsi weak relationships were found between hsi and parr density r 2 5 for all models traditional hsc and frm this study demonstrates that fda is an innovative framework that can be used to predict more representative site specific hsc adapted to differences in local

regression model fish habitat juvenile atlantic salmon 1 introduction habitat suitability curves hsc are used to model habitat preferences of a given species degraaf and bain 1986 morantz et al 1987 heggenes 1996 hsc are then used as a key component of habitat simulation models bovee 1982 leclerc et al 1995 in river ecology for example hsc are combined with outputs from a hydraulic model in tools such as phabsim bovee 1982 bovee et al 1998 habsim parasiewicz 2001 or casimir jorde et al 2001 habitat models are frequently used in river management allowing for the estimation of the potential fish production of a river to predict the effect of changes in flow regime on fish habitat or to simulate stream restoration measures e g leclerc et al 2003 tharme 2003 annear et al 2004 poff and zimmerman 2010 mocq et al 2013 hence hsc remain key components of habitat models ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 yi et al 2017 hsc are built using physical and biological measurements from either a single river hereafter referred to as river specific hsc leclerc et al 1996 guay et al 2000 or by combining data originating from multiple rivers hereafter referred to as regional hsc lamouroux et al 1999 mäki petäys et al 2002 hedger et al 2004 while best practices for habitat modelling recommend the use of river specific hsc such hsc are not always available due to their costly and time consuming development practitioners therefore often use hsc from other rivers or curves that were built using data and knowledge gathered at a regional scale according to the literature river specific hsc have shown poor transferability to other rivers groshens and orth 1993 leftwich et al 1997 guay et al 2003 strakosh et al 2003 moir et al 2005 except for a few situations freeman et al 1997 lamouroux et al 1999 mäki petäys et al 2002 in some studies river specific hsc even had weak predictive power for different reaches of the same river on which they were developed scott and shirvell 1987 bourgeois et al 1996 guay et al 2000 in general regional hsc increase the transferability between rivers but lead to relatively low predictive power hedger et al 2004 given the poor performance and transferability of river or regional hsc some studies have proposed the development of hsc from experts knowledge rather than physical and biological measurements jorde et al 2001 ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 mocq et al 2013 beaupré et al 2020 expert models have shown good potential for model improvement when applied to new rivers e g mocq et al 2013 however these models were mostly applied on only one or few rivers which limits the conclusions that can be drawn in terms of performance and transferability hsc are most often developed from averaging habitat conditions across many sites in a stream e g guay et al 2000 hedger et al 2004 or from experts knowledge of general habitat preferences e g jorde et al 2001 mocq et al 2013 consequently these models are not designed to account for site specific differences that exist in available habitat that can cause local divergence in habitat selection rosenfeld et al 2011 when a stream or a reach has more of less suitable habitat because of the geomorphic conditions and or fragmented habitat fish may be forced to occupy suboptimal habitat at higher frequencies this will result in a shift of the locally calibrated hsc toward a different optimum than those established in streams with a wider range of suitable habitat conditions leading to a poor fit of hsc when transferred among sites or streams that differ in available habitat not considering local differences in available habitat may thus explain the low predictive power e g guay et al 2000 hedger et al 2004 and relatively low transferability e g leftwich et al 1997 guay et al 2003 of traditional habitat models to our knowledge all hsc that were considered in the literature have ignored these local differences in available habitat conditions one justification for this oversight may be linked to the fact that systematically adapting models to various scenarios of available habitat conditions could become difficult if not impossible to apply in an operational context i e in habitat model implementations fortunately recent developments in some statistical methods and their implementation in modern software e g ramsay and silverman 2005 open the possibility of producing site specific hsc that naturally account for differences that exist in habitat conditions at smaller scales without complicating subsequent analyses the actual definition of an hsc i e a curve makes it conducive to the development of a new approach using the functional data analysis fda framework ramsay 1982 fda allows observations to be treated as curves or functions rather than scalar or vector observations in traditional contexts ramsay and silverman 2005 fda has become very popular in recent years both in hydrology e g chebana et al 2012 masselot et al 2016 ternynck et al 2016 larabi et al 2017 boudreault et al 2019 and ecology e g ainsworth et al 2011 embling et al 2012 stewart koster et al 2014 yen et al 2015 di battista et al 2016 boudreault et al 2021 enabling several types of novel analyses such as functional clustering jacques and preda 2014 functional analysis of variance górecki and smaga 2019 and functional regression morris 2015 functional regression models frm appear to be the most appropriate tool in our context by allowing to model a response variable curve like an hsc from inputs that are either scalar values scalar on function models curves function on function models or both morris 2015 frm can thus capture the variation in hsc between reaches by creating a function that modifies the shape of the hsc the response in frm based on reach specific predictors e g depth velocity related to intersite variation in available habitat this makes frm ideally suited for modelling hsc based on available habitat conditions furthermore function on function frm allows the predictor variable to also be included in the model as a curve hence it becomes possible to create a model that links the hsc response curve to the local distribution of available habitat conditions predictor curve by design this frm accounts for local differences that exist in available habitat conditions compared to traditional hsc construction that aggregates habitat conditions and preferences across all sampled sites indeed traditional model fitting generate a single average curve to predict hsc using data integrated across multiple sites that most likely differ in available habitats and their use on the other hand frm can fit individual curves to each site allowing for local prediction of hsc that functionally accounts for differences in available habitat thus addressing an important challenge in fish habitat modelling the benefits associated with site specific hsc could lead to better performance at both river and regional scales i e increased performance and transferability and less field work required to develop locally adapted hsc based on available habitat in this study we apply functional regression to build predictive models for site specific hsc using juvenile atlantic salmon salmo salar as an example to test and compare the proposed approach traditional hsc are also developed at river and regional scales 2 material and methods 2 1 data collection data on juvenile atlantic salmon salmo salar were collected during the summer of 2017 on two rivers located in the province of quebec canada figure 1 the first river is the sainte marguerite river which flows into the saguenay river a tributary of the st lawrence river the sainte marguerite river consists of two main branches main and northeast of similar sub basins sizes and a total watershed of 2118 km2 discharge was only recorded on the northeast branch 48 16 5 n 69 54 33 w 1 km from the main branch confluence with the northeast branch and 3 km from the sainte marguerite s mouth with a mean annual value of 30 1 m3 s based on records from 1999 to 2019 all measurements in this study were made on the main branch the second river is the petite cascapedia river it flows into the baie des chaleurs in the gaspésie region at its gauging station 48 13 56 n 65 43 59 w located 11 km upstream of its mouth it has a drainage basin area of 1340 km2 and a mean annual discharge of 30 6 m3 s based on records from 1982 2004 and 2012 2020 for each river several small reaches hereafter referred to as sites were surveyed with biological and physical measurements as described in section 2 1 of boudreault et al 2021 for the sainte marguerite river and section 2 4 2 of beaupré et al 2020 for the sainte marguerite and petite cascapedia rivers each site consisted of 30 habitat patches of 4 m2 equally distributed along 5 transects i e six patches per transect figure 1 studied sites were 75 m long and had the same width as the river all sites were at least 500 m apart along the river to ensure independence sites were semi systematically selected to cover a wide diversity of habitat conditions such as pools riffles glides etc habitat patches were fished using a smith root lr24 electrofisher with a single pass open net technique beaupré et al 2020 boudreault et al 2021 all fish caught were identified to species except for cyprinids but only juvenile salmon were measured at fork length and then classified as fry 0 or parr 1 2 prior to release on the sainte marguerite river juvenile salmon 30 54 mm long were classified as 0 55 87 mm long as 1 and 88 125 mm long as 2 figure 2 a on the petite cascapedia river fish 42 62 mm long were classified as 0 63 92 mm long as 1 and 93 132 mm long as 2 figure 2b for all patches physical measurements such as water depth mean flow velocity and median substrate size d50 were measured after electrofishing to ensure that enough fish were observed to build site specific hsc only sites with at least four observed juvenile salmon were kept for the analysis this criterion was chosen as a trade off between 1 having as many sites as possible and 2 having enough observations at each site to build credible site specific hsc this criterion has led us to combine data for parr of ages 1 and 2 hereafter referred to as parr indeed parr was the juvenile atlantic salmon life stage having the highest number of sites fulfilling our criterion with n 36 sites compared to fry n 30 1 parr n 28 and 2 parr n 8 hence this study solely focused on parr and considered 1 and 2 parr together as done in recent literature e g mocq et al 2018 beaupré et al 2020 to develop the models presented in the following sections the three most important and commonly studied habitat variables for juvenile atlantic salmon habitat were considered depth d50 and velocity e g guay et al 2000 hedger et al 2004 mocq et al 2013 these measured physical habitat variables were then categorized into two classes available and selected the first class available corresponded to all physical measurements regardless of parr presence or absence the second class selected corresponded only to the physical measurements at patches where parr were observed summary statistics of physical and biological measurements collected on the two rivers are reported in table 1 2 2 traditional habitat suitability curves hsc hsc are defined in different ways in the literature ranging from experts knowledge category i frequency of habitat use category ii and preference category iii bovee et al 1998 preference hsc are favored against frequency of use hsc because they are corrected for available habitat characteristics manly et al 2007 various methods exist to derive preference hsc such as forage ratio bovee et al 1998 jacobs index jacobs 1974 and ivlev electivity index ivlev 1961 forage ratio is the most popular and familiar index of preference according to bovee et al 1998 and jowett et al 2008 it is calculated by dividing the frequency of selected habitat by the frequency of available habitat variable in each class of a variable and by normalising the result to a maximum value of 1 that represents the most preferred habitat condition manly et al 2007 forage ratios were used in this study hereafter referred to simply as hsc frequencies of selected and available habitat were estimated by kernel density estimates kde hayes and jowett 1994 jowett et al 2008 a kde is defined as follows tukey 1977 1 f s 1 n h i 1 n k s s i h where f s is the estimated kde s 1 s n are univariate independent and identically distributed random variables with unknown probability density function n is the number of observations k is the kernel often the standard normal density function and h is called the bandwidth and is a parameter that can be adjusted for smoothness rudemo 1982 before adjusting kde habitat variables were right censored to 99 percentile of their whole distribution to avoid right wavy tails in the kde estimates where only very few observations were made for consistency of the kde with the observed empirical distributions kde were plotted along with the histograms to validate the choice of the bandwidth parameter as done in boudreault et al 2021 a unique bandwidth value was chosen for each habitat variable hsc were computed by dividing the frequency of selected habitat by the frequency of available habitat and then scaled to a maximum value of 1 as explained above hayes and jowett 1994 for each of the considered habitat variable depth d50 and velocity three hsc were developed based on measurements from 1 the sainte marguerite river hsc sm 2 the petite cascapedia river hsc pc and 3 both rivers hsc reg the objective behind developing hsc at various scales i e river and regional was to correctly assess performance of traditional hsc and their transferability to other rivers compared to the newly introduced method described below finally once univariate hsc are built they can be combined into a unique multivariate habitat suitability index hsi using multiplication e g vadas and orth 2001 arithmetic or geometric means e g gard 2014 or other more sophisticated ways such as regression e g guay et al 2000 hsi were computed at each patch using the standard method of multiplication to further validate our results 2 3 functional data analysis fda and functional regression models frm in fda curves or functions represent the response variable to be modelled and or the predictor variable s and need to be constructed from the observed discrete data a usual initial step in fda is to fit a known function e g a linear combination of basis functions to the observations ramsay and silverman 2005 2 f s m 1 m c m φ m s s ω where f is a continuous function ϕm are the known basis functions cm are the coefficients to be estimated m is the number of basis functions and ω is the domain over which f is constructed equation 2 is the traditional way to estimate a functional observation from discrete observations however new approaches for fitting frm can now directly use the observed points on the continuous function without the need to first estimate the underlying continuous function brockhaus et al 2015 hence this prior step was not performed for the current application of frm there were two curves to be estimated for each site i the response curve y i which represents the local hsc at site i and the predictor curve x i which represents the local available habitat a natural choice for xi was to consider the kde of the available habitat conditions for the same variable used to build the hsc for example the kde of available depths was used as a predictor to model the hsc for depth the logic here is that depths chosen by fish and therefore the empirical hsc for depth are influenced by the depths that are available which becomes the predictor function the same applies for the velocity and d50 models function on function frm were used morris 2015 the simplest model of this class is called the concurrent model e g goldsmith and schwartz 2017 it is the equivalent of the linear model but with both response and predictor functional variables 3 y i s α s β s x i s ε i s s ω where y i and x i represent respectively the hsc and the kde of available habitat conditions for a given habitat variable for the studied site i 1 2 36 ω is the domain over which y and x are observed and ε i is the error term in this model the intercept α and the regression coefficient β are also functions their definition is the same as f in eq 2 a linear combination of known basis functions and coefficients to be estimated model 3 only allows the predictor x i at point s or at a fixed lag s l to be used to predict y i at s ramsay and silverman 2005 in order to take into account the complete information on the available habitat conditions all the values of the predictor curves need to be used to predict y at s hence the fully functional linear model is introduced 4 y i s α s ω 2 β r s x i r dr ε i s s ω 1 where β r s is now a surface that represents the effect of x i at any point r on y i and ω1 and ω2 are respectively the domains of y i and x i in our case ω1 ω2 in model 4 all the values of x i are now being used to model the value of y i at s which is more adapted to our current study than model 3 one can note that model 3 is a special case of model 4 where β r s only takes values on the diagonal s r hence only model 4 was considered in this study hereafter referred to simply as frm all analyses were conducted in r r core team 2021 to calibrate frm defined in 4 the fdboost package was used brockhaus et al 2017b the parameters of the regression coefficients were estimated with a component wise gradient boosting algorithm and the minimized loss function was the mean square error bühlmann and hothorn 2007 brockhaus et al 2017a 5 i 1 n ω 1 y i s y i s 2 d s optimal parameters of the model were found with a method called early stopping brockhaus et al 2017a briefly the iterative procedure was stopped when the mean square error calculated with cross validation stops decreasing and begins to increase early stopping avoids overfitting the model and leads to more regularized coefficients brockhaus et al 2017c to assess the uncertainty of the estimated effects standard errors of the intercept and the regression coefficients surface were computed using bootstrapping with 1000 replications as done in masselot et al 2018 it can be seen that traditional hsc described in section 2 2 can be defined as a very simple frm such as equation 3 with no predictor and only an intercept function α this similarity demonstrates that the fda framework is well suited for hsc construction and that performance metrics described in the next section can be calculated for both frm and traditional hsc 2 4 performance criteria to assess the performance of the models to predict site specific hsc two functional equivalents of the traditional r 2 were calculated ramsay and silverman 2005 the first one denoted fr 2 measures the percentage of variation in the data explained by the model adapted for functional observations fr 2 is calculated as follows 6 f r 2 1 i 1 n ω y i s y i s 2 d s i 1 n ω y i s y 2 d s where y i s and y i s are respectively the observed and predicted response curve y is the mean observation ω is the domain over which y is observed and n is the number of functional observations in addition to the fr 2 an alternate version was also calculated altfr 2 in case studies working with functional data it is of interest to know how the model performs compared to a model containing only a functional intercept α in our case the model with the functional intercept only is the average hsc that does not account for variation among sites as explained above altfr 2 was computed as follows 7 a l t f r 2 1 i 1 n ω y i s y i s 2 d s i 1 n ω y i s y s 2 d s where the mean observation y in the denominator of equation 6 is replaced the mean functional observation y s i 1 n y i s n note that in the functional context both fr 2 and altfr 2 can take on negative values if the fit is worse with y i s compared to y and y s respectively ramsay and silverman 2005 the two above criteria were also calculated with cross validation given that the number of studied sites was small n 36 functional observations a leave one out cross validation procedure was performed quenouille 1949 basically one site was removed from the dataset prior to fitting the model then the resulting model was used to predict the hsc at the removed site this procedure was repeated for all sites to calculate performance measures with leave one out cross validation y i s was replaced by y i s in eqs 6 and 7 where y i s is the predicted hsc for site i when this site was removed from the dataset prior to fitting the model apart from cross validation all performance metrics were calculated separately for the sites studied on the sainte marguerite river the petite cascapedia river and both simultaneously these additional results were helpful to check the adequacy of the models on the same river as they were calibrated but also on the river on which they were not developed this refers to the concept of transferability as discussed in the introduction of the paper as a final validation of the developed hsc hsi values were regressed against observed fish densities e g guay et al 2000 2003 beaupré et al 2020 r 2 values were reported as a measure of the ability of hsi to explain fish density 3 results 3 1 traditional habitat suitability curves hsc results traditional habitat suitability curves are reproduced in fig 3 on the sainte marguerite and petite cascapedia rivers two preferred depths ranges were noted fig 3 left panels 20 25 cm and 55 65 cm shallow waters 15 cm were mostly avoided by parr these results were consistent across rivers preferred d50 values ranged from 60 mm to 130 mm on the sainte marguerite river fig 3 top center on the petite cascapedia river the available substrate sizes were smaller than on the sainte marguerite river however the hsc of the petite cascapedia river also showed that parr appeared to prefer larger 80 110 mm substrate sizes fig 3 middle center after combining measurements from the sainte marguerite and petite cascapedia rivers for the regional model the 60 130 mm range remained the most preferred d50 values among the two rivers fig 3 bottom center parr mostly avoided smaller substrates 50 mm for velocity preferred values were between 0 25 and 0 35 m s fig 3 right panels on both rivers velocities greater than 1 m s were less available and did not seem to be preferred by parr 3 2 functional regression models frm results resulting hsc and kde for three sites two on the petite cascapedia river and one on the sainte marguerite river along with histograms of available and selected habitat characteristics are reproduced in fig 4 an illustration of all hsc and kde is available in supplementary material kde of available habitat and hsc were used as direct inputs for frm described in this section frm for the three habitat variables are reproduced in fig 5 for the intercept left panels the regression coefficients surface center panels and its standard error right panels to correctly read and interpret the frm regression surfaces and their standard error some explanations must first be given the x axis corresponds to the values of the available habitat variable while the y axis corresponds to the values of the hsc the regression coefficient surface shows the relationship between an increase or a decrease in the availability of the habitat variable x axis and the hsc for values on the y axis a red region indicates a positive relation between availability and hsc an increase decrease in habitat variable availability is correlated to an increase decrease in the hsc on the other hand a blue region indicates a negative relation the conditional tense is used through the results as these relations are correlation rather than causation 3 2 1 frm for depth as for traditional hsc frm for depth also showed that two ranges of depths were preferred by parr 25 35 mm and 50 60 mm and that both shallowest 10 cm and deepest 70 cm waters were avoided as illustrated by the intercept function fig 5 top left the red region at the bottom left of the surface indicated that increasing availability of shallow water depths 0 15 cm may be linked to an increased hsc for slightly higher values of depths 0 25 cm fig 5 top center also available depths in the range 60 80 cm seemed to favor higher values of hsc for depths in the range 40 80 mm while reducing the hsc for shallower depths 0 20 cm the standard error of the surface was relatively low fig 5 top right 3 2 2 frm for median substrate size d50 according to the intercept function the range of preferred d50 values for parr was from 50 mm to 70 mm fig 5 middle left parr seemed to avoid low 25 mm and high 175 mm values of d50 the regression coefficients surface showed that availability of substrate ranging from 100 mm to 200 mm tended to increase the hsc for such values and decrease the hsc for smaller substrate sizes 100 mm blue region on the surface fig 5 middle center a smaller effect was the increased availability of small substrates 10 60 mm that tended to reduce the hsc for higher values 70 mm to 150 mm the standard error of the surface was greater for high values of available substrate sizes i e 170 mm fig 5 middle right 3 2 3 frm for velocity velocities from 0 20 m s to 0 40 m s were preferred by parr as shown by the intercept function fig 5 bottom left faster currents 1 m s were mostly avoided the regression coefficient surface indicated that increasing the availability of high velocities 1 m s may increase the hsc for slightly smaller values of velocities in the range of 0 40 m s to 1 m s as illustrated by the red region fig 5 bottom center the regression coefficient surface was close to 0 elsewhere for very high values of velocities 1 25 m s the regression coefficient surface had a higher standard error fig 5 bottom right 3 3 performance metrics and comparison 3 3 1 site specific habitat suitability curves hsc performance the performance of site specific hsc modelling expressed by fr 2 values are reported in table 2 the performance on the sainte marguerite river was the highest with the frm for all three habitat variables fr 2 of 0 480 0 543 and 0 511 respectively for depth d50 and velocity for all traditional hsc hsc sm hsc pc and hsc reg these models performed poorly to explain variation in site specific hsc with negative values of fr 2 these results suggest that traditional river or regional hsc are not adapted for local differences in site specific hsc on the petite cascapedia river the same conclusions apply frm explained a large proportion of the variability for all three site specific hsc fr 2 of 0 278 0 499 and 0 404 for depth d50 and velocity while all traditional hsc performed poorly among traditional hsc applied to the petite cascapedia river the hsc developed on the petite cascapedia river hsc pc performed better than the others for depth and d50 while the hsc developed regionally hsc reg performed better for velocity however all fr 2 values were negative for traditional hsc so hsc developed at the river or regional scale did not fit well site specific hsc on the petite cascapedia river when all sites from the two rivers were considered the frm again performed better than regional hsc at modelling site specific hsc with higher fr 2 values 0 380 0 533 and 0 455 for depth d50 and velocity versus negative values for the regional hsc when looking at the performance metrics calculated with the leave one out cross validation the same conclusions apply suggesting that frm were not overfitted in conclusion frm correctly modelled the differences in local hsc observed at each site with high values of fr 2 while none of the traditional hsc was able to represent these local differences in site specific hsc to further validate the different models altfr 2 was also computed table 2 with lower values than fr 2 values recall that altfr 2 compares the predicted hsc to a mean functional observation which already explains a great proportion of the variability in hsc when comparing traditional hsc and frm based on altfr 2 values the same conclusions as above apply regarding frm altfr 2 highlighted the added value of considering available habitat in the models versus using only a functional intercept with altfr 2 values ranging from 0 036 to 0 414 both depth and d50 frm obtained higher values of altfr 2 when applied to one or two rivers however two frm had lower altfr 2 values the d50 frm applied to the petite cascapedia river altfr 2 of 0 036 and the velocity frm applied to the sainte marguerite river altfr 2 of 0 026 such results may signify that local differences in available substrate and velocity values among sites were lower on the sainte marguerite and the petite cascapedia rivers respectively such that parr were exposed to the optimal values that they could use at will in cross validation the altfr 2 for the velocity frm was slightly negative meaning that the velocity frm may not be better than an frm with a unique intercept function this was also the case for the d50 frm but only when applied to the petite cascapedia river this frm was still relevant on the sites of the sainte marguerite river for which the value of altfr 2 in cross validation was higher 0 283 3 3 2 habitat suitability index hsi performance hsi values were computed at each surveyed patch of 4 m2 and regressed against observed parr density r 2 values for this relationship are reported in table 3 while all r 2 values were very low i e below 0 05 traditional hsc seemed to perform slightly better than frm to explain local fish density at each habitat patch when aggregated into hsi on the sainte marguerite river the r 2 between hsi and parr density was 0 029 which is slightly higher than the results of the regional hsc r 2 of 0 022 and of the frm r 2 of 0 018 on the petite cascapedia river the r 2 between hsi and fish density was 0 040 while it was 0 037 for the regional hsc and 0 030 for the frm it can be noted that on each river separately river specific hsc performed better than hsc developed on the other river in explaining fish density both traditional hsc and frm regional models performed better but did not outperform river specific hsc to explain parr density when both rivers were considered r 2 was slightly higher for the traditional hsc than for the frm 4 discussion our results showed that functional regression models frm were powerful tools for constructing site specific habitat suitability curves hsc in small river reaches frm were used to model local hsc based on the distribution of available habitat conditions for three key habitat variables of atlantic salmon parr water depth median substrate size d50 and mean flow velocity frm explained a large proportion of the variation in site specific hsc for parr fr 2 between 38 and 53 in comparison frm had greater performance to model site specific hsc than traditional hsc developed at the scale of each river or regionally which had negative fr 2 values when looking at altfr 2 values ranging from 10 7 to 39 5 when calculated on both rivers the benefits of frm were further demonstrated over traditional approaches a cross validation leave one out showed that frm still outperformed traditional hsc models these results highlight that frm have correctly represented the fact that different available habitat conditions within a river reach can lead to different habitat choices therefore different local hsc and show the need to consider these divergences in hsc construction this was only made possible by taking a new look at hsc through functional data analysis fda and linking hsc to the distribution of available habitat conditions in frm when looking at transferability of traditional hsc performance on the petite cascapedia river was generally better for the hsc developed with the measurements from the same river compared to the hsc developed with the measurements from the other river or the regional hsc indeed these results were expected e g hedger et al 2004 as it is recommended to use river specific hsc when available in habitat modelling however such results were not found on the sainte marguerite river where hsc from the petite cascapedia river or regional hsc were more adapted to site specific hsc than the hsc developed on the sainte marguerite river in all cases the newly introduced frm outperformed all traditional hsc when applied to the sainte marguerite river the petite cascapedia river or both the fact that frm developed with the measurements of the two rivers combined outperformed river specific hsc is a promising finding in terms of improved transferability considering local differences in available habitat among sites or rivers in frm may thus increase transferability of hsc which is reported to be low for traditional hsc e g groshens and orth 1993 leftwich et al 1997 guay et al 2003 strakosh et al 2003 hedger et al 2004 moir et al 2005 despite better results for performance measured on site specific hsc directly the combined habitat suitability index hsi was not a good indicator of parr density r 2 0 05 for all models considered in fact r 2 values were a little higher for traditional hsi using river specific hsc than for hsi calculated from predicted site specific hsc by the frm frm have allowed assessing the relation between the available habitat conditions and the resulting hsc for example an increase in available deep waters 60 cm seemed to increase the hsc towards water depths ranging from 60 cm to 80 cm while reducing the hsc for smaller depths 0 20 cm also an increase in bigger substrate availability 100 mm may reduce the hsc values for smaller substrate sizes 20 80 mm these findings were only made possible by introducing frm to model site specific hsc by employing more information curves frm also provides new results that could not be obtained from traditional models however these associations will need to be further validated with more data in order to derive functional relationships i e causation nonetheless this study shows the potential of frm to provide ecologically valuable information in habitat modelling while this study demonstrates the advantages of using frm to build site specific hsc some future avenues must also be discussed first even though site specific hsc were better predicted by frm compared to traditional river or regional hsc this improved performance did not translate into stronger relations between hsi and fish density i e all r 2 values were below 0 05 improving the hsi is another topic of interest in the literature because traditional ways to summarize hsc into hsi e g multiplication as used in this study have been criticized for a long time for its mixed performance e g guay et al 2000 2003 and its assumption of independence between individual hsc railsback 2016 our study which introduced the fda framework for hsc construction opens the door to refine the hsi computation by using frm to directly predict the hsi from available habitat conditions and taking into account interactions building on the recent work of boudreault et al 2021 second due to the low number of studied sites n 36 our frm only included one predictor curve and thus considered hsc in a univariate manner the sample size is a limitation of fda and suggests continuing measuring and collecting data with recent technologies such as airborne sensors video analysis or high quality satellite images e g smith et al 2005 hedger et al 2006 dugdale et al 2013 as habitat selection depends on other habitat variables that need to be jointly considered railsback 2016 multivariate frm should be further exploited to produce more biologically representative hsc based on several predictors third all of our models traditional hsc and frm were based on observed frequency of use habitat which can be influenced a myriad of factors our electrofishing sampling technique i e single pass with open parcels can bring some bias in the obtained results bain et al 1985 even though it has shown good correlation with the multiple pass technique bateman et al 2005 fish sizes will affect habitat needs with greater sizes associated with preference toward slightly deeper waters and bigger substrates heggenes et al 1999 such differences may however not impact too much our results as considering 1 and 2 parr together is common in the literature e g mocq et al 2013 beaupré et al 2020 other factors such as fish density competition territoriality and predation can influence habitat selection and consequently the resulting hsc e g gabler and amundsen 1999 dionne and dodson 2002 also stream temperature could be considered in future developments of frm especially when the temperature exceeds a threshold and forces fish to migrate toward thermal refuges beaupré et al 2020 in our database the intra site variability of stream temperature was low boudreault et al 2021 which is the reason for not developing individual hsc for stream temperature recent methods also suggest the use of bioenergetics based hsc against preference hsc e g rosenfeld et al 2016 naman et al 2020 nevertheless preference hsc are still being widely used and the proposed methodology can at least cope with some of the drawbacks of traditional hsc finally the developed frm have not yet been applied in an operational context to calculate for example the weighted usable area e g lamouroux et al 1998 mocq et al 2013 therefore it is suggested that hydraulic models be coupled with frm developed in this study which could better serve the needs of river managers and decision makers by providing a better set of hsc adapted to local differences in available habitat conditions among sites or reaches 5 conclusion our study showed that functional data analysis fda is a suitable framework for developing habitat suitability curves hsc that are key components of various fish habitat models indeed fda naturally treated hsc as curves allowing various functional statistical analyses without complicating the subsequent steps we used functional regression models frm to build models producing site specific hsc that took into account the differences in local available habitat our study opens the door to various innovations and performance improvements for the biological component of habitat models therefore it is suggested that the potential of fda is further exploited to consider hsc modelling in a multivariate manner to refine the hsi calculation or to combine the developed frm with hydraulic models credit authorship

24461,we present a model of a fish population present on two patches connected by migrations fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught we assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing taking advantage of the time scales we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale we are looking for the maximum sustainable yield msy for the system of the two connected patches we show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites we then consider a prey predator community of fish in the same environment we assume that only the predator is caught and not its prey growing logistically on each site we study the lotka volterra prey predator model as well as the model with a type ii holling functional response we show that the total catch at msy of the system of connected sites can be greater than the sum of the captures on each isolated site this result is obtained when a fishing site with a large prey carrying capacity and an average growth rate is connected to a site with a small carrying capacity but a large growth rate finally we discuss fishery management methods on two fishing sites for the lotka volterra model as well as the holling type ii model in the case of a prey refuge keywords maximum sustainable yield fishery management fishery on two sites connected by fast migrations aggregation of variables predator prey model 1 introduction many authors have been interested in population dynamics in heterogeneous environments that can be represented by a set of discrete sites connected to each other by migratory flows particular interest was given to the study of the effects of migration on the global dynamics of the metapopulation levin 1974 deangelis and zhang 2014 deangelis et al 2016 many works have considered the case where the populations on each site obey a law of logistic growth the 2 patch model and the generalization to a network of n sites n 2 have been studied most authors looked for the conditions allowing to have a global equilibrium greater than the sum of the carrying capacities of all the sites holt 1985 freedman and waltman 1977 poggiale et al 2005 arditi et al 2015 2018 wang and deangelis 2019 elbetch et al 2021 on another side many models of exploited populations have been studied in particular in the field of fisheries murray 2002 a single harvested species as well as exploited prey predator communities spencer and collie 1995b a with a ratio dependent functional response a particularly important aspect concerns the optimal management of a fishery to ensure maximum profitability of the fishery by looking for the conditions to reach the msy clark 1990 several authors have been interested in determining the msy in various fish prey predator communities legovic and gecek 2010 legovic et al 2011 legovic and gecek 2012 ghosh and kar 2013 kar and ghosh 2013 another aspect of fishery modeling concerns taking into account the heterogeneity of fishing zones the heterogeneity of the fishery can be taken into account by considering a spatially continuous model with parameters of growth and interactions which depend on the position in space another way to do this is to consider separate and different fishing areas which can be connected together by migrations of various fish species as well as fishing fleets it is this last approach that we adopt in this work we focus our approach on the case of fishing areas close enough so that the migrations of fish between areas can take place at a fast time scale compared to local population growth and capture the existence of two time scales will allow us to reduce the dimension of the complete model taking into account all the growth and fishing terms on each site as well as the migration terms and to derive a reduced model governing only the total fish biomass of all sites at a slow time scale these reduction methods make it possible to study the complete model using the simplified reduced model in previous work poggiale et al 2005 studied the case of a single logistically growing population at two sites connected by fast migrations they showed that the total population of the two sites connected by fast migrations at constant rates could tend towards a stable equilibrium greater than the sum of the carrying capacities of the two isolated sites this result shows that it is possible to increase the productivity of a population living on two sites by adequately connecting the two sites with migrations poggiale et al 2005 we generalize this last work by considering that the logistically growing local populations are moreover captured the question that arises in the general context of a fishery on two sites is to find out whether the total catch of the system of the two sites connected by migrations can be greater than the sum of the optimal catches of the two isolated sites i e at msy is there a way to make connections between fishing areas that increases the total catch of the fishery the first part of the present work concerns a single harvested population on two sites in this first case we show that the answer to the previous question is negative we then address this issue in the case of a prey predator community of fish from which only the predator is caught we show that in this second case the answer is positive this part studies a fish prey predator community with a type i functional response the predator of which is always fished on two sites as well as a fish community with a type ii functional response the last part focuses on the effects of connectivity of two fishing areas on the global productivity of the fishery with two suggested concrete application examples the work ends with concluding remarks and perspectives 2 a two patch population model with logistic growth and constant fast migrations 2 1 without harvesting we start by recalling the result given in the following poggiale et al 2005 in which the authors considered a single population in a two patch environment in our case we consider a fish population growing on two sites the movements between patches are described by constant migration rates migrations are assumed to be fast in comparison to local dynamics let us recall the model 1 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 2 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2

the complete model can be reduced as a first step we consider the fast system which is obtained by setting ε 0 in the complete system in our case the fast equilibrium can be easily calculated and is given by 3 b 1 u b m 2 m 1 m 2 b 4 b 2 1 u b m 1 m 1 m 2 b where u m 2 m 1 m 2 represents the constant proportion of fish biomass in patch 1 and 1 u in patch 2 at the fast equilibrium a reduced model is obtained by substituting the fast stable equilibrium into the complete system adding two by two equations for fish biomass and by using slow time we get the following aggregated model governing the total fish biomass b b 1 b 2 at the slow time which is valid when it is structurally stable and for small enough value of ε 5 d b d t r b 1 b k o ε for reduction methods using small parameters we refer to tikhonov 1952 for aggregation of variables methods we refer to iwasa et al 1989 when the reduced system obtained by substituting the fast equilibrium in the complete model is not structurally stable it is necessary to use reduction methods based on the center manifold theorem allowing following term of order ε to be calculated see auger et al 2008a and auger et al 2008b with constant migration rates the global aggregated equation is a logistic equation such as local equations in the long term b tends to the stable equilibrium b k the overall fish growth rate of the reduced model reads poggiale et al 2005 6 r u r 1 1 u r 2 and the overall fish carrying capacity checks the next expression 7 r k r 1 u 2 k 1 r 2 1 u 2 k 2 and is expressed as follows 8 k k 1 k 2 u r 1 1 u r 2 u 2 k 2 r 1 1 u 2 k 1 r 2 in the homogeneous case r 1 r 2 and k 1 k 2 the formula is simplified to give 9 k h o m o g e n e o u s k 1 u 2 1 u 2 in the case of symmetric diffusion u 0 5 it is easy to check that k h o m o g e n e o u s s y m 2 k 1 in the heterogeneous case and symmetric diffusion r 1 r 2 and for instance k 1 k 2 the global carrying capacity reads as follows 10 k h e t e r o g e n e o u s

y m k h o m o g e n e o u s s y m equivalent to k 2 k 1 see also wang and deangelis 2019 in order to have a total carrying capacity greater than the sum of isolated local ones we need heterogeneity and asymmetric diffusion as an example let us choose k 1 k 2 50 r 1 10 r 2 1 and u 1 3 then k 128 57 100 therefore the total equilibrium fish biomass of the system of connected logistic patches can be greater than the sum of equilibrium biomass of isolated patches in other words we have b k k 1 k 2 see poggiale et al 2005 freedman and waltman 1977 and arditi et al 2015 for a complete analysis of the two patch model 2 2 with harvesting we continue with a new part in which we assume that the fish population is exploited with a correspondingly identical rate in each of the two sites we will now ask ourselves if the total productivity of the fishery by connecting the two fishing systems can be improved compared to the case of disconnected sites we still consider a system of two patches connected by fast migrations where fish sub populations grow logistically see fig 1 we still assume that the exchanges between the sites are fast in comparison to local growth and fishing the only change we consider is to assume that the fish population is harvested in both sites the complete model reads as follows 11 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 q e b 1 12 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 ε r 2 b 2 1 b 2 k 2 q e b 2 we assume a schaefer catch on each patch i schaefer 1957 i e q e b i i 1 2 where e is the fishing effort and q is the catchability for sake of simplicity we set q 1 in the next parts in the case of constant migrations using the same reduction method as before we obtain an aggregated model which reads as follows 13 d b d t r b 1 b k e b where r and k are the same as in the previous sub section without fishing in that case the population equilibrium becomes b k 1 e r which is positive and stable when e r the maximum sustainable yield msy for connected patches is obtained when e e m s y r 2 in that case the maximum sustainable yield reads y r k 4 clark 1990 murray 2002 see also for more details appendix a on the other hand for isolated patches without migrations we choose respectively e 1 r 1 2 resp e 2 r 2 2 for the fishing effort in patch 1 resp 2 then the total maximum sustainable yields are respectively r 1 k 1 4 and r 2 k 2 4 in each isolated patch now we are going to compare at msy the yield for the aggregated system to the sum of yields for isolated patches we are going to show that 14 r k 4 r 1 k 1 4 r 2 k 2 4 indeed substituting the expressions of the global growth rate r r 1 u 1 u r 2 and of the global carrying capacity k k 1 k 2 r 1 u r 2 1 u r 1 u 2 r 2 1 u 2 of the aggregated model in the previous inequality it comes 15 r 1 u r 2 1 u 2 k 1 k 2 r 1 k 2 u 2 r 2 k 1 1 u 2 r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 for any 0 u 1 after simplification the inequality becomes k 1 1 u k 2 u 2 0 which is always verified therefore while it is possible to have a global equilibrium for connected patches greater than the sum of the carrying capacities for isolated sites i e b k 1 k 2 it is impossible to have the maximum sustainable yield msy for connected sites greater than the sum of yields at msy for isolated patches fig 2 shows logistic growth functions g b for patch 1 patch 2 and the aggregated model these growth functions are negative parabola intersecting the horizontal axis at 0 and at the corresponding carrying capacity at equilibrium we check r b 1 b k e b for any growth function for each growth curve the msy is found when b is at half the carrying capacity in other words the catch at msy equals the value of the growth function at half of the carrying capacity it thus corresponds to the maximum of each growth function between the origin and the carrying capacity fig 2 shows just an example with r 2 r 1 and k 2 k 1 and k k 1 k 2 for u 0 7 the slope of each logistic growth function is equal to the growth rate at the origin we know that r 1 r r 2 the growth function of the aggregated model must be between the two growth curves of each patch at least when b is close to zero fig 2 shows an example where even if k k 1 k 2 r k 4 3 73 does not exceed r 1 k 1 4 r 2 k 2 4 3 75 for u 1 the green curve of the aggregated model is the same as the blue curve and for u 0 it is similar to the red one for any u in between the curve of the aggregated system lies between the other two intuitively because the growth curve of the aggregated model is mostly framed by the two growth curves of each patch the catch of the fishery of the two coupled sites must always be less or equal than the sum of the catches of the two isolated sites in other words if the global carrying capacity can be greater than the sum of the local carrying capacity the overall growth rate is always lower than the greater of the local growth rates which limits the overall catch which can never exceed the sum of local catches this result is negative but it shows that in the simplest case of a single fish population exploited on two sites it is impossible to increase the total productivity of the fishery by connecting the two sites between them we will now show in the next section that this becomes possible when we consider a fish prey predator system from which the predator is captured 3 the two patch prey predator model with lotka volterra functional response and constant fast migrations 3 1 presentation and reduction of the two patch prey predator model we consider a prey predator fish community in a two patch environment the movements between patches are still described by constant rates and fast in comparison to local dynamics let us consider the following model 16 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 ε a 1 b 1 p 1 17 d b

respectively fish prey and predator biomass on patch i i 1 2 parameters r i and k i represent the fish prey intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity on patch i fig 3 shows the system of connected patches the fish prey and predator can move in both sites the fish predator catches the fish prey in both patches a i is the predation parameter in patch i e is the conversion parameter of prey biomass into predator biomass d is the predator mortality rate the predator is harvested in both sites at a constant fishing effort e prey and predator are assumed to move fast with respect to local growth and predation prey respectively predator leave patch 1 to go to patch 2 at the constant rate m 1 resp k 1 prey respectively predator return to patch 1 leaving patch 2 at constant rate m 2 resp k 2 time scales are still included in the model by using the fast time variable τ together with the positive dimensionless parameter ε 1 the fast system is obtained by setting ε 0 in the complete system in our case the fast equilibrium for the fish prey is given by 20 b 1 u b m 2 m 1 m 2 b 21 b 2 1 u b m 1 m 1 m 2 b where u represents the constant proportion of fish prey biomass in patch 1 and 1 u in patch 2 at the fast equilibrium in the same way the fast equilibrium for the fish predator is given by 22 p 1 v p k 2 k 1 k 2 p 23 p 2 1 v p k 1 k 1 k 2 p where v represents the constant proportion of predator biomass in patch 1 and 1 v in patch 2 at the fast equilibrium a reduced model is obtained by substituting the fast stable equilibrium into the complete system adding two by two equations for fish prey and predator biomass and by using slow time we get the following aggregated model governing the total fish prey biomass b b 1 b 2 and fish predator p p 1 p 2 at the slow time which is also valid when it is structurally stable and for small enough value of ε 24 d b d t r b 1 b k a b p o ε 25 d p d t e a b p d p e p o ε the overall fish prey growth rate of the reduced model

asymptotically stable in the positive quadrant fig 4 shows a comparison of the solutions of the complete red and aggregated blue models for ε 0 1 left upper solutions correspond to the total fish prey biomass simulated using the complete model red and the reduced aggregated model blue lower solutions to the total fish predator biomass it shows that the solutions of both models remain very close when parameter ε is small enough i e 0 1 the right figure shows the phase portrait still comparing the complete red and aggregated blue models for ε 0 1 the calculation of the total catch at equilibrium is recalled in appendix a for the system of two coupled patches the total catch is a function of the fishing effort as follows 31 y e e p r e a 1 d e e a k as well as for isolated patch 1 32 y 1 e e p r 1 e a 1 1 d e e a 1 k 1 and isolated patch 2 33 y 2 e e p r 2 e a 2 1 d e e a 2 k 2 now we consider the maximum sustainable yield msy associated with the fishing effort which maximizes the catch see appendix let y m s y be the maximum yield for the system of the two connected patches by fast migrations which is given by the next expression 34 y m s y r 4 e a 2 k e a k d 2 and it must be compared to the maximum yields at msy for patch 1 35 y m s y 1 r 1 4 e a 1 2 k 1 e a 1 k 1 d 2 and patch 2 36 y m s y 2 r 2 4 e a 2 2 k 2 e a 2 k 2 d 2 3 2 comparison at msy of the global yield in case of connected sites with the sum of yields of isolated sites in the lotka volterra model with type i functional response let us see if the maximum yield for connected patches can be greater than the sum of yields associated with single isolated patches in other words let us check if 37 y m s y y m s y 1 y m s y 2 let us define the yield excess as follows 38 δ y m s y y m s y y m s y 1 y m s y 2 we are now going to look for the conditions allowing to obtain a positive excess yield 3 2 1 homogeneous case let us consider the homogeneous case i e k 1 k 2 r 1 r 2 a 1 a 2 furthermore we assume that the predator distributes spatially like its prey v u parameters of the aggregated model are the following 39 r r 1 40 a a 1 u 2 1 u 2 41 k k 1 u 2 1 u 2 after substitution in δ y m s y it comes 42 δ y m s y r 1 e a 1 k 1 d 2 4 e a 1 2 k 1 1 u 2 1 u 2 2 therefore in order to have a positive excess yield δ y m s y 0 we would need to check 43 g u u 2 1 u 2 1 2 as 0 u 1 this is never possible indeed g 0 g 1 1 furthermore g u has a minimum when u 1 2 and g 1 2 1 2 therefore for any similar spatial distribution of the prey and predator fish symmetric or not it is impossible to have a positive excess yield in the homogeneous case 3 2 2 heterogeneous case fig 5 a shows an almost homogeneous case where the two sites are similar same growth rate r and same predation parameter a here we fix the proportion v of predators in zone 1 and we will vary the proportion of preys u we assume that the predator is mainly located in patch 1 by choosing v 0 9 as expected when k 1 k 2 100 the yield excess is negative then we break the homogeneity by increasing k 1 and we look at the effect of the prey proportion the global maximum in this range of parameters u k 1 is about 20 fig 5 b shows an heterogeneous case with respect to a where the growth rate r 2 is much larger in patch 2 and the predation parameter is much larger in patch 1 compared to the homogeneous case a the global maximum in this range of parameters u k 1 is much higher about 130 site 2 has a high growth rate with few predators as a result it constitutes a productive site a reservoir of preys which are little captured and migrate to site 1 where the predators are numerous and very efficient this would explain the increase of the global productivity at msy of the system of connected patches with respect to isolated patches therefore we could interpret this result as a spillover effect of the prey reservoir fig 5 b shows that the global maximum in this range δ y m s y u k 1 130 is obtained when the carrying capacity k 1 is the largest i e k 1 900 and for a prey proportion at the ideal free distribution ifd bernstein et al 1999 see table 1 we define the percentage of yield excess as δ y m s y 100 δ y m s y y m s y 1 y m s y 2 which equals 35 1 at the global maximum of fig 5 b table 1 shows that the maximum excess yield is obtained when the prey is at ifd i e when u k 1 k 1 k 2 0 9 a strong heterogeneity between the two patches with an asymmetric spatial distribution of the prey to be at ifd and of the predator with u v favors the increase of the yield excess in appendix b we show the following general condition to have a positive excess yield δ y m s y 44 α u 2 β 1 u 2 α u 2 γ 1 u 2 e a 1 α k 1 u β 1 u u 2 γ 1 u 2 α u 2 β 1 u 2 d 2 e a 1 k 1 d 2 β γ 2 α e γ a 1 α k 1 d 2 where we consider a heterogeneous case characterized by dimensionless positive parameters of heterogeneity α β and γ defined as follows 45 k 2 α k 1 46 r 2 β r 1 47 a 2 γ a 1 a very heterogeneous system means that α is small respectively large i e the carrying capacity of patch 2 is small respectively large compared to that of patch 1 and similarly for β and γ with respect to growth rates and predator efficiency furthermore assuming a highly asymmetric distribution for instance u 1 it is shown in appendix b that the previous formula becomes 48 β α γ e a 1 α γ k 1 u β 1 u β d 2 e a 1 k 1 d 2 β γ 2 α e γ a 1 α k 1 d 2 for example choosing u 0 1 β α 100 then α 0 01 and the inequality is checked indeed the right hand side is small of the order of 0 02 e a 1 k 1 d 2 while the left hand side is of the order of e a 1 k 1 d 2 consequently conditions of strong heterogeneity with an asymmetrical distribution make it possible to obtain a positive yield excess 4 the 2 patch holling type ii predator prey model with fast migrations we consider a system of two fishing areas connected by migrations we consider the prey predator model with a holling type ii functional response at each patch the prey and its predator can move from one fishing area to another the complete model reads as follows 49 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 ε a b 1 p 1 b 1 d 50 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 ε r 2 b 2 1 b 2 k 2 ε a b 2 p 2 b 2 d 51 d p 1 d τ k 2 p 2 k 1 p 1 ε e a b 1 p 1 b 1 d d p 1 e p 1 52 d p 2 d τ k 1 p 1 k 2 p 2 ε e a b 2 p 2 b 2 d d p 2 e p 2 we use the same notations as before we assume the same predation parameters a and d in each patch for instance we assume that the prey handling time for the predator is the same in both patches the fig 6 shows the results for the numerical bifurcation analysis of the complete model eqs 49 52 this example is for the parameter set k 1 75 k 2 15 d 25 r 1 0 05 r 2 2 5 a 2 e 1 0 d 0 3 m 1 0 1 m 2 0 185 and k 1 0 02 k 2 0 98 with ɛ 0 05 below the transcritical bifurcation t c the predator is extinct above t c there exists a stable interior equilibrium after reduction the aggregated model reads as follows 53 d b d

equilibrium hence the fast migration equilibrium equations eqs 20 23 also hold now for all times the expressions for the prey populations r eq 6 and k eq 8 are the same as in previous cases adding the two equations for the prey eq 49 50 and predator eqs 51 52 gives the aggregated model eqs 53 54 this shows that the aggregated four dimensional system and the two dimensional system are equivalent

sites and isolated sites as a function of the fishing effort e each curve has a maximum corresponding to the msy it is good to note that for the value of the fishing effort at msy e 0 49 for the complete system of connected sites the bifurcation diagram of fig 6 predicts a stable equilibrium this result is in agreement with fig 8 showing the solutions of the reduced model with also a stable equilibrium simulations not shown here show that for each isolated site there is also a stable equilibrium this allows us to calculate the optimal catch at msy of the system of connected sites and compare with the optimal ones of isolated sites fig 7 shows that for this example there is a positive excess yield equal to δ y m s y 1 36 with respect to y m s y 1 y m s y 2 4 67 i e about 29 increase the type of ecosystem control remains a central question in theoretical ecology leroux and loreau 2015 if the prey and predators do not move or little the predator will control the survival or extinction of the prey at each site with a top down type of control however in our model not only the predator but also its prey are free to move between the two sites the preys can thus be distributed to optimize their overall growth and productivity by adopting the ifd the fast movement of the prey is in a way a bottom up control strategy it seems that the loss of top down control results in the prey increasing its productivity which favors the predator and in turn increases its capture and the yield excess at the msy 5 effects of connectivity of fishing sites on the total productivity of the fishery we will now study the effect of the connection of two fishing sites by comparing the total catch at msy of the coupled sites with that of the two isolated sites for two suggested application examples 5 1 the case of a predator prey fish community with type i functional response let us consider the predator prey system of tuna and sardinella in west africa thiaw et al 2017 tuna live offshore a huge site but with less food and sardinella live on the continental shelf which is a smaller area but very rich in food for sardinella such as plankton tuna eat sardinella and sardinella eat plankton plankton is mainly on the continental shelf tuna are hampered by plankton lack of visibility so they stay most of time offshore and come on continental shelf to predate because sardinella is abundant thus in our example the prey fish could be sardinella and the predator tuna fishing site 1 corresponds to the coastal zone or continental shelf and fishing site 2 to the high seas zone or offshore sardinella abundance is correlated to coastal upwelling index thiaw et al 2017 when the upwelling is high there are significant amounts of nutrients on the coast that are food for plankton this allows high plankton density which is the food of small fish for the sake of simplicity we assume that the density of plankton is constant in both areas it can be considered that the carrying capacity depends on the concentration of plankton in each zone plankton is more abundant in the coastal zone in reality sardinella is also caught and not just tuna in addition there are different industrial and artisanal fishing fleets that exploit both species the tuna does not only eat sardinella but also other small fish as well as squid we therefore do not have the ambition to describe the tuna sardinella prey predator system with a too simple model at this stage we propose a potential example of application with values of parameters which respect the conditions of heterogeneity and predation pressure in the two zones such as in the example of the tuna sardinella system thus in our example we set k 1 700 in coastal area and k 2 80 offshore we also assume that the growth of sardinella is better in the coastal area r 1 4 and r 2 2 tunas are more effective at catching sardinella in the open sea rather than in coastal area so we set a 1 0 2 and a 2 2 we also choose e 0 8 and similar predator mortality in the two zones d 10 sardinellas spend a large part of their time in coastal areas so we assumed that u 0 85 the tunas stay most of the time on the high seas and make forays into coastal areas and we have chosen v 0 15 fig 9 shows equilibrium catches in the two isolated fishing zones as a function of the fishing effort each of them shows a maximum corresponding to the msy the maximum catch in the first fishing site is equal to y m s y 1 464 for the second one the optimal catch is equal to y m s y 2 27 fig 10 shows that the equilibrium catch in the system of connected fishing sites as a function of the fishing effort the curve also shows a maximum corresponding to the msy the maximum catch in the system of connected fishing areas is equal to y m s y 520 this value of the total catch of the fishery at msy is obtained when the two fishing sites are connected by fish migrations it is greater than the sum of the maximum catches of the two fishing sites if they would be isolated and exploited separately the excess productivity of the fishery is equal to δ y m s y 29 which corresponds to a small but positive percentage gain at 5 9 on another hand artificial reefs are known to have an effect on fish productivity therefore the establishment of artificial reefs in coastal areas makes it possible to increase the carrying capacity of small fish like sardinella it seems possible to seek to fix the carrying capacity of the coastal zone in order to optimize the excess yield fig 11 shows the yield excess as a function of prey fish proportion u and carrying capacity k 1 in fishing zone 1 it shows that for a fixed carrying capacity k 1 there is a maximum when the prey distributes at ifd it also shows that at fixed prey proportion in site 1 there is a value of the carrying capacity k 1 that maximizes the excess yield thus we could think of installing artificial reefs in coastal areas to set the carrying capacity at some optimal value leading to a better excess yield another important aspect concerns the installation of marine protected areas mpa in the complete lotka volterra model of connected sites with 4 equations it is possible to consider different fishing effort e 1 and e 2 on each site in the aggregated model reduced to 2 equations it is easy to check that nothing will be changed except the overall fishing effort which will be written 59 e e 1 v e 2 1 v in this case there are two control variables e 1 and e 2 and finding the msy is a more difficult problem not addressed in this work however in the case of an mpa the problem is simplified to a single variable the fishing effort of the area which is not mpa if for example zone 2 is mpa you have to choose the global effort e m s y e a k d 2 to be at msy in this case we will have to fish more in fishing site 1 because we have the following relation 60 e 1 v e a k d 2 v 1 more fishing must be done in the fishing area to reach the msy to compensate for the loss of catch in the protected area the study of the effects of marine reserves in fishery modeling has received a great deal of attention hannesson grafton et al 2005 greenville and macaulay 2006 for a two patch model with two species and protected areas most models focus on the effect on the total population as well as on the resulting increase in fishermen s income in a stable environment or with ecological uncertainty however in our study we are looking for the conditions of heterogeneity and asymmetric diffusion that make it possible to obtain an overall productivity of the fishery higher than that of isolated fisheries at msy 5 2 the case of a predator prey fish community with holling type ii functional response we now study a predator prey model with a holling type ii functional response thus we still consider a prey predator community in a two patch environment with two marine zones one with a high carrying capacity and the other with a smaller carrying capacity for the prey in this new example the first area is a fishing area where the prey and its predator can stay we suppose that the second zone is a mangrove the mangrove forms a shelter for juvenile fish and small prey fish to predators predators have great difficulty in catching prey in the mangrove because of the turbidity of the water which prevents them from detecting the prey it is also usual to consider that mangroves allow fish to grow faster because they spend more time feeding than escaping their predator some predatory fish may venture into the mangroves but they do not stay there for long because they capture little prey fish larger carnivorous fish do not venture deep inside the mangrove rönnbäck et al 1999 we will consider an example where prey is abundant in the common area consequently and for the sake of simplicity we will further assume that the predator is a large one and remains only in the fishing zone thus the predator does not move and stays in patch 1 where it is harvested at constant rate e in this example we assume a holling type ii functional response the complete model reads as follows 61 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 ε a b 1 p b 1 d 62 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 ε r 2 b 2 1 b 2 k 2 63 d p d τ ε e a b 1 p b 1 d d p e p we use the same notations as in the previous models a is the predation parameter in patch 1 d 0 is another predation parameter associated with the handling time in reality the mangrove is an area where juvenile fish mainly thrive it would therefore be necessary to develop a more complex model with age or size classes of prey fish here we consider a simple example with an unstructured prey population in this example site 1 is a fishing area and site 2 is the mangrove we assume that the prey fish are abundant in the fishing area k 1 75 and less in the mangrove k 2 5 we also assume that prey fish growth rate is higher in the mangrove r 1 0 5 and r 2 2 5 other parameters are the following a 2 d 5 e 0 5 d 0 5 and u 0 95 the fig 12 shows the results for the bifurcation analysis of the three dimensional complete model with prey refuge 61 63 with parameter set k 1 75 k 2 5 d 5 r 1 0 5 r 2 2 5 a 2 e

unstable with stable limit cycles these results indicate that for a large region e 0 3 the system can collapse due to stochastic effects rosenzweig 1971 after reduction the aggregated model reads as

let us look for the fishing effort that maximizes the total catch of the two connected fishing sites this fishing effort corresponds to a zero of the derivative of the total catch i e d y e d e 0 the

there exists a stable positive equilibrium fig 12 fig 13 presents function y e with respect to e in that case we compare the productivity of the fishery of the system of connected sites to the productivity of isolated site 1 our simulations have shown that for isolated patch 1 there also exists a stable equilibrium the maximum yield msy for coupled patches shows a maximum at about y 2 71 see fig 13 while the yield of isolated patch 1 at msy is about y 1 2 04 see fig 14 in this example we check that the maximum yield at msy for coupled patches is greater than the maximum yield msy for isolated patch 1 in order to have a positive yield excess it is needed to maintain a large proportion of prey u in patch 1 table 2 shows results for the same set of parameters k 1 75 k 2 5 d 5 r 1 0 5 r 2 2 5 a 2 e 0 5 d 0 5 but for different values of the proportion of prey u in patch 1 ranging from 0 89 to 0 99 in that example the yield excess in percentage is defined as δ y m s y 100 δ y m s y y m s y 1 the maximum of yield excess in percentage is still obtained when u 0 94 interestingly in this example the proportion of prey in the two sites that maximizes the excess yield corresponds again to the ifd indeed at ifd we should have a proportion of prey on site 1 equal to u k 1 k 1 k 2 0 9375 as a consequence we have shown in this case that it is useful to connect the two sites this result is still expected insofar as the effect of a refuge for the prey is favorable to its predator 6 concluding remarks in this work we studied several fishery models at two sites connected by fast fish migrations in the first part we considered the simplest fishing model with a single species of fish exploited on two fishing sites we have assumed that the fish obey a logistic type growth at each fishing site it is known that by connecting the two sites with fast constant migration rates the total equilibrium population at the two sites can be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities of each site however we have shown that the optimal total catch at msy on the two connected fishing sites is always less than or equal to the sum of the optimal catches on each of the isolated sites this result can be seen as negative but constitutes in our eyes an interesting result in the next part we considered a simple prey predator community of fish we considered a predator fish that feeds on another fish species we further assumed that only predator fish are caught and not their prey we have assumed that the prey fish obey a logistic type growth at each site in this case we got the opposite result as in the previous part at msy the total catch may be greater than the sum of the catches at the two isolated fishing sites this result is obtained in the case of a lotka volterra type i or holling type ii functional response for the prey predator model in the last part we have discussed two methods of managing a system of two fishing sites in the first example the manager installs artificial reefs in one of the two fishing sites in the second example it creates a refuge for the prey in the second patch the first example considers a type i functional response and the second one of type ii in both cases the total optimal catch of the connected sites can be greater than the sum of the catches on the isolated sites to achieve this result it is necessary to connect a fishing site with a large carrying capacity and a low prey growth rate to a site with a small carrying capacity but a higher growth rate it is therefore necessary to connect by fast migration two heterogeneous sites for the prey in the future we could generalize our work to a network of n 2 fishing sites connected by fish migrations we would also like to study the case with two different fishing efforts at each site and find the msy we want to mention previous works concerning multi site fisheries connected by migrations where the number and size of fishing sites allowing to optimize the fishing yield has been researched as well as the effects of marine protected areas moussaoui et al 2014 bensenane et al 2013 auger et al 2010 and the effects of artificial reefs brochier et al 2021 in the case of the holling type ii functional response we have limited our study to the case where there exists a stable interior prey predator equilibrium an interesting perspective would be to generalize the method to the case of periodic solutions by using averaging methods along a stable limit cycle in this work we have considered potential application examples with very simplified models compared to reality the example of sardinella and tuna as well as the example of a fishing site and a mangrove in perspective we would like to develop a concrete example with marine biologists by considering a more complex and realistic mathematical model we could also consider an application to a fish farm with different areas and basins connected to each other with the objective of

24461,we present a model of a fish population present on two patches connected by migrations fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught we assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing taking advantage of the time scales we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale we are looking for the maximum sustainable yield msy for the system of the two connected patches we show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites we then consider a prey predator community of fish in the same environment we assume that only the predator is caught and not its prey growing logistically on each site we study the lotka volterra prey predator model as well as the model with a type ii holling functional response we show that the total catch at msy of the system of connected sites can be greater than the sum of the captures on each isolated site this result is obtained when a fishing site with a large prey carrying capacity and an average growth rate is connected to a site with a small carrying capacity but a large growth rate finally we discuss fishery management methods on two fishing sites for the lotka volterra model as well as the holling type ii model in the case of a prey refuge keywords maximum sustainable yield fishery management fishery on two sites connected by fast migrations aggregation of variables predator prey model 1 introduction many authors have been interested in population dynamics in heterogeneous environments that can be represented by a set of discrete sites connected to each other by migratory flows particular interest was given to the study of the effects of migration on the global dynamics of the metapopulation levin 1974 deangelis and zhang 2014 deangelis et al 2016 many works have considered the case where the populations on each site obey a law of logistic growth the 2 patch model and the generalization to a network of n sites n 2 have been studied most authors looked for the conditions allowing to have a global equilibrium greater than the sum of the carrying capacities of all the sites holt 1985 freedman and waltman 1977 poggiale et al 2005 arditi et al 2015 2018 wang and deangelis 2019 elbetch et al 2021 on another side many models of exploited populations have been studied in particular in the field of fisheries murray 2002 a single harvested species as well as exploited prey predator communities spencer and collie 1995b a with a ratio dependent functional response a particularly important aspect concerns the optimal management of a fishery to ensure maximum profitability of the fishery by looking for the conditions to reach the msy clark 1990 several authors have been interested in determining the msy in various fish prey predator communities legovic and gecek 2010 legovic et al 2011 legovic and gecek 2012 ghosh and kar 2013 kar and ghosh 2013 another aspect of fishery modeling concerns taking into account the heterogeneity of fishing zones the heterogeneity of the fishery can be taken into account by considering a spatially continuous model with parameters of growth and interactions which depend on the position in space another way to do this is to consider separate and different fishing areas which can be connected together by migrations of various fish species as well as fishing fleets it is this last approach that we adopt in this work we focus our approach on the case of fishing areas close enough so that the migrations of fish between areas can take place at a fast time scale compared to local population growth and capture the existence of two time scales will allow us to reduce the dimension of the complete model taking into account all the growth and fishing terms on each site as well as the migration terms and to derive a reduced model governing only the total fish biomass of all sites at a slow time scale these reduction methods make it possible to study the complete model using the simplified reduced model in previous work poggiale et al 2005 studied the case of a single logistically growing population at two sites connected by fast migrations they showed that the total population of the two sites connected by fast migrations at constant rates could tend towards a stable equilibrium greater than the sum of the carrying capacities of the two isolated sites this result shows that it is possible to increase the productivity of a population living on two sites by adequately connecting the two sites with migrations poggiale et al 2005 we generalize this last work by considering that the logistically growing local populations are moreover captured the question that arises in the general context of a fishery on two sites is to find out whether the total catch of the system of the two sites connected by migrations can be greater than the sum of the optimal catches of the two isolated sites i e at msy is there a way to make connections between fishing areas that increases the total catch of the fishery the first part of the present work concerns a single harvested population on two sites in this first case we show that the answer to the previous question is negative we then address this issue in the case of a prey predator community of fish from which only the predator is caught we show that in this second case the answer is positive this part studies a fish prey predator community with a type i functional response the predator of which is always fished on two sites as well as a fish community with a type ii functional response the last part focuses on the effects of connectivity of two fishing areas on the global productivity of the fishery with two suggested concrete application examples the work ends with concluding remarks and perspectives 2 a two patch population model with logistic growth and constant fast migrations 2 1 without harvesting we start by recalling the result given in the following poggiale et al 2005 in which the authors considered a single population in a two patch environment in our case we consider a fish population growing on two sites the movements between patches are described by constant migration rates migrations are assumed to be fast in comparison to local dynamics let us recall the model 1 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 2 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 ε r 2 b 2 1 b 2 k 2 where for i 1 2 b i are fish biomass on patch i parameters r i and k i represent the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity on patch i the migration rates m i are constant time scales are included in the model by using the fast time variable τ together with the positive dimensionless parameter ε 1 that represents their ratio t is the slow time such that t ε τ the complete model can be reduced as a first step we consider the fast system which is obtained by setting ε 0 in the complete system in our case the fast equilibrium can be easily calculated and is given by 3 b 1 u b m 2 m 1 m 2 b 4 b 2 1 u b m 1 m 1 m 2 b where u m 2 m 1 m 2 represents the constant proportion of fish biomass in patch 1 and 1 u in patch 2 at the fast equilibrium a reduced model is obtained by substituting the fast stable equilibrium into the complete system adding two by two equations for fish biomass and by using slow time we get the following aggregated model governing the total fish biomass b b 1 b 2 at the slow time which is valid when it is structurally stable and for small enough value of ε 5 d b d t r b 1 b k o ε for reduction methods using small parameters we refer to tikhonov 1952 for aggregation of variables methods we refer to iwasa et al 1989 when the reduced system obtained by substituting the fast equilibrium in the complete model is not structurally stable it is necessary to use reduction methods based on the center manifold theorem allowing following term of order ε to be calculated see auger et al 2008a and auger et al 2008b with constant migration rates the global aggregated equation is a logistic equation such as local equations in the long term b tends to the stable equilibrium b k the overall fish growth rate of the reduced model reads poggiale et al 2005 6 r u r 1 1 u r 2 and the overall fish carrying capacity checks the next expression 7 r k r 1 u 2 k 1 r 2 1 u 2 k 2 and is expressed as follows 8 k k 1 k 2 u r 1 1 u r 2 u 2 k 2 r 1 1 u 2 k 1 r 2 in the homogeneous case r 1 r 2 and k 1 k 2 the formula is simplified to give 9 k h o m o g e n e o u s k 1 u 2 1 u 2 in the case of symmetric diffusion u 0 5 it is easy to check that k h o m o g e n e o u s s y m 2 k 1 in the heterogeneous case and symmetric diffusion r 1 r 2 and for instance k 1 k 2 the global carrying capacity reads as follows 10 k h e t e r o g e n e o u s s y m 2 k 1 k 2 r 1 r 2 k 2 r 1 k 1 r 2 it is easy to check that the total population in the homogeneous case can never be exceeded by that of the heterogeneous case i e k h e t e r o g e n e o u s s y m k h o m o g e n e o u s s y m equivalent to k 2 k 1 see also wang and deangelis 2019 in order to have a total carrying capacity greater than the sum of isolated local ones we need heterogeneity and asymmetric diffusion as an example let us choose k 1 k 2 50 r 1 10 r 2 1 and u 1 3 then k 128 57 100 therefore the total equilibrium fish biomass of the system of connected logistic patches can be greater than the sum of equilibrium biomass of isolated patches in other words we have b k k 1 k 2 see poggiale et al 2005 freedman and waltman 1977 and arditi et al 2015 for a complete analysis of the two patch model 2 2 with harvesting we continue with a new part in which we assume that the fish population is exploited with a correspondingly identical rate in each of the two sites we will now ask ourselves if the total productivity of the fishery by connecting the two fishing systems can be improved compared to the case of disconnected sites we still consider a system of two patches connected by fast migrations where fish sub populations grow logistically see fig 1 we still assume that the exchanges between the sites are fast in comparison to local growth and fishing the only change we consider is to assume that the fish population is harvested in both sites the complete model reads as follows 11 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 q e b 1 12 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 ε r 2 b 2 1 b 2 k 2 q e b 2 we assume a schaefer catch on each patch i schaefer 1957 i e q e b i i 1 2 where e is the fishing effort and q is the catchability for sake of simplicity we set q 1 in the next parts in the case of constant migrations using the same reduction method as before we obtain an aggregated model which reads as follows 13 d b d t r b 1 b k e b where r and k are the same as in the previous sub section without fishing in that case the population equilibrium becomes b k 1 e r which is positive and stable when e r the maximum sustainable yield msy for connected patches is obtained when e e m s y r 2 in that case the maximum sustainable yield reads y r k 4 clark 1990 murray 2002 see also for more details appendix a on the other hand for isolated patches without migrations we choose respectively e 1 r 1 2 resp e 2 r 2 2 for the fishing effort in patch 1 resp 2 then the total maximum sustainable yields are respectively r 1 k 1 4 and r 2 k 2 4 in each isolated patch now we are going to compare at msy the yield for the aggregated system to the sum of yields for isolated patches we are going to show that 14 r k 4 r 1 k 1 4 r 2 k 2 4 indeed substituting the expressions of the global growth rate r r 1 u 1 u r 2 and of the global carrying capacity k k 1 k 2 r 1 u r 2 1 u r 1 u 2 r 2 1 u 2 of the aggregated model in the previous inequality it comes 15 r 1 u r 2 1 u 2 k 1 k 2 r 1 k 2 u 2 r 2 k 1 1 u 2 r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 for any 0 u 1 after simplification the inequality becomes k 1 1 u k 2 u 2 0 which is always verified therefore while it is possible to have a global equilibrium for connected patches greater than the sum of the carrying capacities for isolated sites i e b k 1 k 2 it is impossible to have the maximum sustainable yield msy for connected sites greater than the sum of yields at msy for isolated patches fig 2 shows logistic growth functions g b for patch 1 patch 2 and the aggregated model these growth functions are negative parabola intersecting the horizontal axis at 0 and at the corresponding carrying capacity at equilibrium we check r b 1 b k e b for any growth function for each growth curve the msy is found when b is at half the carrying capacity in other words the catch at msy equals the value of the growth function at half of the carrying capacity it thus corresponds to the maximum of each growth function between the origin and the carrying capacity fig 2 shows just an example with r 2 r 1 and k 2 k 1 and k k 1 k 2 for u 0 7 the slope of each logistic growth function is equal to the growth rate at the origin we know that r 1 r r 2 the growth function of the aggregated model must be between the two growth curves of each patch at least when b is close to zero fig 2 shows an example where even if k k 1 k 2 r k 4 3 73 does not exceed r 1 k 1 4 r 2 k 2 4 3 75 for u 1 the green curve of the aggregated model is the same as the blue curve and for u 0 it is similar to the red one for any u in between the curve of the aggregated system lies between the other two intuitively because the growth curve of the aggregated model is mostly framed by the two growth curves of each patch the catch of the fishery of the two coupled sites must always be less or equal than the sum of the catches of the two isolated sites in other words if the global carrying capacity can be greater than the sum of the local carrying capacity the overall growth rate is always lower than the greater of the local growth rates which limits the overall catch which can never exceed the sum of local catches this result is negative but it shows that in the simplest case of a single fish population exploited on two sites it is impossible to increase the total productivity of the fishery by connecting the two sites between them we will now show in the next section that this becomes possible when we consider a fish prey predator system from which the predator is captured 3 the two patch prey predator model with lotka volterra functional response and constant fast migrations 3 1 presentation and reduction of the two patch prey predator model we consider a prey predator fish community in a two patch environment the movements between patches are still described by constant rates and fast in comparison to local dynamics let us consider the following model 16 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 ε a 1 b 1 p 1 17 d b

respectively fish prey and predator biomass on patch i i 1 2 parameters r i and k i represent the fish prey intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity on patch i fig 3 shows the system of connected patches the fish prey and predator can move in both sites the fish predator catches the fish prey in both patches a i is the predation parameter in patch i e is the conversion parameter of prey biomass into predator biomass d is the predator mortality rate the predator is harvested in both sites at a constant fishing effort e prey and predator are assumed to move fast with respect to local growth and predation prey respectively predator leave patch 1 to go to patch 2 at the constant rate m 1 resp k 1 prey respectively predator return to patch 1 leaving patch 2 at constant rate m 2 resp k 2 time scales are still included in the model by using the fast time variable τ together with the positive dimensionless parameter ε 1 the fast system is obtained by setting ε 0 in the complete system in our case the fast equilibrium for the fish prey is given by 20 b 1 u b m 2 m 1 m 2 b 21 b 2 1 u b m 1 m 1 m 2 b where u represents the constant proportion of fish prey biomass in patch 1 and 1 u in patch 2 at the fast equilibrium in the same way the fast equilibrium for the fish predator is given by 22 p 1 v p k 2 k 1 k 2 p 23 p 2 1 v p k 1 k 1 k 2 p where v represents the constant proportion of predator biomass in patch 1 and 1 v in patch 2 at the fast equilibrium a reduced model is obtained by substituting the fast stable equilibrium into the complete system adding two by two equations for fish prey and predator biomass and by using slow time we get the following aggregated model governing the total fish prey biomass b b 1 b 2 and fish predator p p 1 p 2 at the slow time

when parameter ε is small enough i e 0 1 the right figure shows the phase portrait still comparing the complete red and aggregated blue models for ε 0 1 the calculation of the total catch at equilibrium is recalled in appendix a for the system of two coupled patches the total catch is a function of the fishing effort as follows 31 y e e p r e a 1 d e e a k as well as for isolated patch 1 32 y 1 e e p r 1 e a 1 1 d e e a 1 k 1 and isolated patch 2 33 y 2 e e p r 2 e a 2 1 d e e a 2 k 2 now we consider the maximum sustainable yield msy associated with the fishing effort which maximizes the catch see appendix let y m s y be the maximum yield for the system of the two connected patches by fast migrations which is given by the next expression 34 y m s y r 4 e a 2 k e a k d 2 and it must be compared to the maximum yields at msy for patch 1 35 y m s y 1 r 1 4 e a 1 2 k 1 e a 1 k 1 d 2 and patch 2 36 y m s y 2 r 2 4 e a 2 2 k 2 e a 2 k 2 d 2 3 2 comparison at msy of the global yield in case of connected sites with the sum of yields of isolated sites in the lotka volterra model with type i functional response let us see if the maximum yield for connected patches can be greater than the sum of yields associated with single isolated patches in other words let us check if 37 y m s y y m s y 1 y m s y 2 let us define the yield excess as follows 38 δ y m s y y m s y y m s y 1 y m s y 2 we are now going to look for the conditions allowing to obtain a positive excess yield 3 2 1 homogeneous case let us consider the homogeneous case i e k 1 k 2 r 1 r 2 a 1 a 2 furthermore we assume that the predator distributes spatially like its prey v u parameters of the aggregated model are the following 39 r r 1 40 a a 1 u 2 1 u 2 41 k k 1 u 2 1 u 2 after substitution in δ y m s y it comes 42 δ y m s y r 1 e a 1 k 1 d 2 4 e a 1 2 k 1 1 u 2 1 u 2 2 therefore in order to have a positive excess yield δ y m s y 0 we would need to check 43 g u u 2 1 u 2 1 2 as 0 u 1 this is never possible indeed g 0 g 1 1 furthermore g u has a minimum when u 1 2 and g 1 2 1 2 therefore for any similar spatial distribution of the prey and predator fish symmetric or not it is impossible to have a positive excess yield in the homogeneous case 3 2 2 heterogeneous case fig 5 a shows an almost homogeneous case where the two sites are similar same growth rate r and same predation parameter a here we fix the proportion v of predators in zone 1 and we will vary the proportion of preys u we assume that the predator is mainly located in patch 1 by choosing v 0 9 as expected when k 1 k 2 100 the yield excess is negative then we break the homogeneity by increasing k 1 and we look at the effect of the prey proportion the global maximum in this range of parameters u k 1 is about 20 fig 5 b shows an heterogeneous case with respect to a where the growth rate r 2 is much larger in patch 2 and the predation parameter is much larger in patch 1 compared to the homogeneous case a the global maximum in this range of parameters u k 1 is much higher about 130 site 2 has a high growth rate with few predators as a result it constitutes a productive site a reservoir of preys which are little captured and migrate to site 1 where the predators are numerous and very efficient this would explain the increase of the global productivity at msy of the system of connected patches with respect to isolated patches therefore we could interpret this result as a spillover effect of the prey reservoir fig 5 b shows that the global maximum in this range δ y m s y u k 1 130 is obtained when the carrying capacity k 1 is the largest i e k 1 900 and for a prey proportion at the ideal free distribution ifd bernstein et al 1999 see table 1 we define the percentage of yield excess as δ y m s y 100 δ y m s y y m s y 1 y m s y 2 which equals 35 1 at the global maximum of fig 5 b table 1 shows that the maximum excess yield is obtained when the prey is at ifd i e when u k 1 k 1 k 2 0 9 a strong heterogeneity between the two patches with an asymmetric spatial distribution of the prey to be at ifd and of the predator with u v favors the increase of the yield excess in appendix b we show the following general condition to have a positive excess yield δ y m s y 44 α u 2 β 1 u 2 α u 2 γ 1 u 2 e a 1 α k 1 u β 1 u u 2 γ 1 u 2 α u 2 β 1 u 2 d 2 e a 1 k 1 d 2 β

very heterogeneous system means that α is small respectively large i e the carrying capacity of patch 2 is small respectively large compared to that of patch 1 and similarly for β and γ with respect to growth rates and predator efficiency furthermore assuming a highly asymmetric distribution for instance u 1 it is shown in appendix b that the previous formula becomes 48 β α γ e a 1 α γ k 1 u β 1 u β d 2 e a 1 k 1 d 2 β γ 2 α e γ a 1 α k 1 d 2 for example choosing u 0 1 β α 100 then α 0 01 and the inequality is checked indeed the right hand side is small of the order of 0 02 e a 1 k 1 d 2 while the left hand side is of the order of e a 1 k 1 d 2 consequently conditions of strong heterogeneity with an asymmetrical distribution make it possible to obtain a positive yield excess 4 the 2 patch holling type ii predator prey model with fast migrations we consider a system of two fishing areas connected by migrations we consider the prey predator model with a holling type ii functional response at each patch the prey and its predator can move from one fishing area to another the complete model reads as follows 49 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 ε a b 1 p 1 b 1 d 50 d b

notations as before we assume the same predation parameters a and d in each patch for instance we assume that the prey handling time for the predator is the same in both patches the fig 6 shows the results for the numerical bifurcation analysis of the complete model eqs 49 52 this example is for the parameter set k 1 75 k 2 15 d 25 r 1 0 05 r 2 2 5 a 2 e 1 0 d 0 3 m 1 0 1 m 2 0 185 and k 1 0 02

equilibrium hence the fast migration equilibrium equations eqs 20 23 also hold now for all times the expressions for the prey populations r eq 6 and k eq 8 are the same as in previous cases adding the two equations for the prey eq 49 50 and predator eqs 51 52 gives the aggregated model eqs 53 54 this shows that the aggregated four dimensional system and the two dimensional system are equivalent

sites and isolated sites as a function of the fishing effort e each curve has a maximum corresponding to the msy it is good to note that for the value of the fishing effort at msy e 0 49 for the complete system of connected sites the bifurcation diagram of fig 6 predicts a stable equilibrium this result is in agreement with fig 8 showing the solutions of the reduced model with also a stable equilibrium simulations not shown here show that for each isolated site there is also a stable equilibrium this allows us to calculate the optimal catch at msy of the system of connected sites and compare with the optimal ones of isolated sites fig 7 shows that for this example there is a positive excess yield equal to δ y m s y 1 36 with respect to y m s y 1 y m s y 2 4 67 i e about 29 increase the type of ecosystem control remains a central question in theoretical ecology leroux and loreau 2015 if the prey and predators do not move or little the predator will control the survival or extinction of the prey at each site with a top down type of control however in our model not only the predator but also its prey are free to move between the two sites the preys can thus be distributed to optimize their overall growth and productivity by adopting the ifd the fast movement of the prey is in a way a bottom up control strategy it seems that the loss of top down control results in the prey increasing its productivity which favors the predator and in turn increases its capture and the yield excess at the msy 5 effects of connectivity of fishing sites on the total productivity of the fishery we will now study the effect of the connection of two fishing sites by comparing the total catch at msy of the coupled sites with that of the two isolated sites for two suggested application examples 5 1 the case of a predator prey fish community with type i functional response let us consider the predator prey system of tuna and sardinella in west africa thiaw et al 2017 tuna live offshore a huge site but with less food and sardinella live on the continental shelf which is a smaller area but very rich in food for sardinella such as plankton tuna eat sardinella and sardinella eat plankton plankton is mainly on the continental shelf tuna are hampered by plankton lack of visibility so they stay most of time offshore and come on continental shelf to predate because sardinella is abundant thus in our example the prey fish could be sardinella and the predator tuna fishing site 1 corresponds to the coastal zone or continental shelf and fishing site 2 to the high seas zone or offshore sardinella abundance is correlated to coastal upwelling index thiaw et al 2017 when the upwelling is high there are significant amounts of nutrients on the coast that are food for plankton this allows high plankton density which is the food of small fish for the sake of simplicity we assume that the density of plankton is constant in both areas it can be considered that the carrying capacity depends on the concentration of plankton in each zone plankton is more abundant in the coastal zone in reality sardinella is also caught and not just tuna in addition there are different industrial and artisanal fishing fleets that exploit both species the tuna does not only eat sardinella but also other small fish as well as squid we therefore do not have the ambition to describe the tuna sardinella prey predator system with a too simple model at this stage we propose a potential example of application with values of parameters which respect the conditions of heterogeneity and predation pressure in the two zones such as in the example of the tuna sardinella system thus in our example we set k 1 700 in coastal area and k 2 80 offshore we also assume that the growth of sardinella is better in the coastal area r 1 4 and r 2 2 tunas are more effective at catching sardinella in the open sea rather than in coastal area so we set a 1 0 2 and a 2 2 we also choose e 0 8 and similar predator mortality in the two zones d 10 sardinellas spend a large part of their time in coastal areas so we assumed that u 0 85 the tunas stay most of the time on the high seas and make forays into coastal areas and we have chosen v 0 15 fig 9 shows equilibrium catches in the two isolated fishing zones as a function of the fishing effort each of them shows a maximum corresponding to the msy the maximum catch in the first fishing site is equal to y m s y 1 464 for the second one the optimal catch is equal to y m s y 2 27 fig 10 shows that the equilibrium catch in the system of connected fishing sites as a function of the fishing effort the curve also shows a maximum corresponding to the msy the maximum catch in the system of connected fishing areas is equal to y m s y 520 this value of the total catch of the fishery at msy is obtained when the two fishing sites are connected by fish migrations it is greater than the sum of the maximum catches of the two fishing sites if they would be isolated and exploited separately the excess productivity of the fishery is equal to δ y m s y 29 which corresponds to a small but positive percentage gain at 5 9 on another hand artificial reefs are known to have an effect on fish productivity therefore the establishment of artificial reefs in coastal areas makes it possible to increase the carrying capacity of small fish like sardinella it seems possible to seek to fix the carrying capacity of the coastal zone in order to optimize the excess yield fig 11 shows the yield excess as a function of prey fish proportion u and carrying capacity k 1 in fishing zone 1 it shows that for a fixed carrying capacity k 1 there is a maximum when the prey distributes at ifd it also shows that at fixed prey proportion in site 1 there is a value of the carrying capacity k 1 that maximizes the excess yield thus we could think of installing artificial reefs in coastal areas to set the carrying capacity at some optimal value leading to a better excess yield another important aspect concerns the installation of marine protected areas mpa in the complete lotka volterra model of connected sites with 4 equations it is possible to consider different fishing effort e 1 and e 2 on each site in the aggregated model reduced to 2 equations it is easy to check that nothing will be changed except the overall fishing effort which will be written 59 e e 1 v e 2 1 v in this case there are two control variables e 1 and e 2 and finding the msy is a more difficult problem not addressed in this work however in the case of an mpa the problem is simplified to a single variable the fishing effort of the area which is not mpa if for example zone 2 is mpa you have to choose the global effort e m s y e a k d 2 to be at msy in this case we will have to fish more in fishing site 1 because we have the following relation 60 e 1 v e a k d 2 v 1 more fishing must be done in the fishing area to reach the msy to compensate for the loss of catch in the protected area the study of the effects of marine reserves in fishery modeling has received a great deal of attention hannesson grafton et al 2005 greenville and macaulay 2006 for a two patch model with two species and protected areas most models focus on the effect on the total population as well as on the resulting increase in fishermen s income in a stable environment or with ecological uncertainty however in our study we are looking for the conditions of heterogeneity and asymmetric diffusion that make it possible to obtain an overall productivity of the fishery higher than that of isolated fisheries at msy 5 2 the case of a predator prey fish community with holling type ii functional response we now study a predator prey model with a holling type ii functional response thus we still consider a prey predator community in a two patch environment with two marine zones one with a high carrying capacity and the other with a smaller carrying capacity for the prey in this new example the first area is a fishing area where the prey and its predator can stay we suppose that the second zone is a mangrove the mangrove forms a shelter for juvenile fish and small prey fish to predators predators have great difficulty in catching prey in the mangrove because of the turbidity of the water which prevents them from detecting the prey it is also usual to consider that mangroves allow fish to grow faster because they spend more time feeding than escaping their predator some predatory fish may venture into the mangroves but they do not stay there for long because they capture little prey fish larger carnivorous fish do not venture deep inside the mangrove rönnbäck et al 1999 we will consider an example where prey is abundant in the common area consequently and for the sake of simplicity we will further assume that the predator is a large one and remains only in the fishing zone thus the predator does not move and stays in patch 1 where it is harvested at constant rate e in this example we assume a holling type ii functional response the complete model reads as follows 61 d b 1 d τ m 2 b 2 m 1 b 1 ε r 1 b 1 1 b 1 k 1 ε a b 1 p b 1 d 62 d b 2 d τ m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 ε r 2 b 2 1 b 2 k 2 63 d p d τ ε e a b 1 p b 1 d d p e p we use the same notations as in the previous models a is the predation parameter in patch 1 d 0 is another predation parameter associated with the handling time in reality the mangrove is an area where juvenile fish mainly thrive it would therefore be necessary to develop a more complex model with age or size classes of prey fish here we consider a simple example with an unstructured prey population in this example site 1 is a fishing area and site 2 is the mangrove we assume that the prey fish are abundant in the fishing area k 1 75 and less in the mangrove k 2 5 we also assume that prey fish growth rate is higher in the mangrove r 1 0 5 and r 2 2 5 other parameters are the following a 2 d 5 e 0 5 d 0 5 and u 0 95 the fig 12 shows the results for the bifurcation analysis of the three dimensional complete model with prey refuge 61 63 with parameter set k 1 75 k 2 5 d 5 r 1 0 5 r 2 2 5 a 2 e 0 5 d 0 5 and m 1 0 05 and m 2 0 95 with respect to e above the transcritical bifurcation t c the predator is extinct between t c and the hopf bifurcation h the equilibrium is stable and below h unstable with stable limit cycles these results indicate that for a large region e 0 3 the system can collapse due to stochastic effects rosenzweig 1971 after reduction the aggregated model reads as follows 64 d b d t r b 1 b k a u b p u b d 65 d p d t e a u b p u b d d p e p this reduced model is a classical rosenzweig macarthur model rosenzweig and macarthur 1963 where u is the proportion of fish prey in patch 1 at the fast equilibrium r and k are defined as in the previous cases the interior equilibrium reads 66 b d e d u e a d e which is positive when e e a d and p 67 p r d e u e a d e 1 d e d u k e a d e the equilibrium yield y e e p reads as follows 68 y e r d e e u e a d e 1 d e d u k e a d e the yield for isolated patch 1 reads 69 y 1 e r 1 d e e e a d e 1 d e d k 1 e a d e now let us look for the fishing effort that maximizes the total catch of the two connected fishing sites this fishing effort corresponds to a zero of the derivative of the total catch i e d y e d e 0 the calculation shows that there is a maximum of the total catch for the following value of the fishing effort corresponding to the msy 70 e m s y e a d e a d u k d d e a d u k 2 e a d d similarly for isolated patch 1 71 e 1 m s y e a d e a d k 1 d d e a d k 1 2 e a d d the catches at msy are simply calculated as follows y m s y y e m s y and y 1 m s y y e 1 m s y in our example k 1 75 k 2 5 d 5 r 1 0 5 r 2 2 5 a 2 e 0 5 d 0 5 with u 0 95 we find the growth rate r 0 6 eq 6 and the carrying capacity k 82 56 eq 8 we have seen that for the system of the two connected marine zones by prey migration there exists a stable positive equilibrium fig 12 fig 13 presents function y e with respect to e in that case we compare the productivity of the fishery of the system of connected sites to the productivity of isolated site 1 our simulations have shown that for isolated patch 1 there also exists a stable equilibrium the maximum yield msy for coupled patches shows a maximum at about y 2 71 see fig 13 while the yield of isolated patch 1 at msy is about y 1 2 04 see fig 14 in this example we check that the maximum yield at msy for coupled patches is greater than the maximum yield msy for isolated patch 1 in order to have a positive yield excess it is needed to maintain a large proportion of prey u in patch 1 table 2 shows results for the same set of parameters k 1 75 k 2 5 d 5 r 1 0 5 r 2 2 5 a 2 e 0 5 d 0 5 but for different values of the proportion of prey u in patch 1 ranging from 0 89 to 0 99 in that example the yield excess in percentage is defined as δ y m s y 100 δ y m s y y m s y 1 the maximum of yield excess in percentage is still obtained when u 0 94 interestingly in this example the proportion of prey in the two sites that maximizes the excess yield corresponds again to the ifd indeed at ifd we should have a proportion of prey on site 1 equal to u k 1 k 1 k 2 0 9375 as a consequence we have shown in this case that it is useful to connect the two sites this result is still expected insofar as the effect of a refuge for the prey is favorable to its predator 6 concluding remarks in this work we studied several fishery models at two sites connected by fast fish migrations in the first part we considered the simplest fishing model with a single species of fish exploited on two fishing sites we have assumed that the fish obey a logistic type growth at each fishing site it is known that by connecting the two sites with fast constant migration rates the total equilibrium population at the two sites can be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities of each site however we have shown that the optimal total catch at msy on the two connected fishing sites is always less than or equal to the sum of the optimal catches on each of the isolated sites this result can be seen as negative but constitutes in our eyes an interesting result in the next part we considered a simple prey predator community of fish we considered a predator fish that feeds on another fish species we further assumed that only predator fish are caught and not their prey we have assumed that the prey fish obey a logistic type growth at each site in this case we got the opposite result as in the previous part at msy the total catch may be greater than the sum of the catches at the two isolated fishing sites this result is obtained in the case of a lotka volterra type i or holling type ii functional response for the prey predator model in the last part we have discussed two methods of managing a system of two fishing sites in the first example the manager installs artificial reefs in one of the two fishing sites in the second example it creates a refuge for the prey in the second patch the first example considers a type i functional response and the second one of type ii in both cases the total optimal catch of the connected sites can be greater than the sum of the catches on the isolated sites to achieve this result it is necessary to connect a fishing site with a large carrying capacity and a low prey growth rate to a site with a small carrying capacity but a higher growth rate it is therefore necessary to connect by fast migration two heterogeneous sites for the prey in the future we could generalize our work to a network of n 2 fishing sites connected by fish migrations we would also like to study the case with two different fishing efforts at each site and find the msy we want to mention previous works concerning multi site fisheries connected by migrations where the number and size of fishing sites allowing to optimize the fishing yield has been researched as well as the effects of marine protected areas moussaoui et al 2014 bensenane et al 2013 auger et al 2010 and the effects of artificial reefs brochier et al 2021 in the case of the holling type ii functional response we have limited our study to the case where there exists a stable interior prey predator equilibrium an interesting perspective would be to generalize the method to the case of periodic solutions by using averaging methods along a stable limit cycle in this work we have considered potential application examples with very simplified models compared to reality the example of sardinella and tuna as well as the example of a fishing site and a mangrove in perspective we would like to develop a concrete example with marine biologists by considering a more complex and realistic mathematical model we could also consider an application to a fish farm with different areas and basins connected to each other with the objective of

studies suggest that it is essential to evaluate bloom dynamics based on the relative change rates of biomass rather than absolute concentrations sverdrup 1953 behrenfeld and boss 2014 they believe that the initial biomass increased from 1 mg c m 3 up to 2 mg c m 3 and the initial biomass increased from 10 mg c m 3 up to 20 mg c m 3 over the same time period indicating that the two systems are equally favorable for blooming therefore using the relative change rate of chl as the forecasting value to predict the chl concentration may also be a good optimization method in this paper a long short term memory lstm model was established for chl dynamics forecasting in xiamen bay we explore methods using the change rate δchl and the relative change rate δrchl of chl as output to optimize the lstm model apply it to forecast daily chl concentrations in xiamen bay the proposed approach to the optimization of a chl dynamics deep learning model could assist in the essential proactive strategy for algal bloom control 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data xiamen bay which is located on the west bank of the taiwan strait is a semi enclosed bay with an area of about 390 km2 and a coastline of 262 6 km chen et al 2021 the jiulong river is the most important river affecting xiamen bay with an annual average water discharge of approximately 13 0 109 m3 chen et al 2013 due to rapid economic and social development the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip in the waters of xiamen bay increased significantly chen et al 2013 and the eutrophication of xiamen bay was serious xiamen bureau of oceanography and fisheries in china 2003 2017 this study used water quality observational data collected by an ecological monitoring buoy fig 1 from 2008 to 2018 the collected variables include water temperature dissolved oxygen ph and chlorophyll a the sampling frequency was 30 min so 48 sets of data were generated per day the data were obtained from the fujian province marine observation demonstration network http www fjhyyb cn ocean863web main default aspx hygc we calculated the daily average of the data after quality control we also collected the daily average weather observational data of xiamen meteorological station fig 1 from 2008 to 2018 the collected variables included precipitation average air pressure average air temperature average relative humidity sunshine hours minimum air pressure minimum air temperature maximum air pressure maximum air temperature average 2 min wind speed and maximum wind speed the meteorological data were downloaded from the national meteorological information center https data cma cn in addition we collected the tidal forecast data for xiamen bay from 2008 to 2018 the definitions and characteristics of the variables are shown in table 1 dissolved oxygen and ph have relatively strong correlations with chl table 1 if a bloom is defined as chl concentration greater than 10 µg l and a trend with a distinct peak there have been at least 38 algal bloom events in the monitoring area during the monitoring period data not shown the proportion of chl concentrations below 3 5 µg l overall average was 77 but the average chl concentration of that proportion was only 1 6 µg l the remaining 22 of chl concentrations had an average of 9 6 µg l six times the average of 1 6 µg l this is probably the main reason that the chl concentration has a low mean but a large standard deviation sd to eliminate the effects of dimensional differences and improve the convergence speed of the models all of the data were normalized by the following equation x i x i x s where x i represents the result after normalization x i represents the variable before normalization x is the average value x 1 n i 1 n x i and s is the standard deviation s 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 habs are the result of complex interactions of multiple factors the main factors that act on phytoplankton in different seasons may differ cosgrove et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 therefore we built a chl forecast model based on seasons seasons were delineated as follows winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november 2 2 theory of lstm model lstm is a kind of recurrent neural network rnn that is used to regularize the training of rnns hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it can make up for the deficiencies of rnns in that vanishing or exploding gradients fail to capture long term dependencies bengio et al 1994 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 at present lstm has been applied successfully in sequence modeling hand writing translation and language translation graves et al 2007 qing dao er ji et al 2020 yan et al 2021 yin et al 2021 in the network structure of an lstm model the input of the previous layer acts on the output through additional paths the introduction of gate creates a focusing effect in the network an lstm unit generally contains an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the use of these gates allows information to selectively affect the state of each moment in the recurrent neural network the input gate supplements the latest input from the current input after the state of the forgotten part the output gate determines the output at a particular moment according to the output at the previous moment and the current input the forget gate makes the rnn forget information that was not used before the detailed operation of an lstm unit is shown in fig 2 the lstm network is composed of multiple such units the lstm model used in the chl forecasting in this study includes two lstm layers two fully connected layers a sequence input layer a dropout layer and a regression output layer fig 3 both lstm layers contain 200 nodes fully connected layer 1 contains 10 nodes and fully connected layer 2 contains one node a dropout layer was added between the two lstm layers dropout srivastava et al 2014 lecun et al 2015 recently developed in the deep learning field is a method proposed to control the complexity of the model in each training batch a certain number of hidden layer nodes are set to 0 to reduce the interaction between hidden layer nodes thereby significantly reducing over fitting 2 3 optimization of lstm model the traditional method of deep learning chl forecasting is to master the relationship between different variables and chl through the study of historical data those relationships are used to directly predict the absolute concentration of chl chl through new data coad et al 2014 su et al 2015 shin et al 2020 when predicting the chl of the next step we use the values of all the variables at the current step we can predict the relative value of chl between the next step and the current step and use that information to derive the chl at the next step using this method we can forecast chl the relative value can be the change rate δchl or the relative change rate δrchl of chl between the next step and the current step in this study we use δchl and δrchl as the output of the lstm model and compare our results with the traditional method of directly predicting absolute concentration the δchl and δrchl were calculated as follows δ c h l t y t 1 y t δ t δ r c h l t y t 1 y t δ t y t where y t represents the observed chl concentration at time t and δ t represents the unit time which is one day in this study we assume that the output of the training data of the lstm model at time t is f t when forecasting the chl f t y t 1 when forecasting the δchl f t δ c h l t when forecasting the δrchl f t δ r c h l t in the process of forecasting with test data o represents the output of the model and f represents the predicted chl concentration when forecasting the chl f t o t when forecasting the δchl f t o t δ t y t when forecasting the δrchl f t o t y t δ t y t this study uses the data collected from 2008 to november 2017 as the training data and the data from december 2017 to november 2018 as the test data the lstm model uses the three methods described above to obtain the chl forecast result f from the test data 2 4 indicators of model performance in order to better compare the effects of different optimization methods this study uses three indicators to assess the model performance the root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and absolute error r m s e 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 r t 1 n y t y y t y t 1 n y t y 2 t 1 n y t y 2 absolute erro r t y t y t where y denotes the observed chl value y is the average of observed chl value y refers to the chl value predicted by the model and y is the average of predicted chl value the smaller the rmse and absolute error the better the forecasting performance of the model the r is between 1 and 1 when r is closer to 1 the better the forecasting performance 3 results fig 4 shows the indices of the model performance of the forecast results obtained by chl δchl and δrchl each value in the figure is the average of 10 forecast results which effectively avoids accidental errors in an individual forecast the rmse in winter and spring is lower than in summer and autumn the rmse of the forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl is significantly smaller than obtained by chl in winter and spring in summer and autumn this advantage disappears and even the rmse predicted by δrchl in summer is much larger than the rmse of other methods the r of the forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl in winter and spring is significantly better than the r obtained by chl in summer and autumn this advantage still exists but not as significantly as in winter and spring the concentration of chl in winter and spring of 2018 is relatively low the maximum value in winter is less than 3 μg l and the maximum value in spring is less than 5 μg l figs 5 and 6 in the winter the result obtained by chl is overestimated most of the time the chl predicted by δchl and δrchl is more consistent with the observation result fig 5 in the spring the matching of chl predicted by δchl and δrchl with the observation result is better than the result predicted by chl algal blooms appeared in summer and autumn in 2018 at those times chl showed a large peak with the maximum value in summer reaching 48 μg l and the maximum value in autumn reaching 17 μg l figs 7 and 8 during the summer algal bloom at the end of june the chl value predicted by δrchl seriously overestimated the peak value during the two algal blooms in autumn the result predicted by δrchl also showed a similar overestimation but the overestimation was not as serious as that in summer this pattern explains why the results predicted by δrchl in fig 4 have good r in summer and autumn but have poor rmse values the overestimation of the high value in summer and autumn is the main reason for the high rmse figs 9 and 10 show the absolute error distribution of the forecast results for different forecasting methods in winter and spring the absolute errors of winter and spring forecast results are generally less than 2 μg l in winter and spring the results forecast by δchl and δrchl are far better than those forecast by chl with higher low absolute error frequencies and lower high absolute error frequencies the absolute error of the forecast results obtained by δrchl is slightly better than the forecast results obtained by δchl due to the larger chl values in summer and autumn of 2018 the absolute errors of the corresponding forecast results are also higher than those in winter and spring figs 11 and 12 the low absolute error frequency of less than 0 5 μg l in the forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl is much higher than the results obtained by chl in summer and autumn the low absolute error frequency of the δrchl forecast results is slightly larger than that of the δchl forecast results however the absolute errors of the forecast results obtained using the δrchl have many high absolute errors greater than 10 μg l which may be related to the overestimation of the high values in summer and autumn 4 discussion in this study chl δchl and δrchl were used as the output of the lstm model to predict chl concentrations in four seasons of 2018 in xiamen bay according to the results the chl forecast obtained using δchl or δrchl is much better than the traditional method of forecasting chl figs 4 12 in other words δchl and δrchl are more sensitive to the influencing variables than chl studies have found that in the initial bloom when the phytoplankton concentration is low the rate of chl increase is equivalent to that when the bloom is close to its maximum mahadevan et al 2012 behrenfeld et al 2013 behrenfeld and boss 2014 some researchers believe that bloom dynamics must be evaluated in the context of biomass change rates rather than absolute concentrations sverdrup 1953 behrenfeld and boss 2014 in the winter and spring of 2018 when the chl concentration was low the rmse and r of the chl forecast evaluation results obtained using δrchl are the most accurate fig 4 this may be evidence of the importance of the influencing variables to δrchl especially when the chl concentration is low we can think of the model performance index rmse as representing the degree of deviation between the forecast results and the observation results and the r represents the accuracy of the judgment of the variety trend in the forecast results obtained by δrchl the rmse in summer and autumn is poor but the performance of r is quite good fig 4 that is to say the chl concentration predicted by δrchl in the summer and autumn of 2018 is an inaccurate estimate of how much the chl concentration changed but the judgment of whether chl concentration was increasing or decreasing is accurate the inaccurate estimation of the magnitude of the change in chl concentration in summer and autumn manifests mainly in the overestimation of the high value of chl figs 7 and 8 when δrchl is used as the output of the model a change in chl concentration from 1 μg l to 2 μg l and from 10 μg l to 20 μg l over one day is equivalent however an ecosystem has its carrying limit lammens et al 1997 when the chl concentration is low it can double once a day but when the biomass is close to the limit that the ecosystem can carry it is extremely difficult to maintain that same growth rate the model using δrchl acts as though the carrying capacity of the ecosystem is unlimited which leads to overestimation when the chl concentration is high we can use a combined optimization method to combine the chl forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl we take the chl forecast result obtained by δrchl as the basic result when the basic result is greater than a certain threshold a the chl forecast result obtained by δchl is used to replace the basic result using the 2018 summer and autumn forecast results as an example when an a value of 17 0 μg l is used for summer and an a value of 12 5 μg l is used for autumn the combined optimization forecast effect is the best the combined optimization forecast reduced the summer rmse by 40 9 the autumn rmse by 48 6 and increased the r slightly in both summer and autumn table 2 in addition the overestimation of high values in summer and autumn is obviously alleviated fig 13 the combined optimization greatly improves the forecast results this combined optimization method may also be applicable to winter and spring there was no high chl value in the winter and spring of 2018 but this does not mean that it does not appear in other years winter and spring blooms have appeared in other years of training data it is relatively difficult to determine the threshold of a based only on the forecast results from 2018 due to ecosystem changes or different populations of phytoplankton the threshold of a may not be a fixed value this may require more data and experiments to confirm the variables used in this study cannot include all the variables that affect chl some variables such as nutrients were not included nutrient level is an important variable that affects the growth of phytoplankton morel et al 2008 lewis et al 2019 and the fluctuation of nutrient composition may cause a change in phytoplankton species lin et al 2008 liu et al 2016 the eutrophication in xiamen bay is severe chen et al 2013 xbof 2017 the n p ranges between 27 4 and 47 5 chen et al 2010 which far exceeds the 16 1 atomic ratio of n and p elements required by plankton in the biochemical cycle redfield 1958 therefore the growth of phytoplankton in xiamen bay is limited mainly by the phosphate content yan and cai 2010 chen et al 2013 the lack of nutrients especially phosphate is an important factor that restricts the accuracy of the chl forecast for xiamen bay improvement of monitoring data is crucial to the development of deep learning forecasting models anthropogenic intervention and natural variability can both influence and compromise continued ecosystem functioning banerjee et al 2017 when studying the impact of river restoration projects on estuarine ecosystems kim et al 2019 found that hydrological alterations have induced intensive algal blooms and that short term water quality variables are persistent factors shaping algal dynamics the deep learning chl forecast model is essentially a statistical model that produces forecasts by learning the laws of past events xiamen bay is located at the estuary mouth of the jiulong river human activities have frequently disturbed the coastal ecosystem of this area it is difficult for the existing deep learning model to achieve a perfect forecast if there is a mechanism that affects chl dynamics that has not appeared before human activities may be such a mechanism this may be a challenge for using deep learning chl forecast models for highly dynamic nearshore estuarine ecosystems supplementary learning from the latest data may be an effective way to make up for this deficiency we plan to study this direction in the future both the δchl and δrchl are variables derived from the chl but the chl concentration forecast effect obtained by these derivative variables is significantly better than the direct forecast chl this shows that the deep learning model s ability to extract chl dynamic information from the data is limited however it is an effective way to build derivative variables these derivative variables can facilitate the extraction of data information by the deep learning model through the existing understanding of the chl dynamic mechanism and thereby improve the forecast applying the understanding of the mechanism to the deep learning model is an important way to improve it 5 conclusions this study uses the absolute concentration of chl chl the change rate of chl δchl and the relative change rate of chl δrchl as outputs of the lstm model to produce a coastal chl dynamic forecast the results show that the chl forecast result obtained using δchl and δrchl is much better than the forecast result obtained using chl a combined optimization method that uses the chl forecast results obtained through δchl and δrchl can further improve the chl forecast with the ongoing research on the dynamic mechanism of chl an increasing number of researchers believe that blooms are not governed by abiotic factors controlling cell division but rather reflect subtle ecosystem imbalances instigated by climate forcing or food web shifts behrenfeld et al 2013 behrenfeld and boss 2014 trombetta et al 2019 if we can find the key factors that either disrupt or maintain the ecosystem balance and use that information to obtain better forecasts that would be important evidence for this theory the effective combination and promotion of machine learning models and mechanism research is an important way to improve the accuracy of chl forecasts in the future

quality control we also collected the daily average weather observational data of xiamen meteorological station fig 1 from 2008 to 2018 the collected variables included precipitation average air pressure average air temperature average relative humidity sunshine hours minimum air pressure minimum air temperature maximum air pressure maximum air temperature average 2 min wind speed and maximum wind speed the meteorological data were downloaded from the national meteorological information center https data cma cn in addition we collected the tidal forecast data for xiamen bay from 2008 to 2018 the definitions and characteristics of the variables are shown in table 1 dissolved oxygen and ph have relatively strong correlations with chl table 1 if a bloom is defined as chl concentration greater than 10 µg l and a trend with a distinct peak there have been at least 38 algal bloom events in the monitoring area during the monitoring period data not shown the proportion of chl concentrations below 3 5 µg l overall average was 77 but the average chl concentration of that proportion was only 1 6 µg l the remaining 22 of chl concentrations had an average of 9 6 µg l six times the average of 1 6 µg l this is probably the main reason that the chl concentration has a low mean but a large standard deviation sd to eliminate the effects of dimensional differences and improve the convergence speed of the models all of the data were normalized by the following equation x i x i x s where x i represents the result after normalization x i represents the variable before normalization x is the average value x 1 n i 1 n x i and s is the standard deviation s 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 habs are the result of complex interactions of multiple factors the main factors that act on phytoplankton in different seasons may differ cosgrove et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 therefore we built a chl forecast model based on seasons seasons were delineated as follows winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november 2 2 theory of lstm model lstm is a kind of recurrent neural network rnn that is used to regularize the training of rnns hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it can make up for the deficiencies of rnns in that vanishing or exploding gradients fail to capture long term dependencies bengio et al 1994 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 at present lstm has been applied successfully in sequence modeling hand writing translation and language translation graves et al 2007 qing dao er ji et al 2020 yan et al 2021 yin et al 2021 in the network structure of an lstm model the input of the previous layer acts on the output through additional paths the introduction of gate creates a focusing effect in the network an lstm unit generally contains an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the use of these gates allows information to selectively affect the state of each moment in the recurrent neural network the input gate supplements the latest input from the current input after the state of the forgotten part the output gate determines the output at a particular moment according to the output at the previous moment and the current input the forget gate makes the rnn forget information that was not used before the detailed operation of an lstm unit is shown in fig 2 the lstm network is composed of multiple such units the lstm model used in the chl forecasting in this study includes two lstm layers two fully connected layers a sequence input layer a dropout layer and a regression output layer fig 3 both lstm layers contain 200 nodes fully connected layer 1 contains 10 nodes and fully connected layer 2 contains one node a dropout layer was added between the two lstm layers dropout srivastava et al 2014 lecun et al 2015 recently developed in the deep learning field is a method proposed to control the complexity of the model in each training batch a certain number of hidden layer nodes are set to 0 to reduce the interaction between hidden layer nodes thereby significantly reducing over fitting 2 3 optimization of lstm model the traditional method of deep learning chl forecasting is to master the relationship between different variables and chl through the study of historical data those relationships are used to directly predict the absolute concentration of chl chl through new data coad et al 2014 su et al 2015 shin et al 2020 when predicting the chl of the next step we use the values of all the variables at the current step we can predict the relative value of chl between the next step and the current step and use that information to derive the chl at the next step using this method we can forecast chl the relative value can be the change rate δchl or the relative change rate δrchl of chl between the next step and the current step in this study we use δchl and δrchl as the output of the lstm model and compare our results with the traditional method of directly predicting absolute concentration the δchl and δrchl were calculated as follows δ c h l t y t 1 y t δ t δ r c h l t y t 1 y t δ t y t where y t represents the observed chl concentration at time t and δ t represents the unit time which is one day in this study we assume that the output of the training data of the lstm model at time t is f t when forecasting the chl f t y t 1 when forecasting the δchl f t δ c h l t when forecasting the δrchl f t δ r c h l t in the process of forecasting with test data o represents the output of the model and f represents the predicted chl concentration when forecasting the chl f t o t when forecasting the δchl f t o t δ t y t when forecasting the δrchl f t o t y t δ t y t this study uses the data collected from 2008 to november 2017 as the training data and the data from december 2017 to november 2018 as the test data the lstm model uses the three methods described above to obtain the chl forecast result f from the test data 2 4 indicators of model performance in order to better compare the effects of different optimization methods this study uses three indicators to assess the model performance the root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and absolute error r m s e 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 r t 1 n y t y y t y t 1 n y t y 2 t 1 n y t y 2 absolute erro r t y t y t where y denotes the observed chl value y is the average of observed chl value y refers to the chl value predicted by the model and y is the average of predicted chl value the smaller the rmse and absolute error the better the forecasting performance of the model the r is between 1 and 1 when r is closer to 1 the better the forecasting performance 3 results fig 4 shows the indices of the model performance of the forecast results obtained by chl δchl and δrchl each value in the figure is the average of 10 forecast results which effectively avoids accidental errors in an individual forecast the rmse in winter and spring is lower than in summer and autumn the rmse of the forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl is significantly smaller than obtained by chl in winter and spring in summer and autumn this advantage disappears and even the rmse predicted by δrchl in summer is much larger than the rmse of other methods the r of the forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl in winter and spring is significantly better than the r obtained by chl in summer and autumn this advantage still exists but not as significantly as in winter and spring the concentration of chl in winter and spring of 2018 is relatively low the maximum value in winter is less than 3 μg l and the maximum value in spring is less than 5 μg l figs 5 and 6 in the winter the result obtained by chl is overestimated most of the time the chl predicted by δchl and δrchl is more consistent with the observation result fig 5 in the spring the matching of chl predicted by δchl and δrchl with the observation result is better than the result predicted by chl algal blooms appeared in summer and autumn in 2018 at those times chl showed a large peak with the maximum value in summer reaching 48 μg l and the maximum value in autumn reaching 17 μg l figs 7 and 8 during the summer algal bloom at the end of june the chl value predicted by δrchl seriously overestimated the peak value during the two algal blooms in autumn the result predicted by δrchl also showed a similar overestimation but the overestimation was not as serious as that in summer this pattern explains why the results predicted by δrchl in fig 4 have good r in summer and autumn but have poor rmse values the overestimation of the high value in summer and autumn is the main reason for the high rmse figs 9 and 10 show the absolute error distribution of the forecast results for different forecasting methods in winter and spring the absolute errors of winter and spring forecast results are generally less than 2 μg l in winter and spring the results forecast by δchl and δrchl are far better than those forecast by chl with higher low absolute error frequencies and lower high absolute error frequencies the absolute error of the forecast results obtained by δrchl is slightly better than the forecast results obtained by δchl due to the larger chl values in summer and autumn of 2018 the absolute errors of the corresponding forecast results are also higher than those in winter and spring figs 11 and 12 the low absolute error frequency of less than 0 5 μg l in the forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl is much higher than the results obtained by chl in summer and autumn the low absolute error frequency of the δrchl forecast results is slightly larger than that of the δchl forecast results however the absolute errors of the forecast results obtained using the δrchl have many high absolute errors greater than 10 μg l which may be related to the overestimation of the high values in summer and autumn 4 discussion in this study chl δchl and δrchl were used as the output of the lstm model to predict chl concentrations in four seasons of 2018 in xiamen bay according to the results the chl forecast obtained using δchl or δrchl is much better than the traditional method of forecasting chl figs 4 12 in other words δchl and δrchl are more sensitive to the influencing variables than chl studies have found that in the initial bloom when the phytoplankton concentration is low the rate of chl increase is equivalent to that when the bloom is close to its maximum mahadevan et al 2012 behrenfeld et al 2013 behrenfeld and boss 2014 some researchers believe that bloom dynamics must be evaluated in the context of biomass change rates rather than absolute concentrations sverdrup 1953 behrenfeld and boss 2014 in the winter and spring of 2018 when the chl concentration was low the rmse and r of the chl forecast evaluation results obtained using δrchl are the most accurate fig 4 this may be evidence of the importance of the influencing variables to δrchl especially when the chl concentration is low we can think of the model performance index rmse as representing the degree of deviation between the forecast results and the observation results and the r represents the accuracy of the judgment of the variety trend in the forecast results obtained by δrchl the rmse in summer and autumn is poor but the performance of r is quite good fig 4 that is to say the chl concentration predicted by δrchl in the summer and autumn of 2018 is an inaccurate estimate of how much the chl concentration changed but the judgment of whether chl concentration was increasing or decreasing is accurate the inaccurate estimation of the magnitude of the change in chl concentration in summer and autumn manifests mainly in the overestimation of the high value of chl figs 7 and 8 when δrchl is used as the output of the model a change in chl concentration from 1 μg l to 2 μg l and from 10 μg l to 20 μg l over one day is equivalent however an ecosystem has its carrying limit lammens et al 1997 when the chl concentration is low it can double once a day but when the biomass is close to the limit that the ecosystem can carry it is extremely difficult to maintain that same growth rate the model using δrchl acts as though the carrying capacity of the ecosystem is unlimited which leads to overestimation when the chl concentration is high we can use a combined optimization method to combine the chl forecast results obtained by δchl and δrchl we take the chl forecast result obtained by δrchl as the basic result when the basic result is greater than a certain threshold a the chl forecast result obtained by δchl is used to replace the basic result using the 2018 summer and autumn forecast results as an example when an a value of 17 0 μg l is used for summer and an a value of 12 5 μg l is used for autumn the combined optimization forecast effect is the best the combined optimization forecast reduced the summer rmse by 40 9 the autumn rmse by 48 6 and increased the r slightly in both summer and autumn table 2 in addition the overestimation of high values in summer and autumn is obviously alleviated fig 13 the combined optimization greatly improves the forecast results this combined optimization method may also be applicable to winter and spring there was no high chl value in the winter and spring of 2018 but this does not mean that it does not appear in other years winter and spring blooms have appeared in other years of training data it is relatively difficult to determine the threshold of a based only on the forecast results from 2018 due to ecosystem changes or different populations of phytoplankton the threshold of a may not be a fixed value this may require more data and experiments to confirm the variables used in this study cannot include all the variables that affect chl some variables such as nutrients were not included nutrient level is an important variable that affects the growth of phytoplankton morel et al 2008 lewis et al 2019 and the fluctuation of nutrient composition may cause a change in phytoplankton species lin et al 2008 liu et al 2016 the eutrophication in xiamen bay is severe chen et al 2013 xbof 2017 the n p ranges between 27 4 and 47 5 chen et al 2010 which far exceeds the 16 1 atomic ratio of n and p elements required by plankton in the biochemical cycle redfield 1958 therefore the growth of phytoplankton in xiamen bay is limited mainly by the phosphate content yan and cai 2010 chen et al 2013 the lack of nutrients especially phosphate is an important factor that restricts the accuracy of the chl forecast for xiamen bay improvement of monitoring data is crucial to the development of deep learning forecasting models anthropogenic intervention and natural variability can both influence and compromise continued ecosystem functioning banerjee et al 2017 when studying the impact of river restoration projects on estuarine ecosystems kim et al 2019 found that hydrological alterations have induced intensive algal blooms and that short term water quality variables are persistent factors shaping algal dynamics the deep learning chl forecast model is essentially a statistical model that produces forecasts by learning the laws of past events xiamen bay is located at the estuary mouth of the jiulong river human activities have frequently disturbed the coastal ecosystem of this area it is difficult for the existing deep learning model to achieve a perfect forecast if there is a mechanism that affects chl dynamics that has not appeared before human activities may be such a mechanism this may be a challenge for using deep learning chl forecast models for highly dynamic nearshore estuarine ecosystems supplementary learning from the latest data may be an effective way to make up for this deficiency we plan to study this direction in the future both the δchl and δrchl are variables derived from the chl but the chl concentration forecast effect obtained by these derivative variables is significantly better than the direct forecast chl this shows that the deep learning model s ability to extract chl dynamic information from the data is limited however it is an effective way to build derivative variables these derivative variables can facilitate the extraction of data information by the deep learning model through the existing understanding of the chl dynamic mechanism and thereby improve the forecast applying the understanding of the mechanism to the deep learning model is an important way to improve it 5 conclusions this study uses the absolute concentration of chl chl the change rate of chl δchl and the relative change rate of chl δrchl as outputs of the lstm model to produce a coastal chl dynamic forecast the results show that the chl forecast result obtained using δchl and δrchl is much better than the forecast result obtained using chl a combined optimization method that uses the chl forecast results obtained through δchl and δrchl can further improve the chl forecast with the ongoing research on the dynamic mechanism of chl an increasing number of researchers believe that blooms are not governed by abiotic factors controlling cell division but rather reflect subtle ecosystem imbalances instigated by climate forcing or food web shifts behrenfeld et al 2013 behrenfeld and boss 2014 trombetta et al 2019 if we can find the key factors that either disrupt or maintain the ecosystem balance and use that information to obtain better forecasts that would be important evidence for this theory the effective combination and promotion of machine learning models and mechanism research is an important way to improve the accuracy of chl forecasts in the future

24463,harmful diatom coscinodiscus waillesi and eucampia zodiacus blooms frequently occur in the western coastal area of japan from late autumn to early spring causing discoloration of edible seaweed nori pyropia yezoensis one of the causes of the discoloration is thought to be nutrient depletion oligotrophication due to nutrient uptake by diatoms the goal of our study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton blooms and the effects of such blooms on comprehensive nutrient cycles in the benthic pelagic ecosystem we developed a new ecosystem model emagin l p simultaneously representing phytoplankton life cycle and the benthic pelagic ecosystem the life cycles of four types of phytoplankton dinoflagellates dfl small diatoms sda coscinodiscus wailesii cdw and eucampia zodiacus ez were numerically modeled and incorporated into an existing ecosystem model ecohym sohma et al 2008a representing the food web among the benthic and pelagic systems and carbon nitrogen phosphorus oxygen coupled cycles driven by biogeochemical and physical processes the model was applied to the harima nada sea where the discoloration of nori frequently occurs the model reproduced the differences in timing and scale of the four phytoplankton blooms and each bloom could be explained by a combination of temperature suitability light availability nutrient limitation and vertical mixing within the water column furthermore through a sensitivity analysis competition for nutrient uptake among different types of phytoplankton was observed in the model that is from june to october when dfl and sda blooms occur the sda nutrient uptake rate is high and sda suppresses the dfl bloom while from november to march when cdw and ez blooms occur the nutrient uptake rate of ez is high and the cdw bloom is slightly suppressed the developed model representing the phytoplankton bloom mechanisms in the whole benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem will be a useful tool for revealing the mechanisms underlying the nutrient cycle and the contribution of harmful diatom blooms to the discoloration of nori the modeling approach presented in this paper i e categorizing different types of major phytoplankton and incorporating their life cycle into the entire benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem can be an effective method to understand predict and manage the problems caused by harmful diatom blooms across different damage types harmful diatom species and ocean areas keywords phytoplankton life cycle ecosystem model benthic pelagic coupling eucampia zodiacus coscinodiscus wailesii nutrient cycle 1 introduction harmful diatom blooms have been increasing on a global scale in frequency and distribution and their effects on living resources and local economies have been increasing

2001 fisheries in japan especially the cultivation of seaweed nori pyropia yezoensis are adversely affected by harmful diatoms such as eucampia zodiacus coscinodiscus wailesii and rhizosolenia imbricata during the nori harvest season from november to march manabe and ishio 1991 nishikawa et al 2011 sasaki and kito 2003 leading to nori discoloration hori et al 2008 imai et al 2006 nori harvesting is important for japanese fisheries especially in the coastal waters of western japan it accounts for approximately 75 billion yen which is around 80 of the total nori production in japan e stat 2021 discolored nori has low commercial value owing to its low content of amino acids which are umami components and poor appearance a direct cause of this discoloration is oligotrophication i e a decrease in nutrient concentration of seawater imai et al 2006 as shown in fig 1 a decrease in nutrient concentration could be associated with i competition for nutrient uptake due to harmful diatom ii reduction in excretion and phytoplankton feeding pressure resulting from a decrease in benthic fauna suspension feeders hori et al 2008 smaal and prins 1993 and iii reduction in nutrient inflow from rivers and surrounding ocean areas owing to environmental measures dorado et al 2015 hashimoto et al 1997 yamamoto et al 2008 yamamoto 2003 however these causes are intricately linked in the ecosystems and the main cause of nutrient decline and effective measures to prevent it have not yet been clarified harmful diatoms frequently bloom in the coastal waters of western japan such as in the ariake sea matsubara et al 2014 matsubara et al 2018 sasaki and kito 2003 and the seto inland sea miyahara et al 1996 oyama et al 2008 which are sites for large scale nori cultivation the target area of the present study the harima nada sea is adversely affected by large scale blooms of e zodiacus and c wailesii manabe and ishio 1991 nishikawa et al 2011 in this sea nori discoloration has been frequently occurring since the mid 1980s manabe and ishio 1991 and nagai et al 1995 1996 associated nori discoloration with c wailesii blooms from the mid 1990s e zodiacus blooms have been observed annually in addition to c wailesii blooms nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2011 and the nutrients available for nori have almost disappeared in this context research on the physiological ecology of phytoplankton such as e zodiacus and c wailesii was carried out through laboratory experiments and field observations to clarify the characteristics of bio metabolism such as growth rate and its dependence on light temperature and nutrients nishikawa et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2010 nishikawa and hori 2015 nishikawa and yamaguchi 2006 nishikawa and yamaguchi 2008 to clarify the effect of these bio metabolism processes on phytoplankton biomass concentration in the water and the entire benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem it is necessary to analyze each bio metabolism process within the ecosystem and vice versa feedback effect the final goal of our project is to reveal the behavior of phytoplankton and ecosystem networks from the perspective of comprehensive nutrient cycles across the benthic pelagic ecosystems and to evaluate and predict the controlling factors of nutrient concentration decline and nori discoloration to achieve this goal a model representing the following three factors 1 phytoplankton life cycles 2 food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems and 3 supply of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic system and the return of mineralized nutrients from the benthic to the pelagic system i e a process based ecosystem model is useful jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 sohma et al 2008a sohma et al 2018 regarding factor 1 only few model studies have taken phytoplankton life cycles processes into account eilertsen and wyatt 2000 showed that the consideration of the seed stock better explains spring bloom dynamics warns 2013 coupled a complex dinoflagellate life cycle model warns et al 2013a 2013b with a simple diatom life cycle model lee et al 2018 developed an ecosystem model which includes the life cycles of three main phytoplankton groups diatoms dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria and showed the importance of phytoplankton life cycle mechanisms regulating their blooms however these models did not consider the early diagenetic vertical biogeochemical mechanisms in the benthic system which controls important nutrient supply to the pelagic systems in shallow coastal areas graf 1992 grenz et al 2000 liu et al 2007 griffiths et al 2017 several ecosystem models have been applied to the seto inland sea including our study area the harima nada sea i e ohuchi et al 1986 yoshie et al 2011 these models focused on simplified primary production and even if the phytoplankton was classified into several groups yoshie et al 2011 they did not consider the life cycles of phytoplankton regarding factors 2 and 3 soetaert et al 2000 sohma et al 2002 2008a 2018 and reed et al 2011 developed a benthic pelagic coupled nutrient cycle model with detailed vertical biochemical mechanisms in the benthic system and demonstrated the prominent effect of biogeochemical processes and their vertical changes on nutrient cycles in the benthic system to the pelagic system especially in the shallow eutrophic coastal area in addition baretta et al 1995 butenschön et al 2016 and sohma et al 2008a 2018 developed models describing the benthic pelagic food web and incorporated them into the benthic and pelagic coupled ecosystem model around shallow coastal areas owing to the possibility of their importance in nutrients cycles such benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem models are currently entering the era of operational forecasting siddorn et al 2007 however the forecasting of harmful algal blooms using generic ecosystem models excluding consideration of phytoplankton life cycles is difficult for example vanhoutte brunier et al 2008 considered it necessary to add a specific karenia mikimotoi a type of dinoflagellates algorithm to a generic ecosystem model to study a bloom in the english channel during 2003 in summary to the best of our knowledge no ecosystem model has been developed that describes all three factors i e phytoplankton life cycles food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems and benthic pelagic nutrient cycle describing the fine vertical biochemical structure in the benthic system simultaneously in order to incorporate all the three factors we developed the ecosystem model for aquatic geologic integrated network on life cycles of phytoplankton emagin l p to this end we formulated the biological metabolism life cycles of the four types of phytoplankton including large diatoms and incorporated this information into the existing benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem model which already represents the food web in the benthic and pelagic systems and their nutrient cycles describing their fine vertical biochemical structure sohma et al 2008a incorporating the life cycle of phytoplankton into an existing benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem as a single model can increase the complexity of the model however with regard to the coastal area where harmful diatom blooms have been increasing and the knowledge of their bio metabolism are obtained by experimental field research this new model still has the advantage compared to the existing model in addition this modeling approach is useful to understand predict or manage the harmful diatom blooms which have been occurring globally in the last quarter century landsberg et al 2005 in the current paper as the first stage of model development and application we introduce the mathematical modeling of the phytoplankton life cycle in emagin l p and present the validation results for the model applied to the harima nada sea in addition we demonstrate the mechanism of phytoplankton bloom formation and the competitive relationship of nutrient uptake among phytoplankton derived from model analysis 2 model description 2 1 ecosystem diagram and its drivers fig 2 shows the ecosystem diagram handled by emagin l p and driven by biological chemical physical processes the boxes in fig 2 represent the model variables stock and arrows represent their biological chemical processes flows in addition to these the physical processes derived from water currents were analyzed in emagin l p by coupling with a hydrodynamics model sohma et al 2018 the characteristic driving force processes of the nutrient cycle considered by the model are 1 the phytoplankton life cycles 2 food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems and 3 supply of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic system and the return of nutrients from the benthic to the pelagic system regarding 1 the phytoplankton life cycles phytoplankton were divided into dinoflagellates small diatoms c wailesii and e zodiacus considering that the phytoplankton life cycle exists across the pelagic and benthic systems and that there are differences between the resting stage and vegetative cells cloern 1996 model variables of each phytoplankton were incorporated into both pelagic and benthic systems regarding 2 the food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems benthic fauna such as suspension feeders feed on phytoplankton and excrete dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and the metabolism of such organisms can affect water quality kirby and miller 2005 krueger et al 1992 a previous study reported a correlation between the decrease in benthic fauna and the increase in the occurrence of diatom blooms in the harima nada sea hori et al 2008 to analyze such causal relationships emagin l p represents a food web of the pelagic and benthic systems including benthic fauna regarding 3 the supply of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic system and the return of nutrients from the benthic to the pelagic system most of the n and p contents in the shallow coastal areas accumulate not in the pelagic system but in the benthic system and the nutrients produced by mineralization are reused for primary production in the pelagic system graf 1992 grenz et al 2000 liu et al 2007 emagin l p describes the process of organic matter settling and mineralizing from the water to the sediment and the production of nutrients released from the sediment to the water here the mineralization process was modeled by dividing it into oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization as a result oxygen consumption reduced substance accumulation reoxidation and denitrification which are associated with mineralization were expressed in the model soetaert et al 1996 sohma et al 2001 sohma et al 2004 details of the mathematical modeling for factors 2 and 3 are well described by sohma et al 2001 2004 2008a 2018 in the subsequent section we introduce the modeling for 1 the phytoplankton life cycles 2 2 modeling of the phytoplankton life cycle 2 2 1 overview in our study area the harima nada sea large diatoms i e harmful diatoms e zodiacus and c wailesii bloom from late autumn november to early spring march and small diatoms and dinoflagellates usually bloom from spring may to autumn october the differences in the timing and extent of bloom occurrences among plankton species conjecture to depend on the following the suitability of the external environment for phytoplankton such as water temperature and nutrient concentration and the internal interactions such as competitive relationships of nutrient uptake among phytoplankton species or between phytoplankton and seaweed the categories of phytoplankton in this model e zodiacus c wailesii small diatoms and dinoflagellates fig 2 express such suitability and competitive relationships and were determined based on differences in phytoplankton life cycle size and dominant species in the harima nada sea fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the life cycle of the four phytoplankton categories e zodiacus does not form resting stage cells and exist in vegetative cells throughout their life cycle the cell size changes annually decreasing monotonically from december to september until reaching its minimum size in autumn and then recovering to its maximum size nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2013 the small celled period is the sporulation phase in which proliferation grazing is impossible and the period from november to september after the restoration of cell size is the growth period proliferative phase the cells that enter the proliferative phase are transported from the seafloor to the photic zone due to the upwelling vertical eddy diffusion caused by the northwesterly wind collapsing density gradient in winter and proliferate the proliferative rate growth rate is determined by the suitability of the environment including light nutrients and temperature when the vertical mixing weakens around the end of march the bloom terminates and e zodiacus inhabits the seafloor until the next blooming period nishikawa et al 2011 other phytoplankton species have similar life cycles in which they become vegetative cells during the bloom phase and then form resting stage cells that are present around the seafloor and in the sediment following the bloom period however the bloom period differs depending on the species their resting stage cells reach the photic zone from the seafloor by upwelling flow vertical mixing to become vegetative cells and they germinate to generate blooms imai et al 1990 itakura et al 1992 itakura et al 1997 nagai et al 1995 1996 as shown in fig 2 to represent the life cycles of e zodiacus two variables were set in the model i e a large size 20 µm in the proliferative phase growth phase and a small size 20 µm or less in the sporulation phase non growth phase nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2013 nishikawa 2017 in addition each model variable was set in both benthic and pelagic systems for the other phytoplankton we used pelagic vegetative cells and benthic resting stage cells as model variables furthermore the mechanism by which phytoplankton store nutrients inside the cells namely cell quota nishikawa et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2010 nishikawa and hori 2015 smith and kalff 1982 was expressed in the model thus the model reproduces the proliferation limited by the nutrients stored in cell quota not the nutrient concentration in the water tables 1 a and b show the model variables and their notation in the pelagic and benthic systems tables 2 a and b show an overview of the formulations expressing the time dependence of the model variables related to phytoplankton the detailed formulations are described in appendices a c the formulations of other model variables were the same as those described by sohma et al 2004 2008a the following section describes the newly modeled factors i e the transition between the proliferative and sporulation phases of e zodiacus the treatment of resting stage cells of other phytoplankton and the relationship between cell quota and grazing rate i e photosynthetic rate 2 2 2 transition between the proliferative and sporulation phase of e zodiacus the life cycle shown in fig 3 illustrates that the cell size of e zodiacus peaked at 80 μm around the end of november before continually decreasing over the course of approximately 11 months and then entering the growing sporulation phase from around october of the following year cells having succeeded in forming spores by late november recover their original cell size if the light temperature and nutrient conditions are suitable nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2013 based on the results of nishikawa et al 2007 2013 this model assumes that cells at 20 μm can be instantly proliferated under suitable light temperature and nutrient conditions i e proliferative phase and that cells at 20 μm require the following series of processes spore formation cell size restoration proliferation nishikawa et al 2009 the former cells i e proliferative phase cell size 20 μm were considered as model variables ezl large e zodiacus and the latter i e sporulation phase cell size 20 μm as ezs small e zodiacus the transitions from ezs to ezl and ezl to ezs were modeled respectively as follows d ezs dt ezs ezl r t din dip i

year periodic function created from experimental data in nishikawa et al 2007 see appendices b and c 2 2 3 resting stage cell formation and germination previous studies have shown that most phytoplankton except for e zodiacus form vegetative and resting stage cells fogg and thake 1987 mcquoid and hobson 1996 in the present study resting stage cells represent cysts of dinoflagellates and resting stage cells of diatoms for dinoflagellates small diatoms and c wailesii this model assumed that the period for resting stage cells to recover as vegetative cells and germinate is short and that the environmental conditions temperature nutrients and light irradiation are similar for the restoration of resting stage cells and the germination of vegetative cells based on these assumptions the cells that reached the benthic system were considered as resting stage cells and the cells in the pelagic system were considered as vegetative cells the upwelling of resting stage cells from the benthic to pelagic system was functionalized by the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient calculated by the hydrodynamics model sohma et al 2018 2 2 4 cell quota and photosynthesis phytoplankton contain nutrients that are not immediately utilized for photosynthesis following uptake into cells eppley and strickland 1968 and the photosynthesis rate proliferation rate is proportional to the nutrients contained in the cells cell quota rather than the nutrient concentration in the surrounding water droop 1968 in this model the cell quota was considered as a model variable to express a two step process 1 uptake of nutrients into the cell quota and 2 consumption of cell quota by photosynthesis fig 4 shows the definition of the cell quota in the model and fig 5 shows the nutrient uptake into the cell quota and nutrient consumption by photosynthesis in this model the amount of nutrients stored in the cells i e cell quota q and the minimum amount of nutrients required for phytoplankton cells i e subsistent cell quota qmin were set here q was modeled to vary between the maximum value of nutrients stored in cells qmax and qmin 0 q qmax qmin the cell quota was set for each of the four types of phytoplankton for both din and dip the uptake rate into the cell quota is a function of light irradiation nutrient concentration water temperature and amount of nutrients the consumption rate of the cell quota is the same as the photosynthetic rate the photosynthetic rate is given by a function of light intensity temperature and the amount of nutrients in the cell quota in each phytoplankton fig 5 the detailed formulations of each term in the temporal dynamics of the cell quota are shown in appendices b and c 3 method of implementation the ecosystem model emagin l p was applied to the harima nada sea fig 6 and the average seasonal validation changes in a 1 year cycle from 2000 to 2004 was simulated prescribed functions i e model drivers inflows of nutrients and organic matter from rivers meteorological conditions i e solar radiation wind and boundary conditions of model variables at i j 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 8 3 8 5 2 5 3 and 5 4 in fig 6 were given as 1 year periodic functions these model drivers were generated from the observation data of 5 years 2000 2004 i e the data of the same month and day of each of the 5 years were averaged with five values and from these values the periodic functions were produced as the function describing the annual seasonal daily changes the initial conditions of each model variables were set at the values of april 1st for the periodic functions the convergence state of this simulation describes the dynamics in a 1 year period this state hereafter is called the control case assuming the average seasonal variation from 2000 to 2004 the control case is used for model validation and analysis in the following sections the data source and the model drivers of wind solar radiation and nutrients and organic matter inflow from rivers were shown in appendices f and g the 1 year periodic functions were used owing to insufficient data to follow the yearly changes in addition by using the periodical driving forces the model can be validated using the equilibrium state i e the one year periodic output of model variables this is a preferable approach at the first stage of model development regarding the spatial resolution setting for model simulation in the hydrodynamic model sohma et al 2018 the horizontal spatial resolution was set by dividing the harima nada sea by a grid of 500 m to 1 km and in the ecosystem model the sea was divided into 12 boxes fig 6 the resolution of 12 boxes was not sufficient to demonstrate the details of the horizontal spatial distribution however it still enabled us to describe the distributions of large horizontal spatial scales of nutrients and phytoplankton in the harima nada sea reported in manabe et al 1994 and nishikawa et al 2014 and aided in reducing computational cost that is the nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations are high along the northern coast area and have a large concentration gradient in contrast the gradient is small in the central part of the harima nada sea the vertical special resolution in the pelagic system both in the hydrodynamic model and the ecosystem model is set at 1 2 m which is sufficient to accurately demonstrate the following nutrient cycle related processes i e vertical mixing stratification sedimentation of particulate substances nutrient flux and oxygen consumption from the benthic system in the benthic system the vertical spatial distribution of biochemical processes related to nutrient cycles namely oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization denitrification nitrification odu oxidation and photosynthesis of benthic algae have a steep gradient within a scale of 1 10 mm canfield et al 1993 soetaert et al 1996 glud et al 2016 sohma and sayama 2002 regarding the transport processes the advection flow in the sediment deposition of sediment and advection of pore water is 1 cm year of deposition rate matsumoto et al 1978 hoshika et al 1983 matsumoto 1983 and the diffusion in the sediment is dominated by molecular diffusion i e small scale diffusion while the pelagic system is dominated by eddy diffusion thus the vertical grid interval in the benthic system was set at a pitch of 0 01 1 2 cm the input data flow velocity eddy viscosity and water temperature from the hydrodynamic model to the ecosystem model were spatially averaged and set in 12 boxes of the ecosystem model while considering the continuous equation regarding the vertical resolution of the benthic ecosystem we provided the spatial resolution at the micrometer scale the pelagic system was divided by water depth into a layer of 1 to 2 m thickness fig 6 the benthic system was divided into 30 layers over 10 cm in the vertical direction from the sediment water boundary layer the layer thickness was 0 01 cm on the surface gradually thickening downwards and 1 2 cm at the bottom the simulation time step was set to 1 h such that the temporal dynamics of the daily scale could be sufficiently captured for the biological chemical and physical parameters the values obtained from the observation and experiment data in the harima nada sea were set preferentially for the parameters for which this could not be determined in the harima nada sea the values from other sea areas and other models were set the set values of the parameters associated with phytoplankton are shown in appendices d and e the other biochemical parameters i e parameters for zooplankton and benthic fauna i e suspension feeders and deposit feeders mineralization rate nitrification rate odu oxidation rate were set at the same value as that noted by sohma et al 2008 this simulation case i e assuming the average seasonal variation from 2000 to 2004 is referred to as the control case the control case is used for model validation and analysis in the following sections 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation the model was validated by comparing the observed and simulated values for the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of model variables in the pelagic and benthic systems the observed data used for comparison with the simulated values were observed between april 2000 and march 2005 appendix g figures 7 and 8 show the time series of the model variables on the pelagic and benthic systems in box i j 3 2 where phytoplankton blooms are frequently observed and there exist other multi item observation data in addition tables 3 4 and 5 show the correlation coefficient and root mean squared error rmse calculated between the observed data and simulated values fig 7 shows that the simulated values of phytoplankton dinoflagellate dfl small diatom sda c wailesii cdw and e zodiacus ezl nutrients nh4 n no3 n and po4 p and dissolved oxygen do in the pelagic system were generally within the range of the observed data focusing on the reproducibility of phytoplankton blooms the timing and concentration of c wailesii blooms from late october to march and e zodiacus blooms from december to march were generally reproduced by the model the low level of c wailesii from april to september and e zodiacus from april to december are also consistent with the life cycles of e zodiacus and c wailesii reported by nagai et al 1995 1996 and nishikawa et al 2007 2013 respectively in addition the model almost reproduced the occurrence of small diatom blooms from june to october and the occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms in may and october the model expressed the differences in the timing of bloom occurrence depending on phytoplankton type and the time series tendency of these blooms was almost the same as that in the actual ecosystem as a reflection of this result correlation coefficients for dfl sda cdw and ezl from the surface layer to the bottom layer shown in table 3 are relatively high compared to those of nh4 n and po4 p in the pelagic system in table 4 and suspension feeders deposit feeders detritus nh4 n no3 n and po4 p in the benthic system in table 5 regarding the nutrient concentration in the pelagic system no seasonal tendency in the vertical profiles was found in the observation results fig 7 however according to the simulated results there was a high nutrient concentration in the bottom layer and a low concentration in the surface layer during summer manabe et al 1994 reported the same tendency as our simulation results from the observation data analysis between april 1973 and march 1993 although the period of observation used in the analysis was different from that of the present study this tendency in the simulated results is due to water column stratification photosynthetic utilization of phytoplankton at the surface layer photic zone and mineralization of sedimentary organic matter at the sea bottom and in the benthic system in winter the model demonstrated that the difference in concentration between the surface layer and the bottom layer narrows this tendency is also the same as the observed result reported by manabe et al 1994 this simulated result is because vertical mixing is activated during winter compared with that during summer in the model the do concentration decreases in summer due to the high mineralization of organic matter and the retention of seawater in the bottom layer because of the stronger stratification in summer compared with that in winter from the statistical analysis in table 4 the correlation coefficient values of mh4 n no3 n po4 p and do in the surface layer denote the lowest value among all three layers the poor correlation of the surface layer is due to high vertical gradients of mh4 n no3 n po4 p and do around the surface layer caused by increased photosynthetic activity in the real system the observation was recorded at 0 5 m depth from the ocean surface however the simulation values described the averaged value of the surface layer at 0 2 m depth from the ocean surface fig 6 regarding the benthic system in fig 8 suspension feeders peaked around december and deposit feeders peaked around november in the simulation these simulated results were from a combination of factors such as growth temperature dependence food concentration e g benthic and pelagic detritus and plankton and mortality due to hypoxia during summer as determined by benthic faunal resistance to hypoxia here the temperature and food dependency of the benthic fauna s growth are basically formulated by the experimental observation data sohma et al 2008a these dependency were reported modeled in other oceans e g gili and coma 1998 rosenberg and johansson 1991 ebenhöh et al 1995 baretta bekker et al 1997 ehrnsten et al 2020 the increase decrease in the surface layer of detritus benthic organic matter was due to the increase decrease in fast labile organic matter and this increase decrease depends on the amount of sedimentation of organic matter detritus and planktons from the pelagic system and the rate of mineralization by bacteria conversely the amount of detritus in the deeper sediment around 10 cm depth does not change seasonally because it results from long term accumulation over 10 50 years in the model most of the detritus in the deep sediments is refractory because labile organic matter is mineralized before it is buried deep in the sediment the high concentration of nh4 n and po4 p in the pore water of the benthic system during summer is due to the large amount of mineralization of detritus no3 n is low in summer because of the restricted nitrification due to low do concentration the same tendency as this model was reported in other ocean areas by zhang and wirtz 2017 and sohma et al 2008b regarding statistical analysis of the benthic system shown in table 5 the number of the observed data is insufficient to estimate the results as a result the correlation coefficient of detritus and no3 n at the bottom layer denotes negative values 4 2 ecological succession of the four phytoplankton types fig 9 shows a comparison of the seasonal validation of dfl sda cdw ezl and ezs simulated in the control case of the model in the model the differences in the dynamics depending on the type of phytoplankton shown in fig 9 are governed by three factors the suitability of the physiology of each phytoplankton for the external environment exogenous factors such as water temperature light nutrients and vertical mixing interactions among phytoplankton such as nutrient uptake competition and ecosystem networks with benthic pelagic coupling 4 3 exogenous mechanism of bloom generation effects of temperature light nutrients and vertical mixing here we focused on the gross primary production i e the photosynthesis of phytoplankton and analyzed the effect of external environmental factors on the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass specifically for each of the phytoplankton dfl sda cdw ezl and ezs we analyzed the seasonal dynamics in four factors regarding their function in photosynthesis biomass temperature dependence nutrient cell quota limitation and light availability in the model the total primary production of each phytoplankton was calculated from the product of these factors details of the formulae used to calculate photosynthesis are described in appendix b in addition the seasonal dynamics in the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient which affects the vertical transport from the pelagic bottom layer benthic layer to the photic layer were also analyzed results for all factors are shown in fig 10 1 to 10 5 here the values of all factors except for the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient were averages of the 1st to 5th vertical layers for the whole simulated area the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient was the value averaged in both horizontal and vertical directions over the simulated area from the definition of the cell quota limitation function in appendix b an increase in the nutrient limitation from 0 to 1 indicates that the nutrient limitation for photosynthesis has weakened the comparison of model results and observation data across the whole simulated area are shown in appendix h the model output in appendix h reproduced the observation data at the same level as i j 3 2 discussed in section 4 1 4 3 1 dinoflagellates as shown in fig 10 1 the increase in dfl biomass during period 1 mid april to the end of may was due to an increase in both water temperature and irradiance in period 1 compared with that in period 6 early march to mid april in period 2 late may to early august the water temperature and irradiance were more favorable than in period 1 however nutrient limitation was stronger than that in period 1 thus biomass began decreasing in period 2 this nutrient limitation resulted from competition for nutrient uptake with sda this competition was analyzed and the results are described in section 4 4 in period 3 early august to mid september the biomass increased rapidly because of the optimal water temperature and the nutrient limitation was slightly weak compared with that in period 2 although light availability was lower than in period 2 period 3 was the most suitable environment for the growth of dfl considering water temperature nutrients and light conditions the decrease in biomass during period 4 mid september to late january was due to the decrease in water temperature and irradiation compared with that in period 3 but nutrient limitation decreased compared with that in period 3 this decrease in nutrient limitation was caused by the nutrients in the middle and bottom layers being transported to the surface layer due to strong vertical mixing in period 5 february the degree of biomass decreases weakened because the irradiance increased slightly compared with that in period 4 however since the water temperature was even lower and nutrient limitation was stronger than those in period 4 the total primary production rate was low and biomass did not increase in period 6 early march to early april dfl biomass began to increase because the water temperature and light conditions were more suitable for dfl than those in period 5 4 3 2 small diatoms as shown in fig 10 2 in period 1 april to mid may sda biomass began to increase slightly compared with that in period 6 late january to march owing to the increase in water temperature and irradiation light intensity the increase in biomass during period 2 mid may to early july was also due to an increase in water temperature and irradiation in period 3 early july to late september the biomass increased further because of the increasing water temperature however the rate of increase was slower than that in period 2 because of nutrient limitation and decrease in light suitability the rapid decrease in biomass during period 4 october to late november was due to the active vertical mixing and the wide dispersion of sda concentrated near the surface layer resulting in a decrease in grazing capacity this mechanism comes from the ecological theory that even if the natural growth rate is the same the extent of grazing decreases as the biomass decreases birch 1948 shiff 1964 in addition the decrease in irradiation and water temperature also has an effect on the decrease in biomass during period 4 in period 5 late november to late january a further decrease in irradiation and water temperature reduces the suitability for sda growth in period 6 late january to late march irradiation is more favorable than period 5 however the water temperature and nutrient conditions are less suitable for sda and the combined result is a decrease in biomass 4 3 3 coscinodiscus wailesii as shown in fig 10 3 period 1 early april to early june was more suitable for cdw in terms of both water temperature and irradiation light conditions than period 8 mid february to late march however nutrient limitation was strict and biomass was thus reduced the strong nutrient limitation was due to the weak vertical mixing and reduced nutrient supply from the benthic and bottom layers of the pelagic system furthermore the weakening of vertical mixing increased the amount of sedimentation of cdw and reduced the biomass present in the photic zone resulting in a decrease in cdw grazing capacity the decrease in biomass in period 2 early june to mid august was the same as that in period 1 in period 3 late august to mid september biomass slightly increased this was because nutrient limitation was weaker although water temperature and light suitability for cdw were lower in period 3 than in period 2 the higher nutrient concentration in period 3 than in period 2 could be attributed to the slight recovery of vertical mixing in addition resting stage cells of the benthic system upwelled to the euphotic zone albeit the small window of opportunity the increase in biomass in period 4 mid september to mid october was due to the active vertical mixing compared with that in period 3 the activation of vertical mixing leads to weak nutrient limitation and the upwelling of resting stage cells from the benthic system to the photic zone as a result the proliferation ability of cdw increased in period 5 mid october to late november the suitability of light was lower than that in period 4 however both water temperature and nutrients were the most suitable for cdw throughout the year at the same time vertical mixing was strong and even cdw having a large cell size could remain in the photic zone in period 6 late november to early january biomass began to decrease this was due to a decrease in the water temperature and irradiation in period 7 mid january to mid february the biomass increased especially around the end of january because of the increased suitability of the light for cdw the rapid decrease in biomass during period 8 mid february to late march was due to the weakening of vertical mixing resulting in reduced nutrient supply from the benthic system and bottom layers of the pelagic system the weakening of vertical mixing increased the sedimentation of large cell sized cdw and reduced the biomass in the photic zone further it reduced the supply of nutrients from nutrient rich seafloor to the photic zone consequently the proliferative ability of cdw was reduced in period 8 4 3 4 eucampia zodiacus the model results for ezl proliferative phase and ezs sporulation phase are shown in fig 10 4 and 10 5 respectively the decrease in ezl during period 1 early april to early june was mainly caused by the increase in sedimentation and nutrient limitation due to the weakening of vertical mixing compared with that in period 7 late january to late march in addition to cdw ezl had difficulty remaining in the photic zone when the vertical mixture was weak in period 2 early june to mid august ezl did not grow due to further weakening of vertical mixing and nutrient limitation compared with those in period 1 regarding ezs the decrease in periods 1 and 2 was due to mortality regarding the increase decrease of both ezl and ezs biomass from period 3 to 5 late august to early december not only light nutrient limitation water temperature and vertical mixing but also the life cycle of e zodiacus represented in this model was important for e zodiacus periods 3 late august to late october and 4 late october to mid november represented the transition from the proliferative cell size 20 μm ezl to sporulation cell size 20 μm ezs phase after transitioning from ezl to ezs it is physiologically impossible for the cells to proliferate without recovering in size from ezs to ezl in periods 4 late october to mid november and 5 mid november to early december some ezs cells increased in size to become proliferative therefore it was difficult for ezl to grow in period 3 late august to late october when the transition from ezl to ezs is progressing conversely ezl slightly increased in period 4 late october to mid november when the transition from ezl to ezs and from ezs to ezl overlapped in period 5 mid november to early december when the transition from ezs to ezl was progressing and there was no transition from ezl to ezs the biomass of ezl rapidly increased not only due to the transition from ezs to ezl but also because of the suitability of water temperature light and nutrients for ezl grazing and the recovery of strong vertical mixing which upwelled ezl and nutrients from the lower zone sediment to the photic zone the increase decrease in ezs from period 3 to 5 can be explained by the transition from ezl to ezs due to the decrease in cell size and the size restoration from ezs to ezl during period 6 early december to late january ezl continued to increase because e zodiacus that has recovered its cell size had suitable water temperature light and nutrients continuously from periods 4 and 5 and the retention in the photic zone due to vertical mixing was ensured in period 7 late january to late march ezl biomass began to decrease because of a decrease in the suitability of the water temperature and an increase in sedimentation to the seafloor due to the weakening of vertical mixing the decrease in ezs during periods 6 and 7 was due to natural mortality this decrease is consistent with the experimental data from nishikawa et al 2007 and 2013 4 4 endogenous mechanism of bloom generation effects of nutrient uptake competition to understand the effect of phytoplankton nutrient uptake competition we analyzed the sensitivity of phytoplankton when the biomass of dfl sda cdw and ez ezl and ezs ezl and ezs were set to zero and compared them to the control case described in sections 4 1 to 4 3 fig 11 shows monthly changes in the biomass bar graphs and nutrient limitation function for growth rate dotted line graphs of one type of phytoplankton when the remaining three types were set to zero these results are the analytical output of the state in which a new annual periodicity was reached after each phytoplankton biomass was set to zero here the increase in the value of nutrient limitation indicates that the nutrient limitation for photosynthesis had weakened refer to appendix b as shown in fig 11 a when sda was set to zero case 2 both dfl biomass and nutrient limitation function increased significantly from june to october with biomass increasing more than eight times and nutrient limitation weakening by more than two times in the peak month however when cdw and ez were set to zero i e in the absence of cdw and ez there was no significant change in biomass or nutrient limitation as shown in fig 11 b neither sda biomass nor nutrient limitation changed significantly in the absence of dfl cdw and ez however sda biomass slightly increased from june to october when dfl was set to zero fig 11 a as shown in fig 11 c cdw biomass tended to increase slightly from may to december in the absence of dfl or sda and from november to april in the absence of ez the nutrient limitation weakened by more than two times in the peak month from june to september in the absence of sda however cdw biomass during this period was originally low and thus the biomass did not increase by much as shown in fig 11 d in the absence of dfl and sda ezl biomass increased slightly during april and may however during the ezl bloom period from december to march ezl biomass did not change in the absence of other phytoplankton nutrient limitation weakened significantly from may to september in the absence of sda however ezl biomass was originally low and did not significantly change during this period the abovementioned results regarding biomass and nutrient limitation of each phytoplankton reflect the superiority or inferiority of nutrient uptake among phytoplankton types nishikawa et al 2009 2010 in the blooms from june to october there was competition between dfl and sda and although dfl blooms were rate controlled by sda sda blooms were almost unaffected by other phytoplankton including dfl this is because the rate of nutrient uptake into the cell quota of sda was higher than that of dfl in other words sda has a higher ability to take up nutrients from the surrounding water and secure them in the cell than dfl in the blooms from november to march the cdw blooms were slightly affected by nutrient competition with ezl from january to march however ezl blooms were not affected by cdw in the model because the rate of nutrient uptake to the cell quota was lower in cdw than ezl the sensitivity analysis indicated that the nutrient uptake competition among phytoplankton types affected the phytoplankton blooms and that there were phytoplankton that were both affected and unaffected by competition 4 5 combination of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of bloom fig 12 summarizes the factors that changed the biomass of phytoplankton and were discussed in sections 4 3 and 4 4 as the first stage of modeling the life cycle of phytoplankton and its participation in the benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem model we demonstrated the mechanisms of phytoplankton blooms with a focus on phytoplankton life cycle nutrient uptake competition and physical drivers such as water temperature light and vertical diffusion consequently phytoplankton blooms could be explained mostly by these mechanisms these results indicated that the trigger of phytoplankton blooms may be partly explained by two hypotheses the triticale depth hypothesis sverdup 1952 and critical turbulence hypothesis are the trigger for phytoplankton blooms huisman et al 1999 regarding subsequent ecosystem transitions zooplankton and benthic fauna grazing likely have an important impact on phytoplankton blooms e g behrenfeld et al 2017 hori et al 2008 smaal and prins 1993 to evaluate this accurately it is necessary to perform sensitivity analysis on changes in the abundance of zooplankton and benthic fauna in the model in addition additional observation data of zooplankton and benthic fauna are required the observation of zooplankton and benthic fauna are now in progress and these data will enable us to estimate zooplankton benthic fauna grazing effect by emagin l p in the future the simulated result of zooplankton in the control case is described in appendix i for the simulated results of benthic fauna refer to fig 8 5 conclusion in this research we developed a new ecosystem model emagin l p to elucidate the mechanisms of phytoplankton bloom and the effects of such blooms on comprehensive nutrient cycles in the benthic pelagic ecosystem the developed model analyzed the bio metabolism processes making up the life cycle of phytoplankton reductional approach individually whereas those in the benthic pelagic systems were analyzed holistic approach simultaneously each metabolism process for four types of phytoplankton dfl sda cdw and ez was newly formulated based on the combined experimental field data and ecological theory application of emagin l p to the harima nada sea where the nutrient concentration decreased due to large diatoms c wailesii and e zodiacus and nori discoloration occurred generally reproduced the observed values of model variables both in the pelagic and benthic systems in particular the model reproduced the seasonal variations in the bloom of each of the four types of phytoplankton the fact that emagin l p grasps the entire ecosystem dynamics because of interactions between biological and chemical processes paradoxically makes it possible to elucidate unknown biological chemical physical processes from the entire ecosystem with the abovementioned advantages of emagin l p the validated model elucidated the mechanisms of phytoplankton blooms based on the simultaneous evaluation of the combination of temperature suitability light availability and nutrient limitation for each phytoplankton as well as the vertical mixing of water columns furthermore the model revealed nutrient uptake competition among the four types of phytoplankton although the newly developed emagin l p is a simplified model of the actual ecosystem and involves some uncertainty the model is a unique tool that provides information hypothesis for elucidating the key processes and relative dominance of the drivers of nutrient cycles as well as predicting estimating the effect of environmental measures we plan to predict and evaluate the effects of nutrient supply from rivers surrounding ocean areas changes in water temperature and changes in biomass of benthic fauna on the phytoplankton blooms and nori discoloration by conducting further sensitivity analyses with corroboration of laboratory experiments and field survey the modeling approach presented here i e categorizing different types of major phytoplankton and incorporating their life cycle into the entire benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem will be an effective method to understand predict manage the problems due to harmful diatom blooms even if the types of the damage the species of harmful diatoms and the ocean areas are different emagin l p has the potential to be a communication platform among scientists in various fields or among scientists and policymakers to promote nutrient management in estuaries funding

24463,harmful diatom coscinodiscus waillesi and eucampia zodiacus blooms frequently occur in the western coastal area of japan from late autumn to early spring causing discoloration of edible seaweed nori pyropia yezoensis one of the causes of the discoloration is thought to be nutrient depletion oligotrophication due to nutrient uptake by diatoms the goal of our study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton blooms and the effects of such blooms on comprehensive nutrient cycles in the benthic pelagic ecosystem we developed a new ecosystem model emagin l p simultaneously representing phytoplankton life cycle and the benthic pelagic ecosystem the life cycles of four types of phytoplankton dinoflagellates dfl small diatoms sda coscinodiscus wailesii cdw and eucampia zodiacus ez were numerically modeled and incorporated into an existing ecosystem model ecohym sohma et al 2008a representing the food web among the benthic and pelagic systems and carbon nitrogen phosphorus oxygen coupled cycles driven by biogeochemical and physical processes the model was applied to the harima nada sea where the discoloration of nori frequently occurs the model reproduced the differences in timing and scale of the four phytoplankton blooms and each bloom could be explained by a combination of temperature suitability light availability nutrient limitation and vertical mixing within the water column furthermore through a sensitivity analysis competition for nutrient uptake among different types of phytoplankton was observed in the model that is from june to october when dfl and sda blooms occur the sda nutrient uptake rate is high and sda suppresses the dfl bloom while from november to march when cdw and ez blooms occur the nutrient uptake rate of ez is high and the cdw bloom is slightly suppressed the developed model representing the phytoplankton bloom mechanisms in the whole benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem will be a useful tool for revealing the mechanisms underlying the nutrient cycle and the contribution of harmful diatom blooms to the discoloration of nori the modeling approach presented in this paper i e categorizing different types of major phytoplankton and incorporating their life cycle into the entire benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem can be an effective method to understand predict and manage the problems caused by harmful

imbricata during the nori harvest season from november to march manabe and ishio 1991 nishikawa et al 2011 sasaki and kito 2003 leading to nori discoloration hori et al 2008 imai et al 2006 nori harvesting is important for japanese fisheries especially in the coastal waters of western japan it accounts for approximately 75 billion yen which is around 80 of the total nori production in japan e stat 2021 discolored nori has low commercial value owing to its low content of amino acids which are umami components and poor appearance a direct cause of this discoloration is oligotrophication i e a decrease in nutrient concentration of seawater imai et al 2006 as shown in fig 1 a decrease in nutrient concentration could be associated with i competition for nutrient uptake due to harmful diatom ii reduction in excretion and phytoplankton feeding pressure resulting from a decrease in benthic fauna suspension feeders hori et al 2008 smaal and prins 1993 and iii reduction in nutrient inflow from rivers and surrounding ocean areas owing to environmental measures dorado et al 2015 hashimoto et al 1997 yamamoto et al 2008 yamamoto 2003 however these causes are intricately linked in the ecosystems and the main cause of nutrient decline and effective measures to prevent it have not yet been clarified harmful diatoms frequently bloom in the coastal waters of western japan such as in the ariake sea matsubara et al 2014 matsubara et al 2018 sasaki and kito 2003 and the seto inland sea miyahara et al 1996 oyama et al 2008 which are sites for large scale nori cultivation the target area of the present study the harima nada sea is adversely affected by large scale blooms of e zodiacus and c wailesii manabe and ishio 1991 nishikawa et al 2011 in this sea nori discoloration has been frequently occurring since the mid 1980s manabe and ishio 1991 and nagai et al 1995 1996 associated nori discoloration with c wailesii blooms from the mid 1990s e zodiacus blooms have been observed annually in addition to c wailesii blooms nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2011 and the nutrients available for nori have almost disappeared in this context research on the physiological ecology of phytoplankton such as e zodiacus and c wailesii was carried out through laboratory experiments and field observations to clarify the characteristics of bio metabolism such as growth rate and its dependence on light temperature and nutrients nishikawa et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2010 nishikawa and hori 2015 nishikawa and yamaguchi 2006 nishikawa and yamaguchi 2008 to clarify the effect of these bio metabolism processes on phytoplankton biomass concentration in the water and the entire benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem it is necessary to analyze each bio metabolism process within the ecosystem and vice versa feedback effect the final goal of our project is to reveal the behavior of phytoplankton and ecosystem networks from the perspective of comprehensive nutrient cycles across the benthic pelagic ecosystems and to evaluate and predict the controlling factors of nutrient concentration decline and nori discoloration to achieve this goal a model representing the following three factors 1 phytoplankton life cycles 2 food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems and 3 supply of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic system and the return of mineralized nutrients from the benthic to the pelagic system i e a process based ecosystem model is useful jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 sohma et al 2008a sohma et al 2018 regarding factor 1 only few model studies have taken phytoplankton life cycles processes into account eilertsen and wyatt 2000 showed that the consideration of the seed stock better explains spring bloom dynamics warns 2013 coupled a complex dinoflagellate life cycle model warns et al 2013a 2013b with a simple diatom life cycle model lee et al 2018 developed an ecosystem model which includes the life cycles of three main phytoplankton groups diatoms dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria and showed the importance of phytoplankton life cycle mechanisms regulating their blooms however these models did not consider the early diagenetic vertical biogeochemical mechanisms in the benthic system which controls important nutrient supply to the pelagic systems in shallow coastal areas graf 1992 grenz et al 2000 liu et al 2007 griffiths et al 2017 several ecosystem models have been applied to the seto inland sea including our study area the harima nada sea i e ohuchi et al 1986 yoshie et al 2011 these models focused on simplified primary production and even if the phytoplankton was classified into several groups yoshie et al 2011 they did not consider the life cycles of phytoplankton regarding factors 2 and 3 soetaert et al 2000 sohma et al 2002 2008a 2018 and reed et al 2011 developed a benthic pelagic coupled nutrient cycle model with detailed vertical biochemical mechanisms in the benthic system and demonstrated the prominent effect of biogeochemical processes and their vertical changes on nutrient cycles in the benthic system to the pelagic system especially in the shallow eutrophic coastal area in addition baretta et al 1995 butenschön et al 2016 and sohma et al 2008a 2018 developed models describing the benthic pelagic food web and incorporated them into the benthic and pelagic coupled ecosystem model around shallow coastal areas owing to the possibility of their importance in nutrients cycles such benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem models are currently entering the era of operational forecasting siddorn et al 2007 however the forecasting of harmful algal blooms using generic ecosystem models excluding consideration of phytoplankton life cycles is difficult for example vanhoutte brunier et al 2008 considered it necessary to add a specific karenia mikimotoi a type of dinoflagellates algorithm to a generic ecosystem model to study a bloom in the english channel during 2003 in summary to the best of our knowledge no ecosystem model has been developed that describes all three factors i e phytoplankton life cycles food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems and benthic pelagic nutrient cycle describing the fine vertical biochemical structure in the benthic system simultaneously in order to incorporate all the three factors we developed the ecosystem model for aquatic geologic integrated network on life cycles of phytoplankton emagin l p to this end we formulated the biological metabolism life cycles of the four types of phytoplankton including large diatoms and incorporated this information into the existing benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem model which already represents the food web in the benthic and pelagic systems and their nutrient cycles describing their fine vertical biochemical structure sohma et al 2008a incorporating the life cycle of phytoplankton into an existing benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem as a single model can increase the complexity of the model however with regard to the coastal area where harmful diatom blooms have been increasing and the knowledge of their bio metabolism are obtained by experimental field research this new model still has the advantage compared to the existing model in addition this modeling approach is useful to understand predict or manage the harmful diatom blooms which have been occurring globally in the last quarter century landsberg et al 2005 in the current paper as the first stage of model development and application we introduce the mathematical modeling of the phytoplankton life cycle in emagin l p and present the validation results for the model applied to the harima nada sea in addition we demonstrate the mechanism of phytoplankton bloom formation and the competitive relationship of nutrient uptake among phytoplankton derived from model analysis 2 model description 2 1 ecosystem diagram and its drivers fig 2 shows the ecosystem diagram handled by emagin l p and driven by biological chemical physical processes the boxes in fig 2 represent the model variables stock and arrows represent their biological chemical processes flows in addition to these the physical processes derived from water currents were analyzed in emagin l p by coupling with a hydrodynamics model sohma et al 2018 the characteristic driving force processes of the nutrient cycle considered by the model are 1 the phytoplankton life cycles 2 food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems and 3 supply of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic system and the return of nutrients from the benthic to the pelagic system regarding 1 the phytoplankton life cycles phytoplankton were divided into dinoflagellates small diatoms c wailesii and e zodiacus considering that the phytoplankton life cycle exists across the pelagic and benthic systems and that there are differences between the resting stage and vegetative cells cloern 1996 model variables of each phytoplankton were incorporated into both pelagic and benthic systems regarding 2 the food webs across the pelagic and benthic systems benthic fauna such as suspension feeders feed on phytoplankton and excrete dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and the metabolism of such organisms can affect water quality kirby and miller 2005 krueger et al 1992 a previous study reported a correlation between the decrease in benthic fauna and the increase in the occurrence of diatom blooms in the harima nada sea hori et al 2008 to analyze such causal relationships emagin l p represents a food web of the pelagic and benthic systems including benthic fauna regarding 3 the supply of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic system and the return of nutrients from the benthic to the pelagic system most of the n and p contents in the shallow coastal areas accumulate not in the pelagic system but in the benthic system and the nutrients produced by mineralization are reused for primary production in the pelagic system graf 1992 grenz et al 2000 liu et al 2007 emagin l p describes the process of organic matter settling and mineralizing from the water to the sediment and the production of nutrients released from the sediment to the water here the mineralization process was modeled by dividing it into oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization as a result oxygen consumption reduced substance accumulation reoxidation and denitrification which are associated with mineralization were expressed in the model soetaert et al 1996 sohma et al 2001 sohma et al 2004 details of the mathematical modeling for factors 2 and 3 are well described by sohma et al 2001 2004 2008a 2018 in the subsequent section we introduce the modeling for 1 the phytoplankton life cycles 2 2 modeling of the phytoplankton life cycle 2 2 1 overview in our study area the harima nada sea large diatoms i e harmful diatoms e zodiacus and c wailesii bloom from late autumn november to early spring march and small diatoms and dinoflagellates usually bloom from spring may to autumn october the differences in the timing and extent of bloom occurrences among plankton species conjecture to depend on the following the suitability of the external environment for phytoplankton such as water temperature and nutrient concentration and the internal interactions such as competitive relationships of nutrient uptake among phytoplankton species or between phytoplankton and seaweed the categories of phytoplankton in this model e zodiacus c wailesii small diatoms and dinoflagellates fig 2 express such suitability and competitive relationships and were determined based on differences in phytoplankton life cycle size and dominant species in the harima nada sea fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the life cycle of the four phytoplankton categories e zodiacus does not form resting stage cells and exist in vegetative cells throughout their life cycle the cell size changes annually decreasing monotonically from december to september until reaching its minimum size in autumn and then recovering to its maximum size nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2013 the small celled period is the sporulation phase in which proliferation grazing is impossible and the period from november to september after the restoration of cell size is the growth period proliferative phase the cells that enter the proliferative phase are transported from the seafloor to the photic zone due to the upwelling vertical eddy diffusion caused by the northwesterly wind collapsing density gradient in winter and proliferate the proliferative rate growth rate is determined by the suitability of the environment including light nutrients and temperature when the vertical mixing weakens around the end of march the bloom terminates and e zodiacus inhabits the seafloor until the next blooming period nishikawa et al 2011 other phytoplankton species have similar life cycles in which they become vegetative cells during the bloom phase and then form resting stage cells that are present around the seafloor and in the sediment following the bloom period however the bloom period differs depending on the species their resting stage cells reach the photic zone from the seafloor by upwelling flow vertical mixing to become vegetative cells and they germinate to generate blooms imai et al 1990 itakura et al 1992 itakura et al 1997 nagai et al 1995 1996 as shown in fig 2 to represent the life cycles of e zodiacus two variables were set in the model i e a large size 20 µm in the proliferative phase growth phase and a small size 20 µm or less in the sporulation phase non growth phase nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2013 nishikawa 2017 in addition each model variable was set in both benthic and pelagic systems for the other phytoplankton we used pelagic vegetative cells and benthic resting stage cells as model variables furthermore the mechanism by which phytoplankton store nutrients inside the cells namely cell quota nishikawa et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2010 nishikawa and hori 2015 smith and kalff 1982 was expressed in the model thus the model reproduces the proliferation limited by the nutrients stored in cell quota not the nutrient concentration in the water tables 1 a and b show the model variables and their notation in the pelagic and benthic systems tables 2 a and b show an overview of the formulations expressing the time dependence of the model variables related to phytoplankton the detailed formulations are described in appendices a c the formulations of other model variables were the same as those described by sohma et al 2004 2008a the following section describes the newly modeled factors i e the transition between the proliferative and sporulation phases of e zodiacus the treatment of resting stage cells of other phytoplankton and the relationship between cell quota and grazing rate i e photosynthetic rate 2 2 2 transition between the proliferative and sporulation phase of e zodiacus the life cycle shown in fig 3 illustrates that the cell size of e zodiacus peaked at 80 μm around the end of november before continually decreasing over the course of approximately 11 months and then entering the growing sporulation phase from around october of the following year cells having succeeded in forming spores by late november recover their original cell size if the light temperature and nutrient conditions are suitable nishikawa et al 2007 nishikawa et al 2013 based on the results of nishikawa et al 2007 2013 this model assumes that cells at 20 μm can be instantly proliferated under suitable light temperature and nutrient conditions i e proliferative phase and that cells at 20 μm require the following series of processes spore formation cell size restoration proliferation nishikawa et al 2009 the former cells i e proliferative phase cell size 20 μm were considered as model variables ezl large e zodiacus and the latter i e sporulation phase cell size 20 μm as ezs small e zodiacus the transitions from ezs to ezl and ezl to ezs were modeled respectively as follows d ezs dt ezs ezl r t din dip i ezs v rst ezs t u rst ezsa din dip u rst ezsb i ezs where d e z l d t e z s e z l is the transition rate from ezl to ezs µgc ml h t is time h r is the cell size restoration success rate 1 h t is the water temperature c din is the concentration of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n and no3 n µgn ml dip is the concentration of inorganic phosphorus po4 p µgp ml i is irradiation intensity µe m2 h v rst ezs is the cell size restoration success rate at t with no limitation of din dip and irradiation 1 h u rst ezsa is the cell quota limit for cell size restoration and u rst ezsb is the light availability function for cell size restoration here the function form and parameters were created from the statistical analysis of experimental data nishikawa et al 2009 refer to appendices d and e d ezs dt ezl ezs v dec ezl t nt ezl v dec ezl t v dec ezl t np where v dec ezl is the ratio of ezl that transition to ezs after δt 1 h t is time h p is time period of 1 year h n is an integer and v dec ezl is a 1 year periodic function created from experimental data in nishikawa et al 2007 see appendices b and c 2 2 3 resting stage cell formation and germination previous studies have shown that most phytoplankton except for e zodiacus form vegetative and resting stage cells fogg and thake 1987 mcquoid and hobson 1996 in the present study resting stage cells represent cysts of dinoflagellates and resting stage cells of diatoms for dinoflagellates small diatoms and c wailesii this model assumed that the period for resting stage cells to recover as vegetative cells and germinate is short and that the environmental conditions temperature nutrients and light irradiation are similar for the restoration of resting stage cells and the germination of vegetative cells based on these assumptions the cells that reached the benthic system were considered as resting stage cells and the cells in the pelagic system were considered as vegetative cells the upwelling of resting stage cells from the benthic to pelagic system was functionalized by the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient calculated by the hydrodynamics model sohma et al 2018 2 2 4 cell quota and photosynthesis phytoplankton contain nutrients that are not immediately utilized for photosynthesis following uptake into cells eppley and strickland 1968 and the photosynthesis rate proliferation rate is proportional to the nutrients contained in the cells cell quota rather than the nutrient concentration in the surrounding water droop 1968 in this model the cell quota was considered as a model variable to express a two step process 1 uptake of nutrients into the cell quota and 2 consumption of cell quota by photosynthesis fig 4 shows the definition of the cell quota in the model and fig 5 shows the nutrient uptake into the cell quota and nutrient consumption by photosynthesis in this model the amount of nutrients stored in the cells i e cell quota q and the minimum amount of nutrients required for phytoplankton cells i e subsistent cell quota qmin were set here q was modeled to vary between the maximum value of nutrients stored in cells qmax and qmin 0 q qmax qmin the cell quota was set for each of the four types of phytoplankton for both din and dip the uptake rate into the cell quota is a function of light irradiation nutrient concentration water temperature and amount of nutrients the consumption rate of the cell quota is the same as the photosynthetic rate the photosynthetic rate is given by a function of light intensity temperature and the amount of nutrients in the cell quota in each phytoplankton fig 5 the detailed formulations of each term in the temporal dynamics of the cell quota are shown in appendices b and c 3 method of implementation the ecosystem model emagin l p was applied to the harima nada sea fig 6 and the average seasonal validation changes in a 1 year cycle from 2000 to 2004 was simulated prescribed functions i e model drivers inflows of nutrients and organic matter from rivers meteorological conditions i e solar radiation wind and boundary conditions of model variables at i j 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 8 3 8 5 2 5 3 and 5 4 in fig 6 were given as 1 year periodic functions these model drivers were generated from the observation data of 5 years 2000 2004 i e the data of the same month and day of each of the 5 years were averaged with five values and from these values the periodic functions were produced as the function describing the annual seasonal daily changes the initial conditions of each model variables were set at the values of april 1st for the periodic functions the convergence state of this simulation describes the dynamics in a 1 year period this state hereafter is called the control case assuming the average seasonal variation from 2000 to 2004 the control case is used for model validation and analysis in the following sections the data source and the model drivers of wind solar radiation and nutrients and organic matter inflow from rivers were shown in appendices f and g the 1 year periodic functions were used owing to insufficient data to follow the yearly changes in addition by using the periodical driving forces the model can be validated using the equilibrium state i e the one year periodic output of model variables this is a preferable approach at the first stage of model development regarding the spatial resolution setting for model simulation in the hydrodynamic model sohma et al 2018 the horizontal spatial resolution was set by dividing the harima nada sea by a grid of 500 m to 1 km and in the ecosystem model the sea was divided into 12 boxes fig 6 the resolution of 12 boxes was not sufficient to demonstrate the details of the horizontal spatial distribution however it still enabled us to describe the distributions of large horizontal spatial scales of nutrients and phytoplankton in the harima nada sea reported in manabe et al 1994 and nishikawa et al 2014 and aided in reducing computational cost that is the nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations are high along the northern coast area and have a large concentration gradient in contrast the gradient is small in the central part of the harima nada sea the vertical special resolution in the pelagic system both in the hydrodynamic model and the ecosystem model is set at 1 2 m which is sufficient to accurately demonstrate the following nutrient cycle related processes i e vertical mixing stratification sedimentation of particulate substances nutrient flux and oxygen consumption from the benthic system in the benthic system the vertical spatial distribution of biochemical processes related to nutrient cycles namely oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization denitrification nitrification odu oxidation and photosynthesis of benthic algae have a steep gradient within a scale of 1 10 mm canfield et al 1993 soetaert et al 1996 glud et al 2016 sohma and sayama 2002 regarding the transport processes the advection flow in the sediment deposition of sediment and advection of pore water is 1 cm year of deposition rate matsumoto et al 1978 hoshika et al 1983 matsumoto 1983 and the diffusion in the sediment is dominated by molecular diffusion i e small scale diffusion while the pelagic system is dominated by eddy diffusion thus the vertical grid interval in the benthic system was set at a pitch of 0 01 1 2 cm the input data flow velocity eddy viscosity and water temperature from the hydrodynamic model to the ecosystem model were spatially averaged and set in 12 boxes of the ecosystem model while considering the continuous equation regarding the vertical resolution of the benthic ecosystem we provided the spatial resolution at the micrometer scale the pelagic system was divided by water depth into a layer of 1 to 2 m thickness fig 6 the benthic system was divided into 30 layers over 10 cm in the vertical direction from the sediment water boundary layer the layer thickness was 0 01 cm on the surface gradually thickening downwards and 1 2 cm at the bottom the simulation time step was set to 1 h such that the temporal dynamics of the daily scale could be sufficiently captured for the biological chemical and physical parameters the values obtained from the observation and experiment data in the harima nada sea were set preferentially for the parameters for which this could not be determined in the harima nada sea the values from other sea areas and other models were set the set values of the parameters associated with phytoplankton are shown in appendices d and e the other biochemical parameters i e parameters for zooplankton and benthic fauna i e suspension feeders and deposit feeders mineralization rate nitrification rate odu oxidation rate were set at the same value as that noted by sohma et al 2008 this simulation case i e assuming the average seasonal variation from 2000 to 2004 is referred to as the control case the control case is used for model validation and analysis in the following sections 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation the model was validated by comparing the observed and simulated values for the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of model variables in the pelagic and benthic systems the observed data used for comparison with the simulated values were observed between april 2000 and march 2005 appendix g figures 7 and 8 show the time series of the model variables on the pelagic and benthic systems in box i j 3 2 where phytoplankton blooms are frequently observed and there exist other multi item observation data in addition tables 3 4 and 5 show the correlation coefficient and root mean squared error rmse calculated between the observed data and simulated values fig 7 shows that the simulated values of phytoplankton dinoflagellate dfl small diatom sda c wailesii cdw and e zodiacus ezl nutrients nh4 n no3 n and po4 p and dissolved oxygen do in the pelagic system were generally within the range of the observed data focusing on the reproducibility of phytoplankton blooms the timing and concentration of c wailesii blooms from late october to march and e zodiacus blooms from december to march were generally reproduced by the model the low level of c wailesii from april to september and e zodiacus from april to december are also consistent with the life cycles of e zodiacus and c wailesii reported by nagai et al 1995 1996 and nishikawa et al 2007 2013 respectively in addition the model almost reproduced the occurrence of small diatom blooms from june to october and the occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms in may and october the model expressed the differences in the timing of bloom occurrence depending on phytoplankton type and the time series tendency of these blooms was almost the same as that in the actual ecosystem as a reflection of this result correlation coefficients for dfl sda cdw and ezl from the surface layer to the bottom layer shown in table 3 are relatively high compared to those of nh4 n and po4 p in the pelagic system in table 4 and suspension feeders deposit feeders detritus nh4 n no3 n and po4 p in the benthic system in table 5 regarding the nutrient concentration in the pelagic system no seasonal tendency in the vertical profiles was found in the observation results fig 7 however according to the simulated results there was a high nutrient concentration in the bottom layer and a low concentration in the surface layer during summer manabe et al 1994 reported the same tendency as our simulation results from the observation data analysis between april 1973 and march 1993 although the period of observation used in the analysis was different from that of the present study this tendency in the simulated results is due to water column stratification photosynthetic utilization of phytoplankton at the surface layer photic zone and mineralization of sedimentary organic matter at the sea bottom and in the benthic system in winter the model demonstrated that the difference in concentration between the surface layer and the bottom layer narrows this tendency is also the same as the observed result reported by manabe et al 1994 this simulated result is because vertical mixing is activated during winter compared with that during summer in the model the do concentration decreases in summer due to the high mineralization of organic matter and the retention of seawater in the bottom layer because of the stronger stratification in summer compared with that in winter from the statistical analysis in table 4 the correlation coefficient values of mh4 n no3 n po4 p and do in the surface layer denote the lowest value among all three layers the poor correlation of the surface layer is due to high vertical gradients of mh4 n no3 n po4 p and do around the surface layer caused by increased photosynthetic activity in the real system the observation was recorded at 0 5 m depth from the ocean surface however the simulation values described the averaged value of the surface layer at 0 2 m depth from the ocean surface fig 6 regarding the benthic system in fig 8 suspension feeders peaked around december and deposit feeders peaked around november in the simulation these simulated results were from a combination of factors such as growth temperature dependence food concentration e g benthic and pelagic detritus and plankton and mortality due to hypoxia during summer as determined by benthic faunal resistance to hypoxia here the temperature and food dependency of the benthic fauna s growth are basically formulated by the experimental observation data sohma et al 2008a these dependency were reported modeled in other oceans e g gili and coma 1998 rosenberg and johansson 1991 ebenhöh et al 1995 baretta bekker et al 1997 ehrnsten et al 2020 the increase decrease in the surface layer of detritus benthic organic matter was due to the increase decrease in fast labile organic matter and this increase decrease depends on the amount of sedimentation of organic matter detritus and planktons from the pelagic system and the rate of mineralization by bacteria conversely the amount of detritus in the deeper sediment around 10 cm depth does not change seasonally because it results from long term accumulation over 10 50 years in the model most of the detritus in the deep sediments is refractory because labile organic matter is mineralized before it is buried deep in the sediment the high concentration of nh4 n and po4 p in the pore water of the benthic system during summer is due to the large amount of mineralization of detritus no3 n is low in summer because of the restricted nitrification due to low do concentration the same tendency as this model was reported in other ocean areas by zhang and wirtz 2017 and sohma et al 2008b regarding statistical analysis of the benthic system shown in table 5 the number of the observed data is insufficient to estimate the results as a result the correlation coefficient of detritus and no3 n at the bottom layer denotes negative values 4 2 ecological succession of the four phytoplankton types fig 9 shows a comparison of the seasonal validation of dfl sda cdw ezl and ezs simulated in the control case of the model in the model the differences in the dynamics depending on the type of phytoplankton shown in fig 9 are governed by three factors the suitability of the physiology of each phytoplankton for the external environment exogenous factors such as water temperature light nutrients and vertical mixing interactions among phytoplankton such as nutrient uptake competition and ecosystem networks with benthic pelagic coupling 4 3 exogenous mechanism of bloom generation effects of temperature light nutrients and vertical mixing here we focused on the gross primary production i e the photosynthesis of phytoplankton and analyzed the effect of external environmental factors on the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass specifically for each of the phytoplankton dfl sda cdw ezl and ezs we analyzed the seasonal dynamics in four factors regarding their function in photosynthesis biomass temperature dependence nutrient cell quota limitation and light availability in the model the total primary production of each phytoplankton was calculated from the product of these factors details of the formulae used to calculate photosynthesis are described in appendix b in addition the seasonal dynamics in the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient which affects the vertical transport from the pelagic bottom layer benthic layer to the photic layer were also analyzed results for all factors are shown in fig 10 1 to 10 5 here the values of all factors except for the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient were averages of the 1st to 5th vertical layers for the whole simulated area the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient was the value averaged in both horizontal and vertical directions over the simulated area from the definition of the cell quota limitation function in appendix b an increase in the nutrient limitation from 0 to 1 indicates that the nutrient limitation for photosynthesis has weakened the comparison of model results and observation data across the whole simulated area are shown in appendix h the model output in appendix h reproduced the observation data at the same level as i j 3 2 discussed in section 4 1 4 3 1 dinoflagellates as shown in fig 10 1 the increase in dfl biomass during period 1 mid april to the end of may was due to an increase in both water temperature and irradiance in period 1 compared with that in period 6 early march to mid april in period 2 late may to early august the water temperature and irradiance were more favorable than in period 1 however nutrient limitation was stronger than that in period 1 thus biomass began decreasing in period 2 this nutrient limitation resulted from competition for nutrient uptake with sda this competition was analyzed and the results are described in section 4 4 in period 3 early august to mid september the biomass increased rapidly because of the optimal water temperature and the nutrient limitation was slightly weak compared with that in period 2 although light availability was lower than in period 2 period 3 was the most suitable environment for the growth of dfl considering water temperature nutrients and light conditions the decrease in biomass during period 4 mid september to late january was due to the decrease in water temperature and irradiation compared with that in period 3 but nutrient limitation decreased compared with that in period 3 this decrease in nutrient limitation was caused by the nutrients in the middle and bottom layers being transported to the surface layer due to strong vertical mixing in period 5 february the degree of biomass decreases weakened because the irradiance increased slightly compared with that in period 4 however since the water temperature was even lower and nutrient limitation was stronger than those in period 4 the total primary production rate was low and biomass did not increase in period 6 early march to early april dfl biomass began to increase because the water temperature and light conditions were more suitable for dfl than those in period 5 4 3 2 small diatoms as shown in fig 10 2 in period 1 april to mid may sda biomass began to increase slightly compared with that in period 6 late january to march owing to the increase in water temperature and irradiation light intensity the increase in biomass during period 2 mid may to early july was also due to an increase in water temperature and irradiation in period 3 early july to late september the biomass increased further because of the increasing water temperature however the rate of increase was slower than that in period 2 because of nutrient limitation and decrease in light suitability the rapid decrease in biomass during period 4 october to late november was due to the active vertical mixing and the wide dispersion of sda concentrated near the surface layer resulting in a decrease in grazing capacity this mechanism comes from the ecological theory that even if the natural growth rate is the same the extent of grazing decreases as the biomass decreases birch 1948 shiff 1964 in addition the decrease in irradiation and water temperature also has an effect on the decrease in biomass during period 4 in period 5 late november to late january a further decrease in irradiation and water temperature reduces the suitability for sda growth in period 6 late january to late march irradiation is more favorable than period 5 however the water temperature and nutrient conditions are less suitable for sda and the combined result is a decrease in biomass 4 3 3 coscinodiscus wailesii as shown in fig 10 3 period 1 early april to early june was more suitable for cdw in terms of both water temperature and irradiation light conditions than period 8 mid february to late march however nutrient limitation was strict and biomass was thus reduced the strong nutrient limitation was due to the weak vertical mixing and reduced nutrient supply from the benthic and bottom layers of the pelagic system furthermore the weakening of vertical mixing increased the amount of sedimentation of cdw and reduced the biomass present in the photic zone resulting in a decrease in cdw grazing capacity the decrease in biomass in period 2 early june to mid august was the same as that in period 1 in period 3 late august to mid september biomass slightly increased this was because nutrient limitation was weaker although water temperature and light suitability for cdw were lower in period 3 than in period 2 the higher nutrient concentration in period 3 than in period 2 could be attributed to the slight recovery of vertical mixing in addition resting stage cells of the benthic system upwelled to the euphotic zone albeit the small window of opportunity the increase in biomass in period 4 mid september to mid october was due to the active vertical mixing compared with that in period 3 the activation of vertical mixing leads to weak nutrient limitation and the upwelling of resting stage cells from the benthic system to the photic zone as a result the proliferation ability of cdw increased in period 5 mid october to late november the suitability of light was lower than that in period 4 however both water temperature and nutrients were the most suitable for cdw throughout the year at the same time vertical mixing was strong and even cdw having a large cell size could remain in the photic zone in period 6 late november to early january biomass began to decrease this was due to a decrease in the water temperature and irradiation in period 7 mid january to mid february the biomass increased especially around the end of january because of the increased suitability of the light for cdw the rapid decrease in biomass during period 8 mid february to late march was due to the weakening of vertical mixing resulting in reduced nutrient supply from the benthic system and bottom layers of the pelagic system the weakening of vertical mixing increased the sedimentation of large cell sized cdw and reduced the biomass in the photic zone further it reduced the supply of nutrients from nutrient rich seafloor to the photic zone consequently the proliferative ability of cdw was reduced in period 8 4 3 4 eucampia zodiacus the model results for ezl proliferative phase and ezs sporulation phase are shown in fig 10 4 and 10 5 respectively the decrease in ezl during period 1 early april to early june was mainly caused by the increase in sedimentation and nutrient limitation due to the weakening of vertical mixing compared with that in period 7 late january to late march in addition to cdw ezl had difficulty remaining in the photic zone when the vertical mixture was weak in period 2 early june to mid august ezl did not grow due to further weakening of vertical mixing and nutrient limitation compared with those in period 1 regarding ezs the decrease in periods 1 and 2 was due to mortality regarding the increase decrease of both ezl and ezs biomass from period 3 to 5 late august to early december not only light nutrient limitation water temperature and vertical mixing but also the life cycle of e zodiacus represented in this model was important for e zodiacus periods 3 late august to late october and 4 late october to mid november represented the transition from the proliferative cell size 20 μm ezl to sporulation cell size 20 μm ezs phase after transitioning from ezl to ezs it is physiologically impossible for the cells to proliferate without recovering in size from ezs to ezl in periods 4 late october to mid november and 5 mid november to early december some ezs cells increased in size to become proliferative therefore it was difficult for ezl to grow in period 3 late august to late october when the transition from ezl to ezs is progressing conversely ezl slightly increased in period 4 late october to mid november when the transition from ezl to ezs and from ezs to ezl overlapped in period 5 mid november to early december when the transition from ezs to ezl was progressing and there was no transition from ezl to ezs the biomass of ezl rapidly increased not only due to the transition from ezs to ezl but also because of the suitability of water temperature light and nutrients for ezl grazing and the recovery of strong vertical mixing which upwelled ezl and nutrients from the lower zone sediment to the photic zone the increase decrease in ezs from period 3 to 5 can be explained by the transition from ezl to ezs due to the decrease in cell size and the size restoration from ezs to ezl during period 6 early december to late january ezl continued to increase because e zodiacus that has recovered its cell size had suitable water temperature light and nutrients continuously from periods 4 and 5 and the retention in the photic zone due to vertical mixing was ensured in period 7 late january to late march ezl biomass began to decrease because of a decrease in the suitability of the water temperature and an increase in sedimentation to the seafloor due to the weakening of vertical mixing the decrease in ezs during periods 6 and 7 was due to natural mortality this decrease is consistent with the experimental data from nishikawa et al 2007 and 2013 4 4 endogenous mechanism of bloom generation effects of nutrient uptake competition to understand the effect of phytoplankton nutrient uptake competition we analyzed the sensitivity of phytoplankton when the biomass of dfl sda cdw and ez ezl and ezs ezl and ezs were set to zero and compared them to the control case described in sections 4 1 to 4 3 fig 11 shows monthly changes in the biomass bar graphs and nutrient limitation function for growth rate dotted line graphs of one type of phytoplankton when the remaining three types were set to zero these results are the analytical output of the state in which a new annual periodicity was reached after each phytoplankton biomass was set to zero here the increase in the value of nutrient limitation indicates that the nutrient limitation for photosynthesis had weakened refer to appendix b as shown in fig 11 a when sda was set to zero case 2 both dfl biomass and nutrient limitation function increased significantly from june to october with biomass increasing more than eight times and nutrient limitation weakening by more than two times in the peak month however when cdw and ez were set to zero i e in the absence of cdw and ez there was no significant change in biomass or nutrient limitation as shown in fig 11 b neither sda biomass nor nutrient limitation changed significantly in the absence of dfl cdw and ez however sda biomass slightly increased from june to october when dfl was set to zero fig 11 a as shown in fig 11 c cdw biomass tended to increase slightly from may to december in the absence of dfl or sda and from november to april in the absence of ez the nutrient limitation weakened by more than two times in the peak month from june to september in the absence of sda however cdw biomass during this period was originally low and thus the biomass did not increase by much as shown in fig 11 d in the absence of dfl and sda ezl biomass increased slightly during april and may however during the ezl bloom period from december to march ezl biomass did not change in the absence of other phytoplankton nutrient limitation weakened significantly from may to september in the absence of sda however ezl biomass was originally low and did not significantly change during this period the abovementioned results regarding biomass and nutrient limitation of each phytoplankton reflect the superiority or inferiority of nutrient uptake among phytoplankton types nishikawa et al 2009 2010 in the blooms from june to october there was competition between dfl and sda and although dfl blooms were rate controlled by sda sda blooms were almost unaffected by other phytoplankton including dfl this is because the rate of nutrient uptake into the cell quota of sda was higher than that of dfl in other words sda has a higher ability to take up nutrients from the surrounding water and secure them in the cell than dfl in the blooms from november to march the cdw blooms were slightly affected by nutrient competition with ezl from january to march however ezl blooms were not affected by cdw in the model because the rate of nutrient uptake to the cell quota was lower in cdw than ezl the sensitivity analysis indicated that the nutrient uptake competition among phytoplankton types affected the phytoplankton blooms and that there were phytoplankton that were both affected and unaffected by competition 4 5 combination of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of bloom fig 12 summarizes the factors that changed the biomass of phytoplankton and were discussed in sections 4 3 and 4 4 as the first stage of modeling the life cycle of phytoplankton and its participation in the benthic pelagic coupled ecosystem model we demonstrated the mechanisms of phytoplankton blooms with a focus on phytoplankton life cycle nutrient uptake competition and physical drivers such as water temperature light and vertical diffusion consequently phytoplankton blooms could be explained mostly by these mechanisms these results indicated that the trigger of phytoplankton blooms may be partly explained by two hypotheses the triticale depth hypothesis sverdup 1952 and critical turbulence hypothesis are the trigger for phytoplankton blooms huisman et al 1999 regarding subsequent ecosystem transitions zooplankton and benthic fauna grazing likely have an important impact on phytoplankton blooms e g behrenfeld et al 2017 hori et al 2008 smaal and prins 1993 to evaluate this accurately it is necessary to perform sensitivity analysis on changes in the abundance of zooplankton and benthic fauna in the model in addition additional observation data of zooplankton and benthic fauna are required the observation of zooplankton and benthic fauna are now in progress and these data will enable us to estimate zooplankton benthic fauna grazing effect by emagin l p in the future the simulated result of zooplankton in the control case is described in appendix i for the simulated results of benthic fauna refer to fig 8 5 conclusion in this research we developed a new ecosystem model emagin l p to elucidate the mechanisms of phytoplankton bloom and the effects of such blooms on comprehensive nutrient cycles in the benthic pelagic ecosystem the developed model analyzed the bio metabolism processes making up the life cycle of phytoplankton reductional approach individually whereas those in the benthic pelagic systems were analyzed holistic approach simultaneously each metabolism process for four types of phytoplankton dfl sda cdw and ez was newly formulated based on the combined experimental field data and ecological theory application of emagin l p to the harima nada sea where the nutrient concentration decreased due to large diatoms c wailesii and e zodiacus and nori discoloration occurred generally reproduced the observed values of model variables both in the pelagic and benthic systems in particular the model reproduced the seasonal variations in the bloom of each of the four types of phytoplankton the fact that emagin l p grasps the entire ecosystem dynamics because of interactions between biological and chemical processes paradoxically makes it possible to elucidate unknown biological chemical physical processes from the entire ecosystem with the abovementioned advantages of emagin l p the validated model elucidated the mechanisms of phytoplankton blooms based on the simultaneous evaluation of the combination of temperature suitability light availability and nutrient limitation for each phytoplankton as well as the vertical mixing of water columns furthermore the model revealed nutrient uptake competition among the four types of phytoplankton although the newly developed emagin l p is a simplified model of the actual ecosystem and involves some uncertainty the model is a unique tool that provides information hypothesis for elucidating the key processes and relative dominance of the drivers of nutrient cycles as well as predicting estimating the effect of environmental measures we plan to predict and evaluate the effects of nutrient supply from rivers surrounding ocean areas changes in water temperature and changes in biomass of benthic fauna on the phytoplankton blooms and nori discoloration by conducting further sensitivity analyses with corroboration of laboratory experiments and field survey the modeling approach presented here i e categorizing different types of major phytoplankton and incorporating their life cycle into the entire benthic pelagic coupling ecosystem will be an effective method to understand predict manage the problems due to harmful diatom blooms even if the types of the damage the species of harmful diatoms and the ocean areas are different emagin l p has the potential to be a communication platform among scientists in various fields or among scientists and policymakers to promote nutrient management in estuaries funding

24464,understanding recruitment dynamics is an essential part of effective fisheries management whether the focus is on conservation harvest policy development or invasive species control we developed a model that estimates lake wide ricker stock recruitment relations for invasive sea lampreys petromyzon marinus in each of the five laurentian great lakes to inform future control efforts we fit adult to adult models taking advantage of a long time series of lake wide adult sea lamprey abundance estimates we incorporated proportional contributions at age for the stock as well as additional explanatory variables sea lamprey weight as a surrogate for fecundity and lampricide quantity applied as a surrogate for anthropogenic mortality to explain residual recruitment variability the best model incorporated equal cohort contributions from the adult stock that matured 5 6 and 7 years prior to recruitment a single productivity parameter α common to all five lakes lake specific carrying capacity parameters β j and coefficients for sea lamprey weight and lampricide quantity applied the precision of the estimated ricker parameters compared favorably to those estimated by adult to larva models a promising development in the pursuit of sea lamprey recruitment prediction the model should be useful to fisheries managers in the great lakes wishing to consider various recruitment

2005 the sea lamprey is a semelparous anadromous fish native to the north atlantic ocean it spends most of its life as a filter feeding larva burrowed in stream sediment before migrating to the ocean to feed parasitically on other fish as a juvenile in the great lakes the landlocked invasive sea lamprey maintains its migratory behavior entirely in freshwater moser almeida kemp and sorensen 2015 in the spring a single cohort of adults of mixed age migrates up streams to spawn lay eggs and die the eggs hatch and the larvae live in the stream for 3 5 years before metamorphosing and migrating to the lake to feed parasitically on host fish dawson quintella almeida treble and jolley 2015 sea lampreys feed on host fish for 12 20 months as juveniles before maturing and migrating up streams to spawn and die applegate 1950 unlike most anadromous fishes sea lampreys do not return to their natal rivers to spawn waldman grunwald and wirgin 2008 recruitment and its variation require further study to understand general patterns of sea lamprey population dynamics better hansen et al 2016 jones et al 2003 invasive sea lampreys have been the target of control measures in the great lakes since the formation of the great lakes fishery commission in 1955 fetterolf jr 1980 gaden brant and lambe 2021 two primary methods of control have reduced great lakes sea lamprey populations to a

2 barriers that block upstream spawning migration of adults marsden and siefkes 2019 great lakes tributaries that regularly produce sea lampreys are typically treated with lampricide every 3 5 years such that every larval cohort is subjected to treatment prior to outmigration brege et al 2003 knowledge of stock recruitment relations would be particularly helpful in exploring control options that target adult sea lampreys jones 2007 jones and adams 2021 jones et al 2003 for example if population densities are suppressed to levels where recruitment is only weakly density dependent removal of adults from the population becomes a feasible control option sorensen and stacey 2004 in this paper we develop adult to adult stock recruitment relations for great lakes sea lamprey populations and determine how useful those relations might be in future modeling endeavors we strove to answer the following questions 1 how precise are estimated stock recruitment parameters from an adult to adult model compared to an adult to larva model 2 can the stock recruitment relations provide information on the contributions of different ages of stock to sea lamprey spawning recruitment 3 does the inclusion of explanatory variable surrogates for sea lamprey fecundity and anthropogenic mortality improve the model fit 2 historical models previous investigations into sea lamprey stock recruitment relations used ricker models because of an observed decline in larval recruitment at large stock sizes dawson and jones 2009 haeseker et al 2003 jones and adams 2021 jones et al 2003 2015 robinson et

of these stock recruitment studies focused on the population in a single tributary to lake huron the st marys river with larval abundance either age 0 or age 1 as the recruits adult female abundance as the stock and no other explanatory variables haeseker et al 2003 jones et al 2015 robinson et al 2013 this approach is likely the best for investigating larval recruitment in a single stream where information on larval and adult abundance is available two other studies carried out meta analyses across several great lakes tributaries with age 1 larval abundance per hectare of larval habitat as the recruits adult female abundance per hectare of larval habitat as the stock and two explanatory variables stream temperature and alkalinity neither of which significantly affected recruitment dawson and jones 2009 jones et al 2003 standardizing the stock and larval recruits by the area of larval habitat was a clever way to combine stream specific stock recruitment relations in a single model the only shortcoming is that it requires both larval and adult abundance estimates in all the streams variability in the relation was likely kept to a minimum in all five of these studies by using paired stock and recruit data that are fewer than two years apart in time a fraction of the generation length a sixth study fit an adult to adult relation to lake huron sea lampreys with adult abundance as the recruits adult female abundance six years earlier as the stock and two explanatory variables area of larval habitat treated 2 5 years prior to recruitment and mass of adults in which mass significantly affected spawning recruitment young 2005 a seventh study also fit an adult to adult relation across all five great lakes with adult abundance as the recruits adult abundance 5 7 years earlier as the recruits with assumed known proportional contributions and one explanatory variable amount of lampricide applied 2 years prior to recruitment which significantly affected spawning recruitment jones and adams 2021 the advantage of the adult to adult approach for sea lamprey stock recruit relations is its ability to inform other metrics measured on the lake wide scale e g host fish populations the disadvantage is the introduction of variability from the inclusion of several more years of mortality between the stock and spawning recruit estimates unlike larval abundance lake wide indices of adult sea lamprey abundance are estimated on an annual basis in the great lakes adams barber bravener and lewandoski 2021 a if adult to adult stock recruitment models proved informative about sea lamprey population dynamics they would be more broadly useful to sea lamprey researchers and decision makers accounting for different ages at maturation is one challenge of fitting stock recruit models to sea lamprey populations sea lampreys are indeterminate semelparous meaning they spawn once in their life at a variable age botsford and brittnacher 1998 age at maturity is thought to be influenced by the duration of the sedentary larval stage purvis 1979 and the timing spring or autumn of metamorphosis to the parasitic juvenile stage juvenile sea lampreys actively attack and feed off of other fish for approximately 12 months if they metamorphosed in the spring or 18 months if they metamorphosed in the autumn prior to spawning applegate 1950 lamprey ages are widely known to be difficult to measure since structures typically used to age fish scales spines and otoliths are absent and statoliths primitive otoliths have been found to be both imprecise and inaccurate barker morrison wicks and beamish 1997 dawson jones scribner and gilmore 2009 potts dawson and jones 2015 estimates of sea lamprey ages typically depend on the analysis of larval length frequency distributions haeseker et al 2003 potter 1980 two previously derived models of adult to adult stock recruitment for sea lampreys have relied on deterministic inputs of stock age composition young 2005 fit a model to lake huron sea lampreys to evaluate the use of non chemical control options in meeting fish community objectives assuming an age at maturation of 6 years jones and adams 2021 fit models to all five great lakes to calculate the extinction exploitation rate with assumed values for the proportion of mature sea lampreys at age explicit incorporation of sea lamprey stock from different spawning cohorts in the model could improve the fit and provide information on the typical age at maturation additional factors that have been shown to contribute to sea lamprey spawning recruitment variability at the lake wide level include adult sea lamprey mass young 2005 and mortality from lampricide applications jones and adams 2021 young 2005 dawson and jones 2009 found no evidence of a common pattern of variation among years where year could be interpreted as a surrogate for biotic and abiotic factors at the lake scale stream level factors e g quality of spawning and larval habitat dawson and jones 2009 jones et al 2003 cannot be incorporated in stock recruitment models at the lake scale 3 methods we developed lake wide stock recruitment curves for great lakes sea lampreys using the number of spawning adults from one generation to the next as both stock and recruits myers bowen and barrowman 1999 we incorporated proportional contributions from different cohorts of stock and included two additional explanatory variables to explain some of the variability in spawning recruitment several sea lamprey stock recruitment relations were estimated each represented by a single model fit to all five great lakes at once using numbers of adults as both stock and recruits numbers in each lake were based on an annual index of adult abundance obtained as the sum of mark recapture population estimates from a subset of index streams adams et al 2021 a each index was scaled up to a lake wide population estimate by an expansion factor the median of the ratio of lake wide

cohorts k 5 6 and 7 years prior to recruitment we used ricker stock recruitment relations because compensation has been observed by others in great lakes sea lamprey populations haeseker et al 2003 jones et al 2003 2015 the 21 estimated parameters included α j β j π 5 j and π 6 j the proportional contribution from stock 5 and 6 years prior to recruitment and σ 2 the variance of the lognormally distributed error ϵ with mean zero on the natural log scale table 2 the error was assumed independent across years and lakes this parameterization allows for contributions from mixed age classes while limiting the number of parameters estimated the selected stock cohorts reflect the current presumed generation length of sea lampreys in the great lakes corresponding to sea lamprey larval metamorphosis at age 3 5 5 5 years beamish and medland 1988 young 2005 compensation was assumed to occur in the early stages of life jones et al 2003 2015 hence the incorporation of β j with each contribution of the three stock cohorts to recruits two additional explanatory variables were considered for inclusion in the model adult sea lamprey weight and lampricide applied fecundity was represented by adult sea lamprey weight measured as the median individual mass in g of a subset of recaptured adults in each lake and each year sea lamprey fecundity is linearly correlated with sea lamprey mass applegate 1950 manion 1972 vladykov 1951 lampricide quantity applied served as surrogate for anthropogenic mortality and was measured as the three year average of tfm 3 trifluormethyl 4 nitrophenol applegate howell moffett johnson and smith 1961 applied to larvae 2 4 years prior to recruitment to the adult life stage in kg of active ingredient standardization of the explanatory variables was required so that a single coefficient could describe the relation for each across all five great lakes adult sea lamprey weight and lampricide applied were both centered and scaled by first subtracting their lake specific means and then dividing by their lake specific means fig 1 with these effects thus on a common unitless scale a single stock recruitment relation was fit to all five populations at once the resulting coefficients correspond to the expected effect of a change relative to the mean model 2 incorporates fecundity as an additional effect on the productivity of individual stock cohorts fig 2 2 r i j α j k 5 7 π k j s i k j e β j π k j s i k j δ m i k j ϵ i j where m i j is the standardized adult sea lamprey mass for year i and lake j and δ is the

zhao et al 2013 this parameterization allows individual eggs and larvae produced by mothers from different cohorts to have different traits that affect mortality rates shelton munch keith and mangel

average weight and lampricide quantity applied at an average level because when adult sea lamprey weight is at the average for a given lake the additive δ m i j 0 term drops out of the model and when lampricide applied is at the average for a given lake the e γ e i j 1 multiplicative term drops out of the model additional simplified versions of these four models were also considered first great lakes wide rather than lake specific proportions of stock cohorts were fit leading to models 5 8 with two rather than 10 estimated proportions table 3 second stock was assumed to be composed of all three cohorts in equal proportions leading to models 9 12 third great lakes wide α parameters were fit leading to models 13 24 models were fit via maximum likelihood using the optim function of r r

one with the fewest parameters that met the assumption of stationarity with no evidence of time series bias we visually inspected residual plots for evidence of non stationarity trends over time and unexplained patterns related to combined stock or predicted recruitment walters 1986 such visual inspections are widely recommended for validation of model assumptions because they are more informative than hypothesis tests belsley kuh and welsch 2004 campbell thompson guy mcintosh and glaz 2015 hadi and chatterjee 2012 kozak and piepho 2018 we estimated serial autocorrelations with 95 confidence intervals lagged across a time span of 1 7 years autocorrelation of residuals separated by 5 7 years could indicate the presence of time series bias myers and barrowman 1995 4 results lakes

values table 4 lake erie had a much shorter time series only 7 years and lake ontario had a narrower range of stock sizes the total sample size of data from all five great lakes fit to each model was 99 the ranges of sea lamprey weights were 0 113 orders of magnitude for all lakes the ranges of lampricide quantities applied were 0 6 orders of magnitude all five models with substantial support included a parameter for lampricide quantity applied and excluded lake specific age composition but varied with respect to inclusion of lake specific α j a common age composition of adults for all lakes and a parameter for sea lamprey weight table 3 among these model 23 with the fewest parameters 8 was initially defined as best but evidence of temporal trends in its residuals indicated apparent non stationarity thus model 24 with the next fewest parameters 9 was defined as the best model the residuals from model 24 exhibited no significant trends over time or patterns related to combined stock or predicted recruitment supporting our assumption of stationarity the residuals also showed no evidence of autocorrelation that would have suggested the presence of time series bias model 24 included parameters for weight and lampricide a common α parameter for all lakes and assumed contributions of 1 3 each from stock 5 6 and 7 years prior to recruitment fig 3 all eight models with lake specific age composition parameters had essentially no support stock recruitment parameters from model 24 were well estimated for all lakes with confidence interval widths ranging between 0 9 and 2 0 times the estimates table 5 fig 4 estimated β j parameters were similar for lakes superior michigan and ontario lake erie had a significantly greater β j than the three upper lakes and lake ontario had a significantly greater β j than lake huron indicating peak recruitment at lower numbers of combined stock fig 3 the coefficient for sea lamprey weight was poorly estimated with a confidence interval that contained zero and a confidence interval width 3 4 times the estimate table 5 however its inclusion in the model was necessary to meet the assumption of stationarity the δ parameter was positive indicating an increase in recruitment with an increase in sea lamprey weight the coefficient for sea lamprey weight was the only one sensitive to changes in the starting values for the ricker parameters the estimate for δ varied by 15 estimates of other parameters varied by less than 0 1 when different starting values were used the coefficient for lampricide quantity applied was well estimated with a confidence interval width 1 1 times the absolute value of the estimate table 5 the γ parameter was negative indicating a reduction in recruitment with an increase in lampricide

lampreys with relatively precise parameter estimates the best model included a single productivity parameter common to all five lakes a lake specific carrying capacity parameter and parameters for fecundity and anthropogenic mortality the modeling exercise provided some insight on the age composition of mature sea lampreys but proportional contributions of stock at age were not included in the most parsimonious stationary model the stock recruit relations for the great lakes could help inform decision making regarding sea lamprey control efforts the best model model 24 supported a common productivity rate α two models with substantial support included lake specific α j terms suggesting that there may be underlying differences in the maximum annual reproductive rate of lake populations or the relative lampricide quantity applied to them though not enough to overcome variability in the data the estimated α from model 24 was within the range of typical values 1 7 estimated from adult to adult stock recruitment models for 30 different fish species by myers et al 1999 the maximum annual reproductive rate at average lampricide levels 1 91 with 95 confidence interval 1 23 to 2 95 was similar to those estimated by jones and adams 2021 2 43 with 95 credible interval 1 56 to 4 09 for all great lakes and young 2005 for lake huron 3 95 with 95 confidence interval 2 90 to 6 64 the estimated β j parameters reflect the carrying capacity of the population which is expected to vary among stocks hilborn and walters 1992 carrying capacity tended to reflect overall lake productivity as measured by chlorophyll with the highest estimate for lake erie followed by lakes ontario and michigan burlakova et al 2018 the positive β j indicated density dependent survival in all five lakes consistent with previous work haeseker et al 2003 jones et al 2003 young 2005 the most parsimonious model included fixed equal contributions of 1 3 from each of three cohorts of stock three models with substantial support included estimated proportions suggesting that there may be underlying differences in the recruitment at age contributions though not enough to overcome variability in the data knowledge of age at maturation could be used to infer the duration of the larval life stage and thus how many years sea lampreys are susceptible to chemical control in great lakes streams this would aid decision makers in efficiently planning for lampricide applications and improve models that inform those decisions howe marsden donovan and lamberson 2012 jones et al 2009 robinson et al 2013 treble jones and steeves 2008 a younger age at maturation means increased productivity weaver et al 2018 leading to more lake trout wounding and more frequent lampricide treatments of rivers for invasive great lakes populations better understanding of the age structure of mature sea lampreys could also influence the likelihood of their eradication adams et al 2021 b jones and adams 2021 variation in age at maturity conveys similar benefits to a population as iteroparity i e repeat breeding einum and fleming 2007 murphy 1968 botsford and brittnacher 1998 found that probability of extinction for an indeterminate semelparous species was highly negatively correlated with the standard deviation of age at maturity recasting their fig 4 aging sea lampreys is difficult using statoliths or length frequency distributions dawson et al 2015 though recent genetic pedigree analysis of larval sea lampreys sard et al 2020 weise et al 2019 in press may be extensible to adults if sequencing costs decline enough to allow for lake wide sampling scott miehls us geological survey personal communication the best model included a parameter for sea lamprey weight similar to the findings of young 2005 for lake huron young 2005 included weight information dating back to 1959 with a range about three times that of this study which may have given him more power to detect an effect increased recruitment from heavier females suggests that sea lamprey production in the great lakes will continue to increase all other things being equal as a result of global warming because sea lamprey weight is positively correlated with water temperature cline et al 2014 lampricide quantity applied had a significant effect on sea lamprey recruitment in the great lakes further testimony to the effectiveness of chemical control a coefficient for lampricide quantity was included in all five models with substantial support our model suggests that decreasing lampricide from 50 above to 50 below the mean level of tfm applied approximately doubles e γ e 0 7 2 the number of sea lampreys that recruit to the adult stage fig 3 the precision of the sea lamprey stock recruitment parameters estimated from this adult to adult model compared favorably to those previously estimated from adult to larva models this is a promising development in the pursuit of sea lamprey recruitment prediction providing an opportunity to link recruitment to other lake wide metrics and processes the confidence interval width relative to the mean for model 24 s α 0 9 was greater than those of haeseker et al 2003 0 4 and robinson et al 2013 0 8 and less than that of jones et al 2015 1 9 the confidence interval widths relative to the means for model 24 s β j s 1 0 to 2 0 were greater than that of dawson and jones 2009 0 6 similar to that of robinson et al 2013 1 1 and less than that of haeseker et al 2003 3 5 ideally we would have used only adult females as our stock but information on the sex of captured adults was not recorded consistently in many years sex was only recorded for adult sea lampreys that were recaptured and in some years equal numbers of males and females were selected for mark and release rather than rely on recorded sex ratios we used the total estimated population males and females as stock in our models stock recruitment relations are susceptible to bias as a result of measurement error in the stock walters and ludwig 1981 if errors are large enough recruitment may appear to be independent of stock although that did not occur in this study further investigations into the potential effects of measurement error on adult to adult stock recruitment models would be informative while stream mark recapture estimates that go into stock estimates are relatively precise adams jones and bence 2020 there is unknown error associated with the factor used to scale up stream estimates to lake wide populations if the range of stocks is less than 0 6 orders of magnitude as they are for lake ontario sea lampreys in this study biases can be quite severe hilborn and walters 1992 such bias tends to underestimate the response of recruitment to changes in stock our stock recruitment models did not incorporate any depensation or allee effects allee 1941 berec angulo and courchamp 2007 liebhold and bascompte 2003 although all sexually reproducing organisms exhibit some decline in per capita growth at low densities because finding a mate becomes more difficult liebhold and bascompte 2003 depensation is less pronounced in sea lampreys because their pheromone communication system enables them to locate mates over long distances johnson yun thompson brant and li 2009 miehls sullivan twohey and barber 2020 a stock recruitment relation that underestimated recruitment at low stock sizes would be evidence of depensation myers and barrowman 1995 however we have few observations of stock sizes less than 10 of the maximum observed one each in lakes superior and erie and none less than the 5 recommended to detect depensation perälä and kuparinen 2017 observed recruitment at the lowest observed stock size in lakes superior and erie was above that predicted by the model fig 3 pulses in the prevalence of small and large adult sea lampreys appeared to be synchronized across the great lakes with the exception of lake erie fig 1 excluding erie between lake correlations of sea lamprey weight ranged from 0 27 superior and huron to 0 83 superior and ontario this apparent synchrony suggests that broader environmental or climatic changes that span the great lakes influence sea lamprey weight similar conclusions have been found for recruitment dynamics in great lakes fishes varying with water temperature wind speed and the north atlantic oscillation bunnell et al 2017 myers et al 2015 other studies of fish species outside of the great lakes have shown synchronicity in fish growth black 2009 jensen et al 2011 tao kennard jia and chen 2018 we believe this sea lamprey stock recruitment model could be useful to fisheries managers in the laurentian great lakes and possibly to other systems with invasive sea lampreys e g lake champlain in new york vermont and quebec it may enable data driven modeling to help advance sea lamprey trapping operations from an assessment tool to a control method miehls et al 2020 jones and adams 2021 have already used such a relation to investigate the possibility of sea lamprey eradication from the great lakes by calculating the extinction exploitation rate i e the lowest exploitation rate that will eventually result in the population declining to zero it could be used to inform various recruitment overfishing strategies in the control of invasive sea lampreys adult to adult stock recruitment relations are particularly advantageous to the sea lamprey control program on the great lakes because of readily available annual estimates of lake wide adult abundance attempts to model the population dynamics of invasive species are often met with challenges of data sparsity estimates of abundance may be limited temporally spatially as well as ontogenically models built on a single life stage provide a direct empirical estimate of the carrying capacity but they require the assumption that no bias is introduced by not quantifying the survival at each transitional life stage mueller 1986 this study reaffirms that even population growth models built on a single life stage can inform our understanding of ecological interactions and

24464,understanding recruitment dynamics is an essential part of effective fisheries management whether the focus is on conservation harvest policy development or invasive species control we developed a model that estimates lake wide ricker stock recruitment relations for invasive sea lampreys petromyzon marinus in each of the five laurentian great lakes to inform future control efforts we fit adult to adult models taking advantage of a long time series of lake wide adult sea lamprey abundance estimates we incorporated proportional contributions at age for the stock as well as additional explanatory variables sea lamprey weight as a surrogate for fecundity and lampricide quantity applied as a surrogate for anthropogenic mortality to explain residual recruitment variability the best model incorporated equal cohort contributions from the adult stock that matured 5 6 and 7 years prior to recruitment a single productivity parameter α common to all five lakes lake specific carrying

2005 the sea lamprey is a semelparous anadromous fish native to the north atlantic ocean it spends most of its life as a filter feeding larva burrowed in stream sediment before migrating to the ocean to feed parasitically on other fish as a juvenile in the great lakes the landlocked invasive sea lamprey maintains its migratory behavior entirely in freshwater moser almeida kemp and sorensen 2015 in the spring a single cohort of adults of mixed age migrates up streams to spawn lay eggs and die the eggs hatch and the larvae live in the stream for 3 5 years before metamorphosing and migrating to the lake to feed parasitically on host fish dawson quintella almeida treble and jolley 2015 sea lampreys feed on host fish for 12 20 months as juveniles before maturing and migrating up streams to spawn and die applegate 1950 unlike most anadromous fishes sea lampreys do not return to their natal rivers to spawn waldman grunwald and wirgin 2008 recruitment and its variation require further study to understand general patterns of sea lamprey population dynamics better hansen et al 2016 jones et al 2003 invasive sea lampreys have been the target of control measures in the great lakes since the formation of the great lakes fishery commission in 1955 fetterolf jr 1980 gaden brant and lambe 2021 two primary methods of control have reduced great lakes sea lamprey populations to a fraction of their post invasion peaks heinrich et al 2003 lawrie 1970 robinson miehls and siefkes 2021 1 lampricides that kill larvae during their first years of life burrowed in stream sediments and 2 barriers that block upstream spawning migration of adults marsden and siefkes 2019 great lakes tributaries that regularly produce sea lampreys are typically treated with lampricide every 3 5 years such that every larval cohort is subjected to treatment prior to outmigration brege et al 2003 knowledge of stock recruitment relations would be particularly helpful in exploring control options that target adult sea lampreys jones 2007 jones and adams 2021 jones et al 2003 for example if population densities are suppressed to levels where recruitment is only weakly density dependent removal of adults from the population becomes a feasible control option sorensen and stacey 2004 in this paper we develop adult to adult stock recruitment relations for great lakes sea lamprey populations and determine how useful those relations might be in future modeling endeavors we strove to answer the following questions 1 how precise are estimated stock recruitment parameters from an adult to adult model compared to an adult to larva model 2 can the stock recruitment relations provide information on the contributions of different ages of stock to sea lamprey spawning recruitment 3 does the inclusion of explanatory variable surrogates for sea lamprey fecundity and anthropogenic mortality improve the model fit 2 historical models previous investigations into sea lamprey stock recruitment relations used ricker models because of an observed decline in larval recruitment at large stock sizes dawson and jones 2009 haeseker et al 2003 jones and adams 2021 jones et al 2003 2015 robinson et

carcass nutrients weaver coghlan and zydlewski 2018 genetic sea lamprey control options thresher jones and drake 2019 and levels of control needed to eradicate sea lampreys jones and adams 2021 three of these stock recruitment studies focused on the population in a single tributary to lake huron the st marys river with larval abundance either age 0 or age 1 as the recruits adult female abundance as the stock and no other explanatory variables haeseker et al 2003 jones et al 2015 robinson et al 2013 this approach is likely the best for investigating larval recruitment in a single stream where information on larval and adult abundance is available two other studies carried out meta analyses across several great lakes tributaries with age 1 larval abundance per hectare of larval habitat as the recruits adult female abundance per hectare of larval habitat as the stock and two explanatory variables stream temperature and alkalinity neither of which significantly affected recruitment dawson and jones 2009 jones et al 2003 standardizing the stock and larval recruits by the area of larval habitat was a clever way to combine stream specific stock recruitment relations in a single model the only shortcoming is that it requires both larval and adult abundance estimates in all the streams variability in the relation was likely kept to a minimum in all five of these studies by using paired stock and recruit data that are fewer than two years apart in time a fraction of the generation length a sixth study fit an adult to adult relation to lake huron sea lampreys with adult abundance as the recruits adult female abundance six years earlier as the stock and two explanatory variables area of larval habitat treated 2 5 years prior to recruitment and mass of adults in which mass significantly affected spawning recruitment young 2005 a seventh study also fit an adult to adult relation across all five great lakes with adult abundance as the recruits adult abundance 5 7 years earlier as the recruits with assumed known proportional contributions and one explanatory variable amount of lampricide applied 2 years prior to recruitment which significantly affected spawning recruitment jones and adams 2021 the advantage of the adult to adult approach for sea lamprey stock recruit relations is its ability to inform other metrics measured on the lake wide scale e g host fish populations the disadvantage is the introduction of variability from the inclusion of several more years of mortality between the stock and spawning recruit estimates unlike larval abundance lake wide indices of adult sea lamprey abundance are estimated on an annual basis in the great lakes adams barber bravener and lewandoski 2021 a if adult to adult stock recruitment models proved informative about sea lamprey population dynamics they would be more broadly useful to sea lamprey researchers and decision makers accounting for different ages at maturation is one challenge of fitting stock recruit models to sea lamprey populations sea lampreys are indeterminate semelparous meaning they spawn once in their life at a variable age botsford and brittnacher 1998 age at maturity is thought to be influenced by the duration of the sedentary larval stage purvis 1979 and the timing spring or autumn of metamorphosis to the parasitic juvenile stage juvenile sea lampreys actively attack and feed off of other fish for approximately 12 months if they metamorphosed in the spring or 18 months if they metamorphosed in the autumn prior to spawning applegate 1950 lamprey ages are widely known to be difficult to measure since structures typically used to age fish scales spines and otoliths are absent and statoliths primitive otoliths have been found to be both imprecise and inaccurate barker morrison wicks and beamish 1997 dawson jones scribner and gilmore 2009 potts dawson and jones 2015 estimates of sea lamprey ages typically depend on the analysis of larval length frequency distributions haeseker et al 2003 potter 1980 two previously derived models of adult to adult stock recruitment for sea lampreys have relied on deterministic inputs of stock age composition young 2005 fit a model to lake huron sea lampreys to evaluate the use of non chemical control options in meeting fish community objectives assuming an age at maturation of 6 years jones and adams 2021 fit models to all five great lakes to calculate the extinction exploitation rate with assumed values for the proportion of mature sea lampreys at age explicit incorporation of sea lamprey stock from different spawning cohorts in the model could improve the fit and provide information on the typical age at maturation additional factors that have been shown to contribute to sea lamprey spawning recruitment variability at the lake wide level include adult sea lamprey mass young 2005 and mortality from lampricide applications jones and adams 2021 young 2005 dawson and jones 2009 found no evidence of a common pattern of variation among years where year could be interpreted as a surrogate for biotic and abiotic factors at the lake scale stream level factors e g quality of spawning and larval habitat dawson and jones 2009 jones et al 2003 cannot be incorporated in stock recruitment models at the lake scale 3 methods we developed lake wide stock recruitment curves for great lakes sea lampreys using the number of spawning adults from one generation to the next as both stock and recruits myers bowen and barrowman 1999 we incorporated proportional contributions from different cohorts of stock and included two additional explanatory variables to explain some of the variability in spawning recruitment several sea lamprey stock recruitment relations were estimated each represented by a single model fit to all five great lakes at once using numbers of adults as both stock and recruits numbers in each lake were based on an annual index of adult abundance obtained as the sum of mark recapture population estimates from a subset of index streams adams et al 2021 a each index was scaled up to a lake wide population estimate by an expansion factor the median of the ratio of lake wide population estimates from the mullett model mullett et al 2003 to the adult index table 1 supplemental table s1 a ricker stock recruitment curve was fit ricker 1975 1 r i j α j k 5 7 π k j s i k j e β

cohorts k 5 6 and 7 years prior to recruitment we used ricker stock recruitment relations because compensation has been observed by others in great lakes sea lamprey populations haeseker et al 2003 jones et al 2003 2015 the 21 estimated parameters included α j β j π 5 j and π 6 j the proportional contribution from stock 5 and 6 years prior to recruitment and σ 2 the variance of the lognormally distributed error ϵ with mean zero on the natural log scale table 2 the error was assumed independent across years and lakes this parameterization allows for contributions from mixed age classes while limiting the number of parameters estimated the selected stock cohorts reflect the current presumed generation length of sea lampreys in the great lakes corresponding to sea lamprey larval metamorphosis at age 3 5 5 5 years beamish and medland 1988 young 2005 compensation was assumed to occur in the early stages of life jones et al 2003 2015 hence the incorporation of β j with each contribution of the three stock cohorts to recruits two additional explanatory variables were considered for inclusion in the model adult sea lamprey weight and lampricide applied fecundity was represented by adult sea lamprey weight measured as the median individual mass in g of a subset of recaptured adults in each lake and each year sea lamprey fecundity is linearly correlated with sea lamprey mass applegate 1950 manion 1972 vladykov 1951 lampricide quantity applied served as surrogate for anthropogenic mortality and was measured as the three year average of tfm 3 trifluormethyl 4 nitrophenol applegate howell moffett johnson and smith 1961 applied to larvae 2 4 years prior to recruitment to the adult life stage in kg of active ingredient standardization of the explanatory variables was required so that a single coefficient could describe the relation for each across all five great lakes adult sea lamprey weight and lampricide applied were both centered and scaled by first subtracting their lake specific means and then dividing by their lake specific means fig 1 with these effects thus on a common unitless scale a single stock recruitment relation was fit to all five populations at once the resulting coefficients correspond to the expected effect of a change relative to the mean model 2 incorporates fecundity as an additional effect on the productivity of individual stock cohorts fig 2 2 r i j α j k 5 7 π k j s i k j e β j π k j s i k j δ m i k j ϵ i j where m i j is the standardized adult sea lamprey mass for year i and lake j and δ is the

zhao et al 2013 this parameterization allows individual eggs and larvae produced by mothers from different cohorts to have different traits that affect mortality rates shelton munch keith and mangel

δ m i k j ϵ i j and has the most estimated parameters 24 of any model we fit other model parameters α j π k j and β j are characteristic of the stock recruitment model for adult sea lampreys of an average weight and lampricide quantity applied at an average level because when adult sea lamprey weight is at the average for a given lake the additive δ m i j 0 term drops out of the model and when lampricide applied is at the average for a given lake the e γ e i j 1 multiplicative term drops out of the model additional simplified versions of these four models were also considered first great lakes wide rather than lake specific proportions of stock cohorts were fit leading to models 5 8 with two rather than 10 estimated proportions table 3 second stock was assumed to be composed of all three cohorts in equal proportions leading to models 9 12 third great lakes wide α parameters were fit leading to models 13 24 models were fit via maximum likelihood using the optim function of r r core team 2018 and results were collected using the tidyverse wickham et al 2019 and rlist ren 2016 packages supplemental text s2 starting values for the α j s 2 and β j s 0 08 were selected as the median of the estimated coefficients rounded to one significant digit from 15 separate regressions fit to each lake and stock cohort using the linearized form of the ricker stock recruitment relation

one with the fewest parameters that met the assumption of stationarity with no evidence of time series bias we visually inspected residual plots for evidence of non stationarity trends over time and unexplained patterns related to combined stock or predicted recruitment walters 1986 such visual inspections are widely recommended for validation of model assumptions because they are more informative than hypothesis tests belsley kuh and welsch 2004 campbell thompson guy mcintosh and glaz 2015 hadi and chatterjee 2012 kozak and piepho 2018 we estimated serial autocorrelations with 95 confidence intervals lagged across a time span of 1 7 years autocorrelation of residuals separated by 5 7 years could indicate the presence of time series bias myers and barrowman 1995 4 results lakes superior michigan and huron had time series of at least 18 years and ranges of stock sizes 0 7 orders of magnitude i e the common logarithm base 10 of the ratio of the maximum to minimum observed values table 4 lake erie had a much shorter time series only 7 years and lake ontario had a narrower range of stock sizes the total sample size of data from all five great lakes fit to each model was 99 the ranges of sea lamprey weights were 0 113 orders of magnitude for all lakes the ranges of lampricide quantities applied were 0 6 orders of magnitude all five models with substantial support included a parameter for lampricide quantity applied and excluded lake specific age composition but varied with respect to inclusion of lake specific α j a common age composition of adults for all lakes and a parameter for sea lamprey weight table 3 among these model 23 with the fewest parameters 8 was initially defined as best but evidence of temporal trends in its residuals indicated apparent non stationarity thus model 24 with the next fewest parameters 9 was defined as the best model the residuals from model 24 exhibited no significant trends over time or patterns related to combined stock or predicted recruitment supporting our assumption of stationarity the residuals also showed no evidence of autocorrelation that would have suggested the presence of time series bias model 24 included parameters for weight and lampricide a common α parameter for all lakes and assumed contributions of 1 3 each from stock 5 6 and 7 years prior to recruitment fig 3 all eight models with lake specific age composition parameters had essentially no support stock recruitment parameters from model 24 were well estimated for all lakes with confidence interval widths ranging between 0 9 and 2 0 times the estimates table 5 fig 4 estimated β j parameters were similar for lakes superior michigan and ontario lake erie had a significantly greater β j than the three upper lakes and lake ontario had a significantly greater β j than lake huron indicating peak recruitment at lower numbers of combined stock fig 3 the coefficient for sea lamprey weight was poorly estimated with a confidence interval that contained zero and a confidence interval width 3 4 times the estimate table 5 however its inclusion in the model was necessary to meet the assumption of stationarity the δ parameter was positive indicating an increase in recruitment with an increase in sea lamprey weight the coefficient for sea lamprey weight was the only one sensitive to changes in the starting values for the ricker parameters the estimate for δ varied by 15 estimates of other parameters varied by less than 0 1 when different starting values were used the coefficient for lampricide quantity applied was well estimated with a confidence interval width 1 1 times the absolute value of the estimate table 5 the γ parameter was negative indicating a reduction in recruitment with an increase in lampricide quantity applied for example doubling the mean lampricide quantity applied e 1 results in about a 50 reduction in predicted recruitment e γ e e 0 7 1 0 5 with a 95 confidence interval of 34 to 72 table 5 fig 3 other models with substantial support included parameters that were not included in the most parsimonious and stationary model models 7 and 8 included lake specific α j terms lake erie had the highest estimated α j 7 2 and 7 1 for models 7 and 8 respectively lake michigan the lowest 0 8 and 0 9 and the other lakes had middling estimates ranging from 1 6 to 2 2 models 7 8 and 19 included terms for the proportional contribution of stock cohorts 5 and 6 years prior to recruitment estimates from these three models ranged from 0 35 to 0 89 for π 5 and 0 11 to 0 65 for π 6 consistently estimating the contribution from stock 7 years prior to recruitment 1 π 5 π 6 as 0 01 5 discussion we successfully developed adult to adult stock recruitment relations for great lakes sea lampreys with relatively precise parameter estimates the best model included a single productivity parameter common to all five lakes a lake specific carrying capacity parameter and parameters for fecundity and anthropogenic mortality the modeling exercise provided some insight on the age composition of mature sea lampreys but proportional contributions of stock at age were not included in the most parsimonious stationary model the stock recruit relations for the great lakes could help inform decision making regarding sea lamprey control efforts the best model model 24 supported a common productivity rate α two models with substantial support included lake specific α j terms suggesting that there may be underlying differences in the maximum annual reproductive rate of lake populations or the relative lampricide quantity applied to them though not enough to overcome variability in the data the estimated α from model 24 was within the range of typical values 1 7 estimated from adult to adult stock recruitment models for 30 different fish species by myers et al 1999 the maximum annual reproductive rate at average lampricide levels 1 91 with 95 confidence interval 1 23 to 2 95 was similar to those estimated by jones and adams 2021 2 43 with 95 credible interval 1 56 to 4 09 for all great lakes and young 2005 for lake huron 3 95 with 95 confidence interval 2 90 to 6 64 the estimated β j parameters reflect the carrying capacity of the population which is expected to vary among stocks hilborn and walters 1992 carrying capacity tended to reflect overall lake productivity as measured by chlorophyll with the highest estimate for lake erie followed by lakes ontario and michigan burlakova et al 2018 the positive β j indicated density dependent survival in all five lakes consistent with previous work haeseker et al 2003 jones et al 2003 young 2005 the most parsimonious model included fixed equal contributions of 1 3 from each of three cohorts of stock three models with substantial support included estimated proportions suggesting that there may be underlying differences in the recruitment at age contributions though not enough to overcome variability in the data knowledge of age at maturation could be used to infer the duration of the larval life stage and thus how many years sea lampreys are susceptible to chemical control in great lakes streams this would aid decision makers in efficiently planning for lampricide applications and improve models that inform those decisions howe marsden donovan and lamberson 2012 jones et al 2009 robinson et al 2013 treble jones and steeves 2008 a younger age at maturation means increased productivity weaver et al 2018 leading to more lake trout wounding and more frequent lampricide treatments of rivers for invasive great lakes populations better understanding of the age structure of mature sea lampreys could also influence the likelihood of their eradication adams et al 2021 b jones and adams 2021 variation in age at maturity conveys similar benefits to a population as iteroparity i e repeat breeding einum and fleming 2007 murphy 1968 botsford and brittnacher 1998 found that probability of extinction for an indeterminate semelparous species was highly negatively correlated with the standard deviation of age at maturity recasting their fig 4 aging sea lampreys is difficult using statoliths or length frequency distributions dawson et al 2015 though recent genetic pedigree analysis of larval sea lampreys sard et al 2020 weise et al 2019 in press may be extensible to adults if sequencing costs decline enough to allow for lake wide sampling scott miehls us geological survey personal communication the best model included a parameter for sea lamprey weight similar to the findings of young 2005 for lake huron young 2005 included weight information dating back to 1959 with a range about three times that of this study which may have given him more power to detect an effect increased recruitment from heavier females suggests that sea lamprey production in the great lakes will continue to increase all other things being equal as a result of global warming because sea lamprey weight is positively correlated with water temperature cline et al 2014 lampricide quantity applied had a significant effect on sea lamprey recruitment in the great lakes further testimony to the effectiveness of chemical control a coefficient for lampricide quantity was included in all five models with substantial support our model suggests that decreasing lampricide from 50 above to 50 below the mean level of tfm applied approximately doubles e γ e 0 7 2 the number of sea lampreys that recruit to the adult stage fig 3 the precision of the sea lamprey stock recruitment parameters estimated from this adult to adult model compared favorably to those previously estimated from adult to larva models this is a promising development in the pursuit of sea lamprey recruitment prediction providing an opportunity to link recruitment to other lake wide metrics and processes the confidence interval width relative to the mean for model 24 s α 0 9 was greater than those of haeseker et al 2003 0 4 and robinson et al 2013 0 8 and less than that of jones et al 2015 1 9 the confidence interval widths relative to the means for model 24 s β j s 1 0 to 2 0 were greater than that of dawson and jones 2009 0 6 similar to that of robinson et al 2013 1 1 and less than that of haeseker et al 2003 3 5 ideally we would have used only adult females as our stock but information on the sex of captured adults was not recorded consistently in many years sex was only recorded for adult sea lampreys that were recaptured and in some years equal numbers of males and females were selected for mark and release rather than rely on recorded sex ratios we used the total estimated population males and females as stock in our models stock recruitment relations are susceptible to bias as a result of measurement error in the stock walters and ludwig 1981 if errors are large enough recruitment may appear to be independent of stock although that did not occur in this study further investigations into the potential effects of measurement error on adult to adult stock recruitment models would be informative while stream mark recapture estimates that go into stock estimates are relatively precise adams jones and bence 2020 there is unknown error associated with the factor used to scale up stream estimates to lake wide populations if the range of stocks is less than 0 6 orders of magnitude as they are for lake ontario sea lampreys in this study biases can be quite severe hilborn and walters 1992 such bias tends to underestimate the response of recruitment to changes in stock our stock recruitment models did not incorporate any depensation or allee effects allee 1941 berec angulo and courchamp 2007 liebhold and bascompte 2003 although all sexually reproducing organisms exhibit some decline in per capita growth at low densities because finding a mate becomes more difficult liebhold and bascompte 2003 depensation is less pronounced in sea lampreys because their pheromone communication system enables them to locate mates over long distances johnson yun thompson brant and li 2009 miehls sullivan twohey and barber 2020 a stock recruitment relation that underestimated recruitment at low stock sizes would be evidence of depensation myers and barrowman 1995 however we have few observations of stock sizes less than 10 of the maximum observed one each in lakes superior and erie and none less than the 5 recommended to detect depensation perälä and kuparinen 2017 observed recruitment at the lowest observed stock size in lakes superior and erie was above that predicted by the model fig 3 pulses in the prevalence of small and large adult sea lampreys appeared to be synchronized across the great lakes with the exception of lake erie fig 1 excluding erie between lake correlations of sea lamprey weight ranged from 0 27 superior and huron to 0 83 superior and ontario this apparent synchrony suggests that broader environmental or climatic changes that span the great lakes influence sea lamprey weight similar conclusions have been found for recruitment dynamics in great lakes fishes varying with water temperature wind speed and the north atlantic oscillation bunnell et al 2017 myers et al 2015 other studies of fish species outside of the great lakes have shown synchronicity in fish growth black 2009 jensen et al 2011 tao kennard jia and chen 2018 we believe this sea lamprey stock recruitment model could be useful to fisheries managers in the laurentian great lakes and possibly to other systems with invasive sea lampreys e g lake champlain in new york vermont and quebec it may enable data driven modeling to help advance sea lamprey trapping operations from an assessment tool to a control method miehls et al 2020 jones and adams 2021 have already used such a relation to investigate the possibility of sea lamprey eradication from the great lakes by calculating the extinction exploitation rate i e the lowest exploitation rate that will eventually result in the population declining to zero it could be used to inform various recruitment overfishing strategies in the control of invasive sea lampreys adult to adult stock recruitment relations are particularly advantageous to the sea lamprey control program on the great lakes because of readily available annual estimates of lake wide adult abundance attempts to model the population dynamics of invasive species are often met with challenges of data sparsity estimates of abundance may be limited temporally spatially as well as ontogenically models built on a single life stage provide a direct empirical estimate of the carrying capacity but they require the assumption that no bias is introduced by not quantifying the survival at each transitional life stage mueller 1986 this study reaffirms that even population growth models built on a single life stage can inform our understanding of ecological interactions and
