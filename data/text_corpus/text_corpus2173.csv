10865,aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller is one of the most important medicinal plants with high resistance to drought whose tolerability can be promoted using biofertilizers the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of biofertilizers on some physiological traits and leaf fresh weight of aloe vera under different irrigation regimes the experiments were conducted in a research field in iran boushehr with warm and dry climate during 2016 2018 irrigation treatments included 25 50 75 and 100 of water requirement and the applied biofertilizers treatments were mycorrhizal fungi mf glomus mosae phosphate solubilizing bacteria psb including pseudomonas putida strain p13 and pantoea agglomerans strain p5 mf psb and control without any biofertilizers the results of three harvests showed advantages of biofertilizers specially the combination of mf and psb utilization on all determined factors such as total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents leaf proline and soluble sugar amount the highest yield was obtained in full irrigation but due to the absence of significant difference in leaf fresh weight of this treatment with 50 irrigation as well as the water deficit in boushehr located in semi arid region 50 irrigation and combination of mf and psb biofertilizers is recommended therefore aloe vera is an acceptable option for planting in boushehr province according to its scant water consumption keywords aloe vera biofertilizer chlorophyll irrigation regime leaf fresh weight proline 1 introduction aloe vera l aloe barbadensis miller is a fleshy perennial plant belonging to xanthorrhoeaceae family that is cultivated in warm and dry regions of the world hazrati et al 2017 kumar et al 2017c aloe vera has commercial value because of its medical nutritional and cosmetic uses delatorre herrera et al 2010 hamman 2008 ni et al 2004 yagi and takeo 2003 nowadays water scarcity is one of the most important problems for crop production throughout the world this problem reduces crop growth and yield seriously al busaidi et al 2011 hazrati et al 2017 biomass production in plants depends on the availability of water especially in arid and semiarid ecosystems therefore in these regions it is better to cultivate the drought resistant plants aloe vera aloe barbadensis m is a perennial plant with crassulacean acid metabolism cam which enables it to tolerate water stress conditions silva et al 2010 kumar et al 2017a demonstrated that aloe vera can be a possible source of new natural antioxidant compounds and different agro climatic conditions have various influences on aloe vera phytochemicals total phenolic content and antioxidant potential also it has been reported that colder climatic regions showed superior antiplasmodial activity and higher amount of aloin and aloe emodin in comparison to warmer climatic locations kumar et al 2017b water stress can harm plants and lead to low biomass production and yield this factor affects photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters directly or indirectly drought stress increases chlorophyll degradation in aloe vera plants chlorophyll concentration is changed with environmental fluctuations hazrati et al 2016 some pigments such as carotenoids have been known as plant cell protectors under stressful situation hormaetxe et al 2005 several studies have shown that carotenoids are highly important in protecting the photosynthesis apparatus against photo damage by inter conversions among the xanthophyll molecules sheshbahreh et al 2019 chlorophyll fluorescence measurement can be applied as a useful approach to determine photosynthetic damage due to environmental stresses the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules can be directed in three ways energizing photosynthesis dissipation as heat and remission as fluorescence there are several mechanisms to disperse extra energy like heat or fluorescence under stressful conditions hazrati et al 2016 under the water stress condition cam plants can produce compatible metabolites such as sugars and proline which is known as osmolytes that allow these plants to perform the osmotic adjustment minjares fuentes et al 2017 membrane damage in water stressed plants is generally assessed based on the malondialdehyde mda content pravisya et al 2019 mda content increases in the leaves of plants under stress conditions it shows that reactive oxygen species ros production causes oxidative stress leading to membrane damage due to lipid peroxidation kordrostami et al 2017 jin et al 2007 reported that lipid membranes peroxidation is because of free radical damage as a result of stressful situations influence at the cellular level biofertilizers can be used to refine the harmful effects of water stress mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr are two biofertilizers that can improve plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses pandey and banik 2009 vurukonda et al 2016 mycorrhizal fungi are microorganisms able to establish a symbiotic association with the roots of most plants host plants have a promoted ability for nutrient uptake and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses cardarelli et al 2010 colla et al 2008 rouphael et al 2010 many plant species in liliaceae family to which aloes belong are known to be mycorrhizal dependent cardarelli et al 2010 tawaraya 2003 among mycorrhizal fungi species glomus mossae is the best known species for association with aloe roots most of the mycorrhizal fungi inoculations result in an increase in plant dry biomass of aloe vera pandey and banik 2009 al karaki et al 2004 reported that mycorrhizal plants have more tolerance to drought condition compared to non mycorrhizal ones because of better uptake ability of nutrients such as phosphorous zinc and copper in addition changes in leaf elasticity leaf water content and turgor potential promotion keeping stomata opening and transpiration increasing the length and depth of the root and hyphae expanding can improve plant tolerance to water deficit the rhizosphere bacteria that promote plant growth directly or indirectly are called plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb asghar et al 2002 pgpbs can improve plant growth by nitrogen fixation insoluble phosphates solubilization and ferro providence and increase the solubility of mineral phosphate by microbial siderophore production a phyto hormones formation e g auxines cytokinins and gibberellins and ethylene reduction pravisya et al 2019 vurukonda et al 2016 pgpbs can improve plant tolerance to a stressful situation by root system expanding increasing the water reservation capacity and promoting the gene expression that is responsible for plant tolerance in face of stresses ortiz et al 2015 some pgpbs are known as mycorrhizal helper bacteria mhb mhbs can affect mycorrhizal fungi ability by the effect on root cells permeability root leakage fungi entrance simplification to the roots of host plants phyto hormones production modification the negative effects of the environment on hyphae growth and root hair growth stimulation otroshy et al 2015 among pgpbs phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb that mostly belong to bacillus pseudomonas and pantoea genera improve phosphorus availability by organic acids exudation and production of phosphatase enzymes that are responsible for inorganic phosphorus solubilization and changing the organic phosphorus to inorganic form respectively as a result they improve phosphorus nutrient of plants khan et al 2009 regarding the previous studies it is clear that biofertilizers have many benefits for plant growth especially in a stressful situation the present research was conducted in boushehr province one of the most arid regions in iran fig 1 on aloe vera plant which is a drought tolerant cam plant the aim of this research is to investigate some physiological traits i e leaf chlorophyll contents and fluorescence carotenoids proline soluble sugar soluble proteins and mda in aloe vera leaves beside leaf fresh weight using two strains of psbs pseudomonas putida and pantoea agglomerans and mycorrhizal fungi as biofertilizers under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments a field split plot experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications in boushehr province of iran 50 12 e and 29 16 n 8 40 m above sea level the mean annual temperature and precipitation in the region are 26 38 and 34 21 mm respectively table 1 shows the chemical and physical properties of the soil from the depth of 0 30 cm an offshoot planting was done in october 2016 the main factor included irrigation regimes at four levels 25 50 75 and 100 of water requirement penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the sub factor included biofertilizers at four levels including supplying mycorrhizal fungi mf glomus mosae phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb pseudomonas putida strain p13 and pantoea agglomerans strain p5 mf psb and control without any biofertilizers irrigation treatments started when the plantlets established well inoculation of biofertilizers was done during planting each experimental plot consisted of five 3 m long rows at 60 cm distance from each other and 50 cm distance between the plants within rows the distances between the main plots sub plots and blocks were 2 4 1 2 and 2 m respectively three harvests were performed in june 2017 december 2017 and june 2018 in each stage five plants per treatment were selected randomly and four leaves per plant were harvested hazrati et al 2012 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 leaf chlorophylls carotenoids contents and fluorescence determination of chlorophylls and carotenoids contents was done according to the method of arnon 1949 at first 1 g fresh leaf samples were ground with 10 ml of 80 acetone and 0 5 g calcium carbonate powder after centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c 1 ml of solution was poured into a tuber with 9 ml of 80 acetone and the absorbance of solution was read at 645 663 and 470 nm with a spectrophotometer hazrati et al 2012 these amounts were calculated by following formula and expressed as mg per g leaf fresh weight c h o l o p h y l l a c h l a 12 7 o d 663 2 69 o d 645 v 1000 w c h l o r o p h y l l b c h l b 22 9 o d 645 4 68 o d 663 v 1000 w t o t a l c h o r o p h

solution volume and leaf fresh weight of samples respectively chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured using a portable photosynthesis meter handy pea the uk parameters were assessed in 20 min dark adapted leaves this measurement was done in the morning 2 2 2 leaf proline and soluble sugars content proline content was estimated by following the method of murillo amador et al 2014 in accordance with this method leaf fresh samples were extracted in sulphosalicylic acid after adding glacial acetic acid and ninhydrin boiling cooling and adding toluene proline concentration was measured by spectrophotometer at 520 nm using calibration curve and expressed as mg proline per g fresh weight of leaf total soluble sugar tss was determined using the method of jin et al 2007 tss was measured by adding freshly prepared anthrone 150 mg anthrone 100 ml 72 h2so4 to the alcoholic extract after boiling water bath for 10 min and cooling tss concentration was determined at 625 nm using a spectrophotometer and sucrose as a standard it is expressed as mg tss per gr fresh weight of leaf 2 2 3 leaf protein and malondialdehyde mda content to determine the contents of soluble proteins the method of bradford 1976 was used leaf samples were extracted in buffer phosphate 0 1 m and ph 6 8 after centrifuging soluble protein content was determined using the reagent coomassie brilliant blue g 250 followed by absorbance readings at 595 nm using bovine serum albumin as standard this content is expressed as mg soluble protein per fresh weight of leaf mda was determined based on the method proposed by heath and packer 1968 samples were extracted in trichloroacetic acid 0 1 tca and thiobarbituric acid 0 5 tba afterward mda content was measured by spectrophotometer at 532 nm and 600 nm and expressed as nm per g leaf fresh weight 2 2 4 leaf fresh weight five plants from each plot were selected and four leaves from each plant were harvested hazrati et al 2012 after cutting the leaves at the base they were weighed by the digital scale and leaf fresh weight was registered finally it was expressed as kg per hectare using the average number of leaves 2 3 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using the glm procedure in sas 9 1 software comparison of means was performed using the lsd at a p value of 5 graphs were also drawn using the excel software 3 results the effects of irrigation regimes and biofertilizers on chlorophyll a content were statistically significant in all three harvests table 2 the increasing intensity of water stress caused a decrease in chlorophyll contents the highest chlorophyll a content was observed when plants were subjected to 100 of water requirement wr without any significant difference with 75 and 50 of water requirement and also in mf psb treatment among biofertilizers the lowest amount is related to 25 of wr and biofertilizer control treatment in all three harvests table 4 the interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers had a significant effect on chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll contents table 2 as can be noticed there is not a significant difference between the four irrigation regimes especially when mf psb treatment is used table 3 therefore 25 of wr is recommended when using mf psb irrigation plot in terms of total chlorophyll irrigation regimes except 25 wr showed a significant difference between using biofertilizers and control treatment therefore biofertilizers application can increase total chlorophyll content and has a positive effect on plant photosynthesis chlorophyll content in the second harvest was higher than that in the first and third harvests fig 2 in addition a positive significant correlation between chlorophyll contents and leaf fresh weight 0 389 for both first and second harvests and 0 388 for the third harvest confirms their effects on plant photosynthesis and growth tables 5 7 the interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers had a significant effect on leaf carotenoid content in every harvest table 2 the highest and lowest carotenoids content were observed in 25 of wr control treatment as well as 75 and 100 wr mf psb treatment respectively in all harvests in addition in each level of irrigation regimes the highest carotenoid content was observed in control biofertilizer treatment the number of carotenoids declined in the second and third harvest time compared to the first one fig 3 therefore the more severe the stress condition the higher the carotenoids content in the leaves the interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers influence on f0 was significant in all harvests table 2 in each irrigation plot biofertilizer disuse showed the highest f0 and a significant difference when using various biofertilizers table 4 the stressful situation caused an increase in f0 irrigation regimes and biofertilizers separately showed significant effects on fm and fv fm factors among irrigation regimes treatments fm and fv fm had the highest amounts when using 100 of wr while there was no significant difference between 100 and 75 of wr the lowest amounts belonged to 50 of wr for fm table 4 and to 25 of wr treatment for fv fm again with no statistically significant difference with 25 and 50 of wr in terms of biofertilizers the highest and lowest amounts were observed in control with mf psb respectively showing significant difference with the other treatments table 4 therefore it can be stated that the intensity in water stress decreased fv fm and using mf psb increased the amount of this factor in all three harvests the negative and positive significant correlations of f0 0 480 for three harvests and fv fm 0 667 for first and 0 669 for both second and third harvests on leaf fresh weight respectively demonstrate the impact of irrigation regime and biofertilizer usage on aloe vera yield tables 5 7 a significant interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers was observed on proline and soluble sugar values table 2 for these two factors the highest amounts were observed in 25 of wr control biofertilizer treatment while the lowest values belonged to 100 of wr mf psb treatments with a significant difference with other levels in each mentioned treatment it was observed that biofertilizers could help the plant to avoid stress effects because using them led to the production of less proline and soluble sugar in other words the plant does not need producing these osmolytes to protect its cells against drought stress lower values of these factors in the second harvest showed the lower stressful condition at that time because of the better weather situation figs 4 and 5 irrigation regimes and biofertilizers had a significant effect on soluble protein and mda leaf content table 2 water stress decreased the protein content and increased the mda values in three harvests among biofertilizer treatments mf psb increased leaf protein contents and decreased mda amount significantly these results were observed in all harvests table 4 the positive significant correlation between protein and leaf fresh weight 0 677 in the first and 0 698 in both second and third harvests suggests that it can cause better growth and more yield in aloe vera plant tables 5 7 in aloe vera plants leaf fresh weight can be assumed as the yield of the plant irrigation regimes showed a significant influence on this factor table 2 severity in water stress decreased leaf fresh weight such that there were significant differences between 25 of wr treatment and the other irrigation regime levels fig 6 a biofertilizers also had a significant effect on leaf fresh weight table 2 and the highest amount belonged to mf psb treatment with a significant difference with the other treatments fig 6b 4 discussion hazrati et al 2016 reported that among four irrigation regimes applied for aloe vera chlorophyll content was higher if irrigated after depleting 60 of soil water content regime compared with other irrigation regimes and there was no significant difference in chlorophyll content of plants grown between 20 and 40 irrigation regimes in other words in agreement with our results water stress severity significantly decreased chlorophyll content high light intensity decreased chlorophyll content in aloe vera plants also a combination of high light intensity and water deficit stress increased chlorophyll degradation hazrati et al 2016 chlorophyll degradation has a negative effect on photosynthesis efficiency sakuraba et al 2014 it confirms our result that chlorophyll content was lower in the summer the first and third harvests compared with chlorophyll content in the fall the second harvest because the light intensity was more severe at these seasons this chlorophyll reduction as a result of high light intensity can prevent chloroplast formation when the light intensities are low chloroplasts get larger with a high amount of chlorophylls fu et al 2012 the majority of the mycorrhizal fungi increase plant biomass chlorophyll and nutrient contents n and p of piper lignum plant ingle et al 2013 corn plants colonized by glomus mosseae had higher chlorophyll concentration compared with non mycorrhizal plants under different salinity levels sheng et al 2008 in our research chlorophyll content was higher in the mycorrhizal plant compared with non mycorrhizal ones research on barley showed that co application of psb and mycorrhiza caused the highest amount of chlorophyll content also it was reported that psb and mycorrhiza could increase chlorophyll content separately the increase in this factor can be as a result of a synergic effect between psb and mycorrhizal fungi mehrvarz et al 2008 these results are in line with our results it was reported that the tomato plants treated with psb and subjected to drought stress had a high amount of chlorophyll content than control plants the authors reported similar results in fenugreek plants in which the highest amount of total chlorophyll was recorded in psb treated plants the higher chlorophyll content in plants that were subjected to water stress and treated with psb may be due to decreased chlorophyll degradation and increased chlorophyll synthesis shintu and jayaram 2015 it can be concluded that in the present study combining lower water stress and mf psb enhanced chlorophyll content and had a significant correlation with leaf fresh weight and other physiological traits in all harvests time tables 5 7 therefore chlorophyll content seems to be one of the important reasons for leaf fresh weight changes under drought stress carotenoids are very powerful antioxidant agents involved in the scavenging two of the reactive oxygen species i e singlet molecular oxygen and proxy radicals ozsoy et al 2009 protecting the photosynthetic system against photo oxidative and free radicals stress caused by the drought situation is one of the important responsibilities of carotenoids they are able to capture short wavelength high level energy and convert single oxygen to triple form thereby having an antioxidant role in plants by scavenging oxygen radicals as shown in the present study carotenoid content increases in severe stress situation to prevent chlorophyll destruction inze 2008 the carotenoid contents were always significantly higher in the leaves of mycorrhizal lettuce than in non mycorrhizal plants mycorrhizal symbiosis also increased the levels of total carotenoids when lettuce plants were grown under water deficit baslam et al 2013 in comparison in our study applying mycorrhizal fungi especially with psb under less water stress situation caused the generation of lower amount of carotenoids hence mf and psb can have the ability to prevent aloe vera plant facing the harmful effect of water stress this research showed that in each level of irrigation regimes the highest amount of carotenoid contents occurred in control biofertilizer treatment because in other levels of biofertilizers mf psb and their combination can improve the environmental situation and the plant does not need to produce more carotenoids under drought stress as mentioned earlier the number of carotenoids declines at the second and third harvest times compared to the first one because the climate situation was less stressful at second harvest and probably planted age and its more stability caused the plant to avoid stress situation at the third time fig 3 f0 fm and fv fm are the most important chlorophyll fluorescence parameters used in plant stress physiology studies murchie and lawson 2013 f0 is minimal fluorescence levels when all antenna pigment complexes connected to the photosystem are supposed to be open gorbe and calatayud 2012 an increase in f0 suggests a problem and degradation in photosystem ii or any disturbance in energy transmission to the reaction center calatayud et al 2006 it has been reported that f0 would increase under stressful conditions but the fv fm ratio would decline maxwell and johnson 2000 this result is parallel to our findings an increase in f0 is mostly associated with two factors 1 reduction of plastoquinone electron receptors and incomplete oxidation as a result of retardation which causes electron transfer chain delay in psii and 2 light harvesting chlorophyll a b protein complexes division in psii ashraf and harris 2013 overall the increase in f0 leads to the reduced photochemical capacity of psii calatayud et al 2006 in our study f0 increased in response to water stress in line with the result of hazrati et al 2016 who observed the highest f0 when plants were subjected to water stress the increase in f0 is also known as a mechanism to decrease reactive oxygen species activity fu et al 2012 the fm is maximal fluorescence level when applying a high intensity flash all antenna sites are supposed to be closed reflecting a state of electrical transfer when passed psii baker and rosenqvist 2004 in one study fm decreased in response to high light intensities and water deficit stress which is due to the deactivation of proteins in chlorophyll structure hazrati et al 2016 these results are confirmatory of those of the present study the fv fm value is the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximal fluorescence that is calculated as fm f0 fm it measures the maximum efficiency of psii i e the efficiency of all psii centers that are open murchie and lawson 2013 reduction in fv fm is due to photo damage in psii that leads to reducing psii maximum efficiency porcar castell et al 2014 as shown in tables 5 7 in this study a significant positive correlation was observed between fv fm and chlorophyll content 0 638 0 633 and 0 658 for the first second and third harvests respectively suggesting the effect of this factor on photosynthesis system also our results are in agreement with those of hazrati et al 2016 who reported that an increase in water stress caused a reduction in fv fm mycorrhizal symbiosis increased the parameter of fv fm compared with non mycorrhizal maize plants and the f0 of mycorrhizal plants was significantly lower than that of non mycorrhizal plants therefore it is suggested that the efficiency of psii photochemistry activity of mycorrhizal plants is higher than that of non mycorrhizal plants sheng et al 2008 the fv fm was greater in mycorrhizal treated plants than in non mycorrhizal treatments of two macadamia macadamia tetraphylla l cultivars when exposed to water deficit improved fv fm implies enhanced photosynthesis in mycorrhizal plants under water stress yooyongwech et al 2013 in this research mycorrhizal treatment enhanced the fv fm ratio in aloe vera plant and its combination with psb showed the highest amount of this parameter indicating a promoting effect of biofertilizers proline is an important amino acid that plays a crucial role in plants under drought stress conditions hazrati et al 2017 proline content is used as a reprehensive of drought tolerance in water stressed plant tissue proline accumulation aids to preserve high osmotic levels in plant cells under water deficit in this regard a study showed that stressed rose plants always revealed significant higher proline content in the leaves independent from the mycorrhizal formation this usual stress response in all plants confirmed the role of proline as a general agent for drought stress augé 2001 pinior et al 2005 demonstrated the accumulation of higher proline levels in soybean mycorrhizal roots and lower contents in mycorrhizal shoots compared to non mycorrhizal plants under drought conditions farahani et al 2013 reported that proline accumulation increased in the coriander plant under drought stress although the interaction of mycorrhiza and phosphorus did not have a significant effect on proline accumulation rate the combination of two biofertilizers had a significant effect on this amino acid mycorrhizal inoculated macadamia plant showed higher proline content compared with untreated plants under drought conditions such a mechanism is linked to the protection of host plants from dehydration stress through primary drought avoidance mechanisms yooyongwech et al 2013 in contrast augé 2001 stated that the leaves of some mf inoculated plants have lower concentrations of proline than non mf plants under drought stress probably due to greater drought resistance of mf plants in our research proline content increased with increasing water stress a similar result was observed in other studies delatorre herrera et al 2010 hazrati et al 2017 soluble sugars play a vital role in cell division and leaf growth previous studies have indicated that the content of soluble sugars is increased in warm seasons compared with other seasons zapata et al 2013 in cam plants sucrose is the final product in the calvin cycle which helps the plant to overcome drought stress through osmotic adjustment delatorre herrera et al 2010 soluble sugars are the most important compounds in aloe vera hamman 2008 in aloe vera plants the levels of soluble sugars increase under water deficit polysaccharides improve water stress resistance delatorre herrera et al 2010 in agreement with the results of hazrati et al 2017 our study showed that water stress increased the soluble sugar content yooyongwech et al 2013 demonstrated that there was an increase in soluble sugar content in leaf tissues of the two cultivars of macadamia mycorrhizal pretreated plants also they reported that soluble sugar in mycorrhizal associated erythrina variegata and casuarina equisetifolia declined significantly under water deficit conditions augé 2001 reported that mycorrhizal tobacco rose and pepper plants concentrated less amount of sugars in their leaves compared with non mycorrhizal plants in a drought situation due to experiencing greater stresses in non mycorrhizal plants these results are in agreement with our study where we found an increase in soluble sugar amount under the stressful condition without biofertilizer inoculation plant responses to drought stress may occur within a few seconds like a change in the phosphorylation state of a protein there will be an irreparable degeneration of the nuclear matrix under water stress which causes the inability of the cell to produce mrnas and ribosomal subunits to continue the protein synthesis required for maintenance and growth leading to leaf senescence degradation of leaf proteins has been reported under drought induced leaf senescence munné bosch and alegre 2004 a study on maize plant demonstrated that protein content in corn leaves decreases with severity in water stress mohammadkhani and heidari 2008 this study showed a similar result in aloe vera total protein concentrations were usually higher in mycorrhizal plants than non mycorrhizal ones under drought situation probably because of the beneficial effect of mycorrhizal fungi augé 2001 according to a study on tomato psb was found to be able to improve the availability of insoluble phosphorus absorption which finally enhances the accumulation of protein moreover they suggested more protein concentration as a result of stomatal opening followed by high phosphorus accumulation in mycorrhizal inoculated plants compared to non inoculated one shintu and jayaram 2015 in this research it can be concluded that mycorrhizal and psb combination leads to more protein accumulation in aloe vera leaves mda concentration has been considered as an indicator of oxidative damage mda is supposed to be a suitable representative of membrane lipid peroxidation a decrease in membrane stability reflects the extent of lipid peroxidation caused by ros anjum et al 2011 in one study less increase in mda observed in water stress treated p acutifolius suggested better protection from oxidative damage türkan et al 2005 it means the lower the mda is the higher tolerance to water stress would be achieved as shown in our study full irrigation treatment showed less mda content in leaves mda content in the leaves and roots was lower in mycorrhizal than in non mycorrhizal plants zhu et al 2010 our result showed that among the applied biofertilizers the lowest mda belonged to mf psb treatment silva et al 2014 reported that a mild irrigation regime on aloe vera results in more biomass than full irrigation and stressful situation also they showed a decrease in leaf biomass under water stress in the present study we concluded a similar result as 75 of wr showed the highest amount of leaf fresh weight plant growth decreases under water deficit because of the stomata closing and assimilates reduction sanaullah et al 2011 biofertilizers application can improve medicinal production mycorrhizal fungi are able to enhance plant growth because of improving nutrient uptake yousefi rad 2016 cardarelli et al 2013 reported that mycorrhizal inoculation has had a significant effect on growth parameters of aloe vera this result is in line with our findings but in disagreement with those of mayak et al 2004 research on aloe vera demonstrated the significant effect of psb usage on growth parameters this higher effect can be as a result of more effective phosphate dissolution and synergistic effects of psb with plant roots gupta et al 2012 this research illustrates the same result as well it was observed that the highest amount of leaf fresh weight belongs to mf psb therefore using a combination of two kinds of biofertilizers had a significant effect on aloe vera growth moreover it is observed that leaf fresh weight is affected by all physiological traits except fm in three harvests tables 5 7 among these physiological traits chlorophyll content seems to be the most effective factor on yield because there is no significant difference between 100 75 and 50 of wr treatment in terms of leaf fresh weight and chlorophyll a table 6 therefore no significant difference between 50 of wr and full irrigation in chlorophyll a leads to non significant differences in leaf fresh weight as a result of the same photosynthesis 5 conclusion the results of this study show that the best physiological situation is achieved when there is a combination of full water requirement and using two mf psb biofertilizers simultaneously moreover if one growth parameter aspect like leaf fresh weight is the only reason for planting aloe vera it is suggested that 50 of water requirement can be the best choice among irrigation regimes because of no statistically significant difference between 100 75 and 50 of wr this plot seems to be more economical 50 less water consumption and environmentally sustainable among physiological factors chlorophyll a does not show any statistical differences between 100 75 and 50 of wr treatments hence this factor because of its influence on photosynthesis can be the reason for the mentioned result additionally the combination of mf and psb biofertilizers is recommended for achieving the highest amount of leaf fresh weight as aloe vera yield overall it can be claimed that aloe vera is a good option for planting in climate conditions such as boushehr iran using 50 of its water requirement with mf psb biofertilizers 
10865,aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller is one of the most important medicinal plants with high resistance to drought whose tolerability can be promoted using biofertilizers the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of biofertilizers on some physiological traits and leaf fresh weight of aloe vera under different irrigation regimes the experiments were conducted in a research field in iran boushehr with warm and dry climate during 2016 2018 irrigation treatments included 25 50 75 and 100 of water requirement and the applied biofertilizers treatments were mycorrhizal fungi mf glomus mosae phosphate solubilizing bacteria psb including pseudomonas putida strain p13 and pantoea agglomerans strain p5 mf psb and control without any biofertilizers the results of three harvests showed advantages of biofertilizers specially the combination of mf and psb utilization on all determined factors such as total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents leaf proline and soluble sugar amount the highest yield was obtained in full irrigation but due to the absence of significant difference in leaf fresh weight of this treatment with 50 irrigation as well as the water deficit in boushehr located in semi arid region 50 irrigation and combination of mf and psb biofertilizers is recommended therefore aloe vera is an acceptable option for planting in boushehr province according to its scant water consumption keywords aloe vera biofertilizer chlorophyll irrigation regime leaf fresh weight proline 1 introduction aloe vera l aloe barbadensis miller is a fleshy perennial plant belonging to xanthorrhoeaceae family that is cultivated in warm and dry regions of the world hazrati et al 2017 kumar et al 2017c aloe vera has commercial value because of its medical nutritional and cosmetic uses delatorre herrera et al 2010 hamman 2008 ni et al 2004 yagi and takeo 2003 nowadays water scarcity is one of the most important problems for crop production throughout the world this problem reduces crop growth and yield seriously al busaidi et al 2011 hazrati et al 2017 biomass production in plants depends on the availability of water especially in arid and semiarid ecosystems therefore in these regions it is better to cultivate the drought resistant plants aloe vera aloe barbadensis m is a perennial plant with crassulacean acid metabolism cam which enables it to tolerate water stress conditions silva et al 2010 kumar et al 2017a demonstrated that aloe vera can be a possible source of new natural antioxidant compounds and different agro climatic conditions have various influences on aloe vera phytochemicals total phenolic content and antioxidant potential also it has been reported that colder climatic regions showed superior antiplasmodial activity and higher amount of aloin and aloe emodin in comparison to warmer climatic locations kumar et al 2017b water stress can harm plants and lead to low biomass production and yield this factor affects photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters directly or indirectly drought stress increases chlorophyll degradation in aloe vera plants chlorophyll concentration is changed with environmental fluctuations hazrati et al 2016 some pigments such as carotenoids have been known as plant cell protectors under stressful situation hormaetxe et al 2005 several studies have shown that carotenoids are highly important in protecting the photosynthesis apparatus against photo damage by inter conversions among the xanthophyll molecules sheshbahreh et al 2019 chlorophyll fluorescence measurement can be applied as a useful approach to determine photosynthetic damage due to environmental stresses the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules can be directed in three ways energizing photosynthesis dissipation as heat and remission as fluorescence there are several mechanisms to disperse extra energy like heat or fluorescence under stressful conditions hazrati et al 2016 under the water stress condition cam plants can produce compatible metabolites such as sugars and proline which is known as osmolytes that allow these plants to perform the osmotic adjustment minjares fuentes et al 2017 membrane damage in water stressed plants is generally assessed based on the malondialdehyde mda content pravisya et al 2019 mda content increases in the leaves of plants under stress conditions it shows that reactive oxygen species ros production causes oxidative stress leading to membrane damage due to lipid peroxidation kordrostami et al 2017 jin et al 2007 reported that lipid membranes peroxidation is because of free radical damage as a result of stressful situations influence at the cellular level biofertilizers can be used to refine the harmful effects of water stress mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr are two biofertilizers that can improve plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses pandey and banik 2009 vurukonda et al 2016 mycorrhizal fungi are microorganisms able to establish a symbiotic association with the roots of most plants host plants have a promoted ability for nutrient uptake and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses cardarelli et al 2010 colla et al 2008 rouphael et al 2010 many plant species in liliaceae family to which aloes belong are known to be mycorrhizal dependent cardarelli et al 2010 tawaraya 2003 among mycorrhizal fungi species glomus mossae is the best known species for association with aloe roots most of the mycorrhizal fungi inoculations result in an increase in plant dry biomass of aloe vera pandey and banik 2009 al karaki et al 2004 reported that mycorrhizal plants have more tolerance to drought condition compared to non mycorrhizal ones because of better uptake ability of nutrients such as phosphorous zinc and copper in addition changes in leaf elasticity leaf water content and turgor potential promotion keeping stomata opening and transpiration increasing the length and depth of the root and hyphae expanding can improve plant tolerance to water deficit the rhizosphere bacteria that promote plant growth directly or indirectly are called plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb asghar

mostly belong to bacillus pseudomonas and pantoea genera improve phosphorus availability by organic acids exudation and production of phosphatase enzymes that are responsible for inorganic phosphorus solubilization and changing the organic phosphorus to inorganic form respectively as a result they improve phosphorus nutrient of plants khan et al 2009 regarding the previous studies it is clear that biofertilizers have many benefits for plant growth especially in a stressful situation the present research was conducted in boushehr province one of the most arid regions in iran fig 1 on aloe vera plant which is a drought tolerant cam plant the aim of this research is to investigate some physiological traits i e leaf chlorophyll contents and fluorescence carotenoids proline soluble sugar soluble proteins and mda in aloe vera leaves beside leaf fresh weight using two strains of psbs pseudomonas putida and pantoea agglomerans and mycorrhizal fungi as biofertilizers under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments a field split plot experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications in boushehr province of iran 50 12 e and 29 16 n 8 40 m above sea level the mean annual temperature and precipitation in the region are 26 38 and 34 21 mm respectively table 1 shows the chemical and physical properties of the soil from the depth of 0 30 cm an offshoot planting was done in october 2016 the main factor included irrigation regimes at four levels 25 50 75 and 100 of water requirement penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the sub factor included biofertilizers at four levels including supplying mycorrhizal fungi mf glomus mosae phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb pseudomonas putida strain p13 and pantoea agglomerans strain p5 mf psb and control without any biofertilizers irrigation treatments started when the plantlets established well inoculation of biofertilizers was done during planting each experimental plot consisted of five 3 m long rows at 60 cm distance from each other and 50 cm distance between the plants within rows the distances between the main plots sub plots and blocks were 2 4 1 2 and 2 m respectively three harvests were performed in june 2017 december 2017 and june 2018 in each stage five plants per treatment were selected randomly and four leaves per plant were harvested hazrati et al 2012 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 leaf chlorophylls carotenoids contents and fluorescence determination of chlorophylls and carotenoids contents was done according to the method of arnon 1949 at first 1 g fresh leaf samples were ground with 10 ml of 80 acetone and 0 5 g calcium carbonate powder after centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c 1 ml of solution was poured into a tuber with 9 ml of 80 acetone and the absorbance of solution was read at 645 663 and 470 nm with a spectrophotometer hazrati et al 2012 these amounts were calculated by following formula and expressed as mg per g leaf fresh weight c h o l o p h y l l a c h l a 12 7 o d 663 2 69 o d 645 v 1000 w c h l o r o p h y l l b c h l b 22 9 o d 645 4 68 o d 663 v 1000 w t o t a l c h o r o p h

solution volume and leaf fresh weight of samples respectively chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured using a portable photosynthesis meter handy pea the uk parameters were assessed in 20 min dark adapted leaves this measurement was done in the morning 2 2 2 leaf proline and soluble sugars content proline content was estimated by following the method of murillo amador et al 2014 in accordance with this method leaf fresh samples were extracted in sulphosalicylic acid after adding glacial acetic acid and ninhydrin boiling cooling and adding toluene proline concentration was measured by spectrophotometer at 520 nm using calibration curve and expressed as mg proline per g fresh weight of leaf total soluble sugar tss was determined using the method of jin et al 2007 tss was measured by adding freshly prepared anthrone 150 mg anthrone 100 ml 72 h2so4 to the alcoholic extract after boiling water bath for 10 min and cooling tss concentration was determined at 625 nm using a spectrophotometer and sucrose as a standard it is expressed as mg tss per gr fresh weight of leaf 2 2 3 leaf protein and malondialdehyde mda content to determine the contents of soluble proteins the method of bradford 1976 was used leaf samples were extracted in buffer phosphate 0 1 m and ph 6 8 after centrifuging soluble protein content was determined using the reagent coomassie brilliant blue g 250 followed by absorbance readings at 595 nm using bovine serum albumin as standard this content is expressed as mg soluble protein per fresh weight of leaf mda was determined based on the method proposed by heath and packer 1968 samples were extracted in trichloroacetic acid 0 1 tca and thiobarbituric acid 0 5 tba afterward mda content was measured by spectrophotometer at 532 nm and 600 nm and expressed as nm per g leaf fresh weight 2 2 4 leaf fresh weight five plants from each plot were selected and four leaves from each plant were harvested hazrati et al 2012 after cutting the leaves at the base they were weighed by the digital scale and leaf fresh weight was registered finally it was expressed as kg per hectare using the average number of leaves 2 3 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using the glm procedure in sas 9 1 software comparison of means was performed using the lsd at a p value of 5 graphs were also drawn using the excel software 3 results the effects of irrigation regimes and biofertilizers on chlorophyll a content were statistically significant in all three harvests table 2 the increasing intensity of water stress caused a decrease in chlorophyll contents the highest chlorophyll a content was observed when plants were subjected to 100 of water requirement wr without any significant difference with 75 and 50 of water requirement and also in mf psb treatment among biofertilizers the lowest amount is related to 25 of wr and biofertilizer control treatment in all three harvests table 4 the interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers had a significant effect on chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll contents table 2 as can be noticed there is not a significant difference between the four irrigation regimes especially when mf psb treatment is used table 3 therefore 25 of wr is recommended when using mf psb irrigation plot in terms of total chlorophyll irrigation regimes except 25 wr showed a significant difference between using biofertilizers and control treatment therefore biofertilizers application can increase total chlorophyll content and has a positive effect on plant photosynthesis chlorophyll content in the second harvest was higher than that in the first and third harvests fig 2 in addition a positive significant correlation between chlorophyll contents and leaf fresh weight 0 389 for both first and second harvests and 0 388 for the third harvest confirms their effects on plant photosynthesis and growth tables 5 7 the interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers had a significant effect on leaf carotenoid content in every harvest table 2 the highest and lowest carotenoids content were observed in 25 of wr control treatment as well as 75 and 100 wr mf psb treatment respectively in all harvests in addition in each level of irrigation regimes the highest carotenoid content was observed in control biofertilizer treatment the number of carotenoids declined in the second and third harvest time compared to the first one fig 3 therefore the more severe the stress condition the higher the carotenoids content in the leaves the interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers influence on f0 was significant in all harvests table 2 in each irrigation plot biofertilizer disuse showed the highest f0 and a significant difference when using various biofertilizers table 4 the stressful situation caused an increase in f0 irrigation regimes and biofertilizers separately showed significant effects on fm and fv fm factors among irrigation regimes treatments fm and fv fm had the highest amounts when using 100 of wr while there was no significant difference between 100 and 75 of wr the lowest amounts belonged to 50 of wr for fm table 4 and to 25 of wr treatment for fv fm again with no statistically significant difference with 25 and 50 of wr in terms of biofertilizers the highest and lowest amounts were observed in control with mf psb respectively showing significant difference with the other treatments table 4 therefore it can be stated that the intensity in water stress decreased fv fm and using mf psb increased the amount of this factor in all three harvests the negative and positive significant correlations of f0 0 480 for three harvests and fv fm 0 667 for first and 0 669 for both second and third harvests on leaf fresh weight respectively demonstrate the impact of irrigation regime and biofertilizer usage on aloe vera yield tables 5 7 a significant interaction between irrigation regimes and biofertilizers was observed on proline and soluble sugar values table 2 for these two factors the highest amounts were observed in 25 of wr control biofertilizer treatment while the lowest values belonged to 100 of wr mf psb treatments with a significant difference with other levels in each mentioned treatment it was observed that biofertilizers could help the plant to avoid stress effects because using them led to the production of less proline and soluble sugar in other words the plant does not need producing these osmolytes to protect its cells against drought stress lower values of these factors in the second harvest showed the lower stressful condition at that time because of the better weather situation figs 4 and 5 irrigation regimes and biofertilizers had a significant effect on soluble protein and mda leaf content table 2 water stress decreased the protein content and increased the mda values in three harvests among biofertilizer treatments mf psb increased leaf protein contents and decreased mda amount significantly these results were observed in all harvests table 4 the positive significant correlation between protein and leaf fresh weight 0 677 in the first and 0 698 in both second and third harvests suggests that it can cause better growth and more yield in aloe vera plant tables 5 7 in aloe vera plants leaf fresh weight can be assumed as the yield of the plant irrigation regimes showed a significant influence on this factor table 2 severity in water stress decreased leaf fresh weight such that there were significant differences between 25 of wr treatment and the other irrigation regime levels fig 6 a biofertilizers also had a significant effect on leaf fresh weight table 2 and the highest amount belonged to mf psb treatment with a significant difference with the other treatments fig 6b 4 discussion hazrati et al 2016 reported that among four irrigation regimes applied for aloe vera chlorophyll content was higher if irrigated after depleting 60 of soil water content regime compared with other irrigation regimes and there was no significant difference in chlorophyll content of plants grown between 20 and 40 irrigation regimes in other words in agreement with our results water stress severity significantly decreased chlorophyll content high light intensity decreased chlorophyll content in aloe vera plants also a combination of high light intensity and water deficit stress increased chlorophyll degradation hazrati et al 2016 chlorophyll degradation has a negative effect on photosynthesis efficiency sakuraba et al 2014 it confirms our result that chlorophyll content was lower in the summer the first and third harvests compared with chlorophyll content in the fall the second harvest because the light intensity was more severe at these seasons this chlorophyll reduction as a result of high light intensity can prevent chloroplast formation when the light intensities are low chloroplasts get larger with a high amount of chlorophylls fu et al 2012 the majority of the mycorrhizal fungi increase plant biomass chlorophyll and nutrient contents n and p of piper lignum plant ingle et al 2013 corn plants colonized by glomus mosseae had higher chlorophyll concentration compared with non mycorrhizal plants under different salinity levels sheng et al 2008 in our research chlorophyll content was higher in the mycorrhizal plant compared with non mycorrhizal ones research on barley showed that co application of psb and mycorrhiza caused the highest amount of chlorophyll content also it was reported that psb and mycorrhiza could increase chlorophyll content separately the increase in this factor can be as a result of a synergic effect between psb and mycorrhizal fungi mehrvarz et al 2008 these results are in line with our results it was reported that the tomato plants treated with psb and subjected to drought stress had a high amount of chlorophyll content than control plants the authors reported similar results in fenugreek plants in which the highest amount of total chlorophyll was recorded in psb treated plants the higher chlorophyll content in plants that were subjected to water stress and treated with psb may be due to decreased chlorophyll degradation and increased chlorophyll synthesis shintu and jayaram 2015 it can be concluded that in the present study combining lower water stress and mf psb enhanced chlorophyll content and had a significant correlation with leaf fresh weight and other physiological traits in all harvests time tables 5 7 therefore chlorophyll content seems to be one of the important reasons for leaf fresh weight changes under drought stress carotenoids are very powerful antioxidant agents involved in the scavenging two of the reactive oxygen species i e singlet molecular oxygen and proxy radicals ozsoy et al 2009 protecting the photosynthetic system against photo oxidative and free radicals stress caused by the drought situation is one of the important responsibilities of carotenoids they are able to capture short wavelength high level energy and convert single oxygen to triple form thereby having an antioxidant role in plants by scavenging oxygen radicals as shown in the present study carotenoid content increases in severe stress situation to prevent chlorophyll destruction inze 2008 the carotenoid contents were always significantly higher in the leaves of mycorrhizal lettuce than in non mycorrhizal plants mycorrhizal symbiosis also increased the levels of total carotenoids when lettuce plants were grown under water deficit baslam et al 2013 in comparison in our study applying mycorrhizal fungi especially with psb under less water stress situation caused the generation of lower amount of carotenoids hence mf and psb can have the ability to prevent aloe vera plant facing the harmful effect of water stress this research showed that in each level of irrigation regimes the highest amount of carotenoid contents occurred in control biofertilizer treatment because in other levels of biofertilizers mf psb and their combination can improve the environmental situation and the plant does not need to produce more carotenoids under drought stress as mentioned earlier the number of carotenoids declines at the second and third harvest times compared to the first one because the climate situation was less stressful at second harvest and probably planted age and its more stability caused the plant to avoid stress situation at the third time fig 3 f0 fm and fv fm are the most important chlorophyll fluorescence parameters used in plant stress physiology studies murchie and lawson 2013 f0 is minimal fluorescence levels when all antenna pigment complexes connected to the photosystem are supposed to be open gorbe and calatayud 2012 an increase in f0 suggests a problem and degradation in photosystem ii or any disturbance in energy transmission to the reaction center calatayud et al 2006 it has been reported that f0 would increase under stressful conditions but the fv fm ratio would decline maxwell and johnson 2000 this result is parallel to our findings an increase in f0 is mostly associated with two factors 1 reduction of plastoquinone electron receptors and incomplete oxidation as a result of retardation which causes electron transfer chain delay in psii and 2 light harvesting chlorophyll a b protein complexes division in psii ashraf and harris 2013 overall the increase in f0 leads to the reduced photochemical capacity of psii calatayud et al 2006 in our study f0 increased in response to water stress in line with the result of hazrati et al 2016 who observed the highest f0 when plants were subjected to water stress the increase in f0 is also known as a mechanism to decrease reactive oxygen species activity fu et al 2012 the fm is maximal fluorescence level when applying a high intensity flash all antenna sites are supposed to be closed reflecting a state of electrical transfer when passed psii baker and rosenqvist 2004 in one study fm decreased in response to high light intensities and water deficit stress which is due to the deactivation of proteins in chlorophyll structure hazrati et al 2016 these results are confirmatory of those of the present study the fv fm value is the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximal fluorescence that is calculated as fm f0 fm it measures the maximum efficiency of psii i e the efficiency of all psii centers that are open murchie and lawson 2013 reduction in fv fm is due to photo damage in psii that leads to reducing psii maximum efficiency porcar castell et al 2014 as shown in tables 5 7 in this study a significant positive correlation was observed between fv fm and chlorophyll content 0 638 0 633 and 0 658 for the first second and third harvests respectively suggesting the effect of this factor on photosynthesis system also our results are in agreement with those of hazrati et al 2016 who reported that an increase in water stress caused a reduction in fv fm mycorrhizal symbiosis increased the parameter of fv fm compared with non mycorrhizal maize plants and the f0 of mycorrhizal plants was significantly lower than that of non mycorrhizal plants therefore it is suggested that the efficiency of psii photochemistry activity of mycorrhizal plants is higher than that of non mycorrhizal plants sheng et al 2008 the fv fm was greater in mycorrhizal treated plants than in non mycorrhizal treatments of two macadamia macadamia tetraphylla l cultivars when exposed to water deficit improved fv fm implies enhanced photosynthesis in mycorrhizal plants under water stress yooyongwech et al 2013 in this research mycorrhizal treatment enhanced the fv fm ratio in aloe vera plant and its combination with psb showed the highest amount of this parameter indicating a promoting effect of biofertilizers proline is an important amino acid that plays a crucial role in plants under drought stress conditions hazrati et al 2017 proline content is used as a reprehensive of drought tolerance in water stressed plant tissue proline accumulation aids to preserve high osmotic levels in plant cells under water deficit in this regard a study showed that stressed rose plants always revealed significant higher proline content in the leaves independent from the mycorrhizal formation this usual stress response in all plants confirmed the role of proline as a general agent for drought stress augé 2001 pinior et al 2005 demonstrated the accumulation of higher proline levels in soybean mycorrhizal roots and lower contents in mycorrhizal shoots compared to non mycorrhizal plants under drought conditions farahani et al 2013 reported that proline accumulation increased in the coriander plant under drought stress although the interaction of mycorrhiza and phosphorus did not have a significant effect on proline accumulation rate the combination of two biofertilizers had a significant effect on this amino acid mycorrhizal inoculated macadamia plant showed higher proline content compared with untreated plants under drought conditions such a mechanism is linked to the protection of host plants from dehydration stress through primary drought avoidance mechanisms yooyongwech et al 2013 in contrast augé 2001 stated that the leaves of some mf inoculated plants have lower concentrations of proline than non mf plants under drought stress probably due to greater drought resistance of mf plants in our research proline content increased with increasing water stress a similar result was observed in other studies delatorre herrera et al 2010 hazrati et al 2017 soluble sugars play a vital role in cell division and leaf growth previous studies have indicated that the content of soluble sugars is increased in warm seasons compared with other seasons zapata et al 2013 in cam plants sucrose is the final product in the calvin cycle which helps the plant to overcome drought stress through osmotic adjustment delatorre herrera et al 2010 soluble sugars are the most important compounds in aloe vera hamman 2008 in aloe vera plants the levels of soluble sugars increase under water deficit polysaccharides improve water stress resistance delatorre herrera et al 2010 in agreement with the results of hazrati et al 2017 our study showed that water stress increased the soluble sugar content yooyongwech et al 2013 demonstrated that there was an increase in soluble sugar content in leaf tissues of the two cultivars of macadamia mycorrhizal pretreated plants also they reported that soluble sugar in mycorrhizal associated erythrina variegata and casuarina equisetifolia declined significantly under water deficit conditions augé 2001 reported that mycorrhizal tobacco rose and pepper plants concentrated less amount of sugars in their leaves compared with non mycorrhizal plants in a drought situation due to experiencing greater stresses in non mycorrhizal plants these results are in agreement with our study where we found an increase in soluble sugar amount under the stressful condition without biofertilizer inoculation plant responses to drought stress may occur within a few seconds like a change in the phosphorylation state of a protein there will be an irreparable degeneration of the nuclear matrix under water stress which causes the inability of the cell to produce mrnas and ribosomal subunits to continue the protein synthesis required for maintenance and growth leading to leaf senescence degradation of leaf proteins has been reported under drought induced leaf senescence munné bosch and alegre 2004 a study on maize plant demonstrated that protein content in corn leaves decreases with severity in water stress mohammadkhani and heidari 2008 this study showed a similar result in aloe vera total protein concentrations were usually higher in mycorrhizal plants than non mycorrhizal ones under drought situation probably because of the beneficial effect of mycorrhizal fungi augé 2001 according to a study on tomato psb was found to be able to improve the availability of insoluble phosphorus absorption which finally enhances the accumulation of protein moreover they suggested more protein concentration as a result of stomatal opening followed by high phosphorus accumulation in mycorrhizal inoculated plants compared to non inoculated one shintu and jayaram 2015 in this research it can be concluded that mycorrhizal and psb combination leads to more protein accumulation in aloe vera leaves mda concentration has been considered as an indicator of oxidative damage mda is supposed to be a suitable representative of membrane lipid peroxidation a decrease in membrane stability reflects the extent of lipid peroxidation caused by ros anjum et al 2011 in one study less increase in mda observed in water stress treated p acutifolius suggested better protection from oxidative damage türkan et al 2005 it means the lower the mda is the higher tolerance to water stress would be achieved as shown in our study full irrigation treatment showed less mda content in leaves mda content in the leaves and roots was lower in mycorrhizal than in non mycorrhizal plants zhu et al 2010 our result showed that among the applied biofertilizers the lowest mda belonged to mf psb treatment silva et al 2014 reported that a mild irrigation regime on aloe vera results in more biomass than full irrigation and stressful situation also they showed a decrease in leaf biomass under water stress in the present study we concluded a similar result as 75 of wr showed the highest amount of leaf fresh weight plant growth decreases under water deficit because of the stomata closing and assimilates reduction sanaullah et al 2011 biofertilizers application can improve medicinal production mycorrhizal fungi are able to enhance plant growth because of improving nutrient uptake yousefi rad 2016 cardarelli et al 2013 reported that mycorrhizal inoculation has had a significant effect on growth parameters of aloe vera this result is in line with our findings but in disagreement with those of mayak et al 2004 research on aloe vera demonstrated the significant effect of psb usage on growth parameters this higher effect can be as a result of more effective phosphate dissolution and synergistic effects of psb with plant roots gupta et al 2012 this research illustrates the same result as well it was observed that the highest amount of leaf fresh weight belongs to mf psb therefore using a combination of two kinds of biofertilizers had a significant effect on aloe vera growth moreover it is observed that leaf fresh weight is affected by all physiological traits except fm in three harvests tables 5 7 among these physiological traits chlorophyll content seems to be the most effective factor on yield because there is no significant difference between 100 75 and 50 of wr treatment in terms of leaf fresh weight and chlorophyll a table 6 therefore no significant difference between 50 of wr and full irrigation in chlorophyll a leads to non significant differences in leaf fresh weight as a result of the same photosynthesis 5 conclusion the results of this study show that the best physiological situation is achieved when there is a combination of full water requirement and using two mf psb biofertilizers simultaneously moreover if one growth parameter aspect like leaf fresh weight is the only reason for planting aloe vera it is suggested that 50 of water requirement can be the best choice among irrigation regimes because of no statistically significant difference between 100 75 and 50 of wr this plot seems to be more economical 50 less water consumption and environmentally sustainable among physiological factors chlorophyll a does not show any statistical differences between 100 75 and 50 of wr treatments hence this factor because of its influence on photosynthesis can be the reason for the mentioned result additionally the combination of mf and psb biofertilizers is recommended for achieving the highest amount of leaf fresh weight as aloe vera yield overall it can be claimed that aloe vera is a good option for planting in climate conditions such as boushehr iran using 50 of its water requirement with mf psb biofertilizers 
10866,globally second generation biofuels have been promoted as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels this shift in energy sources was envisaged to reduce dependence on fossil fuels cut down greenhouse gas ghg emissions and ultimately to relieve national economies from the ever escalating prices of fossil fuels jatropha curcas l jatropha appeared to have great potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production it attracted interest from governments and private investors in asia and africa including botswana despite the global promotion of jatropha biodiesel production there is surprisingly limited information about its water use during the cultivation stage the aim of this study was to determine the crop water irrigation requirements and the effects of irrigation scheduling on jatropha cultivation in botswana climate and soil data from 2014 2016 were obtained from the weather station at the department of agricultural research station sebele botswana secondary data sources were consulted to obtain data such as crop coefficients crop duration length rooting depth and crop height the cropwat model was then used to estimate the rate of reference evapotranspiration eto evapotranspiration of jatropha etc irrigation water requirements iwr and yield response to irrigation scheduling in botswana the results showed that the annual eto from 2014 to 2016 at the station was 1456 mm the lowest monthly eto 50 10 mm was observed in june and the highest 182 59 mm was observed in january the results also indicated that the total jatropha evapotranspiration rate etc from 2014 2016 was estimated to be 955 4 mm growing season and the irrigation requirement was estimated to be 665 4 mm growing season with an irrigation efficiency of 70 indicating that supplementary irrigation is needed furthermore high yield reductions are expected in the late developmental stage if limited water is supplied the late developmental stage requires more water than other stages given the low and highly variable rainfall in botswana satisfactory yields for biodiesel production will only be realized if irrigation is done it is therefore recommended that shifting planting dates to coincide with rainfall should be considered and also allocating water to the most critical crop developmental stages which would help to maximise yield keywords jatropha biofuels irrigation scheduling yield reductions cropwat 1 introduction globally biofuels gained the interest of many investors and governments as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels in the early 2000s biofuels were expected to reduce dependence on fossil fuels cut down greenhouse gas emissions boost rural development and relieve economies from rapidly rising prices of imported fuels bessou et al 2011 hassan and kalam 2013 himmel et al 2007 in countries like the usa brazil and china energy security was a major driver of biofuel development gasparatos et al 2013 in africa biofuels were also promoted on the basis of energy security poverty alleviation and potential foreign exchange savings dufey 2006 gasparatos et al 2015 in botswana the promotion of biofuels was also based on energy security the potential benefits for rural development and greenhouse gas ghg reductions however for biofuels to achieve the perceived benefits their production must be sustainable economically socially and environmentally environmentally a net reduction in ghg production from using biofuels will only be realized if there is no further clearing of forest land to accommodate other crop land chakauya et al 2009 eliasch 2008 economically the investment returns should be higher than the cost of production for sustainability to be realized initially biofuels were produced from edible plants such as soybeans glycine max maize zea mays peanuts arachis hypogaea common sunflower helianthus annuus and rapeseed brassica napus gasparatos et al 2012 lynd et al 1991 their production raised issues for land and food security as a non food alternative jatropha curcas l attracted the attention of many researchers policymakers investors and industries worldwide as one of the most promising biofuel feedstock candidates gasparatos et al 2012 rao et al 2012 von maltitz et al 2014 jatropha was promoted as an oil crop based on claims that it can grow on marginal and arid land with minimal requirements of water and fertilizers although jatropha was initially claimed to thrive in water stressed environments recent studies have demonstrated that jatropha like other crops is dependent on inputs such as sufficient water and fertilization to obtain competitive yields pandey et al 2012 volckaert 2009 wendimu et al 2017 in semi arid areas where there was a boom of jatropha production as a biofuel feedstock production is adversely affected by mild to severe water scarcity maes et al 2009 morison et al 2007 even though there was interest in its biofuel potential the available data and knowledge on water requirements and yield potential of jatropha are limited more research is required to address water use and yield potential under different environments considering the fact that water is a limited resource in many parts of the world global water resources are at risk of depletion because of water demand for various uses by both urban and industrial activities moreover the situation is worsened by the increasing population economic development climate change and intensified agricultural production agricultural production in arid areas is critically dependent upon rainfall rahman et al 2008 however this rain is not always available for plants to use as some is lost through surface runoff seepage and deep percolation infiltration dastane 1974 sssa 2008 the amount of water available to plants after all the losses have taken place is referred to as the effective rainfall that is the rainfall that directly satisfies crop water requirements dastane 1974 rahman et al 2008 sometimes rainfall is not necessarily important at the time rate or the amount received at that particular time which may have a detrimental impact on the effective rainfall to supplement the effective rainfall irrigation is usually practised to meet the crop water requirements globally crop irrigation accounts for 80 90 of all freshwater withdrawals by humans morison et al 2007 despite the limited resource

rate eto the total annual reference eto was estimated to be 1456 mm table 3 the daily rate of evapotranspiration ranged from 1 67 to 6 07 mm day table 3 in general terms eto varies seasonally 3 2 rainfall and effective rainfall total monthly rainfall data were obtained from the weather station installed at the station while the effective rainfall during the growing period of jatropha in the study area sebele was obtained from the cropwat model monthly effective rainfall varied between 0 0 mm to 96 2 mm month fig 3 the total effective rainfall was 343 2 mm out of 386 8 mm received during this period representing 89 of the rain received fig 3 3 3 crop evapotranspiration etc effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for different developmental stages fig 4 shows that modelled etc varied from 100 8 mm in the initial stage to 406 4 mm in the late maturity stage the maximum evapotranspiration rate etc mm stage of jatropha occurred in the late developmental stage the total etc for the growing season 2014 2016 was 955 4 mm etc effective rainfall and irrigation requirement showed a fluctuating pattern across the developmental stages the results indicate that the highest effective rainfall and irrigation requirements were observed in the late developmental mature stage of jatropha the mean modelled effective rainfall for the period under study was 283 6 mm leaving a deficit of 655 mm to be made up from irrigation 3 4 the effect of irrigation scheduling on yield reductions fig 5 indicate the effect of irrigation scheduling on jatropha yield potential tests of scenarios of no irrigation irrigation at 10 day intervals 10 yield reductions and 10 etc reduction per stage scenario indicate that considerable reductions result during the late developmental stages for example when irrigation is not done at all this will result in 95 yield reductions at the late stage when irrigation is done at 10 mm 20 mm and 30 mm levels of soil moisture depletion yield reductions across the stages are similar 4 discussion 4 1 monthly eto and effective rainfall eto exhibits seasonal variation that mirrors that of insolation and temperature the total annual eto was estimated to be 1456 mm year which is similar to the annual eto value of 1654 mm annual for 1958 1985 estimated by bhalotra 1987 for gaborone botswana hess and molatakgosi 2009 used average long term values 1989 2002 in different locations in botswana to estimate eto they estimated eto in ﬁve regions gaborone jwaneng mahalapye francistown and maun where cabbage was cultivated eto rates obtained were 1536 6 1593 6 1567 1 1689 8 1671 8 mm respectively the differences between the results obtained from this study and other studies are not surprising because of the different agroecological zones that are present within the country agroecological zones are influenced by latitude elevation and temperature as well as seasonality and rainfall amounts and distribution during the growing season results obtained from this study are similar to those obtained in iraq by najmaddin et al 2017 in their study they compared eto from remote sensing eto rs with eto derived from four ground based stations eto g from 2010 to 2014 in the semi arid region of iraq their findings indicated that eto ranged between 1153 and 1893 mm year for eto g and between 1176 and 1859 mm year for eto rs for the different stations studied they concluded that eto rs hs can also be used to yield accurate and unbiased eto estimates for semi arid regions which can be useful in water resources management najmaddin et al 2017 furthermore the effective rainfall from the study area varied throughout the year the highest effective rainfall estimated was in march because of the high rainfall received during that month lower or no effective rainfall indicates that supplementary irrigation is needed to meet the daily crop water needs water used to supplement rainfall for biofuel production in water scarce environments could be used by other water using sectors or for food production 4 2 crop water and irrigation requirements the total etc and ir of jatropha for the 2014 2016 period september to march at the study area was estimated to be 955 4 mm growing season and 665 4 mm growing season respectively the high etc and ir requirement may be attributed to the low rainfall received during the growing season and high temperatures recorded furthermore the results showed that the late developmental stage requires more water than other developmental stages high irrigation requirements during this stage may be attributed to an increased rate of growth of the jatropha fruits that need a lot of water compared with other stages kheira and atta 2009 this is necessary for obtaining high oil quantities from the seeds in tan tan province the semi arid region of morocco the total etc estimated was 780 mm per growing season march september rajaona et al 2012 the region has hot and dry summers with an average minimum and maximum monthly temperature of 14 c and 25 c respectively and an annual total rainfall of 115 mm the higher etc estimated for sebele could be because of the generally higher temperatures coupled with low rainfall experienced in botswana when using the cropwat model in a semi arid tropical location at icrisat patancheru india etc of jatropha under no moisture stress condition varied from 1410 to 1538 mm per growing season between 2006 and 2009 rao et al 2012 under field conditions etc of jatropha varied from 614 to 930 mm depending on the atmospheric demand rainfall and crop physiological stage furthermore the icrisat jatropha plantation yield in the third year varied from 600 kg ha to 1560 kg ha depending on rainfall distribution during the season rao et al 2012 this indicates that etc is very much dependent on the atmospheric conditions experienced at a particular location again meeting crop water requirements is important for high yield production at the owen sithole college of agriculture osca located approximately 20 kms outside empangeni on the kwazulu natal kzn north coast in south africa holl et al 2007 compared etc measured in jatropha using the heat pulse sap flow velocity method and the leaf area index method they found that sap flow indicated mean annual etc of between 144 and 362 mm while that from the leaf area index method was higher lying between 300 and 500 mm they concluded that the water use of j curcas trees in empangeni area is generally low the variation between the etc estimated in empangeni and our study area could be because of the different climates experinced empangeni s climate is classified as warm and temperate and has a significant amount of rainfall during the year the annual precipitation is about 1082 mm this implies that in areas similar to empangeni there is less evapotranspiration from the environmental demand therefore less irrigation water is required to supplement the rainfall compared to botswana conditions 4 3 irrigation scheduling the results indicate that irrigation is critical in the late developmental stage of jatropha to avoid yield reductions in jatropha cultivation much water should be applied in the late developmental stage this is probably because large quantitities of water are needed in fruit formation kheira and atta 2009 in areas where water is a limiting factor in crop production deficit irrigation may be practiced in deficit irrigation irrigation is withheld in certain crop growth stages believed to be the least sensitive to water stress fereres and garcía vila 2019 the goal of deficit irrigation is to reduce irrigation water use to cope with water issues in areas where the supply is constrained without adverse effects on yields english 1990 fereres and garcía vila 2019 in field crops a well designed irrigation scheduling can optimize water productivity over an area when full irrigation is not possible however a certain yield reduction should be expected because of the relationship between et and the yield of some field crops bennett and harms 2011 fereres and garcía vila 2019 little research has been done on deficit irrigation boland et al 1996 and it is not known whether it can be used over long time periods given that the reduction in applied water could lead to soil salinization in the soil profile as a result of reduced leaching fereres and garcía vila 2019 other researchers have found that deficit irrigation has implications for fruit formation and oil yield of some crops motilva et al 2000 found that regulated deficit irrigation induces olive fruit ripening and at harvest oil yield increased when water supply was decreased iniesta et al 2009 also highlighted that water deficit in olives caused a reduction in fresh fruit yield than oil yield this suggests that the effects of deficit irrigation on jatropha growth should be investigated further 5 conclusions this study has shown that sufficient water is vital in the late developmental stage of jatropha more so than for other developmental stages this indicates that proper planning and timing of planting dates to coincide the late developmental stage with high rainfall months is vital in water resource management especially in semi arid climates different crop and soil water management practices need to be adopted for the production to be economically sustainable it is therefore recommended that shifting planting dates to coincide with rainfall should be considered and also allocating water according to the critical developmental stages in order to maximise yields without adverse implications for water resources acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the japan international cooperation agency jica

10866,globally second generation biofuels have been promoted as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels this shift in energy sources was envisaged to reduce dependence on fossil fuels cut down greenhouse gas ghg emissions and ultimately to relieve national economies from the ever escalating prices of fossil fuels jatropha curcas l jatropha appeared to have great potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production it attracted interest from governments and private investors in asia and africa including botswana despite the global promotion of jatropha biodiesel production there is surprisingly limited information about its water use during the cultivation stage the aim of this study was to determine the crop water irrigation requirements and the effects of irrigation scheduling on jatropha cultivation in botswana climate and soil data from 2014 2016 were obtained from the weather station at the department of agricultural research station sebele botswana secondary data sources were consulted to obtain data such as crop coefficients crop duration length rooting depth and crop height the cropwat model was then used to estimate the rate of reference evapotranspiration eto evapotranspiration of jatropha etc irrigation water requirements iwr and yield response to irrigation scheduling in botswana the results showed that the annual eto from 2014 to 2016 at the station was 1456 mm the lowest monthly eto 50 10 mm was observed in june and the highest 182 59 mm was observed in january the results also indicated that the total jatropha evapotranspiration rate etc from 2014 2016 was estimated to be 955 4 mm growing season and the irrigation requirement was estimated to be 665 4 mm growing season with an irrigation efficiency of 70 indicating that supplementary irrigation is needed furthermore high yield reductions are expected in the late developmental stage if limited water is supplied the late developmental stage requires more water than other stages given the low and highly variable rainfall in botswana satisfactory yields for biodiesel production will only be realized if irrigation is done it is therefore recommended that shifting planting dates to coincide with rainfall should be considered and also allocating water to the most critical crop developmental stages which would help to maximise yield keywords jatropha biofuels irrigation scheduling yield reductions cropwat 1 introduction globally biofuels gained the interest of many investors and governments as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels in the early 2000s biofuels were expected to reduce dependence on fossil fuels cut down greenhouse gas emissions boost rural development and relieve economies from rapidly rising prices of imported fuels bessou et al 2011 hassan and kalam 2013 himmel et al 2007 in countries like the usa brazil and china energy security was a major driver of biofuel development gasparatos et al 2013 in africa biofuels were also promoted on the basis of energy security poverty alleviation and potential foreign exchange savings dufey 2006 gasparatos et al 2015 in botswana the promotion of biofuels was also based on energy security the potential benefits for rural development and greenhouse gas ghg reductions however for biofuels to achieve the perceived benefits their production must be sustainable economically socially and environmentally environmentally a net reduction in ghg production from using biofuels will only be realized if there is no further clearing of forest land to accommodate other crop land chakauya et al 2009 eliasch 2008 economically the investment returns should be higher than the cost of production for sustainability to be realized initially biofuels were produced from edible plants such as soybeans glycine max maize zea mays peanuts arachis hypogaea common sunflower helianthus annuus and rapeseed brassica napus gasparatos et al 2012 lynd et al 1991 their production raised issues for land and food security as a non food alternative jatropha curcas l attracted the attention of many researchers policymakers investors and industries worldwide as one of the most promising biofuel feedstock candidates gasparatos et al 2012 rao et al 2012 von maltitz et al 2014 jatropha was promoted as an oil crop based on claims that it can grow on marginal and arid land with minimal requirements of water and fertilizers although jatropha was initially claimed to thrive in water stressed environments recent studies have demonstrated that jatropha like other crops is dependent on inputs such as sufficient water and fertilization to obtain competitive yields pandey et al 2012 volckaert 2009 wendimu et al 2017 in semi arid areas where there was a boom of jatropha production as a biofuel feedstock production is adversely affected by mild to severe water scarcity maes et al 2009 morison et al 2007 even though there was interest in its biofuel potential the available data and knowledge on water requirements and yield potential of jatropha are limited more research is required to address water use and yield potential under different environments considering the fact that water is a limited resource in many parts of the world global water resources are at risk of depletion because of water demand for various uses by both urban and industrial activities moreover the situation is worsened by the increasing population economic development climate change and intensified agricultural production agricultural production in arid areas is critically dependent upon rainfall rahman et al 2008 however this rain is not always available for plants to use as some is lost through surface runoff seepage and deep percolation infiltration dastane 1974 sssa 2008 the amount of water available to plants after all the losses have taken place is referred to as the effective rainfall that is the rainfall that directly satisfies crop water requirements dastane 1974 rahman et al 2008 sometimes rainfall is not necessarily important at the time rate or the amount received at that particular time which may have a detrimental impact on the effective rainfall to supplement the effective rainfall irrigation is usually practised to meet the crop water requirements globally crop irrigation accounts for 80 90 of all freshwater withdrawals by humans morison et al 2007 despite the limited resource

effect of irrigation scheduling on jatropha yield seven scenario tests were modelled in the cropwat model the different irrigation scenarios were as follows no irrigation irrigation at 10 days

rate eto the total annual reference eto was estimated to be 1456 mm table 3 the daily rate of evapotranspiration ranged from 1 67 to 6 07 mm day table 3 in general terms eto varies seasonally 3 2 rainfall and effective rainfall total monthly rainfall data were obtained from the weather station installed at the station while the effective rainfall during the growing period of jatropha in the study area sebele was obtained from the cropwat model monthly effective rainfall varied between 0 0 mm to 96 2 mm month fig 3 the total effective rainfall was 343 2 mm out of 386 8 mm received during this period representing 89 of the rain received fig 3 3 3 crop evapotranspiration etc effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for different developmental stages fig 4 shows that modelled etc varied from 100 8 mm in the initial stage to 406 4 mm in the late maturity stage the maximum evapotranspiration rate etc mm stage of jatropha occurred in the late developmental stage the total etc for the growing season 2014 2016 was 955 4 mm etc effective rainfall and irrigation requirement showed a fluctuating pattern across the developmental stages the results indicate that the highest effective rainfall and irrigation requirements were observed in the late developmental mature stage of jatropha the mean modelled effective rainfall for the period under study was 283 6 mm leaving a deficit of 655 mm to be made up from irrigation 3 4 the effect of irrigation scheduling on yield reductions fig 5 indicate the effect of irrigation scheduling on jatropha yield potential tests of scenarios of no irrigation irrigation at 10 day intervals 10 yield reductions and 10 etc reduction per stage scenario indicate that considerable reductions result during the late developmental stages for example when irrigation is not done at all this will result in 95 yield reductions at the late stage when irrigation is done at 10 mm 20 mm and 30 mm levels of soil moisture depletion yield reductions across the stages are similar 4 discussion 4 1 monthly eto and effective rainfall eto exhibits seasonal variation that mirrors that of insolation and temperature the total annual eto was estimated to be 1456 mm year which is similar to the annual eto value of 1654 mm annual for 1958 1985 estimated by bhalotra 1987 for gaborone botswana hess and molatakgosi 2009 used average long term values 1989 2002 in different locations in botswana to estimate eto they estimated eto in ﬁve regions gaborone jwaneng mahalapye francistown and maun where cabbage was cultivated eto rates obtained were 1536 6 1593 6 1567 1 1689 8 1671 8 mm respectively the differences between the results obtained from this study and other studies are not surprising because of the different agroecological zones that are present within the country agroecological zones are influenced by latitude elevation and temperature as well as seasonality and rainfall amounts and distribution during the growing season results obtained from this study are similar to those obtained in iraq by najmaddin et al 2017 in their study they compared eto from remote sensing eto rs with eto derived from four ground based stations eto g from 2010 to 2014 in the semi arid region of iraq their findings indicated that eto ranged between 1153 and 1893 mm year for eto g and between 1176 and 1859 mm year for eto rs for the different stations studied they concluded that eto rs hs can also be used to yield accurate and unbiased eto estimates for semi arid regions which can be useful in water resources management najmaddin et al 2017 furthermore the effective rainfall from the study area varied throughout the year the highest effective rainfall estimated was in march because of the high rainfall received during that month lower or no effective rainfall indicates that supplementary irrigation is needed to meet the daily crop water needs water used to supplement rainfall for biofuel production in water scarce environments could be used by other water using sectors or for food production 4 2 crop water and irrigation requirements the total etc and ir of jatropha for the 2014 2016 period september to march at the study area was estimated to be 955 4 mm growing season and 665 4 mm growing season respectively the high etc and ir requirement may be attributed to the low rainfall received during the growing season and high temperatures recorded furthermore the results showed that the late developmental stage requires more water than other developmental stages high irrigation requirements during this stage may be attributed to an increased rate of growth of the jatropha fruits that need a lot of water compared with other stages kheira and atta 2009 this is necessary for obtaining high oil quantities from the seeds in tan tan province the semi arid region of morocco the total etc estimated was 780 mm per growing season march september rajaona et al 2012 the region has hot and dry summers with an average minimum and maximum monthly temperature of 14 c and 25 c respectively and an annual total rainfall of 115 mm the higher etc estimated for sebele could be because of the generally higher temperatures coupled with low rainfall experienced in botswana when using the cropwat model in a semi arid tropical location at icrisat patancheru india etc of jatropha under no moisture stress condition varied from 1410 to 1538 mm per growing season between 2006 and 2009 rao et al 2012 under field conditions etc of jatropha varied from 614 to 930 mm depending on the atmospheric demand rainfall and crop physiological stage furthermore the icrisat jatropha plantation yield in the third year varied from 600 kg ha to 1560 kg ha depending on rainfall distribution during the season rao et al 2012 this indicates that etc is very much dependent on the atmospheric conditions experienced at a particular location again meeting crop water requirements is important for high yield production at the owen sithole college of agriculture osca located approximately 20 kms outside empangeni on the kwazulu natal kzn north coast in south africa holl et al 2007 compared etc measured in jatropha using the heat pulse sap flow velocity method and the leaf area index method they found that sap flow indicated mean annual etc of between 144 and 362 mm while that from the leaf area index method was higher lying between 300 and 500 mm they concluded that the water use of j curcas trees in empangeni area is generally low the variation between the etc estimated in empangeni and our study area could be because of the different climates experinced empangeni s climate is classified as warm and temperate and has a significant amount of rainfall during the year the annual precipitation is about 1082 mm this implies that in areas similar to empangeni there is less evapotranspiration from the environmental demand therefore less irrigation water is required to supplement the rainfall compared to botswana conditions 4 3 irrigation scheduling the results indicate that irrigation is critical in the late developmental stage of jatropha to avoid yield reductions in jatropha cultivation much water should be applied in the late developmental stage this is probably because large quantitities of water are needed in fruit formation kheira and atta 2009 in areas where water is a limiting factor in crop production deficit irrigation may be practiced in deficit irrigation irrigation is withheld in certain crop growth stages believed to be the least sensitive to water stress fereres and garcía vila 2019 the goal of deficit irrigation is to reduce irrigation water use to cope with water issues in areas where the supply is constrained without adverse effects on yields english 1990 fereres and garcía vila 2019 in field crops a well designed irrigation scheduling can optimize water productivity over an area when full irrigation is not possible however a certain yield reduction should be expected because of the relationship between et and the yield of some field crops bennett and harms 2011 fereres and garcía vila 2019 little research has been done on deficit irrigation boland et al 1996 and it is not known whether it can be used over long time periods given that the reduction in applied water could lead to soil salinization in the soil profile as a result of reduced leaching fereres and garcía vila 2019 other researchers have found that deficit irrigation has implications for fruit formation and oil yield of some crops motilva et al 2000 found that regulated deficit irrigation induces olive fruit ripening and at harvest oil yield increased when water supply was decreased iniesta et al 2009 also highlighted that water deficit in olives caused a reduction in fresh fruit yield than oil yield this suggests that the effects of deficit irrigation on jatropha growth should be investigated further 5 conclusions this study has shown that sufficient water is vital in the late developmental stage of jatropha more so than for other developmental stages this indicates that proper planning and timing of planting dates to coincide the late developmental stage with high rainfall months is vital in water resource management especially in semi arid climates different crop and soil water management practices need to be adopted for the production to be economically sustainable it is therefore recommended that shifting planting dates to coincide with rainfall should be considered and also allocating water according to the critical developmental stages in order to maximise yields without adverse implications for water resources acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the japan international cooperation agency jica

10867,treated wastewater irrigation usually leads to the increase of metals contents in soils and affects their mobilities and distributions the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of treated wastewater irrigation systems on the vertical and lateral distribution of metals in soils two irrigated sites with treated wastewater were chosen the first is composed of a calcisol soil type irrigated since 17 years with a furrow irrigation system the second one fluvisol irrigated since 4 years with a bowl irrigation system in both sites a vertical soil sampling is made as a pedological profile in the irrigated soil and the non irrigated one control moreover in the calcisol another lateral soil sampling is carried out in the same direction of irrigation water flux all the soils samples were characterised by their major and metal contents as well as some soils physicochemical properties to evaluate the vertical distribution of metals in soils two parameters are calculated the logratio and the isovolumetric mass balance as qualitative and quantitative tools respectively in the irrigated calcisol the logratio shows a slight enrichment of metals in the upper soil layer mainly for cr the isovolumetric mass balance confirms this trend for cr but in contrast the stocks of zn and cu in the soil have decreased the logratio for the fluvisol reveals an accumulation of all the metals in a new created horizon at 90 cm of the depth quantitatively the stocks of cr zn and cu in this soil have increased however in the case of calcisol the furrow irrigation system favors the lateral distribution of metals rather than the vertical variability keywords calcisol fluvisol furrow irrigation bowl irrigation logratio isovolumetric mass balance 1 introduction suitability of any irrigation water for agriculture depends mostly on its chemical composition and conditions of use the main factors determining the conditions of use are soil texture total water salinity crop to be irrigated climate management practices and the skill of the water user singh et al 2018 al ghobari 2011 the treated wastewater tw is used for several agricultural purposes thus irrigation in the suburbs of cities is the most interesting sector indeed the tw have the advantage of being produced constantly and being already in the pipes at the wastewater treatment plant this should encourage agricultural use in peri urban areas located nearby these plants however irrigation with treated wastewater can affect the vertical distribution and mobility of trace and major elements in irrigated soils pedrero et al 2010 belaid et al 2015 one of these impacts is of course upon the soil itself irrigation often represents a large increase in the amount of water which would pass through a soil profile under natural conditions and has the capacity to accelerate mineral weathering to transport and leach soluble and colloidal materials to change soil structure and to raise the local water table sepehrnia et al 2018 rousseau et al 2004 these effects depend upon the intensity of irrigation irrigation water of poor quality has the added capacity to inflict critical damage especially upon soil structure löv et al 2018 murray and grant 2007 although the low concentration of metals in tw it is shown that irrigation may eventually lead to their accumulation in the irrigated soils rattan et al 2005 the extent of metal contents increased in irrigated soils depends on both the period and rate of wastewater application rattan et al 2005 solis et al 2005 kalavrouziotis et al 2008 nayek et al 2010 belaid et al 2012 indeed retention and mobility of metals in soil are governed by various phenomena mechanical physicochemical even biological sherene 2010 quenea et al 2009 as well as the interrelationships between metals in soils kalavrouziotis et al 2009 metals in the soil solution are subject to mass transfer out of the system by leaching to groundwater plant uptake or volatilization at the same time metals participate in chemical reactions with the soil solid phase cary et al 2015 the concentration of metals in the soil solution at any given time is governed by a number of inter related processes including intrinsic soil conditions such as ph eh organic matter the rate of clays cec mapanda et al 2005 kabata pendias 2004 the ability to predict the concentration of a given metal in the soil solution depends on the accuracy of changes in soil environmental conditions over time such as the degradation of the organic matter changes in ph redox potential or soil solution composition due to various schemes such as irrigation with treated wastewaters cary et al 2015 the extent of vertical contamination is related to the soil solution and surface chemistry of the soil matrix irrigation can have adverse effects on soil properties thereby on sustainable productivity if not regularly monitored timely monitoring helps to avoid negative effects of irrigation on soil properties so that irrigation could continue its contribution to the diversification of agriculture henr and hogg 2003 this means irrigation should be managed so that it can minimize adverse effects on soil quality the effects of irrigating with wastewater on soil chemical properties were reported by many researchers moreover the effects of irrigation on soil physicochemical properties and metals mobility in arid and semi arid environments were well documented however there is little information about the effects of treated wastewater irrigation systems on soil physicochemical properties as well as on major and trace elements and its vertical and lateral distribution in the irrigated soils the objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of two irrigation systems on the lateral and vertical distribution of some metals and major elements in the calcisol field irrigated with treated wastewater since 17 years the soil is irrigated by a gravitary furrow system while in the fluvisol area the soil is irrigated by a surface bowl system since 4 years this study is a part of a research program which aims to evaluate the impact of wastewater application on both soils and crops properties in the arid region of sfax belaid et al 2010 2012 2015 the overall goals are to aid management of crop irrigation with wastewater to reduce overexploitation of the local groundwater resources and to improve the water recharge of groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and sampling procedure the studied area is located near the town of sfax tunisia at the west of the secondary sewage treatment plant fig 1 the climate of this region is arid with dry summer occurring from april to september the mean monthly air temperature is ranged from 11 3 to 26 7 c and the annual rainfalls are about 200 mm mostly occurring from october to december however the average annual potential evaporation is very high 1200 mm in this climatic condition combined with water scarcity the majority of cultivars in the area olive trees and orchards before the reuse of tw were dry cultivated two sites were selected as to represent both the soil type diversity as well as the variety of local irrigation systems two main soil types occur in the study area calcisol and fluvisol table 1 the two selected areas produce alternate cycles of crops with successive winter and summer harvest oat sorgho as well as an annual crop alfalfa however due to the difference in soil properties the selected study fields are submitted to different agricultural practices in the calcisol field the successive winter and summer forage crops are harvested in association with permanent olive trees this kind of cropping system requires irrigation by open surface furrows distributed in between each row of olive trees fig 1 in this case of irrigation the treated wastewater flow runs gravitarily from the irrigation ramp to the end of the plot for the field of fluvisol type irrigation is performed by direct surface submersion in small plots bowl irrigation for both the summer and the winter crops the two studied areas also differ in their irrigation duration table 1 the fluvisol field has been irrigated with treated wastewater for only four years while the calcisol has been submitted to wastewater irrigation for seventeen years in order to assess the effects of the wastewater irrigation control fields of both soil types which are never irrigated with any water types have been preserved as close as possible to the irrigated site in the calcisol field vertical and lateral sampling procedures are applied to reveal the effects of the irrigation system in the first time two pedological profiles were drilled in the control area not irrigated and in the field irrigated with the tw then surface soil samples were collected every 10 m in the middle of a plot along a transect which runs perpendicularly to the irrigation canal fig 1 each soil sample is made of a composite from three sub samples taken from 0 to 5 cm depths after the surface litter was removed in the fluvisol field the same vertical soil sampling is applied where two pedological profiles were drilled in the control area not irrigated and in the field irrigated with the tw after the description of the profiles about 2 kg of soil of each horizon were collected all samples were stored in plastic bags on the field and transferred to the laboratory 2 2 soil characterization before characterization the soils were dried gently crushed and sieved to 2 mm the ph soil organic matter som and caco3 were assessed by the standard methods of soil analysis afnor 2004 for the soil ph measurements a 1 2 5 soil water suspension was prepared and left standing overnight som was determined by the walkley and black dichromate oxidation method jackson 1958 the reaction of carbonate with excess of hydrochloric acid as to produce carbon dioxide was used to ascertain the carbonate levels of the soil samples the accuracy of this method was assessed with analar grade calcium carbonate soil samples cec were determined at actual soil ph by the cobaltihexamine method orsini et remy 1976 the soil granulometric fractions were determined by laser granulometer type fritsch analysette 22 the bulk and the true density were measured respectively by the method of archimedes thrust afnor x31 505 1992 and pycnometer method of afnor x31 503 1992 these two parameters are used to calculate the total porosity of soils as following porosity 1 bulk density true density 100 for the determination of the total soil metal and major elements concentrations the homogenized samples were digested using hf hno3 hcl a procedure based on an acid digestion induced by microwave energy was optimized in order to measure the total elemental contents in soils a 0 5 g of soil placed in a teflon vessel 100 ml with 5 ml hno3 3 ml hf and 2 ml hcl was digested for 35 min in a microwave oven anton paar multiwave 3000 in order to neutralise hf excess the digested soils were treated with saturated h3bo3 solution analytical blanks were prepared in the same way without addition of any sample after digestion the samples were filtered and transferred into 50 ml volumetric flasks brought to volume with milliq water and transferred into polyethylene flasks for analysis all samples preparations were done in triplicate the metals concentrations were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry varianspectraa 220 or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer varian spectraa 800 calibration curves were prepared using dilutions of stock solutions 2 3 irrigation water quality only treated wastewater of the wwtp of sfax was used for this experiment this applied treated wastewater always remained alkaline with average salinity ranged between 3 5 and 5 g l 1 and presented a high level suspended matter belaid et al 2010 levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod indeed always largely exceed the tunisian standards for wastewater reuse in irrigation nt 106 03 tw also contains great amounts of nitrate phosphate and potassium the most detected metals in tw are cr 50 1100 μg l 1 cu 60 160 μg l 1 fe 130 1700 μg l 1 ni 18 130 μg l 1 and zn 100 270 μg l 1 in exception of cr these concentrations are relatively low and always meet the tunisian standards belaid et al 2012 2 4 data calculations to allow quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the studied soil profiles two methods have been used for major and trace elements 1 isovolumetric mass balance from rock to soil 2 logratio profile the isovolumetric method was chosen to calculate the stocks of chemical elements of the different soil horizons this method is based on the assumption that the current soil volume is equal to the volume of the altered bedrock required for the formation of this soil the same volume and mass this hypothesis is based on two parameters a chemical reference element and a reference horizon considered as bedrock material soubrand colin et al 2007 the interest of this method is to determine the gains or the losses in elements between the rock and the soil sum of the different horizons of soil in our case study due to the absence of bedrock for the two studied soils we choose an identical horizon for each soil type that will be considered as a reference horizon thus in order to calculate the isovolumetric stocks it has been assumed that the alteration of the reference horizon is at the origin of the formation of the soil which is above millot and bonifas 1955 however in soil profiles original structure and texture of the bedrocks are not preserved so the mass balance calculations require the use of an invariant element to obtain the theoretical thickness to of weathered rock which is required to build up the measured soil thickness soubrand colin et al 2007 in this study si and ba are used as invariant elements respectively for calcisol and fluvisol 1 stocks of elements are calculated by surface unit of each parent rock s0 and soil horizon s using an isovolumetric method millot and bonifas 1955 this calculation includes bulk density d bulk concentration x and soil horizon thickness t s soil horizon d x t s0 soil horizon reference d0 x0 t0 where x and xo are element concentrations respectively of soil horizon and horizon reference d and d0 are bulk densities t and t0 are thickness total input or output of elements in soil were calculated by dividing the cumulated stock of elements in the pedon ssoil sum of all the soil horizon stocks by the stock of element in the parent material or in the deepest horizon considered as a reference level the percentage of relative loss or gain change of an element during treated wastewater irrigation from reference horizon to soil is obtained as follows soubrand colin et al 2007 change 100 s s0 100 2 logratio profile allows on the one hand to visualize the trend of the chemical elements in the pedon and on the other hand to compare different soil profiles thus for a given element x the logratio is determined as follows caillaud et al 2009 logratio x log x log x0 1 with x and x0 are the contents of the element x respectively in a soil horizon and in the corresponding horizon of reference 2 5 statistical analysis in order to further elucidate the geochemical processes that contribute to the mobility of chemical elements in the studied soils a principal component analysis pca was dressed pca as one of the descriptive multivariate analyses is used to study and to graphically represent the maximum of information and correlation between the variables and the observations points all statistical computations were made using microsoft office excel 2010 and statistica data analysis software system version 10 from statsoft inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characterization of calcisol in the calcisol two sampling procedures were applied a vertical one as a pedological profile and a lateral one at the same direction of irrigation water flux that has been interested only the first 5 cm the studied calcisol has an alkaline ph which is almost invariable along the profile table 2 by contrast carbonate contents increase from the surface to the lower horizon that corresponds to the partially dismantled calcareous crust h4 horizon the increase in total limestone content with depth is consistent with the mineralogical analyses found by x ray diffraction which can be explained by the nature of the parent material of the soil sedimentary calcareous crust in the irrigated calcisol profile the total limestone content in the third horizon h3 is higher compared to that of the control profile table 2 it can be suggested that the rate of irrigation with tw 1000 mm led to leaching and accumulation of limestone in this h3 horizon characterised by the presence of limestone clusters and nodules the calcareous crusts detected in the two profiles show until now similar values of ph and total limestone this confirms their identical sedimentary origin already observed in the field the soil cation exchange capacity cec is low and does not exceed the rate of 12 table 2 in addition there is a difference between the irrigated profile and the control one particularly at the depth of organo mineral horizon h1 horizon the levels of organic matter and total nitrogen are also low however values are higher in the irrigated soil than in the non irrigated one which reveals the effect of irrigation with tw on the soil nutrients as already mentioned by belaid et al 2012 regarding the physical property of soils porosity was calculated from the determination of true density and bulk density only on undisturbed samples taken from soil profiles the porosity values of all the horizons of the irrigated soil are comparable to those of the control one table 2 indeed the irrigation with tw did not affect yet the soil porosity for the lateral samples taken at the surface of h1 horizon the soil shows much higher contents of om and caco3 than the h1 horizon itself and the other levels of calcisol profile table 4 however ph values are low than ordinary ones found for this soil thus it may be explained by the accumulation and decomposition of om that usually lead to the ph decrease rattan et al 2005 solis et al 2005 herpin et al 2007 3 2 physico chemical characterization of fluvisol in the fluvisol profile irrigated with the tw a new horizon has been identified ha which does not appear in the control soil it may be an accumulation horizon that has been developed after 4 years of irrigation with tw at the rate of 1000 mm year table 1 the ph of this fluvisol is slightly basic table 2 in addition the values of ph of the irrigated soil are close to that of the non irrigated soil control in contrast to calcisol the total limestone contents in fluvisol profiles show an irregular evolution with depth table 2 however these carbonate contents remain comparable for the first three horizons of all fluvisol profiles in the fluvisol profiles the rate of cec is irregular table 2 the h3 and h4 horizons respectively for the irrigated and the control profiles have the lowest cec values these horizons are composed mainly of fine sand unlike other horizons that have silty to clay sandy textures for both fluvisol profiles the highest cec values are found in the first two horizons these cec values nevertheless vary from one profile to another the highest values are detected in the irrigated profile this difference in cec thus reflects more a variation of the soil texture rather than an effect of irrigation indeed compared to the control soil there is no enrichment of irrigated soils neither in om nor in total nitrogen table 2 the examination of the porosity values shows that tw irrigation has led to the compaction of the surface horizon table2 indeed the porosity of the surface horizon of the irrigated soil profile with the treated wastewater is lower than that of the control soil the relatively fine texture of the surface horizon as well as the mechanical work of the soil used on the irrigated plots only can be at the origin of these modifications of the soil structure at the upper horizon chen et al 2014 3 3 bulk contents of chemical elements in soils the results of major elements contained in soils table 3 show that silicon and calcium are the main constituents for both types of soils this is confirmed by xrd analyses which show that quartz and calcite are the main minerals within the soils result not shown in calcisol the sio2 content decreases with depth unlike cao on the other hand in the fluvisol no evolution was observed for these two elements reflecting the alluvial origin of this soil aluminum and iron represent the two secondary elements in both types of soils it is important to note that at the calcisol the results of the chemical analyses of all the horizons of the two profiles irrigated and control are comparable it is therefore the same type of soil which makes possible the quantification of the rate of enrichment in major and metallic elements in the irrigated soil for fluvisol the chemical analyses allowed us to confirm the similarity of the first three horizons qualitatively comparing the irrigated calcisol to the control one notices a relative enrichment of the surface horizon h1 in some metallic elements in particular chromium for other horizons the levels detected are almost in the same order as those of the natural geochemical background on the other hand the cr zn and cu contents found in soil samples taken from the surface are much larger than those detected in the h1 horizon table 3 in the fluvisol the comparison of the irrigated profile with the control profile shows only a slight enrichment of the horizons h1 and h2 in chromium 3 4 vertical distribution of chemical elements major and trace the study of the vertical distribution of chemical elements major and trace is based on two different methods of calculation the isovolumetric mass balance and the logratio it consists on a comparison between the parent rock and the soil horizons in the different profiles thus each of these two methods gives complementary information the interest is to allow the comparison of the distribution of chemical elements in two different soils in this case between the irrigated soils and the controls 3 4 1 comparison of logratio profiles for major metallic elements the examination of the evolution of logratio for major elements of calcisol fig 2 shows losses of ti na and ca relative to the horizon taken for reference h4 which corresponds to the carbonate crust whereas al fe and k accumulate just in the compact h3 horizon above the crust fig 2 on the other hand the concentrations of si and mg remain practically invariant this result evokes natural decarbonation and desalinization of this soil particularly in the compacted horizon which tends to retain water better associated with an accumulation of fine mineral particles clay minerals or oxides the logratio also indicates the accumulation of all the studied metals particularly in the h2 and h3 horizons with respect to the carbonate crust except pb fig 3 chromium shows a slight loss in surface suggesting a possible leaching of this element in general and with the exception of pb all metallic elements have the same tendency as fe k and al in this soil suggesting that metals are integrated in silicates type minerals however metals have a different evolution which presumably reflects a complexity in their natural mineral carriers whereas fluvisol shows comparatively less significant variations of logratio fig 4 the majority of the elements accumulate around 30 cm mainly for na mg and ti horizon h2 which corresponds to a clay horizon only manganese has a variation in the opposite of the iron while calcium and potassium have similar evolutions of iron and aluminum these results suggest that ca is not carried by carbonates in this soil but by silicates and that there are variations in iron minerals the na follows a particular evolution which seems to align with the variations of texture all metals behave in the same way in the profile and marking the same tendency as magnesium or titanium and to a lesser extent iron and calcium fig 5 copper accumulates more than other metals the increasing order of accumulation is as follows cr zn ni pb cu 3 4 2 wastewater irrigation effects on soils compared to the control soil all major elements evolve in the same way in the control and irrigated calcisol except for sodium and titanium fig 2 na and ti have exactly the same logratio in the calcisol plot irrigated with treated wastewater while their logratio differs by an order of magnitude in the control plot the behavior of metals in the irrigated calcisol is different compared to control one however trends suggest that irrigation favors the accumulation of metals in the upper layer particularly copper and chromium fig 3 in the control fluvisol profile according to their trends the major elements form two groups the first is formed by na mg and ti while fe al ca and k constitute the second group fig 4 the mn is the only element showing an evolution quite opposite to those of the elements of the second group in the irrigated profile the same grouping of elements as in the control profile is distinguished but with a relatively different trend the elements ti mg and na show identical evolutions along this profile at the h3 horizon all major elements have relative losses regarding to the reference horizon with the exception of barium and manganese on the other hand at the level of ha horizon all the elements again show relative enrichments suggesting thus that this horizon is indeed a horizon of accumulation all the metals show the same evolution as those observed in the control profile fig 5 however at the level of the ha horizon of the irrigated profile there is a slight enrichment in metals compared to the reference horizon as previously for ti mg and na thus in fluvisol the metallic elements have similar distributions to the same major elements i e ti mg and na in addition whether on surface or at depth the metal enrichments are all found in the same direction namely cu pb ni zn cr in logratio we can compare the trends but not the absolute values this requires quantitative study provided by the balance sheets of the isovolumetric stocks 3 5 quantitative study by isovolumetric mass balance the determination of this parameter is based on the choice of a chemical element of reference considered as invariant at the scale of the profile during pedogenesis several elements can remain immobile sc ti zr and therefore can be used as an invariant element hernandez et al 2003 shotyk et al 2000 soubrand colin et al 2007 in the case of sediments elements such as al fe and si can also be used as invariant elements woitke et al 2003 ghrefat and yusuf 2006 huang and lin 2003 lu et al 2005 due to lack of reference for the two studied soils calcisol and fluvisol we tried to choose the invariant elements from the chemical analyzes made on the soil profiles in the case of calcisol iron and silicon are the two least variable elements in this soil their low variabilities are attributed to their high levels in this soil the calculation of isovolumetric stocks from these two elements shows comparable results in the case of fluvisol it is the barium that gives the best results for the calculation of isovolumetric stocks 3 5 1 isovolumetric mass balance for calcisol for the control profile the alteration thickness of the rock is 40 cm whereas the actual soil thickness is 35 cm for the irrigated profile the calculated alteration thickness is of the order of 31 cm against an actual thickness of the soil of 30 cm table 5 we can therefore assume that there was no loss of soil volume the comparison of the two profiles irrigated and control shows comparable losses in al fe ti and mg which goes against a disturbance by treated wastewater irrigation table 5 on the other hand in the irrigated profile the decarbonation is more pronounced loss ca 69 than in the control one loss ca 45 in addition the loss of sodium is higher in the profile irrigated with tw these results are consistent with observations reported in the previous study with an increase of exchangeable sodium esp with depth belaid et al 2010 this effect is induced by irrigation which favors the leaching of na in this type of soil with regard to metals a clear influence of irrigation with tw on the isovolumetric stocks of cr has been observed this element showing a loss of 25 in the control profile records a gain of 19 in the irrigated soil on the other hand according to another study belaid et al 2015 chromium is essentially accumulated at the surface quantitatively stocks of pb and ni do not change with irrigation but their distributions in the soil vary thus in irrigated soil these two elements accumulate at the horizon h2 however the stocks of zn and cu show a loss in the irrigated soil which can correspond to the absorption by the cultivated plants especially since the complexation of these two elements with the humic compounds resulting from recycling of the mo favors their phyto uptake rattan et al 2005 bidar et al 2008 hao et al 2009 belaid et al 2012 3 5 2 isovolumetric mass balance for fluvisol the balance of the isovolumetric stocks of major and metallic elements as well as the alteration thicknesses calculated for the two soil profiles are presented in table 5 all the calculated thicknesses tc are close to the actual soil thicknesses t0 showing that the studied system is isovolumetric the results show that in the two fluvisol profiles the si is the only element that shows a loss as observed by the logratio however the si losses recorded in the irrigated profiles are comparable to those recorded in the control profile and therefore do not appear to be disturbed by irrigation on the other hand in the irrigated profile the accumulations in major elements are less important than those observed in the control soil and one can consider that the irrigation caused a loss of these elements the loss of al is due to the migration of fine clay particles while the elements ca na and k are leached in soluble and exchangeable forms belaid et al 2010 quantitatively tw irrigation caused a double accumulation in cr and a one third increase in zn and cu stocks too table 5 stocks of ni and pb are virtually invariable 3 6 lateral variability of metals contents in upper calcisol the metal levels in soils show a spatial variability along the transect fig 6 i e from the arrival of irrigation water to the end of the plot at the length of 180 m fig 1 indeed along the transect zn cr and cu contents decrease with the distance until reaching relatively stable values thus even approximately the levels found in the last two points at the end of the plot can be considered as the contents initially within the soil therefore values above this baseline may be considered as exogenous inputs carried by treated wastewater assadian et al 1998 and 1999 found a similar spatial variation in transects made perpendicularly to the irrigation canal they noted that the total metals contents decrease away from the channel of the irrigation intake while no significant variation is observed in a transect made parallel to the irrigation canal the orientation of the irrigation system is therefore a determining factor in the spatial variability of metals in the soil in fact when the soil is saturated the surface runoff dominated the transport processes that s why in such condition yu et al 2011 have shown that pollutants in colloidal forms were found more in surface flow than in soil drainage moreover in the treated wastewater the metals are mainly in colloidal forms belaid et al 2012 the lower breakthrough of these elements in the subsurface was resulted by the filtration of colloids in the top soil layer chen et al 2005 yu et al 2011 3 7 effects of irrigation system on spatial variability of metallic elements in a furrow irrigation system applied in the calcisol field hydrological phenomena infiltration runoff and erosion and soil compaction are the main factors responsible for the spatial variability of elements distribution in the soil mateos and oyonarte 2005 moreover the irrigation intensity and its temporal variation govern the dynamism of the colloid concentrations in both surface runoff and subsurface flow zhang et al 2016 in fact the solutes contained in the irrigation water i e metal elements will be accumulated in the soil located mainly near the irrigation source of course this phenomenon occurs in the case where irrigation water is considered as the main transport vector assadian et al 1999 in our study the highest levels of metals in the transect were found at 10 m from the irrigation source fig 6 the metals carried by irrigation water whether in soluble or particular form settled down a reduced distance thus the decrease observed beyond this distance 10 m is due on the one hand the attenuation of the phenomenon of metals direct transport by irrigation water and on the other hand the small slope of the irrigated plot in the order of 1 indeed soil particles eroded by irrigation water especially near the discharge of irrigation channel will be transported and deposited more or less far depending on the steepness of the slope the intensity of the infiltration and the presence of plant residues mateos and oyonarte 2005 on the other hand in tw the metals are in a labile or colloidal form belaid et al 2012 that s why they are transported over long distances in the case of fluvisol the applied bowl irrigation system favors the vertical mobility of the eroded particles and associated elements thus after 4 years of irrigation with a volume of 1000 mm year a new accumulation horizon was developed at 90 cm depth in addition it appears that the majority of the elements major and traces that have been leached into the upper horizons have been accumulated at this horizon with high irrigation intensity a preferential flow and transport occurred causing a considerable leaching of soil particles koestel and jorda 2014 jacobsen et al 1997 the presence of a continuous macropore system and the kinetics of the detachment of particles from the macropore walls are the main conditions controlling the detachment and further transport of particles jacobsen et al 1997 the particle detachment seems partly diffused and strongly dependent on soil texture as well as clay and organic matter contents koestel and jorda 2014 jacobsen et al 1997 in the fluvisol h3 horizon has the lower level of om clay content and cec however its level of porosity is the highest table 2 all these parameters favour particles detachment and transport from this soil layer and their deposition down in the new soil horizon ha of the irrigated fluvisol it seems that this irrigation system has largely disrupted the vertical distribution of all the elements along this soil unlike to calcisol where applied furrow irrigation only slightly disturbed the top soil horizon 3 8 principal component analysis pca in order to further elucidate the geochemical processes that contribute to the mobility of chemical elements in the studied soils a principal component analysis pca was dressed all the chemical analysis of major and metallic elements as well as soils properties relative to different soils layers 23 variables and 15 observations are employed for this pca figs 7 and 8 the number of factors generated from pca indicates the total number of possible sources of variation in the chemical data the first three components extracted have eigenvalues greater than 1 and account for 90 of the total variance in the dataset the first factor which explains 71 of the total variance is considered as major factor controlling the relative proportions of chemical element existing in the soils layers fig 7 factors 2 and 3 are not as important as the first one and explain only about 11 and 8 respectively the different variables are represented according to the factors 1 and 2 which explain together 80 of the variance and thus the account for the majority of the variance in the original dataset fig 7 factor 1 has strong positive loadings of all major and metallic elements except si and ca with soils parameters as clay silt and om contents as well as cec and bulk density bai et al 2011 reported factors like om soil texture ph and cec to affect the mobility of elements in soils these confirm that the mobility of chemical elements in soils is governed by motilities of fine fraction of soils and by the organo mineral colloids sepehrnia et al 2018 heavy metals tend to have strong affiliation with inorganic colloids like clay minerals bradl 2004 clay minerals have binding potential and are known to contribute significantly to the level of metals in soils moreover in the case of irrigation with treated wastewater usually a close relationship between metals and om of irrigated soils is found kebonye et al 2017 herre et al 2004 indeed soil om is capable to holding and or fixing metals quite strongly löv et al 2018 hafeez et al 2013 and that may explain why there is a strong correlation in the majority of soils studied classes kebonye et al 2017 herre et al 2004 the second factor accounting for 11 of total variance presents positive loading of si and sand fraction in fact this fraction is essentially composed by silicate minerals due to their calcareous characteristics the studied soils present high buffer capacities belaid et al 2010 that s why the ph don t affect metals mobility the third factor 8 of variance shows a positive correlation between ca and total carbonates the projection of the soils samples according to the two factors and the spatial distribution maps of f1 and f2 scores leads to distinguish different groups fig 8 group 1 is formed by the upper layers of fluvisol either irrigated or not and the accumulation horizon ha formed in the irrigated fluvisol these horizons have fine texture with high cec and relatively elevate om content it appears that these horizons are the most vulnerable for metals fixation and complexation group 2 is composed by the bottom horizons of fluvisol either irrigated or not presenting sandy texture with low cec and om contents these horizons are more exposed to particles loss associated with chemical elements as shown by logratio fig 3 group 3 is formed by all calcisol layers either irrigated or not the irrigation has slightly affected the vertical mobility of chemical elements of this soil except for ca where a high rate of total carbonate was detected in the bottom layer of the irrigated calcisol this decarbonation is already expected by logratio profile fig 2 and the isovolumetric mass balance table 5 4 conclusion the vertical distribution of metals in soils was examined by adopting two approaches qualitative and quantitative the qualitative study using logratio reveals that in the case of calcisol furrow irrigation leads to the lixiviation of major elements ca na this phenomena is favoured by the relative high permeability of this soil however with the following irrigation system logratio suggests trends of accumulation of certain metals cr ni cu and zn carried out by the tw in the upper of the first soil layer this trend is confirmed by soil sampling limited to the finest topsoil layer 0 5 cm after only four years the bowl irrigation system applied in the fluvisol leads to the leaching down of the major and metal elements if this process stills continuous this soil will loose its fertility indeed to preserve soil properties farmers should change the actual used irrigation system or reduce the irrigation rate less than 1000 mm acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the valuable cooperation of crda sfax staff members during both the site selection and soil sampling stages 
10867,treated wastewater irrigation usually leads to the increase of metals contents in soils and affects their mobilities and distributions the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of treated wastewater irrigation systems on the vertical and lateral distribution of metals in soils two irrigated sites with treated wastewater were chosen the first is composed of a calcisol soil type irrigated since 17 years with a furrow irrigation system the second one fluvisol irrigated since 4 years with a bowl irrigation system in both sites a vertical soil sampling is made as a pedological profile in the irrigated soil and the non irrigated one control moreover in the calcisol another lateral soil sampling is carried out in the same direction of irrigation water flux all the soils samples were characterised by their major and metal contents as well as some soils physicochemical properties to evaluate the vertical distribution of metals in soils two parameters are calculated the logratio and the isovolumetric mass balance as qualitative and quantitative tools respectively in the irrigated calcisol the logratio shows a slight enrichment of metals in the upper soil layer mainly for cr the isovolumetric mass balance confirms this trend for cr but in contrast the stocks of zn and cu in the soil have decreased the logratio for the fluvisol reveals an accumulation of all the metals in a new created horizon at 90 cm of the depth quantitatively the stocks of cr zn and cu in this soil have increased however in the case of calcisol the furrow irrigation system favors the lateral distribution of metals rather than the vertical variability keywords calcisol fluvisol furrow irrigation bowl irrigation logratio isovolumetric mass balance 1 introduction suitability of any irrigation water for agriculture depends mostly on its chemical composition and conditions of use the main factors determining the conditions of use are soil texture total water salinity crop to be irrigated climate management practices and the skill of the water user singh et al 2018 al ghobari 2011 the treated wastewater tw is used for several agricultural purposes thus irrigation in the suburbs of cities is the most interesting sector indeed the tw have the advantage of being produced constantly and being already in the pipes at the wastewater treatment plant this should encourage agricultural use in peri urban areas located nearby these plants however irrigation with treated wastewater can affect the vertical distribution and mobility of trace and major elements in irrigated soils pedrero et al 2010 belaid et al 2015 one of these impacts is of course upon the soil itself irrigation often represents a large increase in the amount of water which would pass through a soil profile under natural conditions and has the capacity to accelerate mineral weathering to transport and leach soluble and colloidal materials to change soil structure and to raise the local water table sepehrnia et al 2018 rousseau et al 2004 these effects depend upon the intensity of irrigation irrigation water of poor quality has the added capacity to inflict critical damage especially upon soil structure löv et al 2018 murray and grant 2007 although the low concentration of metals in tw it is shown that irrigation may eventually lead to their accumulation in the irrigated soils rattan et al 2005 the extent of metal contents increased in irrigated soils depends on both the period and rate of wastewater application rattan et al 2005 solis et al 2005 kalavrouziotis et al 2008 nayek et al 2010 belaid et al 2012 indeed retention and mobility of metals in soil are governed by various phenomena mechanical physicochemical even biological sherene 2010 quenea et al 2009 as well as the interrelationships between metals in soils kalavrouziotis et al 2009 metals in the soil solution are subject to mass transfer out of the system by leaching to groundwater plant uptake or volatilization at the same time metals participate in chemical reactions with the soil solid phase cary et al 2015 the concentration of metals in the soil solution at any given time is governed by a number of inter related processes including intrinsic soil conditions such as ph eh organic matter the rate of clays cec mapanda et al 2005 kabata pendias 2004 the ability to predict the concentration of a given metal in the soil solution depends on the accuracy of changes in soil environmental conditions over time such as the degradation of the organic matter changes in ph redox potential or soil solution composition due to various schemes such as irrigation with treated wastewaters cary et al 2015 the extent of vertical contamination is related to the soil solution and surface chemistry of the soil matrix irrigation can have adverse effects on soil properties thereby on sustainable productivity if not regularly monitored timely monitoring helps to avoid negative effects of irrigation on soil properties so that irrigation could continue its contribution to the diversification of agriculture henr and hogg 2003 this means irrigation should be managed so that it can minimize adverse effects on soil quality the effects of irrigating with wastewater on soil chemical properties were reported by many researchers moreover the effects of irrigation on soil physicochemical properties and metals mobility in arid and semi arid environments were well documented however there is little information about the effects of treated wastewater irrigation systems on soil physicochemical properties as well as on major and trace elements and its vertical and lateral distribution in the irrigated soils the objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of two irrigation systems on the lateral and vertical distribution of some metals and major elements in the calcisol field irrigated with treated wastewater since 17 years the soil is irrigated by a gravitary furrow system while in the fluvisol area the soil is irrigated by a surface bowl system since 4 years this study is a part of a research program which aims to evaluate the impact of wastewater application on both soils and crops properties in the arid region of sfax belaid et al 2010 2012 2015 the overall goals are to aid management of crop irrigation with wastewater to reduce overexploitation of the local groundwater resources and to improve the water recharge of groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and sampling procedure the studied area is located near the town of sfax tunisia at the west of the secondary sewage treatment plant fig 1 the climate of this region is arid with dry summer occurring from april to september the mean monthly air temperature is ranged from 11 3 to 26 7 c and the annual rainfalls are about 200 mm mostly occurring from october to december however the average annual potential evaporation is very high 1200 mm in this climatic condition combined with water scarcity the majority of cultivars in the area olive trees and orchards before the reuse of tw were dry cultivated two sites were selected as to represent both the soil type diversity as well as the variety of local irrigation systems two main soil types occur in the study area calcisol and fluvisol table 1 the two selected areas produce alternate cycles of crops with successive winter and summer harvest oat sorgho as well as an annual crop alfalfa however due to the difference in soil properties the selected study fields are submitted to different agricultural practices in the calcisol field the successive winter and summer forage crops are harvested in association with permanent olive trees this kind of cropping system requires irrigation by open surface furrows distributed in between each row of olive trees fig 1 in this case of irrigation the treated wastewater flow runs gravitarily from the irrigation ramp to the end of the plot for the field of fluvisol type irrigation is performed by direct surface submersion in small plots bowl irrigation for both the summer and the winter crops the two studied areas also differ in their irrigation duration table 1 the fluvisol field has been irrigated with treated wastewater for only four years while the calcisol has been submitted to wastewater irrigation for seventeen years in order to assess the effects of the wastewater irrigation control fields of both soil types which are never irrigated with any water types have been preserved as close as possible to the irrigated site in the calcisol field vertical and lateral sampling procedures are applied to reveal the effects of the irrigation system in the first time two pedological profiles were drilled in the control area not irrigated and in the field irrigated with the tw then surface soil samples were collected every 10 m in the middle of a plot along a transect which runs perpendicularly to the irrigation canal fig 1 each soil sample is made of a composite from three sub samples taken from 0 to 5 cm depths after the surface litter was removed in the fluvisol field the same vertical soil sampling is applied where two pedological profiles were drilled in the control area not irrigated and in the field irrigated with the tw after the description of the profiles about 2 kg of soil of each horizon were collected all samples were stored in plastic bags on the field and transferred to the laboratory 2 2 soil characterization before characterization the soils were dried gently crushed and sieved to 2 mm the ph soil organic matter som and caco3 were assessed by the standard methods of soil analysis afnor 2004 for the soil ph measurements a 1 2 5 soil water suspension was prepared and left standing overnight som was determined by the walkley and black dichromate oxidation method jackson 1958 the reaction of carbonate with excess of hydrochloric acid as to produce carbon dioxide was used to ascertain the carbonate levels of the soil samples the accuracy of this method was assessed with analar grade calcium carbonate soil samples cec were determined at actual soil ph by the cobaltihexamine method orsini et remy 1976 the soil granulometric fractions were determined by laser granulometer type fritsch analysette 22 the bulk and the true density were measured respectively by the method of archimedes thrust afnor x31 505 1992 and pycnometer method of afnor x31 503 1992 these two parameters are used to calculate the total porosity of soils as following porosity 1 bulk density true density 100 for the determination of the total soil metal and major elements concentrations the homogenized samples were digested using hf hno3 hcl a procedure based on an acid digestion induced by microwave energy was optimized in order to measure the total elemental contents in soils a 0 5 g of soil placed in a teflon vessel 100 ml with 5 ml hno3 3 ml hf and 2 ml hcl was digested for 35 min in a microwave oven anton paar multiwave 3000 in order to neutralise hf excess the digested soils were treated with saturated h3bo3 solution analytical blanks were prepared in the same way without addition of any sample after digestion the samples were filtered and transferred into 50 ml volumetric flasks brought to volume with milliq water and transferred into polyethylene flasks for analysis all samples preparations were done in triplicate the metals concentrations were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry varianspectraa 220 or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer varian spectraa 800 calibration curves were prepared using dilutions of stock solutions 2 3 irrigation water quality only treated wastewater of the wwtp of sfax was used for this experiment this applied treated wastewater always remained alkaline with average salinity ranged between 3 5 and 5 g l 1 and presented a high level suspended matter belaid et al 2010 levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod indeed always largely exceed the tunisian standards for wastewater reuse in irrigation nt 106 03 tw also contains great amounts of nitrate phosphate and potassium the most detected metals in tw are cr 50 1100 μg l 1 cu 60 160 μg l 1 fe 130 1700 μg l 1 ni 18 130 μg l 1 and zn 100 270 μg l 1 in exception of cr these concentrations are relatively low and always meet the tunisian standards belaid et al 2012 2 4 data calculations to allow quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the studied soil profiles two methods have been used for major and trace elements 1 isovolumetric mass balance from rock to soil 2 logratio profile the isovolumetric method was chosen to calculate the stocks of chemical elements of the different soil horizons this method is based on the assumption that the current soil volume is equal to the volume of the altered bedrock required for the formation of this soil the same volume and mass this hypothesis is based on two parameters a chemical reference element and a reference horizon considered as bedrock material soubrand colin et al 2007 the interest of this method is to determine the gains or the losses in elements between the rock and the soil sum of the different horizons of soil in our case study due to the absence of bedrock for the two studied soils we choose an identical horizon for each soil type that will be considered as a reference horizon thus in order to calculate the isovolumetric stocks it has been assumed that the alteration of the reference horizon is at the origin of the formation of the soil which is above millot and bonifas 1955 however in soil profiles original structure and texture of the bedrocks are not preserved so the mass balance calculations require the use of an invariant element to obtain the theoretical thickness to of weathered rock which is required to build up the measured soil thickness soubrand colin et al 2007 in this study si and ba are used as invariant elements respectively for calcisol and fluvisol 1 stocks of elements are calculated by surface unit of each parent rock s0 and soil horizon s using an isovolumetric method millot and bonifas 1955 this calculation includes bulk density d bulk concentration x and soil horizon thickness t s soil horizon d x t s0 soil horizon reference d0 x0 t0 where x and xo are element concentrations respectively of soil horizon and horizon reference d and d0 are bulk densities t and t0 are thickness total input or output of elements in soil were calculated by dividing the cumulated stock of elements in the pedon ssoil sum of all the soil horizon stocks by the stock of element in the parent material or in the deepest horizon considered as a reference level the percentage of relative loss or gain change of an element during treated wastewater irrigation from reference horizon to soil is obtained as follows soubrand colin et al 2007 change 100 s s0 100 2 logratio profile allows on the one hand to visualize the trend of the chemical elements in the pedon and on the other hand to compare different soil profiles thus for a given element x the logratio is determined as follows caillaud et al 2009 logratio x log x log x0 1 with x and x0 are the contents of the element x respectively in a soil horizon and in the corresponding horizon of reference 2 5 statistical analysis in order to further elucidate the geochemical processes that contribute to the mobility of chemical elements in the studied soils a principal component analysis pca was dressed pca as one of the descriptive multivariate analyses is used to study and to graphically represent the maximum of information and correlation between the variables and the observations points all statistical computations were made using microsoft office excel 2010 and statistica data analysis software system version 10 from statsoft inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characterization of calcisol in the calcisol two sampling procedures were applied a vertical one as a pedological profile and a lateral one at the same direction of irrigation water flux that has been interested only the first 5 cm the studied calcisol has an alkaline ph which is almost invariable along the profile table 2 by contrast carbonate contents increase from the surface to the lower horizon that corresponds to the partially dismantled calcareous crust h4 horizon the increase in total limestone content with depth is consistent with the mineralogical analyses found by x ray diffraction which can be explained by the nature of the parent material of the soil sedimentary calcareous crust in the irrigated calcisol profile the total limestone content in the third horizon h3 is higher compared to that of the control profile table 2 it can be suggested that the rate of irrigation with tw 1000 mm led to leaching and accumulation of limestone in this h3 horizon characterised by the presence of limestone clusters and nodules the calcareous crusts detected in the two profiles show until now similar values of ph and total limestone this confirms their identical sedimentary origin already observed in the field the soil cation exchange capacity cec is low and does not exceed the rate of 12 table 2 in addition there is a difference between the irrigated profile and the control one particularly at the depth of organo mineral horizon h1 horizon the levels of organic matter and total nitrogen are also low however values are higher in the irrigated soil than in the non irrigated one which reveals the effect of irrigation with tw on the soil nutrients as already mentioned by belaid et al 2012 regarding the physical property of soils porosity was calculated from the determination of true density and bulk density only on undisturbed samples taken from soil profiles the porosity values of all the horizons of the irrigated soil are comparable to those of the control one table 2 indeed the irrigation with tw did not affect yet the soil porosity for the lateral samples taken at the surface of h1 horizon the soil shows much higher contents of om and caco3 than the h1 horizon itself and the other levels of calcisol profile table 4 however ph values are low than ordinary ones found for this soil thus it may be explained by the accumulation and decomposition of om that usually lead to the ph decrease rattan et al 2005 solis et al 2005 herpin et al 2007 3 2 physico chemical characterization of fluvisol in the fluvisol profile irrigated with the tw a new horizon has been identified ha which does not appear in the control soil it may be an accumulation horizon that has been developed after 4 years of irrigation with tw at the rate of 1000 mm year table 1 the ph of this fluvisol is slightly basic table 2 in addition the values of ph of the irrigated soil are close to that of the non irrigated soil control in contrast to calcisol the total limestone contents in fluvisol profiles show an irregular evolution with depth table 2 however these carbonate contents remain comparable for the first three horizons of all fluvisol profiles in the fluvisol profiles the rate of cec is irregular table 2 the h3 and h4 horizons respectively for the irrigated and the control profiles have the lowest cec values these horizons are composed mainly of fine sand unlike other horizons that have silty to clay sandy textures for both fluvisol profiles the highest cec values are found in the first two horizons these cec values nevertheless vary from one profile to another the highest values are detected in the irrigated profile this difference in cec thus reflects more a variation of the soil texture rather than an effect of irrigation indeed compared to the control soil there is no enrichment of irrigated soils neither in om nor in total nitrogen table 2 the examination of the porosity values shows that tw irrigation has led to the compaction of the surface horizon table2 indeed the porosity of the surface horizon of the irrigated soil profile with the treated wastewater is lower than that of the control soil the relatively fine texture of the surface horizon as well as the mechanical work of the soil used on the irrigated plots only can be at the origin of these modifications of the soil structure at the upper horizon chen et al 2014 3 3 bulk contents of chemical elements in soils the results of major elements contained in soils table 3 show that silicon and calcium are the main constituents for both types of soils this is confirmed by xrd analyses which show that quartz and calcite are the main minerals within the soils result not shown in calcisol the sio2 content decreases with depth unlike cao on the other hand in the fluvisol no evolution was observed for these two elements reflecting the alluvial origin of this soil aluminum and iron represent the two secondary elements in both types of soils it is important to note that at the calcisol the results of the chemical analyses of all the horizons of the two profiles irrigated and control are comparable it is therefore the same type of soil which makes possible the quantification of the rate of enrichment in major and metallic elements in the irrigated soil for fluvisol the chemical analyses allowed us to confirm the similarity of the first three horizons qualitatively comparing the irrigated calcisol to the control one notices a relative enrichment of the surface horizon h1 in some metallic elements in particular chromium for other horizons the levels detected are almost in the same order as those of the natural geochemical background on the other hand the cr zn and cu contents found in soil samples taken from the surface are much larger than those detected in the h1 horizon table 3 in the fluvisol the comparison of the irrigated profile with the control profile shows only a slight enrichment of the horizons h1 and h2 in chromium 3 4 vertical distribution of chemical elements major and trace the study of the vertical distribution of chemical elements major and trace is based on two different methods of calculation the isovolumetric mass balance and the logratio it consists on a comparison between the parent rock and the soil horizons in the different profiles thus each of these two methods gives complementary information the interest is to allow the comparison of the distribution of chemical elements in two different soils in this case between the irrigated soils and the controls 3 4 1 comparison of logratio profiles for major metallic elements the examination of the evolution of logratio for major elements of calcisol fig 2 shows losses of ti na and ca relative to the horizon taken for reference h4 which corresponds to the carbonate crust whereas al fe and k accumulate just in the compact h3 horizon above the crust fig 2 on the other hand the concentrations of si and mg remain practically invariant this result evokes natural decarbonation and desalinization of this soil particularly in the compacted horizon which tends to retain water better associated with an accumulation of fine mineral particles clay minerals or oxides the logratio also indicates the accumulation of all the studied metals particularly in the h2 and h3 horizons with respect to the carbonate crust except pb fig 3 chromium shows a slight loss in surface suggesting a possible leaching of this element in general and with the exception of pb all metallic elements have the same tendency as fe k and al in this soil suggesting that metals are integrated in silicates type minerals however metals have a different evolution which presumably reflects a complexity in their natural mineral carriers whereas fluvisol shows comparatively less significant variations of logratio fig 4 the majority of the elements accumulate around 30 cm mainly for na mg and ti horizon h2 which corresponds to a clay horizon only manganese has a variation in the opposite of the iron while calcium and potassium have similar evolutions of iron and aluminum these results suggest that ca is not carried by carbonates in this soil but by silicates and that there are variations in iron minerals the na follows a particular evolution which seems to align with the variations of texture all metals behave in the same way in the profile and marking the same tendency as magnesium or titanium and to a lesser extent iron and calcium fig 5 copper accumulates more than other metals the increasing order of accumulation is as follows cr zn ni pb cu 3 4 2 wastewater irrigation effects on soils compared to the control soil all major elements evolve in the same way in the control and irrigated calcisol except for sodium and titanium fig 2 na and ti have exactly the same logratio in the calcisol plot irrigated with treated wastewater while their logratio differs by an order of magnitude in the control plot the behavior of metals in the irrigated calcisol is different compared to control one however trends suggest that irrigation favors the accumulation of metals in the upper layer particularly copper and chromium fig 3 in the control fluvisol profile according to their trends the major elements form two groups the first is formed by na mg and ti while fe al ca and k constitute the second group fig 4 the mn is the only element showing an evolution quite opposite to those of the elements of the second group in the irrigated profile the same grouping of elements as in the control profile is distinguished but with a relatively different trend the elements ti mg and na show identical evolutions along this profile at the h3 horizon all major elements have relative losses regarding to the reference horizon with the exception of barium and manganese on the other hand at the level of ha horizon all the elements again show relative enrichments suggesting thus that this horizon is indeed a horizon of accumulation all the metals show the same evolution as those observed in the control profile fig 5 however at the level of the ha horizon of the irrigated profile there is a slight enrichment in metals compared to the reference horizon as previously for ti mg and na thus in fluvisol the metallic elements have similar distributions to the same major elements i e ti mg and na in addition whether on surface or at depth the metal enrichments are all found in the same direction namely cu pb ni zn cr in logratio we can compare the trends but not the absolute values this requires quantitative study provided by the balance sheets of the isovolumetric stocks 3 5 quantitative study by isovolumetric mass balance the determination of this parameter is based on the choice of a chemical element of reference considered as invariant at the scale of the profile during pedogenesis several elements can remain immobile sc ti zr and therefore can be used as an invariant element hernandez et al 2003 shotyk et al 2000 soubrand colin et al 2007 in the case of sediments elements such as al fe and si can also be used as invariant elements woitke et al 2003 ghrefat and yusuf 2006 huang and lin 2003 lu et al 2005 due to lack of reference for the two studied soils calcisol and fluvisol we tried to choose the invariant elements from the chemical analyzes made on the soil profiles in the case of calcisol iron and silicon are the two least variable elements in this soil their low variabilities are attributed to their high levels in this soil the calculation of isovolumetric stocks from these two elements shows comparable results in the case of fluvisol it is the barium that gives the best results for the calculation of isovolumetric stocks 3 5 1 isovolumetric mass balance for calcisol for the control profile the alteration thickness of the rock is 40 cm whereas the actual soil thickness is 35 cm for the irrigated profile the calculated alteration thickness is of the order of 31 cm against an actual thickness of the soil of 30 cm table 5 we can therefore assume that there was no loss of soil volume the comparison of the two profiles irrigated and control shows comparable losses in al fe ti and mg which goes against a disturbance by treated wastewater irrigation table 5 on the other hand in the irrigated profile the decarbonation is more pronounced loss ca 69 than in the control one loss ca 45 in addition the loss of sodium is higher in the profile irrigated with tw these results are consistent with observations reported in the previous study with an increase of exchangeable sodium esp with depth belaid et al 2010 this effect is induced by irrigation which favors the leaching of na in this type of soil with regard to metals a clear influence of irrigation with tw on the isovolumetric stocks of cr has been observed this element showing a loss of 25 in the control profile records a gain of 19 in the irrigated soil on the other hand according to another study belaid et al 2015 chromium is essentially accumulated at the surface quantitatively stocks of pb and ni do not change with irrigation but their distributions in the soil vary thus in irrigated soil these two elements accumulate at the horizon h2 however the stocks of zn and cu show a loss in the irrigated soil which can correspond to the absorption by the cultivated plants especially since the complexation of these two elements with the humic compounds resulting from recycling of the mo favors their phyto uptake rattan et al 2005 bidar et al 2008 hao et al 2009 belaid et al 2012 3 5 2 isovolumetric mass balance for fluvisol the balance of the isovolumetric stocks of major and metallic elements as well as the alteration thicknesses calculated for the two soil profiles are presented in table 5 all the calculated thicknesses tc are close to the actual soil thicknesses t0 showing that the studied system is isovolumetric the results show that in the two fluvisol profiles the si is the only element that shows a loss as observed by the logratio however the si losses recorded in the irrigated profiles are comparable to those recorded in the control profile and therefore do not appear to be disturbed by irrigation on the other hand in the irrigated profile the accumulations in major elements are less important than those observed in the control soil and one can consider that the irrigation caused a loss of these elements the loss of al is due to the migration of fine clay particles while the elements ca na and k are leached in soluble and exchangeable forms belaid et al 2010 quantitatively tw irrigation caused a double accumulation in cr and a one third increase in zn and cu stocks too table 5 stocks of ni and pb are virtually invariable 3 6 lateral variability of metals contents in upper calcisol the metal levels in soils show a spatial variability along the transect fig 6 i e from the arrival of irrigation water to the end of the plot at the length of 180 m fig 1 indeed along the transect zn cr and cu contents decrease with the distance until reaching relatively stable values thus even approximately the levels found in the last two points at the end of the plot can be considered as the contents initially within the soil therefore values above this baseline may be considered as exogenous inputs carried by treated wastewater assadian et al 1998 and 1999 found a similar spatial variation in transects made perpendicularly to the irrigation canal they noted that the total metals contents decrease away from the channel of the irrigation intake while no significant variation is observed in a transect made parallel to the irrigation canal the orientation of the irrigation system is therefore a determining factor in the spatial variability of metals in the soil in fact when the soil is saturated the surface runoff dominated the transport processes that s why in such condition yu et al 2011 have shown that pollutants in colloidal forms were found more in surface flow than in soil drainage moreover in the treated wastewater the metals are mainly in colloidal forms belaid et al 2012 the lower breakthrough of these elements in the subsurface was resulted by the filtration of colloids in the top soil layer chen et al 2005 yu et al 2011 3 7 effects of irrigation system on spatial variability of metallic elements in a furrow irrigation system applied in the calcisol field hydrological phenomena infiltration runoff and erosion and soil compaction are the main factors responsible for the spatial variability of elements distribution in the soil mateos and oyonarte 2005 moreover the irrigation intensity and its temporal variation govern the dynamism of the colloid concentrations in both surface runoff and subsurface flow zhang et al 2016 in fact the solutes contained in the irrigation water i e metal elements will be accumulated in the soil located mainly near the irrigation source of course this phenomenon occurs in the case where irrigation water is considered as the main transport vector assadian et al 1999 in our study the highest levels of metals in the transect were found at 10 m from the irrigation source fig 6 the metals carried by irrigation water whether in soluble or particular form settled down a reduced distance thus the decrease observed beyond this distance 10 m is due on the one hand the attenuation of the phenomenon of metals direct transport by irrigation water and on the other hand the small slope of the irrigated plot in the order of 1 indeed soil particles eroded by irrigation water especially near the discharge of irrigation channel will be transported and deposited more or less far depending on the steepness of the slope the intensity of the infiltration and the presence of plant residues mateos and oyonarte 2005 on the other hand in tw the metals are in a labile or colloidal form belaid et al 2012 that s why they are transported over long distances in the case of fluvisol the applied bowl irrigation system favors the vertical mobility of the eroded particles and associated elements thus after 4 years of irrigation with a volume of 1000 mm year a new accumulation horizon was developed at 90 cm depth in addition it appears that the majority of the elements major and traces that have been leached into the upper horizons have been accumulated at this horizon with high irrigation intensity a preferential flow and transport occurred causing a considerable leaching of soil particles koestel and jorda 2014 jacobsen et al 1997 the presence of a continuous macropore system and the kinetics of the detachment of particles from the macropore walls are the main conditions controlling the detachment and further transport of particles jacobsen et al 1997 the particle detachment seems partly diffused and strongly dependent on soil texture as well as clay and organic matter contents koestel and jorda 2014 jacobsen et al 1997 in the fluvisol h3 horizon has the lower level of om clay content and cec however its level of porosity is the highest table 2 all these parameters favour particles detachment and transport from this soil layer and their deposition down in the new soil horizon ha of the irrigated fluvisol it seems that this irrigation system has largely disrupted the vertical distribution of all the elements along this soil unlike to calcisol where applied furrow irrigation only slightly disturbed the top soil horizon 3 8 principal component analysis pca in order to further elucidate the geochemical processes that contribute to the mobility of chemical elements in the studied soils a principal component analysis pca was dressed all the chemical analysis of major and metallic elements as well as soils properties relative to different soils layers 23 variables and 15 observations are employed for this pca figs 7 and 8 the number of factors generated from pca indicates the total number of possible sources of variation in the chemical data the first three components extracted have eigenvalues greater than 1 and account for 90 of the total variance in the dataset the first factor which explains 71 of the total variance is considered as major factor controlling the relative proportions of chemical element existing in the soils layers fig 7 factors 2 and 3 are not as important as the first one and explain only about 11 and 8 respectively the different variables are represented according to the factors 1 and 2 which explain together 80 of the variance and thus the account for the majority of the variance in the original dataset fig 7 factor 1 has strong positive loadings of all major and metallic elements except si and ca with soils parameters as clay silt and om contents as well as cec and bulk density bai et al 2011 reported factors like om soil texture ph and cec to affect the mobility of elements in soils these confirm that the mobility of chemical elements in soils is governed by motilities of fine fraction of soils and by the organo mineral colloids sepehrnia et al 2018 heavy metals tend to have strong affiliation with inorganic colloids like clay minerals bradl 2004 clay minerals have binding potential and are known to contribute significantly to the level of metals in soils moreover in the case of irrigation with treated wastewater usually a close relationship between metals and om of irrigated soils is found kebonye et al 2017 herre et al 2004 indeed soil om is capable to holding and or fixing metals quite strongly löv et al 2018 hafeez et al 2013 and that may explain why there is a strong correlation in the majority of soils studied classes kebonye et al 2017 herre et al 2004 the second factor accounting for 11 of total variance presents positive loading of si and sand fraction in fact this fraction is essentially composed by silicate minerals due to their calcareous characteristics the studied soils present high buffer capacities belaid et al 2010 that s why the ph don t affect metals mobility the third factor 8 of variance shows a positive correlation between ca and total carbonates the projection of the soils samples according to the two factors and the spatial distribution maps of f1 and f2 scores leads to distinguish different groups fig 8 group 1 is formed by the upper layers of fluvisol either irrigated or not and the accumulation horizon ha formed in the irrigated fluvisol these horizons have fine texture with high cec and relatively elevate om content it appears that these horizons are the most vulnerable for metals fixation and complexation group 2 is composed by the bottom horizons of fluvisol either irrigated or not presenting sandy texture with low cec and om contents these horizons are more exposed to particles loss associated with chemical elements as shown by logratio fig 3 group 3 is formed by all calcisol layers either irrigated or not the irrigation has slightly affected the vertical mobility of chemical elements of this soil except for ca where a high rate of total carbonate was detected in the bottom layer of the irrigated calcisol this decarbonation is already expected by logratio profile fig 2 and the isovolumetric mass balance table 5 4 conclusion the vertical distribution of metals in soils was examined by adopting two approaches qualitative and quantitative the qualitative study using logratio reveals that in the case of calcisol furrow irrigation leads to the lixiviation of major elements ca na this phenomena is favoured by the relative high permeability of this soil however with the following irrigation system logratio suggests trends of accumulation of certain metals cr ni cu and zn carried out by the tw in the upper of the first soil layer this trend is confirmed by soil sampling limited to the finest topsoil layer 0 5 cm after only four years the bowl irrigation system applied in the fluvisol leads to the leaching down of the major and metal elements if this process stills continuous this soil will loose its fertility indeed to preserve soil properties farmers should change the actual used irrigation system or reduce the irrigation rate less than 1000 mm acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the

10868,climate change has been a serious concern in the 21st century and mitigation strategies on its effects are less researched the increase in temperature and changes in rainfall have forced researchers to ponder over reducing the wastage of fresh water this paper deals with the rain water availability and the crop evapotranspiration et c changes occurring and projected to occur over a time period of fifty years three major crops paddy wheat and berseem fodder were considered for three locations observed data and forecasted data for precipitation and temperature was obtained from india meteorological department and can esm2 model respectively the mann kendall mk test and the thiel sen s slope estimator tss test were applied on the crop stage wise aggregated rain water available and the et c to analyze the effects of climate change in addition to the above study the historical and projected means of crop period wise aggregated effective rainfall total net irrigation requirement and total crop water requirement for a range of dates of sowing transplanting for the above mentioned crops and locations were analyzed it was seen by the analysis that the rainwater availability is seen to decrease and the temperatures increase with a delay in the sowing dates in the future scenarios causing an increase in the crop water requirements suitable shifting of the crop sowing or transplanting dates is seen to aid to better exploit the available rainwater and minimize the irrigation application keywords climate change kharif rabi rainfall sowing evapotranspiration 1 introduction the ganga basin is one of the richest basins in the world in terms of water abundance and soil fertility this abundance has led to a rise in the population and in other symbiotic life forms like poultry dairy etc agriculture has been the primary occupation in the basin to cater to the needs of the humans and livestock in the recent times the effects of climate change are creeping in the form of irregular and insufficient precipitation trends in rainfall in the past few decades there has been an increase in the number of extreme events in the basin several researchers have documented studies on climate change and the effect on precipitation in india the global climate has been changing significantly in the last few decades the last three decades have been termed as the warmest decades since the 19th century for south asian countries the temperatures are seen to increase significantly while the rainfall is seen to reduce further lowering the water availability in addition the occurrence of erratic extreme events has also risen ipcc 2013 a number of studies have been done on the temperature and precipitation changes over india the trend of rainfall in india is seen to be decreasing in the past decades while the temperature is seen to increase ipcc 2014a fingar 2008 jain and kumar 2012 joshi et al 2016 similar studies have been carried out on various sub basins of ganga basin duhan and pandey 2015 2013 and also over the entire ganga basin bera 2017 kothyari et al 1997 and they show similar trends with increasing maximum and minimum temperature and decrease in the rainfall amount climate change has a serious effect on crop production and crop water availability it has been seen that the increase in temperature during the crop flowering and reduction in water availability have a serious effect on the crop yield this effect has been seen in indian as well as other locations worldwide kumar and raj gautam 2014 torquebieau 2016 tripathi and mishra 2017 wreford et al 2010 the climate change effects are not only prominent in agricultural sectors but also affects the other dependent sectors like the livestock dependent on the agricultural produce like the forage cultivation rojas downing et al 2017 the ipcc 2014b suggests a number of mitigation strategies in order to mitigate the effects of climate change tripathi and mishra 2017 one such strategies is the changing in the cropping patterns by the farmers many researchers have studied the effect of changing the sowing date on the crop yield harrington et al 1993 jain et al 2017 jalota et al 2012 lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 but limited studies have been done on the availability and changes in the rainfall patterns for the crop periods this may give an insight into the variation of cropping schedules in order to mitigate the climate change effects the monsoon rainfall constitutes about 80 of the annual rainfall fraction in the ganga basin and the indian sub continent while the post monsoon pre monsoon and winter showers add to the rest this distinct division facilitates two major cropping periods viz i kharif june october and ii rabi november may the kharif crops are mostly water intensive crops in comparison with the rabi crops higher rainfall during the rabi season is known to cause damage to the crops the present study deals with one crop in the kharif season paddy rice oryza sativa which is a water intensive major food crop cropping considered here for roorkee ghazipur and karnal and two crops of the rabi season berseem clover trifolium alexandrinum l which is a legume used as a forage crop cropping considered here for roorkee and karnal winter wheat triticum aestivum which is a major food crop cropping considered here for roorkee and ghazipur except for paddy the other two crops are not water intensive crops and give considerable yield with minimal irrigation and rainfall dependency three locations have been selected for study here based on availability of crop data and also the spatial distribution in the ganga basin in the present study an attempt has been made to study the effect of climate change with the on field rainfall availability and corresponding cropping scenarios three spatially distributed locations namely roorkee karnal and ghazipur have been considered for study here observed data for about 30 years for these locations was obtained from the india meteorological department imd the canesm2 climate change data for two representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios based on the green house gas ghg emission levels as per the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has been used twenty years of historical data and thirty years of forecasted data for 2 scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 have been used to study the effects of climate change 2 study area and data the ganga basin along with its tributary basins yamuna chambal kosi betwa etc spans for about 30 of total land area of the indian subcontinent the basin consists mainly of alluvial soils rich in minerals for cropping the ground water recharge during peak monsoon season is considerable but the flow is drastically reduced in the winter or lean season the winter monsoon is a result of western disturbances which may cause moderate to heavy rainfall in the low lying regions fig 1 shows the map of the ganga basin in india and the three locations i roorkee ii ghazipur and iii karnal considered for the present study the experiments at roorkee and ghazipur were conducted as a part of the project titled mitigating climate change impacts on india agriculture by improved irrigation water management funded by the ministry of earth sciences govt of india and natural environment research council uk the project involved collaborative meetings with a number of local farmers at both the locations as a part of this project the experiments at iit roorkee were conducted and monitored carefully with inputs from the local farmers the cropping at ghazipur was conducted as per the annual cropping schedule of a local farmer and the corresponding details were obtained a location on the yamuna basin was also chosen based on the cropping data availability hence the cropping data for karnal for paddy and berseem was used from the data presented in tyagi et al 2000 2003 roorkee is at an elevation of 273 m above msl and is located at 29 52 n and 77 54 e roorkee has a warm and temperate climate roorkee gets significant rainfall in the monsoon and even in the case of winter monsoon rainfall is considerably high the average annual temperature in roorkee is 23 7 c and the average annual rainfall is about 1170 mm the maximum temperature in roorkee goes up to 45 c in peak summers and as low as 1 c in winters field experiments were conducted for two seasons of paddy 2013 14 2014 15 three seasons of berseem 2013 14 2014 15 2016 2017 and one season of wheat 2016 17 on an experimental field located within the premises of the indian institute of technology roorkee roorkee india ghazipur is situated in the eastern part of uttar pradesh on the banks of river ganges it is located at 25 58 n 83 57 e and has an average elevation of 62 meters 203 feet above msl the climate of ghazipur is not very hot or cold the coldest months here are december january and the hottest months are may june the temperature varies from 5 to 17 c in winters and 30 to 42 in summers one season of paddy for june 2014 and two seasons of cropping for wheat nov 2013 and nov 2014 were monitored in collaboration with a local farmer karnal is located in the yamuna basin and the yamuna canal runs through karnal lysimeter experiments on paddy july 1994 two seasons of berseem october 1996 and 1997 were conducted at the research farm of the central soil salinity research institute this farm is located at an elevation of 245 m above msl with latitude of 29 43 n and longitude of 76 58 e the climate of karnal is semi arid with highest monthly temperature of 39 7 c recorded during may and mean monthly minimum temperature of 5 7 c recorded during january 2 1 meteorological data daily observed gridded rainfall data and temperature data for a period of thirty years from 1984 to 2014 was procured from the india meteorological department imd and used for the analysis the gcm data canesm2 from the cmip5 experiments of canadian center for climate modeling and analysis for fifty years was used here data from a number of models were compared with the observed imd data and the canesm2 data was found to be considerably coherent the data comprises of historical data for 20 years 1984 2004 and future modeled data for 30 years 2005 2035 for two scenarios viz rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2 1 1 imd observed data the data obtained here was daily gridded data for precipitation max temperature min temperature for the ganges basin this data was extracted for the locations under study for the various crop periods as per the cropping schedules in roorkee ghazipur and karnal the data was used along with the gcm data to analyze and predict the future changes in water availability and requirements using the mk test and tss test 2 1 2 gcm data three sets of data viz historical 1984 2005 and forecasted data 2006 2035 for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures for the scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were obtained a considerable discrepancy has been observed between the imd observed and the gcm data this bias in the gcm data needs to be corrected before the utilization for analysis purposes the bias correction is done as documented in ghosh and mujumdar 2008 fig 2 shows the cumulative distribution functions cdfs for the imd observed data gcm modeled data and also the bias corrected gcm data there is a significant variation between the imd observed data and the gcm data for all three centers roorkee ghazipur and karnal in addition it can be seen that the imd observed data is in good agreement with the bias corrected gcm values 2 2 field experiments in order to replicate the on field scenarios the sowing and transplanting patterns employed by the local farmers is followed in the experimental work conducted in roorkee while the knowledge of regular farming schedules as employed by the farmers at ghazipur is considered in the case of karnal the experimentation documented in tyagi et al 2000 2003 served as a reference for the farming dates 2 2 1 paddy paddy is a water intensive food crop and is one of the main crops in the ganga basin it is cultivated in the kharif season and its crop period spans through the monsoon table 1 shows the days of transplanting and the crop stages and crop periods for paddy cropping studied here the cropping of paddy in roorkee was done in the premises of civil engineering department of iit roorkee for easy monitoring 20 day old seedlings were transplanted onto the field during the mid july to end of july of 2013 and 2014 based on the variety of the crop the crop was harvested after the monsoon by the end of october 30 day old seedlings of rice crop were transplanted on 4 july in 1994 in the field at karnal and was harvested on 30 october 1994 paddy cropping in ghazipur is usually done by transplanting seedlings between the last week of june to first week of july and harvesting by the end of october fig 3 shows the fao allen et al 1998 crop co efficients k c values for the corresponding date of transplanting dot for the paddy cropping as done in roorkee ghazipur and karnal 2 2 2 berseem berseem is a major fodder forage crop with high nutritive value for livestock it is a leguminous winter crop with upto 5 harvests the sowing season starts during mid october and goes upto mid december based on the previous crop harvest in some regions like roorkee owing to the previous crop harvest for paddy which extends upto late october the sowing is done after mid november this causes a reduction in the number of cuts or harvest similar to alfalfa testa et al 2011 the harvest time rainwater supply etc have a considerable effect on the forage quality table 2 shows the dates of sowing dos and harvesting for berseem cropping at roorkee and karnal fig 4 shows the k c distribution for the five crop seasons based on the crop development and the fao k c distribution berseem was sown on 19th and 16th of october in 1996 and 1997 respectively at karnal the first cut was made at 9 weeks the second and third cut at 5 weeks each respectively the fourth and fifth at 4 and 3 weeks respectively three crop seasons of berseem were sown in the experimental plot in roorkee with three different sowing dates one was in mid november one was early december and the third was in mid december the preceding paddy crop extended up to late october and thus the cropping of berseem was delayed four harvests were done with the last harvest done when the onset of flowering stage occurred in case of roorkee cropping schedule was followed as indicated in table 2 and for karnal it is as reported by tyagi et al 2003 2 2 3 wheat wheat is one of the major food crops in india it is a rabi crop with moderate irrigation requirement heavy rainfall is known to cause serious damage to the crop harvests it is often sown during the last week of november and it is sown up to first week of december wheat was sown in the experimental plot in roorkee on 28th of november 2016 and it was harvested in mid april the cropping in ghazipur was a part of the annual cropping schedule and data was acquired in collaboration with a local farmer at ghazipur the sowing was done in the last week of november or first week of december and was harvested by early to mid april a plot of the k c values for the crop is as below in fig 5 the k c values based on the crop development and fao values and the corresponding dates of sowing are given in table 3 3 methodology this study comprises of two stages in the first stage the variation of rainfall availability and crop evapotranspiration lumped for each crop stage for historical and two future scenarios was analyzed this was done by employing two methods for trend detection the mann kendall test and the theil sen s slope estimator test the second stage deals with the effect of change in sowing transplanting date on the water availability and crop water requirement of the crops 3 1 potential evapotranspiration et 0 and crop evapotranspiration et c the potential evapotranspiration was obtained using temperature data owing to the lack of detailed weather data for the observed and projected time scales the hargreaves samani method for et 0 computation hargreaves and samani 1982 as cited by samani 2000 has been used here the hargreaves samani equation is given as 1 e t 0 0 0135 k t r a t d 1 2 t c 17 8 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration td t max t min c t max is the maximum temperature t min is the minimum temperature and tc is the average daily temperature c r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mm day and kt is the empirical coefficient the value of kt is specific to a site based on its location the value of r a is given based on the latitude of the site the et c is obtained as below 2 e t c e t 0 k c where et c is the crop evapotranspiration mm d k c is the crop coefficient et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d the crop periods are divided into crop stages as specified by fao the crop stages are specified in tables 1 3 for paddy berseem and wheat respectively the daily et c is calculated as per eq 2 the paddy crop stages are assumed as defined by allen et al 1998 although the paddy crop is a water intensive crop the significance of the monsoon rainfall availability is high the crop stages for berseem are taken as the cutting periods and the k c graph is as per development stages of the crop the first stage is considerably longer than the other stages in berseem as the root formation takes place in the first stage and hence the water requirement in this stage is also considerably high the et c drops to et for no crop state once the harvest is done owing to the absence of the crop shoot and leaves for crop evapotranspiration in the case of wheat the crop stages are taken as per the developmental stages of the crop suggested by fao the crop water requirement is high in the second and third stages while it reduces after the grain filling is complete the changes in stage wise available rainfall sar presents a picture of the local effects of changes in climatic conditions and also the future trends that may be anticipated 3 2 trend analysis of etc and precipitation the trend analysis is carried out by applying two robust trend detection techniques viz the mann kendall test and the theil sen slope estimator test these tests are applied to rainfall availability and crop evapotranspiration lumped for each crop stage for each season over 50 years for historical 20 years and future scenarios 30 years 3 2 1 mann kendall mk test mk test is a rank based nonparametric test and has been used by several researchers to detect trends in precipitation data casa and nasello 2014 duhan and pandey 2013 tabari et al 2011 it is based on the test statics s defined as s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where x 1 x 2 x n represent n data points and x j and x j represent the data points at time i and j respectively with j i and s g n x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 a very high positive value of s is an indicator of an increasing trend and a very low negative value indicates a decreasing trend it has been documented that when n 10 the statistic s is approximately normally distributed with the mean e s 0 and its variance is v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value and t k is the number of data points in the kth group the standardized test statistic z is computed by as follows z s 1 v a r s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 v a r s if s 0 the null hypothesis h0 meaning that no significant trend is present is accepted if the test statistic z is not statistically significant i e zα 2 z zα 2 where α is the significance level and zα 2 is the standard normal deviate the value of α in this study is taken as 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 corresponding to 90 95 and 99 confidence level respectively 3 2 2 theil sen s estimator tss the slope of n pairs of data points will be estimated using the theil sen s estimator sen 1968 theil 1950 which is given by the following relation β m e d i a n x j x i j 1 for all i j in which 1 j i n and β is the robust estimate of the trend magnitude a positive value of β indicates an upward trend while a negative value of β indicates a downward trend these methods have been tested robustly and have been the best statistical parameters to estimate the trends in meteorological time series studies 3 3 total crop water requirement tcwr and total net irrigation water requirement tnir the two main forms of water supply are natural precipitation and artificial irrigation the irrigation supply in india is usually done by farmers based on crop inspection or soil inspection or prior knowledge of cropping or government power water supply frequency the errors in inspection may lead to under irrigation or over irrigation of the field a delay in water supply may lead to the crop reaching the wilting stage this may cause irreversible damage to the crops on the contrary excess watering of the crops may cause soil saturation which may eventually harm the yield in case of rabi crops hence a proper watering schedule based on the et c study and information about precipitation occurrence are of considerable significance in avoiding excess or reduced watering of non water intensive crops the daily et c are aggregated for the whole crop period as it gives a lumped value of water utilized by the crops the total crop water requirement tcwr is hence defined as the total value of the crop evapotranspiration aggregated for the whole crop period and is given by eq 3 the total water utilized for rabi crops here berseem and wheat is significant while the daily requirement is considerably low owing to the soil moisture retention and low evaporation in winter season on the contrary the et c in the case of paddy is considerably high owing to the high temperatures in the initial stages of the kharif season the et c sum for a particular stage is given as 3 t c w r day 1 cd e t c where tcwr refers to the total crop water requirement and cd is the total crop duration the rainfall is aggregated similarly considering the effective rainfall eq 4 the value of p eff is considered to be between 50 and 80 for paddy and 70 for other crops as mentioned in fao paper 25 dastane 1975 4 p s day 1 cd p e f f where p s refers to the summation of p eff for the crop duration the total net irrigation water requirement tnir is defined as the total net irrigation water needed to be supplied to the crops for the whole crop period in addition to the available input from the effective precipitation and is given as 5 t n i r t c w r p s where tcwr is the total crop water requirement and p s is the effective precipitation available for irrigation the value of tcwr for different crop stages is usually seen to be greater than the sum of precipitation for rabi crops contrarily in the kharif season a negative value of tnir shows the p s in excess of the tcwr due to the changes in the rainfall patterns owing to changing climatic scenarios the crop scheduling also needs to be altered this is to mitigate the deficits between the tcwr and precipitation availability in this study berseem which is a forage crop with multiple harvests is also considered the value of et c drops to the et 0 value whenever the crop is harvested hence the p s tcwr and tnir are aggregated for each cutting stage and are changed to stage wise summation of p eff p ss stage wise crop water requirement scwr and stage wise net irrigation water requirement snir respectively 4 results and discussions the methodology discussed in the previous sections is employed to analyze the changes in the rainfall trends in the previous years and also for future periods in the context of the total lumped rainwater availability the effect of shifting of the sowing date is also studied by computing the variations in p eff et c and also the corresponding deficit in the rainwater availability w r t the et c 4 1 rainfall and et c trend analysis for current dos dot the mk and tss tests were applied to the stage wise sum of precipitation and et c for the crops paddy karnal ghazipur roorkee berseem karnal roorkee and wheat ghazipur roorkee the z statistic showing a positive value signifies a rising trend while the negative value denotes a decreasing trend the z statistic is seen at 90 95 and 99 confidence level with the value of z being 1 645 1 960 2 576 respectively this has been indicated in the corresponding tables tables 4 6 and 8 with and for 90 95 and 99 confidence levels respectively the values with no asterisks indicate insignificant z values the slope β also signifies the trends over the historical and future time scenarios tables 4 9 show the tabulated values of z and β for the various crops under study for roorkee ghazipur and karnal these are discussed in detail in this section the seasons referred to here are the cropping seasons adopted as in tables 1 3 respectively for paddy berseem and wheat 4 1 1 paddy cropping of two seasons were done in roorkee and for paddy fig 6 shows the z and β for precipitation and et c for roorkee for historical 1984 2004 and future 2005 2035 scenarios for season 1 as per the date of transplanting dot in table 1 for paddy table 4 shows the values for z for precipitation and et c for roorkee ghazipur and karnal as in fig 6 and table 4 the z statistic shows significant positive trends for the two projected scenarios in the first stage and for rcp 8 5 for second stage in the first crop season at roorkee it is evident from table 5 that the β for paddy at roorkee shows insignificant values for et c while for the β for precipitation for the crop with sowing date in the last week of july the precipitation is seen to increase for the second stage significantly in the case of ghazipur precipitation shows a significant positive β for rcp 4 5 for the second stage while the other stages have insignificant β for p and et c the β for karnal is insignificant for et c while it has a considerable variation for precipitation 4 1 2 berseem on observation the z and β values for dos corresponding to the first season of cropping at roorkee as in table 2 for berseem show a varying but insignificant trend table 6 shows the values for z for precipitation and et c for berseem cropping at roorkee and karnal for dos as per the second season at roorkee in the future scenario of rcp 4 5 there is a significant negative trend seen for the second cutting the z values for the dos as per the last season at roorkee also show a varying but insignificant trend in the case of et c the z values for the first cutting in all three seasons show a significant positive trend for rcp 8 5 future scenario this case is seen in the second cutting of the third season also whereas the other scenarios show an insignificant trend on observation from table 6 even though the variations in z values for cropping of berseem at karnal can be seen none of them were within the range of significance levels mentioned before this case is seen for all three scenarios viz historical rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the z for et c shows significant positive value only for the rcp 8 5 scenario for the third stage while the rest are varied insignificant positive and negative values similar trend is seen for the crop with day of transplanting in mid july in the case of ghazipur the projected scenarios show a significant positive trend for z for the third stage of cropping and for precipitation it is significant for rcp 4 5 for the second stage the z values for precipitation for karnal are insignificant while for et c the values for the first and second stage for the projected scenario of rcp 8 5 show a significant positive trend table 7 shows the β values for the various stages of berseem cropping at roorkee and karnal it can be seen that the historical data for the 2nd stage shows a significant positive slope indicating an increase in the stage wise precipitation between 1984 and 2005 for both roorkee and karnal the β values for et c have insignificant slopes in comparison with the β values for precipitation for both locations 4 1 3 wheat wheat is a staple food crop in india after rice and hence the area under wheat cropping is also considerably high tables 8 and 9 show the values of z and β for various crop stages of wheat at roorkee and ghazipur for wheat cropping in roorkee only the first stage shows a significant trend which is a negative value for both future rainfall scenarios while other trends are insignificant the z values for et c for the second stage shows a significant negative trend for the cropping of wheat in ghazipur significant positive z trends can be seen for the third stage of cropping for rcp 4 5 scenario while the historical rainfall shows a positive trend for the fourth stage this is also seen in the β for precipitation for the third stage in the case of et c we can see significant negative trend for the first third and fourth stages for rcp 4 5 while rcp 8 5 shows a positive trend in the fourth stage the historical data shows a positive trend only in the second stage the β value for et c is considerably less in comparison with the precipitation β values also the trends seen in z graphs are reflected in the β study on analyzing section 4 1 the results of the mk and tss tests show that for both kharif and rabi seasons in case of forecasted data rcp 4 5 projects an excess of et and shortfall of p and for rcp 8 5 it is the vice versa the analysis of values of p and et c lumped for each stage helps to decipher the changes in the historical scenarios as well as forecasted scenarios since the study here quantifies the changes in the p and et c for three crops for three spatially distributed locations with varied cropping days and also for three time scenarios it is not justified to generalize the results obtained however this study was successful in enlightening about the possible rainfall and crop et changes that may happen in future stages in comparison to the present and the past years 4 2 sums and precipitation deficits for change in dos dot the previous section dealt with the trends of the stage wise rainfall for the crops with the current practice this section looks into the possibility of changing the dot or dos and the corresponding effects on tnir and tcwr the rainwater is the primary source of water supply for crops and artificial irrigation is applied to substitute the water insufficiency brouwer et al 1985 the overall crop water availability for the entire crop period is analyzed by shifting the date of transplanting date of sowing for two crops paddy and wheat at three locations and for berseem the analysis was done by changing the dos and studying the effect on tcwr and tnir for each cuttings forage harvest the analyses are carried out for historical and future scenarios as well the p s tnir and tcwr are aggregated for the whole season and the means for fifty years historical and forecasted scenarios is obtained for the various dot and dos a plot of this sum shows the decline or increase in the available rainwater which would facilitate the better use of the natural water the range is of dates for changes in dot dos were decided based on the local farmers practices as the sowing is done by farmers based on the rainfall occurrence 4 2 1 paddy paddy is a kharif crop and the date of sowing has a considerable effect on the crop health and yield in addition with the effects of changing climate creeping in an insight into the changes in the rainwater availability patterns is necessary to mitigate its ill effects although paddy is a water intensive crop with excessive water demand the rainwater serves as a significant input in addition to the irrigation water supplied a roorkee roorkee receives moderate to high rainfall during the monsoon season fig 7 shows the p s tnir and tcwr for paddy cropping at roorkee with the dot varying from the last week of june 25th of june to the last week of july 25th of july for historical and future scenarios fig 7 it can be seen from the historical scenario that the water availability or the lumped p s for the crop period decreases as the dot is shifted toward late july while the tcwr variation is not very high the negative tnir seen for the crops with dot up to the first week of july shows that although the paddy crop needs standing water supply the p s is mostly in excess of the tcwr of the crop period in the case of the forecasted scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 show two different temperature and rainfall scenarios owing to the higher temperatures and comparatively lower rainfall projected in the rcp 4 5 scenario the p s is seen to be always below the tcwr values and hence the tnir is always positive and it increases as the dot is shifted toward late july on the contrary in the case of rcp 8 5 the p s is seen to be in excess of the tcwr and hence the tnir is seen to have a negative value for all dot b ghazipur unlike roorkee it can be seen in fig 8 that the rainfall at ghazipur in the monsoon is lower while the temperatures are higher owing to these conditions the tcwr is considerably high and the tnir is also positive throughout the dates of variation the changes in the dot were considered in consultation with the local farmers at ghazipur the cropping is varied for a fortnight last week of june to first week of july the tcwr for all three scenarios is high and the variation in the values of p s tnir and tcwr with the advance in the dot is negligible for the projected scenarios the p s in the case of rcp 4 5 is less for all the dots in comparison with the rcp 8 5 while it is seen to marginally decrease for the historical data c karnal karnal is seen to experience lesser rainfall in comparison with roorkee and ghazipur fig 9 the dot was varied for more than a fortnight in this case from the fourth week of june to third week of july the tcwr is considerably higher for all three scenarios and p s is significantly low and declining on the advance of the dot the necessity for irrigation application in such a scenario is inevitably high and also there is not much of contribution by the rainwater 4 2 2 wheat the windward side of the himalayas receive high rainfall in the monsoon season while during the non monsoon months like the winter season the rainfall occurrence is scarce the winter rainfall is caused by the phenomenon of western disturbances in india hence non water intensive crops are grown during this season also called the rabi cropping season wheat is a primary rabi crop with sowing done from late november to early december although it is less water intensive in comparison to the paddy crop it needs irrigation supply occasionally the effect of changing the sowing date for the cropping of wheat is studied here a roorkee fig 10 shows the variation of p s tnir and tcwr for the whole crop period for various sowing dates the dos for the cropping of wheat in roorkee was varied for more than a fortnight 4th week of nov to 2nd week of dec similar to the cropping of berseem the p s availability and also its variation with the change in dos is not very significant with the delay in sowing date there is an increase in tcwr suggesting a better yield but with advance in dates the harvest may be delayed an also the tnir is seen to increase with advance in dos b ghazipur the cropping of wheat in ghazipur is usually done in last week of november or first week of december hence as seen in fig 11 the dos here is varied from 20 nov to dec 10th in this case while the tcwr and tnir are high and increase with the advance of dos the rainwater availability and also its variability with change in dos is very low hence the farmer s discretion for sowing is necessary 4 2 3 berseem berseem is a forage crop with a maximum of up to five cuttings depending on the date of sowing if the crop is sown after the kharif paddy the sowing date is delayed as the paddy crop extends till the last week of october cropping of berseem by varying the dos up to the late dates of sowing as per farmers practice at roorkee and karnal and its effects on water availability for the crop is discussed here the berseem crop has three stages for each cutting and the et c values reduce to the et value for the no crop environment in this case each cutting harvest can be considered as an individual crop unlike the other crops studied here the tnir and tcwr considered for other crops are here aggregated cutting stage wise and are replaced as stage wise net irrigation water requirement snir and stage wise crop water requirement scwr respectively these cutting stage wise p ss snir and scwr variations are studied here for roorkee and karnal a roorkee the berseem crop in roorkee was sown for three seasons with the date of cropping varying by up to 15 days the three seasons mid november early december mid december the dos was hence varied for 30 days to study the variation of the scwr and snir the cropping was done after the paddy cropping here and hence the initial date of sowing was delayed fig 12 shows the means of aggregated p ss snir and scwr for crop period for various dates of sowing for berseem in roorkee unlike the monsoon the winter rainfall in the ganga basin is very scarce and more random since the solar radiation is also lower during the rabi season the scwr from which includes the soil evaporation and crop et is also low in comparison with the kharif crops since the stages considered refer to harvests cuttings each stage can be considered as a whole crop the stage wise precipitation is seen to increase with the advance in date of sowing for historical and future scenarios alike up to the first week of december in the second stage the rainwater availability reduces and the scwr increases not much variation is seen in the third and fourth stage with the variation in the dos b karnal karnal receives lesser rainfall in comparison to roorkee winter rainfall the dos in this case is varied from mid october to early december the early sowing facilitates one additional cutting harvest by the time there is flowering in berseem in order to obtain five harvests the sowing must be carried out by late october to early november as by the end of april the conditions are unsuitable for the sustenance of the berseem crop fig 18 shows the graphs for five stages of berseem crop in karnal for various dos changed between 15th of october and 30th of november fig 13 as seen in the figure ensemble the water availability for first stage increases marginally and the snir decreases as we shift the dos toward november the snir and the corresponding scwr increases as the dos is shifted ahead for the other cuttings 3 4 5 the deficits also increase as the snir values increase with the shift of dos it can be observed that during mid october the natural water availability is low and the temperature are higher as compared to the temperatures in november and hence an increase in the scwr in the first stage is seen 4 2 4 water saving by change in dos dot the results show that there is an increase in the tnir irrigation requirement of crops with a delay in the sowing date table 10 shows the percentage increase in tnir between the earliest and the latest sowing dates it can be seen that in the majority of instances early sowing is seen to be helpful to reduce the irrigation input to the crops the higher value indicates that there is a significant increase in the irrigation water requirement of the crops with a delay in sowing in section 4 2 the dot dos were varied keeping the water related aspects tcwr tnir and scwr snir into consideration the significance is seen in the high rainfall seasons kharif for crops which are more water intensive paddy rather than the crops which are less water intensive and are in cultivated in the winter cropping season or rabi season which has very low rainfall intensities the changes in the p s and tcwr with the change in the dot is clearly visible in all three scenarios historical and forecasted in roorkee and karnal likewise the change for paddy at ghazipur is not very significant the rabi crops do not show significant changes in terms of the change in rainfall as the number of rainfall events is considerably low while the tcwr shows an increasing pattern as the later crop stages move toward the high temperature days end of feb to march although the increase in et c suggests a better yield in case of wheat the grain yield is affected by the higher temperatures timsina et al 2008 in the case of berseem the crops sown in mid november roorkee as the harvest dates are delayed the later stages tend toward stagnation of tcwr suggesting drying of the crop harvest this is similarly applicable for berseem sown in mid october karnal this shows that as the dos for rabi crops is shifted to the later parts the tnir or the need for supply of irrigation also increases and this can be seen for both the future scenarios table 10 shows the percentage increase in the tnir between the initial and final sowing dates in the ranges suggested for the respective crops and the locations studied this asserts that for a majority of the crops under study for both kharif and rabi cropping early sowing transplantation makes more rainwater available for the crop and hence reduces the irrigation required 5 conclusions the climate change effect mitigation strategies studied in the literature include the change in dates of sowing change in the cultivars to get more heat resistant and less water intensive crops this is apart from the strategies to reduce the climate change itself by reducing the ghg emissions and implementing this in the national and regional policy decisions of the above strategies effect of change in dates of sowing on water availability has been discussed in this paper along with the possible rainfall and et c variations that may occur in the future timescales three crops paddy berseem and wheat were considered for study at three locations viz roorkee ghazipur and karnal the climate data analyzed spanned for about fifty years and included the imd observed historical data gcm projected historical data and gcm projected forecasted data for two rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the local farming dates were obtained and were compared with the changed dates for sowing transplanting two trend detection techniques were employed to study the changes in the previous years as well as the future climate scenarios in addition the effect of changes in date of sowing on the irrigation requirements of the crops is also discussed for these crops for their respective locations the mk test gave an insight into the big picture of the climatic variations in the future scenarios as it is seen in both the seasons kharif and rabi for all the three crops the temperatures are seen to increase as per the rcp 8 5 scenario and hence the corresponding et c is also seen to increase this is also substantiated by the majority of the positive β values seen for the crops for the seasons considered the consecutive study focused on the change in the water requirement of crops with the change in the dos dot it was seen that the delay in the kharif cropping in the discussed window caused a significant increase in the crop irrigation requirement for both the future scenarios on the contrary the increase in tnir was considerably low in case of karnal and very low for ghazipur in the rabi season although the delayed wheat cropping at roorkee shows a considerable increase in the tnir the change is insignificant for ghazipur as seen in kharif cropping this is attributed to the low climate variability in the lower ganga basin as compared to the upper ganga basin or even the upper yamuna basin in the case of berseem fodder crop early sowing where feasible seemed to be productive owing to the supplementary pre winter sunshine for the green fodder production in the case of roorkee since the cropping was done after the paddy crop the tnir was seen to increase for all the stages of harvest in a nutshell it can be concluded that the delay in cropping causes an increase in the crop irrigation requirement owing to the increase in the crop et coupled with the lowered rainfall based on the present study it can be concluded that the possible outcomes obtained need to be weighed with the historical occurrences for better mitigation strategies

10868,climate change has been a serious concern in the 21st century and mitigation strategies on its effects are less researched the increase in temperature and changes in rainfall have forced researchers to ponder over reducing the wastage of fresh water this paper deals with the rain water availability and the crop evapotranspiration et c changes occurring and projected to occur over a time period of fifty years three major crops paddy wheat and berseem fodder were considered for three locations observed data and forecasted data for precipitation and temperature was obtained from india meteorological department and can esm2 model respectively the mann kendall mk test and the thiel sen s slope estimator tss test were applied on the crop stage wise aggregated rain water available and the et c to analyze the effects of climate change in addition to the above study the historical and projected means of crop period wise aggregated effective rainfall total net irrigation requirement and total crop water requirement for a range of dates of sowing transplanting for the above mentioned crops and locations were analyzed it was seen by the analysis that the rainwater availability is seen to decrease and the temperatures increase with a delay in the sowing dates in the future scenarios causing an increase in the crop water requirements suitable shifting of the crop sowing or transplanting dates is seen to aid to better exploit the available rainwater and minimize the irrigation application keywords climate change kharif rabi rainfall sowing evapotranspiration 1 introduction the ganga basin is one of the richest basins in the world in terms of water abundance and soil fertility this abundance has led to a rise in the population and in other symbiotic life forms like poultry dairy etc agriculture has been the primary occupation in the basin to cater to the needs of the humans and livestock in the recent times the effects of climate change are creeping in the form of irregular and insufficient precipitation trends in rainfall in the past few decades there has been an increase in the number of extreme events in the basin several researchers have documented studies on climate change and the effect on precipitation in india the global climate has been changing significantly in the last few decades the last three decades have been termed as the warmest decades since the 19th century for south asian countries the temperatures are seen to increase significantly while the rainfall is seen to reduce further lowering the water availability in addition the occurrence of erratic extreme events has also risen ipcc 2013 a number of studies have been done on the temperature and precipitation changes over india the trend of rainfall in india is seen to be decreasing in the past decades while the temperature is seen to increase ipcc 2014a fingar 2008 jain and kumar 2012 joshi et al 2016 similar studies have been carried out on various sub basins of ganga basin duhan and pandey 2015 2013 and also over the entire ganga basin bera 2017 kothyari et al 1997 and they show similar trends with increasing maximum and minimum temperature and decrease in the rainfall amount climate change has a serious effect on crop production and crop water availability it has been seen that the increase in temperature during the crop flowering and reduction in water availability have a serious effect on the crop yield this effect has been seen in indian as well as other locations worldwide kumar and raj gautam 2014 torquebieau 2016 tripathi and mishra 2017 wreford et al 2010 the climate change effects are not only prominent in agricultural sectors but also affects the other dependent sectors like the livestock dependent on the agricultural produce like the forage cultivation rojas downing et al 2017 the ipcc 2014b suggests a number of mitigation strategies in order to mitigate the effects of climate change tripathi and mishra 2017 one such strategies is the changing in the cropping patterns by the farmers many researchers have studied the effect of changing the sowing date on the crop yield harrington et al 1993 jain et al 2017 jalota et al 2012 lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 but limited studies have been done on the availability and changes in the rainfall patterns for the crop periods this may give an insight into the variation of cropping schedules in order to mitigate the climate change effects the monsoon rainfall constitutes about 80 of the annual rainfall fraction in the ganga basin and the indian sub continent while the post monsoon pre monsoon and winter showers add to the rest this distinct division facilitates two major cropping periods viz i kharif june october and ii rabi november may the kharif crops are mostly water intensive crops in comparison with the rabi crops higher rainfall during the rabi season is known to cause damage to the crops the present study deals with one crop in the kharif season paddy rice oryza sativa which is a water intensive major food crop cropping considered here for roorkee ghazipur and karnal and two crops of the rabi season berseem clover trifolium alexandrinum l which is a legume used as a forage crop cropping considered here for roorkee and karnal winter wheat triticum aestivum which is a major food crop cropping considered here for roorkee and ghazipur except for paddy the other two crops are not water intensive crops and give considerable yield with minimal irrigation and rainfall dependency three locations have been selected for study here based on availability of crop data and also the spatial distribution in the ganga basin in the present study an attempt has been made to study the effect of climate change with the on field rainfall availability and corresponding cropping scenarios three spatially distributed locations namely roorkee karnal and ghazipur have been considered for study here observed data for about 30 years for these locations was obtained from the india meteorological department imd the canesm2 climate change data for two representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios based on the green house gas ghg emission levels as per the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has been used twenty years of historical data and thirty years of forecasted data for 2 scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 have been used to study the effects of climate change 2 study area and data the ganga basin along with its tributary basins yamuna chambal kosi betwa etc spans for about 30 of total land area of the indian subcontinent the basin consists mainly of alluvial soils rich in minerals for cropping the ground water recharge during peak monsoon season is considerable but the flow is drastically reduced in the winter or lean season the winter monsoon is a result of western disturbances which may cause moderate to heavy rainfall in the low lying regions fig 1 shows the map of the ganga basin in india and the three locations i roorkee ii ghazipur and iii karnal considered for the present study the experiments at roorkee and ghazipur were conducted as a part of the project titled mitigating climate change impacts on india agriculture by improved irrigation water management funded by the ministry of earth sciences govt of india and natural environment research council uk the project involved collaborative meetings with a number of local farmers at both the locations as a part of this project the experiments at iit roorkee were conducted and monitored carefully with inputs from the local farmers the cropping at ghazipur was conducted as per the annual cropping schedule of a local farmer and the corresponding details were obtained a location on the yamuna basin was also chosen based on the cropping data availability hence the cropping data for karnal for paddy and berseem was used from the data presented in tyagi et al 2000 2003 roorkee is at an elevation of 273 m above msl and is located at 29 52 n and 77 54 e roorkee has a warm and temperate climate roorkee gets significant rainfall in the monsoon and even in the case of winter monsoon rainfall is considerably high the average annual temperature in roorkee is 23 7 c and the average annual rainfall is about 1170 mm the maximum temperature in roorkee goes up to 45 c in peak summers and as low as 1 c in winters field experiments were conducted for two seasons of paddy 2013 14 2014 15 three seasons of berseem 2013 14 2014 15 2016 2017 and one season of wheat 2016 17 on an experimental field located within the premises of the indian institute of technology roorkee roorkee india ghazipur is situated in the eastern part of uttar pradesh on the banks of river ganges it is located at 25 58 n 83 57 e and has an average elevation of 62 meters 203 feet above msl the climate of ghazipur is not very hot or cold the coldest months here are december january and the hottest months are may june the temperature varies from 5 to 17 c in winters and 30 to 42 in summers one season of paddy for june 2014 and two seasons of cropping for wheat nov 2013 and nov 2014 were monitored in collaboration with a local farmer karnal is located in the yamuna basin and the yamuna canal runs through karnal lysimeter experiments on paddy july 1994 two seasons of berseem october 1996 and 1997 were conducted at the research farm of the central soil salinity research institute this farm is located at an elevation of 245 m above msl with latitude of 29 43 n and longitude of 76 58 e the climate of karnal is semi arid with highest monthly temperature of 39 7 c recorded during may and mean monthly minimum temperature of 5 7 c recorded during january 2 1 meteorological data daily observed gridded rainfall data and temperature data for a period of thirty years from 1984 to 2014 was procured from the india meteorological department imd and used for the analysis the gcm data canesm2 from the cmip5 experiments of canadian center for climate modeling and analysis for fifty years was used here data from a number of models were compared with the observed imd data and the canesm2 data was found to be considerably coherent the data comprises of historical data for 20 years 1984 2004 and future modeled data for 30 years 2005 2035 for two scenarios viz rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2 1 1 imd observed data the data obtained here was daily gridded data for precipitation max temperature min temperature for the ganges basin this data was extracted for the locations under study for the various crop periods as per the cropping schedules in roorkee ghazipur and karnal the data was used along with the gcm data to analyze and predict the future changes in water availability and requirements using the mk test and tss test 2 1 2 gcm data three sets of data viz historical 1984 2005 and forecasted data 2006 2035 for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures for the scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were obtained a considerable discrepancy has been observed between the imd observed and the gcm data this bias in the gcm data needs to be corrected before the utilization for analysis purposes the bias correction is done as documented in ghosh and mujumdar 2008 fig 2 shows the cumulative distribution functions cdfs for the imd observed data gcm modeled data and also the bias corrected gcm data there is a significant variation between the imd observed data and the gcm data for all three centers roorkee ghazipur and karnal in addition it can be seen that the imd observed data is in good agreement with the bias corrected gcm values 2 2 field experiments in order to replicate the on field scenarios the sowing and transplanting patterns employed by the local farmers is followed in the experimental work conducted in roorkee while the knowledge of regular farming schedules as employed by the farmers at ghazipur is considered in the case of karnal the experimentation documented in tyagi et al 2000 2003 served as a reference for the farming dates 2 2 1 paddy paddy is a water intensive food crop and is one of the main crops in the ganga basin it is cultivated in the kharif season and its crop period spans through the monsoon table 1 shows the days of transplanting and the crop stages and crop periods for paddy cropping studied here the cropping of paddy in roorkee was done in the premises of civil engineering department of iit roorkee for easy monitoring 20 day old seedlings were transplanted onto the field during the mid july to end of july of 2013 and 2014 based on the variety of the crop the crop was harvested after the monsoon by the end of october 30 day old seedlings of rice crop were transplanted on 4 july in 1994 in the field at karnal and was harvested on 30 october 1994 paddy cropping in ghazipur is usually done by transplanting seedlings between the last week of june to first week of july and harvesting by the end of october fig 3 shows the fao allen et al 1998 crop co efficients k c values for the corresponding date of transplanting dot for the paddy cropping as done in roorkee ghazipur and karnal 2 2 2 berseem berseem is a major fodder forage crop with high nutritive value for livestock it is a leguminous winter crop with upto 5 harvests the sowing season starts during mid october and goes upto mid december based on the previous crop harvest in some regions like roorkee owing to the previous crop harvest for paddy which extends upto late october the sowing is done after mid november this causes a reduction in the number of cuts or harvest similar to alfalfa testa et al 2011 the harvest time rainwater supply etc have a considerable effect on the forage quality table 2 shows the dates of sowing dos and harvesting for berseem cropping at roorkee and karnal fig 4 shows the k c distribution for the five crop seasons based on the crop development and the fao k c distribution berseem was sown on 19th and 16th of october in 1996 and 1997 respectively at karnal the first cut was made at 9 weeks the second and third cut at 5 weeks each respectively the fourth and fifth at 4 and 3 weeks respectively three crop seasons of berseem were sown in the experimental plot in roorkee with three different sowing dates one was in mid november one was early december and the third was in mid december the preceding paddy crop extended up to late october and thus the cropping of berseem was delayed four harvests were done with the last harvest done when the onset of flowering stage occurred in case of roorkee cropping schedule was followed as indicated in table 2 and for karnal it is as reported by tyagi et al 2003 2 2 3 wheat wheat is one of the major food crops in india it is a rabi crop with moderate irrigation requirement heavy rainfall is known to cause serious damage to the crop harvests it is often sown during the last week of november and it is sown up to first week of december wheat was sown in the experimental plot in roorkee on 28th of november 2016 and it was harvested in mid april the cropping in ghazipur was a part of the annual cropping schedule and data was acquired in collaboration with a local farmer at ghazipur the sowing was done in the last week of november or first week of december and was harvested by early to mid april a plot of the k c values for the crop is as below in fig 5 the k c values based on the crop development and fao values and the corresponding dates of sowing are given in table 3 3 methodology this study comprises of two stages in the first stage the variation of rainfall availability and crop evapotranspiration lumped for each crop stage for historical and two future scenarios was analyzed this was done by employing two methods for trend detection the mann kendall test and the theil sen s slope estimator test the second stage deals with the effect of change in sowing transplanting date on the water availability and crop water requirement of the crops 3 1 potential evapotranspiration et 0 and crop evapotranspiration et c the potential evapotranspiration was obtained using temperature data owing to the lack of detailed weather data for the observed and projected time scales the hargreaves samani method for et 0 computation hargreaves and samani 1982 as cited by samani 2000 has been used here the hargreaves samani equation is given as 1 e t 0 0 0135 k t r a t d 1 2 t c 17 8 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration td t max t min c t max is the maximum temperature t min is the minimum temperature and tc is the average daily temperature c r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mm day and kt is the empirical coefficient the value of kt is specific to a site based on its location the value of r a is given based on the latitude of the site the et c is obtained as below 2 e t c e t 0 k c where et c is the crop evapotranspiration mm d k c is the crop coefficient et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d the crop periods are divided into crop stages as specified by fao the crop stages are specified in tables 1 3 for paddy berseem and wheat respectively the daily et c is calculated as per eq 2 the paddy crop stages are assumed as defined by allen et al 1998 although the paddy crop is a water intensive crop the significance of the monsoon rainfall availability is high the crop stages for berseem are taken as the cutting periods and the k c graph is as per development stages of the crop the first stage is considerably longer than the other stages in berseem as the root formation takes place in the first stage and hence the water requirement in this stage is also considerably high the et c drops to et for no crop state once the harvest is done owing to the absence of the crop shoot and leaves for crop evapotranspiration in the case of wheat the crop stages are taken as per the developmental stages of the crop suggested by fao the crop water requirement is high in the second and third stages while it reduces after the grain filling is complete the changes in stage wise available rainfall sar presents a picture of the local effects of changes in climatic conditions and also the future trends that may be anticipated 3 2 trend analysis of etc and precipitation the trend analysis is carried out by applying two robust trend detection techniques viz the mann kendall test and the theil sen slope estimator test these tests are applied to rainfall availability and crop evapotranspiration lumped for each crop stage for each season over 50 years for historical 20 years and future scenarios 30 years 3 2 1 mann kendall mk test mk test is a rank based nonparametric test and has been used by several researchers to detect trends in precipitation data casa and nasello 2014 duhan and pandey 2013 tabari et al 2011 it is based on the test statics s defined as s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where x 1 x 2 x n represent n data points and x j and x j represent the data points at time i and j respectively with j i and s g n x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 a very high positive value of s is an indicator of an increasing trend and a very low negative value indicates a decreasing trend it has been documented that when n 10 the statistic s is approximately normally distributed with the mean e s 0 and its variance is v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value and t k is the number of data points in the kth group the standardized test statistic z is computed by as follows z s 1 v a r s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 v a r s if s 0 the null hypothesis h0 meaning that no significant trend is present is accepted if the test statistic z is not statistically significant i e zα 2 z zα 2 where α is the significance level and zα 2 is the standard normal deviate the value of α in this study is taken as 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 corresponding to 90 95 and 99 confidence level respectively 3 2 2 theil sen s estimator tss the slope of n pairs of data points will be estimated using the theil sen s estimator sen 1968 theil 1950 which is given by the following relation β m e d i a n x j x i j 1 for all i j in which 1 j i n and β is the robust estimate of the trend magnitude a positive value of β indicates an upward trend while a negative value of β indicates a downward trend these methods have been tested robustly and have been the best statistical parameters to estimate the trends in meteorological time series studies 3 3 total crop water requirement tcwr and total net irrigation water requirement tnir the two main forms of water supply are natural precipitation and artificial irrigation the irrigation supply in india is usually done by farmers based on crop inspection or soil inspection or prior knowledge of cropping or government power water supply frequency the errors in inspection may lead to under irrigation or over irrigation of the field a delay in water supply may lead to the crop reaching the wilting stage this may cause irreversible damage to the crops on the contrary excess watering of the crops may cause soil saturation which may eventually harm the yield in case of rabi crops hence a proper watering schedule based on the et c study and information about precipitation occurrence are of considerable significance in avoiding excess or reduced watering of non water intensive crops the daily et c are aggregated for the whole crop period as it gives a lumped value of water utilized by the crops the total crop water requirement tcwr is hence defined as the total value of the crop evapotranspiration aggregated for the whole crop period and is given by eq 3 the total water utilized for rabi crops here berseem and wheat is significant while the daily requirement is considerably low owing to the soil moisture retention and low evaporation in winter season on the contrary the et c in the case of paddy is considerably high owing to the high temperatures in the initial stages of the kharif season the et c sum for a particular stage is given as 3 t c w r day 1 cd e t c where tcwr refers to the total crop water requirement and cd is the total crop duration the rainfall is aggregated similarly considering the effective rainfall eq 4 the value of p eff is considered to be between 50 and 80 for paddy and 70 for other crops as mentioned in fao paper 25 dastane 1975 4 p s day 1 cd p e f f where p s refers to the summation of p eff for the crop duration the total net irrigation water requirement tnir is defined as the total net irrigation water needed to be supplied to the crops for the whole crop period in addition to the available input from the effective precipitation and is given as 5 t n i r t c w r p s where tcwr is the total crop water requirement and p s is the effective precipitation available for irrigation the value of tcwr for different crop stages is usually seen to be greater than the sum of precipitation for rabi crops contrarily in the kharif season a negative value of tnir shows the p s in excess of the tcwr due to the changes in the rainfall patterns owing to changing climatic scenarios the crop scheduling also needs to be altered this is to mitigate the deficits between the tcwr and precipitation availability in this study berseem which is a forage crop with multiple harvests is also considered the value of et c drops to the et 0 value whenever the crop is harvested hence the p s tcwr and tnir are aggregated for each cutting stage and are changed to stage wise summation of p eff p ss stage wise crop water requirement scwr and stage wise net irrigation water requirement snir respectively 4 results and discussions the methodology discussed in the previous sections is employed to analyze the changes in the rainfall trends in the previous years and also for future periods in the context of the total lumped rainwater availability the effect of shifting of the sowing date is also studied by computing the variations in p eff et c and also the corresponding deficit in the rainwater availability w r t the et c 4 1 rainfall and et c trend analysis for current dos dot the mk and tss tests were applied to the stage wise sum of precipitation and et c for the crops paddy karnal ghazipur roorkee berseem karnal roorkee and wheat ghazipur roorkee the z statistic showing a positive value signifies a rising trend while the negative value denotes a decreasing trend the z statistic is seen at 90 95 and 99 confidence level with the value of z being 1 645 1 960 2 576 respectively this has been indicated in the corresponding tables tables 4 6 and 8 with and for 90 95 and 99 confidence levels respectively the values with no asterisks indicate insignificant z values the slope β also signifies the trends over the historical and future time scenarios tables 4 9 show the tabulated values of z and β for the various crops under study for roorkee ghazipur and karnal these are discussed in detail in this section the seasons referred to here are the cropping seasons adopted as in tables 1 3 respectively for paddy berseem and wheat 4 1 1 paddy cropping of two seasons were done in roorkee and for paddy fig 6 shows the z and β for precipitation and et c for roorkee for historical 1984 2004 and future 2005 2035 scenarios for season 1 as per the date of transplanting dot in table 1 for paddy table 4 shows the values for z for precipitation and et c for roorkee ghazipur and karnal as in fig 6 and table 4 the z statistic shows significant positive trends for the two projected scenarios in the first stage and for rcp 8 5 for second stage in the first crop season at roorkee it is evident from table 5 that the β for paddy at roorkee shows insignificant values for et c while for the β for precipitation for the crop with sowing date in the last week of july the precipitation is seen to increase for the second stage significantly in the case of ghazipur precipitation shows a significant positive β for rcp 4 5 for the second stage while the other stages have insignificant β for p and et c the β for karnal is insignificant for et c while it has a considerable variation for precipitation 4 1 2 berseem on observation the z and β values for dos corresponding to the first season of cropping at roorkee as in table 2 for berseem show a varying but insignificant trend table 6 shows the values for z for precipitation and et c for berseem cropping at roorkee and karnal for dos as per the second season at roorkee in the future scenario of rcp 4 5 there is a significant negative trend seen for the second cutting the z values for the dos as per the last season at roorkee also show a varying but insignificant trend in the case of et c the z values for the first cutting in all three seasons show a significant positive trend for rcp 8 5 future scenario this case is seen in the second cutting of the third season also whereas the other scenarios show an insignificant trend on observation from table 6 even though the variations in z values for cropping of berseem at karnal can be seen none of them were within the range of significance levels mentioned before this case is seen for all three scenarios viz historical rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the z for et c shows significant positive value only for the rcp 8 5 scenario for the third stage while the rest are varied insignificant positive and negative values similar trend is seen for the crop with day of transplanting in mid july in the case of ghazipur the projected scenarios show a significant positive trend for z for the third stage of cropping and for precipitation it is significant for rcp 4 5 for the second stage the z values for precipitation for karnal are insignificant while for et c the values for the first and second stage for the projected scenario of rcp 8 5 show a significant positive trend table 7 shows the β values for the various stages of berseem cropping at roorkee and karnal it can be seen that the historical data for the 2nd stage shows a significant positive slope indicating an increase in the stage wise precipitation between 1984 and 2005 for both roorkee and karnal the β values for et c have insignificant slopes in comparison with the β values for precipitation for both locations 4 1 3 wheat wheat is a staple food crop in india after rice and hence the area under wheat cropping is also considerably high tables 8 and 9 show the values of z and β for various crop stages of wheat at roorkee and ghazipur for wheat cropping in roorkee only the first stage shows a significant trend which is a negative value for both future rainfall scenarios while other trends are insignificant the z values for et c for the second stage shows a significant negative trend for the cropping of wheat in ghazipur significant positive z trends can be seen for the third stage of cropping for rcp 4 5 scenario while the historical rainfall shows a positive trend for the fourth stage this is also seen in the β for precipitation for the third stage in the case of et c we can see significant negative trend for the first third and fourth stages for rcp 4 5 while rcp 8 5 shows a positive trend in the fourth stage the historical data shows a positive trend only in the second stage the β value for et c is considerably less in comparison with the precipitation β values also the trends seen in z graphs are reflected in the β study on analyzing section 4 1 the results of the mk and tss tests show that for both kharif and rabi seasons in case of forecasted data rcp 4 5 projects an excess of et and shortfall of p and for rcp 8 5 it is the vice versa the analysis of values of p and et c lumped for each stage helps to decipher the changes in the historical scenarios as well as forecasted scenarios since the study here quantifies the changes in the p and et c for three crops for three spatially distributed locations with varied cropping days and also for three time scenarios it is not justified to generalize the results obtained however this study was successful in enlightening about the possible rainfall and crop et changes that may happen in future stages in comparison to the present and the past years 4 2 sums and precipitation deficits for change in dos dot the previous section dealt with the trends of the stage wise rainfall for the crops with the current practice this section looks into the possibility of changing the dot or dos and the corresponding effects on tnir and tcwr the rainwater is the primary source of water supply for crops and artificial irrigation is applied to substitute the water insufficiency brouwer et al 1985 the overall crop water availability for the entire crop period is analyzed by shifting the date of transplanting date of sowing for two crops paddy and wheat at three locations and for berseem the analysis was done by changing the dos and studying the effect on tcwr and tnir for each cuttings forage harvest the analyses are carried out for historical and future scenarios as well the p s tnir and tcwr are aggregated for the whole season and the means for fifty years historical and forecasted scenarios is obtained for the various dot and dos a plot of this sum shows the decline or increase in the available rainwater which would facilitate the better use of the natural water the range is of dates for changes in dot dos were decided based on the local farmers practices as the sowing is done by farmers based on the rainfall occurrence 4 2 1 paddy paddy is a kharif crop and the date of sowing has a considerable effect on the crop health and yield in addition with the effects of changing climate creeping in an insight into the changes in the rainwater availability patterns is necessary to mitigate its ill effects although paddy is a water intensive crop with excessive water demand the rainwater serves as a significant input in addition to the irrigation water supplied a roorkee roorkee receives moderate to high rainfall during the monsoon season fig 7 shows the p s tnir and tcwr for paddy cropping at roorkee with the dot varying from the last week of june 25th of june to the last week of july 25th of july for historical and future scenarios fig 7 it can be seen from the historical scenario that the water availability or the lumped p s for the crop period decreases as the dot is shifted toward late july while the tcwr variation is not very high the negative tnir seen for the crops with dot up to the first week of july shows that although the paddy crop needs standing water supply the p s is mostly in excess of the tcwr of the crop period in the case of the forecasted scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 show two different temperature and rainfall scenarios owing to the higher temperatures and comparatively lower rainfall projected in the rcp 4 5 scenario the p s is seen to be always below the tcwr values and hence the tnir is always positive and it increases as the dot is shifted toward late july on the contrary in the case of rcp 8 5 the p s is seen to be in excess of the tcwr and hence the tnir is seen to have a negative value for all dot b ghazipur unlike roorkee it can be seen in fig 8 that the rainfall at ghazipur in the monsoon is lower while the temperatures are higher owing to these conditions the tcwr is considerably high and the tnir is also positive throughout the dates of variation the changes in the dot were considered in consultation with the local farmers at ghazipur the cropping is varied for a fortnight last week of june to first week of july the tcwr for all three scenarios is high and the variation in the values of p s tnir and tcwr with the advance in the dot is negligible for the projected scenarios the p s in the case of rcp 4 5 is less for all the dots in comparison with the rcp 8 5 while it is seen to marginally decrease for the historical data c karnal karnal is seen to experience lesser rainfall in comparison with roorkee and ghazipur fig 9 the dot was varied for more than a fortnight in this case from the fourth week of june to third week of july the tcwr is considerably higher for all three scenarios and p s is significantly low and declining on the advance of the dot the necessity for irrigation application in such a scenario is inevitably high and also there is not much of contribution by the rainwater 4 2 2 wheat the windward side of the himalayas receive high rainfall in the monsoon season while during the non monsoon months like the winter season the rainfall occurrence is scarce the winter rainfall is caused by the phenomenon of western disturbances in india hence non water intensive crops are grown during this season also called the rabi cropping season wheat is a primary rabi crop with sowing done from late november to early december although it is less water intensive in comparison to the paddy crop it needs irrigation supply occasionally the effect of changing the sowing date for the cropping of wheat is studied here a roorkee fig 10 shows the variation of p s tnir and tcwr for the whole crop period for various sowing dates the dos for the cropping of wheat in roorkee was varied for more than a fortnight 4th week of nov to 2nd week of dec similar to the cropping of berseem the p s availability and also its variation with the change in dos is not very significant with the delay in sowing date there is an increase in tcwr suggesting a better yield but with advance in dates the harvest may be delayed an also the tnir is seen to increase with advance in dos b ghazipur the cropping of wheat in ghazipur is usually done in last week of november or first week of december hence as seen in fig 11 the dos here is varied from 20 nov to dec 10th in this case while the tcwr and tnir are high and increase with the advance of dos the rainwater availability and also its variability with change in dos is very low hence the farmer s discretion for sowing is necessary 4 2 3 berseem berseem is a forage crop with a maximum of up to five cuttings depending on the date of sowing if the crop is sown after the kharif paddy the sowing date is delayed as the paddy crop extends till the last week of october cropping of berseem by varying the dos up to the late dates of sowing as per farmers practice at roorkee and karnal and its effects on water availability for the crop is discussed here the berseem crop has three stages for each cutting and the et c values reduce to the et value for the no crop environment in this case each cutting harvest can be considered as an individual crop unlike the other crops studied here the tnir and tcwr considered for other crops are here aggregated cutting stage wise and are replaced as stage wise net irrigation water requirement snir and stage wise crop water requirement scwr respectively these cutting stage wise p ss snir and scwr variations are studied here for roorkee and karnal a roorkee the berseem crop in roorkee was sown for three seasons with the date of cropping varying by up to 15 days the three seasons mid november early december mid december the dos was hence varied for 30 days to study the variation of the scwr and snir the cropping was done after the paddy cropping here and hence the initial date of sowing was delayed fig 12 shows the means of aggregated p ss snir and scwr for crop period for various dates of sowing for berseem in roorkee unlike the monsoon the winter rainfall in the ganga basin is very scarce and more random since the solar radiation is also lower during the rabi season the scwr from which includes the soil evaporation and crop et is also low in comparison with the kharif crops since the stages considered refer to harvests cuttings each stage can be considered as a whole crop the stage wise precipitation is seen to increase with the advance in date of sowing for historical and future scenarios alike up to the first week of december in the second stage the rainwater availability reduces and the scwr increases not much variation is seen in the third and fourth stage with the variation in the dos b karnal karnal receives lesser rainfall in comparison to roorkee winter rainfall the dos in this case is varied from mid october to early december the early sowing facilitates one additional cutting harvest by the time there is flowering in berseem in order to obtain five harvests the sowing must be carried out by late october to early november as by the end of april the conditions are unsuitable for the sustenance of the berseem crop fig 18 shows the graphs for five stages of berseem crop in karnal for various dos changed between 15th of october and 30th of november fig 13 as seen in the figure ensemble the water availability for first stage increases marginally and the snir decreases as we shift the dos toward november the snir and the corresponding scwr increases as the dos is shifted ahead for the other cuttings 3 4 5 the deficits also increase as the snir values increase with the shift of dos it can be observed that during mid october the natural water availability is low and the temperature are higher as compared to the temperatures in november and hence an increase in the scwr in the first stage is seen 4 2 4 water saving by change in dos dot the results show that there is an increase in the tnir irrigation requirement of crops with a delay in the sowing date table 10 shows the percentage increase in tnir between the earliest and the latest sowing dates it can be seen that in the majority of instances early sowing is seen to be helpful to reduce the irrigation input to the crops the higher value indicates that there is a significant increase in the irrigation water requirement of the crops with a delay in sowing in section 4 2 the dot dos were varied keeping the water related aspects tcwr tnir and scwr snir into consideration the significance is seen in the high rainfall seasons kharif for crops which are more water intensive paddy rather than the crops which are less water intensive and are in cultivated in the winter cropping season or rabi season which has very low rainfall intensities the changes in the p s and tcwr with the change in the dot is clearly visible in all three scenarios historical and forecasted in roorkee and karnal likewise the change for paddy at ghazipur is not very significant the rabi crops do not show significant changes in terms of the change in rainfall as the number of rainfall events is considerably low while the tcwr shows an increasing pattern as the later crop stages move toward the high temperature days end of feb to march although the increase in et c suggests a better yield in case of wheat the grain yield is affected by the higher temperatures timsina et al 2008 in the case of berseem the crops sown in mid november roorkee as the harvest dates are delayed the later stages tend toward stagnation of tcwr suggesting drying of the crop harvest this is similarly applicable for berseem sown in mid october karnal this shows that as the dos for rabi crops is shifted to the later parts the tnir or the need for supply of irrigation also increases and this can be seen for both the future scenarios table 10 shows the percentage increase in the tnir between the initial and final sowing dates in the ranges suggested for the respective crops and the locations studied this asserts that for a majority of the crops under study for both kharif and rabi cropping early sowing transplantation makes more rainwater available for the crop and hence reduces the irrigation required 5 conclusions the climate change effect mitigation strategies studied in the literature include the change in dates of sowing change in the cultivars to get more heat resistant and less water intensive crops this is apart from the strategies to reduce the climate change itself by reducing the ghg emissions and implementing this in the national and regional policy decisions of the above strategies effect of change in dates of sowing on water availability has been discussed in this paper along with the possible rainfall and et c variations that may occur in the future timescales three crops paddy berseem and wheat were considered for study at three locations viz roorkee ghazipur and karnal the climate data analyzed spanned for about fifty years and included the imd observed historical data gcm projected historical data and gcm projected forecasted data for two rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the local farming dates were obtained and were compared with the changed dates for sowing transplanting two trend detection techniques were employed to study the changes in the previous years as well as the future climate scenarios in addition the effect of changes in date of sowing on the irrigation requirements of the crops is also discussed for these crops for their respective locations the mk test gave an insight into the big picture of the climatic variations in the future scenarios as it is seen in both the seasons kharif and rabi for all the three crops the temperatures are seen to increase as per the rcp 8 5 scenario and hence the corresponding et c is also seen to increase this is also substantiated by the majority of the positive β values seen for the crops for the seasons considered the consecutive study focused on the change in the water requirement of crops with the change in the dos dot it was seen that the delay in the kharif cropping in the discussed window caused a significant increase in the crop irrigation requirement for both the future scenarios on the contrary the increase in tnir was considerably low in case of karnal and very low for ghazipur in the rabi season although the delayed wheat cropping at roorkee shows a considerable increase in the tnir the change is insignificant for ghazipur as seen in kharif cropping this is attributed to the low climate variability in the lower ganga basin as compared to the upper ganga basin or even the upper yamuna basin in the case of berseem fodder crop early sowing where feasible seemed to be productive owing to the supplementary pre winter sunshine for the green fodder production in the case of roorkee since the cropping was done after the paddy crop the tnir was seen to increase for all the stages of harvest in a nutshell it can be concluded that the delay in cropping causes an increase in the crop irrigation requirement owing to the increase in the crop et coupled with the lowered rainfall based on the present study it can be concluded that the possible outcomes obtained need to be weighed with the historical occurrences for better mitigation strategies

sustainability of vineyards and to prevent severe water stress in many winegrowing mediterranean regions such as southern spain resco et al 2016 this future scenario with more recurrent drought phenomena and heatwaves will make it more necessary to apply efficient deficit irrigation di strategies and techniques as an adaptation to cc because the water resources will be increasingly limiting in this respect we have verified that di techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying irrigation pri using moderate annual volumes of water maintain high yields and improve the long term water use efficiency wue and berry and wine quality in monastrell wine grapes under semiarid conditions romero et al 2016a 2016b however to maintain the long term sustainability of the vineyards until the year 2050 and beyond it will be necessary to apply additional adaptation measures besides irrigation fraga et al 2018 in this respect a recent study in portugal where the application of efficient di as a measure to adapt a vineyard to cc was simulated in the medium term 2041 2070 concluded that irrigation alleviated the impact of cc by significantly reducing the projected yield losses but in some of the warmer and drier areas yields still declined significantly even with irrigation which was attributed to the synergistic effects of thermal and water stress fraga et al 2018 to face the risks associated with cc and to achieve environmentally sustainable viticulture the substitution of existing plant material by different rootstocks varieties of vine or clones of the same variety selected for their better adaptation to and tolerance of the new climatic conditions has also been proposed as another effective measure of adaptation to cc in the medium long term fraga et al 2013 berdeja et al 2015 this vine genetic diversity should be taken advantage of to increase the diversity of vineyards and overcome the threats of cc wolkovich et al 2018 in a recent five year study we evaluated the interactive effects of the irrigation method rdi and pri and rootstock invigorating and non invigorating on vine performance and berry quality we concluded that the application of low water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 with well designed di strategies for monastrell vines grafted on low vigor rootstocks resulted in better berry quality and nutraceutical potential than the use of more invigorating rootstocks under semiarid conditions in se spain romero et al 2018 such a synergic approach can serve as an adaptation measure in the face of cc to improve vine performance and enhance monastrell vineyard sustainability under semiarid and water limiting conditions the main goal of this study was to analyse whether the physiological changes and altered final berry quality conditioned by the interactive effects of the rootstock and irrigation method observed in a previous study romero et al 2018 are reflected in the final wine composition global wine quality aromatic profile sensory attributes and organoleptic properties to achieve this we analysed over three years the technological phenolic metabolomics nutraceutical and aromatic composition of the wines from the different rootstock x irrigation method combinations r x im studied in addition a sensory analysis of the wines by panels of expert tasters was carried out in order to relate the final wine chemical composition and quality characteristics to the sensory attributes taster preferences and scores of the wines 2 material and methods 2 1 field conditions plant materials and

2 5 sensory analysis of wines difference testing was conducted at the end of the alf 2014 2015 2016 a professional panel of five expert tasters was recruited every year from d o bullas spain all involved in the winemaking business in the study area the majority had been formally trained in wine assessment and all had extensive experience in difference testing and aroma and flavor intensity assessment the differences between the wines were assessed through a blind tasting following the protocols recommendations and tasting sheet of the instituto nacional de denominación de origen indo spain for each sample 20 30 ml of wine from blind coded 750 ml bottles were served to tasters in similar tasting glasses at room temperature and under normal lighting conditions in a laboratory at the imida la alberca spain the glasses were covered with plastic petri dish lids to retain the headspace aromas for each wine tasted the partial and total scores of the tasters were reported on a tasting sheet in the order 1 visual phase 2 olfactory phase intensity and quality 3 gustatory phase intensity and quality 4 harmony and 5 total score the sum of all phases according to the tasting sheet and protocol used the lower the score obtained in the different phases and the total score the better was the sensory and organoleptic quality and the overall evaluation of the wine each expert tasted 10 wines 1 per rootstock irrigation method combination in each session positive and negative sensory attributes in relation to color smell and flavor were also reported by the tasters on the tasting sheet according to the tasters positive sensory attributes were related more to qualities such as intensity darkness red purple violet nuances vivid purity brightness good expression body and structure balance mellowness fresh good harmony persistent good aftertaste good acidity sweetness red dark mature fruits and floral fruity notes in contrast negative attributes were related more to defects and flaws such as the presence of atypical aromas e g vegetable green or oxidation chemical aromas low intensity of fruit dull color lack of structure and body excessive acidity acetaldehyde notes bitterness dryness and astringency for each wine each positive attribute was given a score of 1 point and each negative attribute was given a score of 1 and the sum positive negative of the attributes was calculated fig 1s supporting information 2 6 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using analysis of variance anova procedures and the means were separated by duncan s multiple range test using statgraphics 2 0 plus software statistical graphics corporation usa a three way anova procedure was used to discriminate the effects of the rootstock irrigation method and year based on the results of a set of 23 variables related to different aspects of wine quality that were common in the three years of study 2014 2015 and 2016 a principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis were carried out the 23 variables measured in the three years chosen initially belonged to five different quality aspects of the wines 1 polyphenols content 2 sensory and organoleptic perception 3 metabolomics technological quality 4 mineral nutrition and 5 antioxidant activity nutraceutical potential a preliminary study of the pearson correlation matrix of all the variables determined the selection of variables for the subsequent analysis variables that were linearly related to others were eliminated finally those that had the most significant correlations and represented the largest number of different quality aspects were chosen different models were analyzed and the most satisfactory one from the point of view of sampling adequacy considering the kmo kaiser meyer olkin statistics and the bartlett sphericity test was chosen the final selection of nine variables tannins anthocyanins tannins ratio qiwine final total score in the sensory analysis º alcohol glycerol k total macronutrients and antioxidant activity presented a value of 0 617 in the kmo test considering values above 0 5 to be acceptable kaiser 1974 and below 0 05 in the bartlett test this confirmed that with this selection of variables we could reject the null hypothesis of sphericity an essential condition for the factorial analysis of the variables contemplated in this study in addition for each of the main components obtained from the pca a clusters analysis was carried out to establish a classification differentiation of the combinations rootstock x irrigation method studied the statistical software ibm spss statistics 21 was used for these studies 3 results 3 1 wine composition quality index and nutraceutical potential the wine composition was significantly affected by the rootstock thus low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r gave a higher polyphenol content anthocyanins ci od620nm od520nm od420nm qiwine and lower ph 161 49c than 1103 p and 140ru table 2 conversely high vigor rootstocks such as 1103 p and 140ru and medium vigor rootstocks 41b showed the lowest values of tpi ci qiwine od520nm od420nm and od620nm and higher ph 1103 p 140ru and acetaldehyde 41b wines from 140ru also had the lowest tannins concentration and wines from 41b the lowest alcohol degree ph and qiwine in addition wines from 161 49c and 140ru had the highest anthocyanins tannins ratio table 2 differences were also found due to the irrigation method thus regardless of the rootstock pri resulted in a higher concentration of reducing sugars and a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen table 2 significant interactive effects r x im were also observed wines made from grapes grown on 161 49c 110r or 41b under pri had significantly higher od620nm od520nm and od420nm than under rdi the contrary was observed in wines from 1103 p or 140ru table 2 in addition 161 49c vines under pri had significantly higher qiwine than 161 49c rdi and the rest of the combinations r x im the year 2014 a drier and warmer year was the year with the highest global wine quality index qiwine whereas 2016 had the lowest value table 2 regarding the chromatic characteristics 161 49c wines measured in 2016 showed lower l h and b and higher c and a values than those of the other rootstocks while 140ru and 1103 p wines showed the highest l 140ru h and b 1103 p values and the lowest c and a values 140ru table 3 the concentrations of several individual derivatives of anthocyanins and flavonols were highest in wines from the 161 49c and 110r rootstocks malvidin 3 0 monoglucoside the most abundant anthocyanin quercetin and miricetin flavonols derivatives conversely the concentrations were lowest in 140ru and 1103 p wines table 4 the pri wines also showed significantly higher concentrations of quercetin 3 o glucoside nevertheless significant interactive effects meant that 161 49c pri wines had significantly higher concentrations of malvidin 3 o monoglucoside but lower concentrations of flavonol derivatives than 161 49c rdi wines in contrast 110r pri wines showed significantly higher concentrations of flavonol derivatives quercetin and miricetin than 110r rdi wines table 4 rootstocks 161 49c and 140ru gave rise to significantly higher concentrations of total amino acids in the must compared to the other rootstocks table 5 while rootstock 41b gave the lowest total amino acid concentrations in addition there was a significant effect of the rootstock on the amino acids profile in general the most abundant amino acids in the must were pro ala and gly must from 140ru had significantly higher ser glu and ala levels than that from the rest of the rootstocks whereas 161 49c led to higher gly val phe and tyr table 5 wines from rootstock 161 49c also had significantly greater antioxidant activity higher fructose glucose and total sugars concentrations and a higher anthocyanins total sugars ratio table 6 in addition 161 49c and 140ru wines had significantly higher total amino acid concentrations than the others wines from 1103 p had the lowest antioxidant activity and wines from 41b the lowest fructose and total sugars concentrations glycerol was significantly less abundant in 161 49c and 41b wines compared to 110r there were significant effects of the year but not the irrigation method on the nutraceutical potential of the wine table 6 besides the interaction r x im showed that for rootstock 161 49c pri wines had significantly higher fructose and total sugars concentrations and anthocyanins sugars ratios than rdi wines while for 110r rdi wines had significantly higher values of fructose total sugars and the anthocyanins sugars ratio than pri wines table 6 additional metabolomics analysis after alf in 2016 showed that wines from 161 49c had higher concentrations of proline tartaric acid and formic acid higher tartaric malic ratios and lower concentrations of methanol fumaric acid and galacturonic acid compared to those of the other rootstocks table 1s supporting information in addition wines from 110r showed the lowest proline tartaric acid and formic acid concentrations the lowest tartaric malic ratios and the highest concentrations of succinic and fumaric acids the high vigor rootstock 140ru had lower concentrations of tyrosol and higher concentrations of proline and lactic acid compared to the rest of the rootstocks wines from 41b had higher concentrations of methanol tyrosol and galacturonic acid than those of the other rootstocks table 1s occasionally in 2016 pri wines showed lower ethyl acetate concentrations than rdi wines there were no significant interactive r x im effects the wine mineral nutrition analysis revealed that wines from 161 49c had significantly lower concentrations of p and k than those of the rest of the rootstocks table 7 in addition 161 49c and 41b wines had significantly higher zn concentrations than 140ru wines and 161 49c 1103 p and 110r wines had significantly higher b concentrations than 41b wines table 7 the k and zn concentrations in pri wines were significantly lower than in rdi wines the year had a significant effect on the mineral content of the wines and the interaction r x im had a significant effect on the zn concentration thus pri wines from 161 49c 110r 41b and 140ru had lower zn concentrations than rdi wines except for 1103 p where the opposite effect was observed table 7 additional mineral nutrition analysis also showed that 161 49c grapes had higher b concentrations than 110r and 140ru grapes and lower concentrations of cu na and p than 110r or 1103 p grapes table 2s supporting information 3 2 aromatic profile of the wines and sensory analysis the 49 major and minor compounds quantified in the red wines produced from the monastrell grapes were arranged in five chemical families alcohols esters terpenes volatile fatty acids and others table 8 alcohols and esters were the major groups in terms of the number and concentration of aromatic compounds identified in all wine samples followed by volatile fatty acids and terpenes the aromatic profiles of the wines in 2015 and 2016 showed significant differences due to the year rootstock and to a lesser extent irrigation method table 8 the rootstock affected the concentrations of 11 compounds and the irrigation method only affected the concentrations of two compounds significantly 2 methyl 1 butanol naphthalene in general for all rootstocks 2016 resulted in more aromatic wines than 2015 and the most abundant aromatic compounds were alcohols 2 methyl 1 butanol phenyl ethanol esters ethyl octanoate ethyl decanoate ethyl acetate volatile fatty acids butanoic acid and 2 octanone wines from rootstocks 1103 p and 41b had the highest concentrations of aromatic compounds whereas 110r wines had the lowest concentrations thus wines from the high vigor rootstock 1103 p showed higher concentration of alcohols propanol hexanol esters ethyl 3 oh butanoate diethyl succinate ethyl dodecanoate 2 octanone and acetic acid than wines from other rootstocks conversely low vigor rootstocks 161 49c and 110r had significantly lower concentrations of alcohols propanol hexanol esters 3 methyl butyl butanoate 3 methyl ethyl butanoate methyl nonanoate ethyl dodecanoate 2 octanone and acetic acid table 8 in addition regardless of the rootstock pri wines had significantly higher concentrations of 2 methyl 1 butanol an alcohol and the most abundant aromatic compound total higher alcohols and naphthalene than rdi wines there were no significant interactions between the rootstock and irrigation method the score for the sensory analysis of the wines after alf also differed significantly according to the rootstock irrigation method year and the interaction r x im table 9 wines from rootstocks 161 49c and 140ru followed by 110r were the best valued globally having the lowest scores in the visual olfactory and gustatory phases and harmony and the lowest final score conversely 41b and 1103 p wines were the worst valued obtaining the highest scores table 9 the year with the best score was 2014 in general pri wines obtained worse scores in the olfactory phase intensity gustatory phase intensity and quality and harmony and lower final scores than rdi wines nevertheless there were significant interactive r x im effects the professional tasters appreciated in the sensory analysis of the wines averaged for the three years a greater number of positive attributes in 161 49c wines followed by 140ru and more negative attributes for 41b and 1103 p fig 1s 3 3 relationships between wine quality parameters aromatic compounds and sensory analyses according to the pearson correlation coefficients obtained between the quality parameters and the sensory analysis of the wines the polyphenolic and alcohol contents were significantly and positively correlated with the global sensory appreciation of the wines table 10 therefore overall wines with higher values of ipt anthocyanins alcohol and qiwine obtained better olfactory gustatory harmony and total scores lower values in the tasting table 10 the values of ipt ci tannins concentration and qiwine were also significantly and negatively correlated with the concentrations of several families of aromatic compounds such as alcohols volatile fatty acids and esters and with the total aromatic compounds in the wines fig 1 besides the concentration of total anthocyanins was correlated negatively with that of volatile fatty acids but positively with the concentration of alcohols the concentration of tannins and the ci were also correlated significantly and positively with the volatile fatty acids fig 1 in addition the greater the concentration of aromatic compounds in the wine the worse the score in the sensory tasting fig 2 the only exception were the volatile fatty acids for which a greater concentration was significantly correlated with a better score in the gustatory phase intensity fig 2 3 4 principal component analysis of the wines the analysis of the principal components pca showed a separation between wines from the different combinations r x im fig 3 the first principal component pc1 explains 38 90 the second pc2 explains 26 53 and the third component pc3 explains 21 99 of the total variance macronutrients included k antioxidant activity and sugars glycerol contributed in this order greatly to pc1 defined as nutrition sugars in the case of pc2 defined as astringency bitterness the principal parameters to explain it were tannins content sensory analysis score and anthocyanins tannins ratio the third component pc3 defined as flavonoids alcohol content was greatly explained by two variables qiwine and alcohol fig 3 there was a clear separation between 161 49c pri wines and the rest mainly in quality attributes related with pc3 flavonoids alcohol content these distinct wines were better characterized by lower k content greater antioxidant activity qiwine related to a high polyphenolic content and color intensity and high alcohol the analysis cluster for each component also showed that 161 49c pri wines were closer to 41b pri wines and 161 49 rdi wines for pc1 high antioxidant activity and 110r rdi wines for pc 2 lower astringency and better organoleptic evaluation in addition 110r pri wines were better explained by differences in pc1 and pc2 higher tannins content lower macronutrients and worse organoleptic perception compared to 110r rdi wines in contrast overall pca showed similar component loadings and key variables in 140ru wines indicating no clear differences between pri and rdi wines in addition wines from 41b pri clearly separated from the rest in quality attributes related with pc 2 related with astringency mainly due to a greater tannins content and worse sensory evaluation and pc 3 lower qiwine and alcohol fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 rootstock effect the chemical composition and global quality of monastrell wine was significantly affected by the rootstock overall wine phenolics mirrored differences in fruit phenolics romero et al 2018 as supported by other studies casassa et al 2015 wines from low vigor high berry quality rootstocks 161 49c 110r enhanced significantly the wine phenolic concentration and chromatic characteristics giving also higher qiwine scores than high vigor low berry quality rootstocks 1103 p 140ru in particular rootstock 161 49c which was one of the least productive and gave grapes with the highest phenolic content in the berries total anthocyanins highest nutraceutical potential resveratrol derivatives and better global berry quality qioverall romero et al 2018 also gave the wines with the highest color intensity sugars content antioxidant activity and global quality qiwine tables 2 and 6 the hplc analysis also revealed that the levels of derivatives of anthocyanins mainly malvidin 3 o monoglucoside the most abundant tri hydroxylated anthocyanin and flavonols quercetin miricetin were significantly enhanced in wines from 161 49c an increase in trihydroxylated anthocyanins especially malvidin derivatives has been observed also in other di studies castellarin et al 2007a b santesteban et al 2011 brillante et al 2018 and rootstocks studies koundouras et al 2009 suggesting a shift in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway towards higher transcription levels of f3 5 h rather than f3 h and stimulation of the activity of the 3 o and 5 o methyltransferase enzymes resulting in an increase in methylated anthocyanins mainly malvidin romero et al 2016b in contrast in cabernet sauvignon cs bindon et al 2008 found that pri changed the methylation step of anthocyanin synthesis increasing non malvidin anthocyanins while malvidin glucosides were unaffected the enrichment in trihydroxylated anthocyanins mainly malvidin 3 o monoglucosides constitutes also an enrichment of purple blue pigments hence modifying the must and wine quality castellarin et al 2006 the 161 49c wines showed lower l h and b and higher c and a table 3 which means darker and more intense wine color a greater fraction of blue and red colors greater purity and more vivid color in red wines these metabolites malvidin flavonols are important components in the determination of wine style and quality as flavonols can act as copigments and conjugate to anthocyanins a process called copigmentation that reinforces the long term stability of wine color castellarin et al 2012 especially in young wines where the copigmentation fraction is maximal heras roger et al 2016 therefore 161 49c wines with higher malvidin and flavonols contents probably increased copigmentation processes which also involves a wine color shift towards increased color intensity darker red hues lower yellow hues and higher percentage of blue color darker and purplish wines heras roger et al 2016 this improvement in wine color characteristics may have contributed to the good visual appreciation of these wines table 9 besides the enhanced presence of malvidin forms of anthocyanins and flavonols derivatives and greater antioxidant activity in wines can lead to multiple health benefits in humans de vries et al 2001 graf et al 2005 quintieri et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in contrast wines from rootstock 140ru showed the lowest ci c and a and the highest l which means lighter wine color lower purity less vivid color and a lower fraction of red color table 3 the lower berry weight and yield romero et al 2018 and lower must percentage 60 9 for rootstock 161 49c data not shown could also have enhanced the levels of metabolites in the must and wine due to a greater concentration effect in contrast bigger berries 110r and 140ru romero et al 2018 and a higher must percentage 63 5 and 62 7 respectively data not shown probably produced a dilution effect and reduced the total concentration of flavonoids in the must and wine romero et al 2016 the concentrations of micronutrients such as zn and b were higher in 161 49c wines than in 41b b or 140ru wines zn table 7 mirroring what was observed in the leaves higher b romero et al 2018 and grapes higher b table 2s probably also due to a greater concentration effect boron increases the synthesis of carbohydrates and their movement especially that of sucrose from the leaves to the roots and fruiting bodies thus increasing the sugar content in the fruit batukaev et al 2016 this could explain the increased sugar content in 161 49c berries despite the fact that the plants had lower photosynthesis rates and total leaf area than other rootstocks romero et al 2018 the greater sugar contents in 161 49c berries and musts were also reflected in higher sugar contents after fermentation in 161 49c wines table 6 on the other hand the concentrations of some important macronutrients such as p and k were reduced in wines from rootstock 161 49c in accordance with the lower mineral content in grapes p na cu table 2s and leaves n p romero et al 2018 this was probably due to greater cumulative vine water stress and a lower water uptake transport capacity in this rootstock romero et al 2018 the content of p in wines is usually related to its levels in their musts but part of it also comes from soil sirén et al 2015 rootstocks 161 49c and 140ru also increased significantly the total amino acids in the must table 5 and wines table 6 compared to the other rootstocks which could also have altered the wine metabolomic and aromatic composition in particular 161 49c must had higher concentrations of gly tyr and phe while 140ru must had more ser arg glu ala and pro table 5 the amino acids in must as a n source serve as precursors for the synthesis of wine volatile aromatic compounds during fermentation such as higher alcohols bell and henschke 2005 thus contributing to the overall taste of the wine grimplet et al 2009 therefore the increase in the concentration of the major nitrogenous compounds such as total amino acids arginine or glutamine important n sources for yeast and consequently of the yeast assimilable nitrogen yan may have favoured the balance between desirable and undesirable chemical and sensory wine attributes bell and henschke 2005 the significantly higher concentration of pro the most abundant amino acid in must and wines in 140ru and 161 49c wines tables 6 1s could have contributed to an enhancement of sweetness deluc et al 2009 in previous work pro and arg were closely associated with the body and balance scores of the wines in sensory tests chang et al 2014 this is also congruent with the better final scores and greater preference obtained by the wines from these two rootstocks in the sensory analysis table 9 the significant p 0 05 correlation coefficients between the polyphenol content anthocyanins ipts tannins qiwine alcoholic degree and score in the wine sensory analysis table 10 suggest that overall the greater the polyphenolic and alcohol content of the wine the better valued and more preferred by the tasters it was as occurred for 161 49c and 110r wines table 9 a higher alcohol ethanol content in wines leads to a greater perceivable alcoholic aroma and hot mouthfeel hopfer et al 2015 and has been shown to decrease the perception of astringency and roughness mcrae and kennedy 2011 in addition anthocyanins contribute to wine flavor as high levels of anthocyanins are necessary to obtain not only visual intensity but also balance and mellowness cheynier et al 1998 higher concentrations of anthocyanins and polysaccharides glucose fructose total sugars and a higher anthocyanins sugars ratio 161 49c wines tables 2 and 6 could have contributed to a better mouthfeel perception of these wines as this has been associated previously with lower astringency ratings of wines and reduction of the unpleasant puckering sensation of young wines mcrae and kennedy 2011 another interesting point is that 140ru wines despite having lower polyphenolic contents and worse chromatic characteristics were among the wines that were best valued and most preferred by the tasters table 9 this indicates that factors additional to the gross polyphenolic content and chromatic characteristics come into play in the better sensory and organoleptic perception of wines high quality is not driven by individual sensory descriptors but is the result of several multiple descriptors acting together in the wine matrix hopfer et al 2015 in particular wine quality has been claimed to depend also on the anthocyanins to tannins ratio cheynier et al 1998 therefore lower tannins levels and higher anthocyanins tannins ratios associated with a high alcohol content as observed in wines from rootstocks 140ru and 161 49c table 2 could also have contributed to a better sensory perception of these wines these properties have been related previously to more intense and balanced wines mellowness mouthfullness lower astringency and green tannin perception which is also possibly enhanced by alcohol cheynier et al 1998 the nmr metabolomic analysis revealed other positive chemical features that may also have contributed to a greater taste preference for these wines 161 49c and 140ru lower methanol acetic acid and galacturonic acid 161 49c higher tartaric acid 161 49c and lactic acid 140ru and a higher tartaric malic ratio 161 49c 140ru tables 1s and 8 a lower malic acid concentration higher tartaric malic ratio and higher lactic acid concentration in wines can suppose the replacement of the strong green taste of l malic acid with the less aggressive or slightly sour taste of lactic acid volschenk et al 2006 tartaric acid is responsible for much of the tart taste of wine and wine acidity chang et al 2014 contributing to both the biological stability and the longevity of wine conde et al 2007 and has more pleasant organoleptic properties than malic acid poni et al 2018 in addition 140ru wines had significantly higher concentrations above the odor threshold value table 8 of an aromatic ester methyl nonanoate compared to 1103 p 110r or 161 49c wines which could also confer a coconut floral fruit odor on these wines nih pubchem 2018 in contrast wines from rootstocks 41b and 1103 p showed some negative chemical features defect causing compounds such as higher total tannins 41b 1103 p greater methanol and acetaldehyde contents 41b both above their odor threshold values 100 mg l 1 for methanol and 19 2 mg l 1 for acetaldehyde gónzalez robles and cook 2016 greater galacturonic 41b and acetic acids contents 1103 p and lower anthocyanins tannins ratios 41b 1103 p ºalcohol 41b sugar contents 41b and tartaric malic ratios tables 2 6 8 and 1s high amounts of tannins are undesirable because they are related to bitter astringent and dry sensations chang et al 2014 cheynier et al 2006 sáenz navajas et al 2018 in addition a lower tartaric malic ratio confers a green taste on wine and excessive amounts of acetic acid are detrimental to the taste giving a wine that tastes sour and thin and is less appealing to consumers with an unpleasant aroma and palate joyeux et al 1984 conde et al 2007 a high galacturonic acid content is not desirable either and is associated with the degradation of pectic compounds due to grape infection by botrytis cinérea mihaljevic zulj et al 2015 in addition acetaldehyde related to wine oxidation imparts a green bruised apple or nutty aroma bell and henschke 2005 and can increase the perception of astringency mcrae and kennedy 2011 while excess methanol is not desirable due to its toxicity and characteristic sweet pungent solvent like odor gónzalez robles and cook 2016 these factors may have contributed to the worse overall sensory and organoleptic perception of these wines the 41b and 1103 p wines showed more negative than positive attributes fig 1s and were the ones valued worst table 9 among the negative attributes reported by the panel members for these wines stand out color with a light layer light browning fruits not fully ripe notes of greenery on the nose and mouth lack of structure and body in the mouth slight reduction poor acidity and not very intense flavor notes of pepper and acetaldehyde astringent and bitter mouthfeel and dryness this is congruent with the results of hopfer et al 2015 who reported that expert tasters associated low wine quality with the presence of defects and flaws such as microbial spoilage the presence of atypical aromas e g vegetable green or oxidation aromas or an unbalanced flavour profile the rootstock also altered the concentrations of volatile aromatic compounds mainly higher alcohols ha and esters some of these key odor active compounds surpassed their odor threshold values otv table 9 which may have also altered the sensory perception of the wines table 9 interestingly the most aromatic wines 1103 p and 41b had lower polyphenolic contents in accordance with the inverse relationship between polyphenols and aromatic compounds fig 1 and besides were those least preferred by the experts table 9 rather wines of low or medium aromaticity 161 49c 140ru 110r were the ones most preferred by the tasters they had the best scores in the olfactory phase and the best final sensory score agreeing with the significant inverse relationship between the concentration of aromatic compounds in the wine and the score obtained in the sensory tasting fig 2 these results are in agreement with other observations where wines of high quality had volatile profiles without extreme concentrations hopfer et al 2015 therefore not all volatile aromatic compounds are associated with a pleasant aroma and not all contribute to the aroma equally icc et al 2016 for example the most aromatic wines from rootstock 1103 p which was the worst evaluated in the olfactory phase table 9 had higher levels of total ha propanol hexanol esters such as ethyl dodecanoate 3 methyl ethyl butanoate above its otv also in 41b wine ethyl 3 oh butanoate and diethyl succinate and 2 octanone above its otv also in 41b and 140ru wines table 8 in wines with high ha levels red fruit aroma and woody character can be masked or suppressed thus decreasing the appreciation preference and perceived quality of fruity and woody wines de la fuente blanco et al 2016 de la et al 2017 in addition alcohols with six carbon atoms hexenols and hexanols bestowed plant grass and herbaceous nuances on the wines vilanova et al 2012 cortés dieguez et al 2015 propanol may also confer an odor quality described as pungent harsh ripe fruit and alcohol cortés dieguez et al 2015 besides diethyl succinate and 3 methyl ethyl butanoate are compounds related to ageing and or oxidation reactions and have been associated with green flavor dried fruit aroma hopfer et al 2015 while 2 octanone a methyl ketone may confer a fatty green cheese aroma and a bitter fruity and camphor taste giving altogether an unpleasant odor and flavor belitz and grosch 1999 similarly previous studies reported that with increased levels of some alcohols 1 butanol and esters 3 methyl ethyl butanoate ethyl 2 methyl butanoate among others wine experts scored the wines lower for quality hopfer et al 2015 in contrast 161 49c and 110r wines had lower concentrations of alcohols mainly hexanol esters mainly ethyl dodecanoate 3 methyl butyl butanoate ethyl 3 oh butanoate 161 49c and 2 octanone which may have contributed to a better olfactory perception of these wines 4 2 effects of the irrigation method pri vs rdi and its interaction with the rootstock the irrigation method pri vs rdi also altered the chemical composition and aromatic profile of the wines although to a lesser extent than the rootstock the differences observed in the berries romero et al 2018 were attenuated in the wines thus pri wines had significantly greater od620nm od520nm od420nm reducing sugars arginine and flavonol derivatives quercetin 3 o glucoside and lower dissolved oxygen ethyl acetate and k and zn concentrations compared to rdi wines previous studies in cs wines produced under pri showed a significant increase 15 in wine color density bindon et al 2008 greater color absorbance and higher concentrations of residual sugars non fermented and flavonols derivatives quercetin 3 o glucoside may contribute to perception of a more intense wine color greater perceived sweetness hopfer et al 2015 and increased nutraceutical potential of pri wines respectively lower dissolved oxygen can also avoid oxidation processes in sensitive young red wines which can be beneficial in this type of wine the lower k concentrations found in pri wines can be positive to avoid acidity losses and an increase in ph but on the other hand lower k and zn contents can decrease the nutritional value of the wine in addition overall pri wines were more aromatic than rdi wines since pri increased significantly the concentrations of total ha mainly 2 methyl 1 butanol the most abundant aromatic compound and naphthalene in the wines table 8 therefore the higher concentrations of both these aromatic compounds in pri wines which surpassed the detectable odor thresholds table 8 could have conferred an unpleasant aroma and flavor both 2 methyl 1 butanol and naphthalene confer strong and characteristic odors corresponding to alcohol harsh vinous and green for 2 methyl 1 butanol and mothballs for naphthalene nih pubchem 2018 this was reflected in the poor scores for pri wines in the sensory evaluation and organoleptic perception olfactory and gustatory phases table 9 in cs pri increased the presence of volatile c13 norisoprenoids some with positive sensory characteristics in wines β damascenone β ionone and others with negative characteristics such as a kerosene like odor 1 1 6 trimethyl 1 2 dihydronaphtalene tdn bindon et al 2007 nevertheless the significant interactive r x im effects on the wine chemical composition indicate that overall for low medium vigor rootstocks especially 161 49c followed by 41b pri was more beneficial than rdi since it increased blue red and yellow color components 161 49c 41b table 2 anthocyanin derivatives malvidin 161 49c amino acids arg 161 49c 41b reducing sugars 41b 161 49c fructose 161 49c total sugars 161 49c anthocyanins sugars ratio 161 49c qiwine 161 49c flavonol derivatives 41b and visual perception 41b in addition 110r pri wines showed also some improvements in their phenolic composition compared to 110r rdi wines but gustatory perception and final sensory score was significantly worse probably due to lower content of fructose and total sugars table 6 and higher content of aromatic compounds total alcohols table 8 on the other hand for rootstocks of higher vigor and productivity 1103 p 140ru pri did not produce clear advantages in the wine rather rdi was more beneficial for wine composition and global quality due to an improved polyphenolics concentration qiwine and sensory perception pca cluster analysis also showed that 161 49c pri wines were clearly differentiated from the other rootstock im combinations mainly for their best quality higher qiwine and alcohol pc3 in contrast 41b pri wines were also differentiated for pc2 and pc3 mainly for their worst quality higher tannins content lower qiwine and alcohol and worse sensory evaluation fig 3 5 conclusions based on these results and those of romero et al 2018 we conclude that the choice of the rootstock had a very significant effect on the monastrell berry and wine composition the application of low annual water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 with well designed di strategies to low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r resulted in moderate yields 7 400 9 900 kg ha 1 with higher global berry and wine quality and greater nutraceutical potential compared to other rootstocks interestingly grafting monastrell on 140ru increased substantially the berry yield and wue 72 compared to the average of the other rootstocks allowing the production of a greater volume of wine these wines had poorer polyphenolic contents nutraceutical potential and chromatic characteristics due mainly to greater dilution effects but a high content of lactic acid and amino acids and tartaric malic and anthocyanins tannins ratios as well as a low concentration of aromatic compounds alcohols and were among the wines valued best and preferred by the tasters under semiarid conditions of se spain and low water irrigation volumes the pri method improved monastrell berry and wine quality and organoleptic perception for low vigor rootstock especially 161 49c compared to rdi these wines showed darker color higher sugar content and nutraceutical potential as well as better sensory perception compared to other rootstock im combinations in contrast for high vigor rootstocks 1103 p 140ru rdi was better for wine composition global quality and sensory perception

other rootstocks these wines also had lower concentration of aromatic compounds alcohols and esters the 140ru wines although having a lower polyphenolic concentration and worse color were among those rated most highly and preferred by the tasters these wines had a high content of lactic acid and amino acids higher tartaric malic and anthocyanins tannins ratios and a low concentration of aromatic compounds in contrast 1103 p and 41b wines had lower polyphenolic content nutraceutical value lower qiwine tartaric malic and anthocyanins tannins ratios more aromatic compounds abundant green vegetable astringent notes and more defect causing compounds in addition these wines were also the worst rated in the sensory analysis significant positive correlations between the polyphenolic content and alcoholic degree and the score in the wine sensory analysis indicated that the greater the polyphenolic and alcohol contents in the wine the better valued and more preferred by the tasters it was pri method improved wine quality and organoleptic perception for low vigor rootstocks especially 161 49c compared to rdi these wines showed darker color higher sugar content and nutraceutical

quality and sensory perception overall the pri method also increased the presence of some volatile unpleasant alcohols in the wines we recommend the use of low vigor rootstocks and di techniques with

drying irrigation polyphenolics regulated deficit irrigation rootstocks sensory attributes wine composition 1 introduction according to the climate projections for the middle of this century 2040 2070 it will be in semiarid regions of southern europe e g se spain where viticulture will need to make the greatest adaptation to climate change cc with greater costs to maintain quality and productivity since they are going to experience more severe water stress and impacts of greater magnitude than other winegrowing areas guiot and cramer 2016 resco et al 2016 it is also expected that in these regions there will be a greater loss of optimal areas for vine cultivation tóth and végváry 2016 in these warm and more vulnerable areas of the mediterranean region it will be necessary to implement deep changes in vineyard management combining different adaptation measures especially those related to water management and availability iglesias and garrote 2015 even in those areas considered optimal for vineyards in the future tóth and végváry 2016 recent analysis of the economic impact of global warming on wine production point in the same direction although with some uncertainties it indicated that in certain regions of the european countries closest to the equator such as spain and france cc will have adverse effects on the wine market compared to regions located farther north at higher latitudes ashenfelter and storchmann 2016 thus in the last 30 years a significant advance in vine phenology and a clear change in the composition of the grape have been observed in many viticultural regions which can be partly attributed to cc in general grapes now contain more sugar and less organic acids mainly malic and have a higher ph in addition changes have also been observed in some aromatic components van leeuwen and destrac irvine 2017 the negative effects on wine quality associated with cc include inhibition of anthocyanin synthesis loss of grape color and acidity increasing ph alcoholic degree and volatilization of aromatic compounds producing grapes with a low aromatic content and an increased risk of organoleptic degradation and their aging potential and deterioration of the wine resco et al 2016 pons et al 2017 besides recent studies predict in the near and distant future a significant advance for all phenological stages e g shorter ripening period and advanced harvest up to four weeks which could affect the quality and suitability of winegrapes production in many areas if appropriate adaptation strategies are not taken alikadic et al 2019 molitor and junk 2019 the predicted increase in the evapotranspiration and water needs of the vine as a result of cc will make necessary the application of irrigation water to maintain the sustainability of vineyards and to prevent severe water stress in many winegrowing mediterranean regions such as southern spain resco et al 2016 this future scenario with more recurrent drought phenomena and heatwaves will make it more necessary to apply efficient deficit irrigation di strategies and techniques as an adaptation to cc because the water resources will be increasingly limiting in this respect we have verified that di techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying irrigation pri using moderate annual volumes of water maintain high yields and improve the long term water use efficiency wue and berry and wine quality in monastrell wine grapes under semiarid conditions romero et al 2016a 2016b however to maintain the long term sustainability of the vineyards until the year 2050 and beyond it will be necessary to apply additional adaptation measures besides irrigation fraga et al 2018 in this respect a recent study in portugal where the application of efficient di as a measure to adapt a vineyard to cc was simulated in the medium term 2041 2070 concluded that irrigation alleviated the impact of cc by significantly reducing the projected yield losses but in some of the warmer and drier areas yields still declined significantly even with irrigation which was attributed to the synergistic effects of thermal and water stress fraga et al 2018 to face the risks associated with cc and to achieve environmentally sustainable viticulture the substitution of existing plant material by different rootstocks varieties of vine or clones of the same variety selected for their better adaptation to and tolerance of the new climatic conditions has also been proposed as another effective measure of adaptation to cc in the medium long term fraga et al 2013 berdeja et al 2015 this vine genetic diversity should be taken advantage of to increase the diversity of vineyards and overcome the threats of cc wolkovich et al 2018 in a recent five year study we evaluated the interactive effects of the irrigation method rdi and pri and rootstock invigorating and non invigorating on vine performance and berry quality we concluded that the application of low water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 with well designed di strategies for monastrell vines grafted on low vigor rootstocks resulted in better berry quality and nutraceutical potential than the use of more invigorating rootstocks under semiarid conditions in se spain romero et al 2018 such a synergic approach can serve as an adaptation measure in the face of cc to improve vine performance and enhance monastrell vineyard sustainability under semiarid and water limiting conditions the main goal of this study was to analyse whether the physiological changes and altered final berry quality conditioned by the interactive effects of the rootstock and irrigation method observed in a previous study romero et al 2018 are reflected in the final wine composition global wine quality aromatic profile sensory attributes and organoleptic properties to achieve this we analysed over three years the technological phenolic metabolomics nutraceutical and aromatic composition of

2 5 sensory analysis of wines difference testing was conducted at the end of the alf 2014 2015 2016 a professional panel of five expert tasters was recruited every year from d o bullas spain all involved in the winemaking business in the study area the majority had been formally trained in wine assessment and all had extensive experience in difference testing and aroma and flavor intensity assessment the differences between the wines were assessed through a blind tasting following the protocols recommendations and tasting sheet of the instituto nacional de denominación de origen indo spain for each sample 20 30 ml of wine from blind coded 750 ml bottles were served to tasters in similar tasting glasses at room temperature and under normal lighting conditions in a laboratory at the imida la alberca spain the glasses were covered with plastic petri dish lids to retain the headspace aromas for each wine tasted the partial and total scores of the tasters were reported on a tasting sheet in the order 1 visual phase 2 olfactory phase intensity and quality 3 gustatory phase intensity and quality 4 harmony and 5 total score the sum of all phases according to the tasting sheet and protocol used the lower the score obtained in the different phases and the total score the better was the sensory and organoleptic quality and the overall evaluation of the wine each expert tasted 10 wines 1 per rootstock irrigation method combination in each session positive and negative sensory attributes in relation to color smell and flavor were also reported by the tasters on the tasting sheet according to the tasters positive sensory attributes were related more to qualities such as intensity darkness red purple violet nuances vivid purity brightness good expression body and structure balance mellowness fresh good harmony persistent good aftertaste good acidity sweetness red dark mature fruits and floral fruity notes in contrast negative attributes were related more to defects and flaws such as the presence of atypical aromas e g vegetable green or oxidation chemical aromas low intensity of fruit dull color lack of structure and body excessive acidity acetaldehyde notes bitterness dryness and astringency for each wine each positive attribute was given a score of 1 point and each negative attribute was given a score of 1 and the sum positive negative of the attributes was calculated fig 1s supporting information 2 6 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using analysis of variance anova procedures and the means were separated by duncan s multiple

analysis were carried out the 23 variables measured in the three years chosen initially belonged to five different quality aspects of the wines 1 polyphenols content 2 sensory and organoleptic perception 3 metabolomics technological quality 4 mineral nutrition and 5 antioxidant activity nutraceutical potential a preliminary study of the pearson correlation matrix of all the variables determined the selection of variables for the subsequent analysis variables that were linearly related to others were eliminated finally those that had the most significant correlations and represented the largest number of different quality aspects were chosen different models were analyzed and the most satisfactory one from the point of view of sampling adequacy considering the kmo kaiser meyer olkin statistics and the bartlett sphericity test was chosen the final selection of nine variables tannins anthocyanins tannins ratio qiwine final total score in the sensory analysis º alcohol glycerol k total macronutrients and antioxidant activity presented a value of 0 617 in the kmo test considering values above 0 5 to be acceptable kaiser 1974 and below 0 05 in the bartlett test this confirmed that with this selection of variables we could reject the null hypothesis of sphericity an essential condition for the factorial analysis of the variables contemplated in this study in addition for each of the main components obtained from the pca a clusters analysis was carried out to establish a classification differentiation of the combinations rootstock x irrigation method studied the statistical software ibm spss statistics 21 was used for these studies 3 results 3 1 wine composition quality index and nutraceutical potential the wine composition was significantly affected by the rootstock thus low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r gave a higher polyphenol content anthocyanins ci od620nm od520nm od420nm qiwine and lower ph 161 49c than 1103 p and 140ru table 2 conversely high vigor rootstocks such as 1103 p and 140ru and medium vigor rootstocks 41b showed the lowest values of tpi ci qiwine od520nm od420nm and od620nm and higher ph 1103 p 140ru and acetaldehyde 41b wines from 140ru also had the lowest tannins concentration and wines from 41b the lowest alcohol degree ph and qiwine in addition wines from 161 49c and 140ru had the highest anthocyanins tannins ratio table 2 differences were also found due to the irrigation method thus regardless of the rootstock pri resulted in a higher concentration of reducing sugars and a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen table 2 significant interactive effects r x im were also observed wines made from grapes grown on 161 49c 110r or 41b under pri had significantly higher od620nm od520nm and od420nm than under rdi the contrary was observed in wines from 1103 p or 140ru table 2 in addition 161 49c vines under pri had significantly higher qiwine than 161 49c rdi and the rest of the combinations r x im the year 2014 a drier and warmer year was the year with the highest global wine quality index qiwine whereas 2016 had the lowest value table 2 regarding the chromatic characteristics 161 49c wines measured in 2016 showed lower l h and b and higher c and a values than those of the other rootstocks while 140ru and 1103 p wines showed the highest l 140ru h and b 1103 p values and the lowest c and a values 140ru table 3 the concentrations of several individual derivatives of anthocyanins and flavonols were highest in wines from the 161 49c and 110r rootstocks malvidin 3 0 monoglucoside the most abundant anthocyanin quercetin and miricetin flavonols derivatives conversely the concentrations were lowest in 140ru and 1103 p wines table 4 the pri wines also showed significantly higher concentrations of quercetin 3 o glucoside nevertheless significant interactive effects meant that 161 49c pri wines had significantly higher concentrations of malvidin 3 o monoglucoside but lower concentrations of flavonol derivatives than 161 49c rdi wines in contrast 110r pri wines showed significantly higher concentrations of flavonol derivatives quercetin and miricetin than 110r rdi wines table 4 rootstocks 161 49c and 140ru gave rise to significantly higher concentrations of total amino acids in the must compared to the other rootstocks table 5 while rootstock 41b gave the lowest total amino acid concentrations in addition there was a significant effect of the rootstock on the amino acids profile in general the most abundant amino acids in the must were pro ala and gly must from 140ru had significantly higher ser glu and ala levels than that from the rest of the rootstocks whereas 161 49c led to higher gly val phe and tyr table 5 wines from rootstock 161 49c also had significantly greater antioxidant activity higher fructose glucose and total sugars concentrations and a higher anthocyanins total sugars ratio table 6 in addition 161 49c and 140ru wines had significantly higher total amino acid concentrations than the others wines from 1103 p had the lowest antioxidant activity and wines from 41b the lowest fructose and total sugars concentrations glycerol was significantly less abundant in 161 49c and 41b wines compared to 110r there were significant effects of the year but not the irrigation method on the nutraceutical potential of the wine table 6 besides the interaction r x im showed that for rootstock 161 49c pri wines had significantly higher fructose and total sugars concentrations and anthocyanins sugars ratios than rdi wines while for 110r rdi wines had significantly higher values of fructose total sugars and the anthocyanins sugars ratio than pri wines table 6 additional metabolomics analysis after alf in 2016 showed that wines from 161 49c had higher concentrations of proline tartaric acid and formic acid higher tartaric malic ratios and lower concentrations of methanol fumaric acid and galacturonic acid compared to those of the other rootstocks table 1s supporting information in addition wines from 110r showed the lowest proline tartaric acid and formic acid concentrations the lowest tartaric malic ratios and the highest concentrations of succinic and fumaric acids the high vigor rootstock 140ru had lower concentrations of tyrosol and higher concentrations of proline and lactic acid compared to the rest of the rootstocks wines from 41b had higher concentrations of methanol tyrosol and galacturonic acid than those of the other rootstocks table 1s occasionally in 2016 pri wines showed lower ethyl acetate concentrations than rdi wines there were no significant interactive r x im effects the wine mineral nutrition analysis revealed that wines from 161 49c had significantly lower concentrations of p and k than those of the rest of the rootstocks table 7 in addition 161 49c and 41b wines had significantly higher zn concentrations than 140ru wines and 161 49c 1103 p and 110r wines had significantly higher b concentrations than 41b wines table 7 the k and zn concentrations in pri wines were significantly lower than in rdi wines the year had a significant effect on the mineral content of the wines and the interaction r x im had a significant effect on the zn concentration thus pri wines from 161 49c 110r 41b and 140ru had lower zn concentrations than rdi wines except for 1103 p where the opposite effect was observed table 7 additional mineral nutrition analysis also showed that 161 49c grapes had higher b concentrations than 110r and 140ru grapes and lower concentrations of cu na and p than 110r or 1103 p grapes table 2s supporting information 3 2 aromatic profile of the wines and sensory analysis the 49 major and minor compounds quantified in the red wines produced from the monastrell grapes were arranged in five chemical families alcohols esters terpenes volatile fatty acids and others table 8 alcohols and esters were the major groups in terms of the number and concentration of aromatic compounds identified in all wine samples followed by volatile fatty acids and terpenes the aromatic profiles of the wines in 2015 and 2016 showed significant differences due to the year rootstock and to a lesser extent irrigation method table 8 the rootstock affected the concentrations of 11 compounds and the irrigation method only affected the concentrations of two compounds significantly 2 methyl 1 butanol naphthalene in general for all rootstocks 2016 resulted in more aromatic wines than 2015 and the most abundant aromatic compounds were alcohols 2 methyl 1 butanol phenyl ethanol esters ethyl octanoate ethyl decanoate ethyl acetate volatile fatty acids butanoic acid and 2 octanone wines from rootstocks 1103 p and 41b had the highest concentrations of aromatic compounds whereas 110r wines had the lowest concentrations thus wines from the high vigor rootstock 1103 p showed higher concentration of alcohols propanol hexanol esters ethyl 3 oh butanoate diethyl succinate ethyl dodecanoate 2 octanone and acetic acid than wines from other rootstocks conversely low vigor rootstocks 161 49c and 110r had significantly lower concentrations of alcohols propanol hexanol esters 3 methyl butyl butanoate 3 methyl ethyl butanoate methyl nonanoate ethyl dodecanoate 2 octanone and acetic acid table 8 in addition regardless of the rootstock pri wines had significantly higher concentrations of 2 methyl 1 butanol an alcohol and the most abundant aromatic compound total higher alcohols and naphthalene than rdi wines there were no significant interactions between the rootstock and irrigation method the score for the sensory analysis of the wines after alf also differed significantly according to the rootstock irrigation method year and the interaction r x im table 9 wines from rootstocks 161 49c and 140ru followed by 110r were the best valued globally having the lowest scores in the visual olfactory and gustatory phases and harmony and the lowest final score conversely 41b and 1103 p wines were the worst valued obtaining the highest scores table 9 the year with the best score was 2014 in general pri wines obtained worse scores in the olfactory phase intensity gustatory phase intensity and quality and harmony and lower final scores than rdi wines nevertheless there were significant interactive r x im effects the professional tasters appreciated in the sensory analysis of the wines averaged for the three years a greater number of positive attributes in 161 49c wines followed by 140ru and more negative attributes for 41b and 1103 p fig 1s 3 3 relationships between wine quality parameters aromatic compounds and sensory analyses according to the pearson correlation coefficients obtained between the quality parameters and the sensory analysis of the wines the polyphenolic and alcohol contents were significantly and positively correlated with the global sensory appreciation of the wines table 10 therefore overall wines with higher values of ipt anthocyanins alcohol and qiwine obtained better olfactory gustatory harmony and total scores lower values in the tasting table 10 the values of ipt ci tannins concentration and qiwine were also significantly and negatively correlated with the concentrations of several families of aromatic compounds such as alcohols volatile fatty acids and esters and with the total aromatic compounds in the wines fig 1 besides the concentration of total anthocyanins was correlated negatively with that of volatile fatty acids but positively with the concentration of alcohols the concentration of tannins and the ci were also correlated significantly and positively with the volatile fatty acids fig 1 in addition the greater the concentration of aromatic compounds in the wine the worse the score in the sensory tasting fig 2 the only exception were the volatile fatty acids for which a greater concentration was significantly correlated with a better score in the gustatory phase intensity fig 2 3 4 principal component analysis of the wines the analysis of the principal components pca showed a separation between wines from the different combinations r x im fig 3 the first principal component pc1 explains 38 90 the second pc2 explains 26 53 and the third component pc3 explains 21 99 of the total variance macronutrients included k antioxidant activity and sugars glycerol contributed in this order greatly to pc1 defined as nutrition sugars in the case of pc2 defined as astringency bitterness the principal parameters to explain it were tannins content sensory analysis score and anthocyanins tannins ratio the third component pc3 defined as flavonoids alcohol content was greatly explained by two variables qiwine and alcohol fig 3 there was a clear separation between 161 49c pri wines and the rest mainly in quality attributes related with pc3 flavonoids alcohol content these distinct wines were better characterized by lower k content greater antioxidant activity qiwine related to a high polyphenolic content and color intensity and high alcohol the analysis cluster for each component also showed that 161 49c pri wines were closer to 41b pri wines and 161 49 rdi wines for pc1 high antioxidant activity and 110r rdi wines for pc 2 lower astringency and better organoleptic evaluation in addition 110r pri wines were better explained by differences in pc1 and pc2 higher tannins content lower macronutrients and worse organoleptic perception compared to 110r rdi wines in contrast overall pca showed similar component loadings and key variables in 140ru wines indicating no clear differences between pri and rdi wines in addition wines from 41b pri clearly separated from the rest in quality attributes related with pc 2 related with astringency mainly due to a greater tannins content and worse sensory evaluation and pc 3 lower qiwine and alcohol fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 rootstock effect the chemical composition and global quality of monastrell wine was significantly affected by the rootstock overall wine phenolics mirrored differences in fruit phenolics romero et al 2018 as supported by other studies casassa et al 2015 wines from low vigor high berry quality rootstocks 161 49c 110r enhanced significantly the wine phenolic concentration and chromatic characteristics giving also higher qiwine scores than high vigor low berry quality rootstocks 1103 p 140ru in particular rootstock 161 49c which was one of the least productive and gave grapes with the highest phenolic content in the berries total anthocyanins highest nutraceutical potential resveratrol derivatives and better global berry quality qioverall romero et al 2018 also gave the wines with the highest color intensity sugars content antioxidant activity and global quality qiwine tables 2 and 6 the hplc analysis also revealed that the levels of derivatives of anthocyanins mainly malvidin 3 o monoglucoside the most abundant tri hydroxylated anthocyanin and flavonols quercetin miricetin were significantly enhanced in wines from 161 49c an increase in trihydroxylated anthocyanins especially malvidin derivatives has been observed also in other di studies castellarin et al 2007a b santesteban et al 2011 brillante et al 2018 and rootstocks studies koundouras et al 2009 suggesting a shift in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway towards higher transcription levels of f3 5 h rather than f3 h and stimulation of the activity of the 3 o and 5 o methyltransferase enzymes resulting in an increase in methylated anthocyanins mainly malvidin romero et al 2016b in contrast in cabernet sauvignon cs bindon et al 2008 found that pri changed the methylation step of anthocyanin synthesis increasing non malvidin anthocyanins while malvidin glucosides were unaffected the enrichment in trihydroxylated anthocyanins mainly malvidin 3 o monoglucosides constitutes also an enrichment of purple blue pigments hence modifying the must and wine quality castellarin et al 2006 the 161 49c wines showed lower l h and b and higher c and a table 3 which means darker and more intense wine color a greater fraction of blue and red colors greater purity and more vivid color in red wines these metabolites malvidin flavonols are important components in the determination of wine style and quality as flavonols can act as copigments and conjugate to anthocyanins a process called copigmentation that reinforces the long term stability of wine color castellarin et al 2012 especially in young wines where the copigmentation fraction is maximal heras roger et al 2016 therefore 161 49c wines with higher malvidin and flavonols contents probably increased copigmentation processes which also involves a wine color shift towards increased color intensity darker red hues lower yellow hues and higher percentage of blue color darker and purplish wines heras roger et al 2016 this improvement in wine color characteristics may have contributed to the good visual appreciation of these wines table 9 besides the enhanced presence of malvidin forms of anthocyanins and flavonols derivatives and greater antioxidant activity in wines can lead to multiple health benefits in humans de vries et al 2001 graf et al 2005 quintieri et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in contrast wines from rootstock 140ru showed the lowest ci c and a and the highest l which means lighter wine color lower purity less vivid color and a lower fraction of red color table 3 the lower berry weight and yield romero et al 2018 and lower must percentage 60 9 for rootstock 161 49c data not shown could also have enhanced the levels of metabolites in the must and wine due to a greater concentration effect in contrast bigger berries 110r and 140ru romero et al 2018 and a higher must percentage 63 5 and 62 7 respectively data not shown probably produced a dilution effect and reduced the total concentration of flavonoids in the must and wine romero et al 2016 the concentrations of micronutrients such as zn and b were higher in 161 49c wines than in 41b b or 140ru wines zn table 7 mirroring what was observed in the leaves higher b romero et al 2018 and grapes higher b table 2s probably also due to a greater concentration effect boron increases the synthesis of carbohydrates and their movement especially that of sucrose from the leaves to the roots and fruiting bodies thus increasing the sugar content in the fruit batukaev et al 2016 this could explain the increased sugar content in 161 49c berries despite the fact that the plants had lower photosynthesis rates and total leaf area than other rootstocks romero et al 2018 the greater sugar contents in 161 49c berries and musts were also reflected in higher sugar contents after fermentation in 161 49c wines table 6 on the other hand the concentrations of some important macronutrients such as p and k were reduced in wines from rootstock 161 49c in accordance with the lower mineral content in grapes p na cu table 2s and leaves n p romero et al 2018 this was probably due to greater cumulative vine water stress and a lower water uptake transport capacity in this rootstock romero et al 2018 the content of p in wines is usually related to its levels in their musts but part of it also comes from soil sirén et al 2015 rootstocks 161 49c and 140ru also increased significantly the total amino acids in the must table 5 and wines table 6 compared to the other rootstocks which could also have altered the wine metabolomic and aromatic composition in particular 161 49c must had higher concentrations of gly tyr and phe while 140ru must had more ser arg glu ala and pro table 5 the amino acids in must as a n source serve as precursors for the synthesis of wine volatile aromatic compounds during fermentation such as higher alcohols bell and henschke 2005 thus contributing to the overall taste of the wine grimplet et al 2009 therefore the increase in the concentration of the major nitrogenous compounds such as total amino acids arginine or glutamine important n sources for yeast and consequently of the yeast assimilable nitrogen yan may have favoured the balance between desirable and undesirable chemical and sensory wine attributes bell and henschke 2005 the significantly higher concentration of pro the most abundant amino acid in must and wines in 140ru and 161 49c wines tables 6 1s could have contributed to an enhancement of sweetness deluc et al 2009 in previous work pro and arg were closely associated with the body and balance scores of the wines in sensory tests chang et al 2014 this is also congruent with the better final scores and greater preference obtained by the wines from these two rootstocks in the sensory analysis table 9 the significant p 0 05 correlation coefficients between the polyphenol content anthocyanins ipts tannins qiwine alcoholic degree and score in the wine sensory analysis table 10 suggest that overall the greater the polyphenolic and alcohol content of the wine the better valued and more preferred by the tasters it was as occurred for 161 49c and 110r wines table 9 a higher alcohol ethanol content in wines leads to a greater perceivable alcoholic aroma and hot mouthfeel hopfer et al 2015 and has been shown to decrease the perception of astringency and roughness mcrae and kennedy 2011 in addition anthocyanins contribute to wine flavor as high levels of anthocyanins are necessary to obtain not only visual intensity but also balance and mellowness cheynier et al 1998 higher concentrations of anthocyanins and polysaccharides glucose fructose total sugars and a higher anthocyanins sugars ratio 161 49c wines tables 2 and 6 could have contributed to a better mouthfeel perception of these wines as this has been associated previously with lower astringency ratings of wines and reduction of the unpleasant puckering sensation of young wines mcrae and kennedy 2011 another interesting point is that 140ru wines despite having lower polyphenolic contents and worse chromatic characteristics were among the wines that were best valued and most preferred by the tasters table 9 this indicates that factors additional to the gross polyphenolic content and chromatic characteristics come into play in the better sensory and organoleptic perception of wines high quality is not driven by individual sensory descriptors but is the result of several multiple descriptors acting together in the wine matrix hopfer et al 2015 in particular wine quality has been claimed to depend also on the anthocyanins to tannins ratio cheynier et al 1998 therefore lower tannins levels and higher anthocyanins tannins ratios associated with a high alcohol content as observed in wines from rootstocks 140ru and 161 49c table 2 could also have contributed to a better sensory perception of these wines these properties have been related previously to more intense and balanced wines mellowness mouthfullness lower astringency and green tannin perception which is also possibly enhanced by alcohol cheynier et al 1998 the nmr metabolomic analysis revealed other positive chemical features that may also have contributed to a greater taste preference for these wines 161 49c and 140ru lower methanol acetic acid and galacturonic acid 161 49c higher tartaric acid 161 49c and lactic acid 140ru and a higher tartaric malic ratio 161 49c 140ru tables 1s and 8 a lower malic acid concentration higher tartaric malic ratio and higher lactic acid concentration in wines can suppose the replacement of the strong green taste of l malic acid with the less aggressive or slightly sour taste of lactic acid volschenk et al 2006 tartaric acid is responsible for much of the tart taste of wine and wine acidity chang et al 2014 contributing to both the biological stability and the longevity of wine conde et al 2007 and has more pleasant organoleptic properties than malic acid poni et al 2018 in addition 140ru wines had significantly higher concentrations above the odor threshold value table 8 of an aromatic ester methyl nonanoate compared to 1103 p 110r or 161 49c wines which could also confer a coconut floral fruit odor on these wines nih pubchem 2018 in contrast wines from rootstocks 41b and 1103 p showed some negative chemical features defect causing compounds such as higher total tannins 41b 1103 p greater methanol and acetaldehyde contents 41b both above their odor threshold values 100 mg l 1 for methanol and 19 2 mg l 1 for acetaldehyde gónzalez robles and cook 2016 greater galacturonic 41b and acetic acids contents 1103 p and lower anthocyanins tannins ratios 41b 1103 p ºalcohol 41b sugar contents 41b and tartaric malic ratios tables 2 6 8 and 1s high amounts of tannins are undesirable because they are related to bitter astringent and dry sensations chang et al 2014 cheynier et al 2006 sáenz navajas et al 2018 in addition a lower tartaric malic ratio confers a green taste on wine and excessive amounts of acetic acid are detrimental to the taste giving a wine that tastes sour and thin and is less appealing to consumers with an unpleasant aroma and palate joyeux et al 1984 conde et al 2007 a high galacturonic acid content is not desirable either and is associated with the degradation of pectic compounds due to grape infection by botrytis cinérea mihaljevic zulj et al 2015 in addition acetaldehyde related to wine oxidation imparts a green bruised apple or nutty aroma bell and henschke 2005 and can increase the perception of astringency mcrae and kennedy 2011 while excess methanol is not desirable due to its toxicity and characteristic sweet pungent solvent like odor gónzalez robles and cook 2016 these factors may have contributed to the worse overall sensory and organoleptic perception of these wines the 41b and 1103 p wines showed more negative than positive attributes fig 1s and were the ones valued worst table 9 among the negative attributes reported by the panel members for these wines stand out color with a light layer light browning fruits not fully ripe notes of greenery on the nose and mouth lack of structure and body in the mouth slight reduction poor acidity and not very intense flavor notes of pepper and acetaldehyde astringent and bitter mouthfeel and dryness this is congruent with the results of hopfer et al 2015 who reported that expert tasters associated low wine quality with the presence of defects and flaws such as microbial spoilage the presence of atypical aromas e g vegetable green or oxidation aromas or an unbalanced flavour profile the rootstock also altered the concentrations of volatile aromatic compounds mainly higher alcohols ha and esters some of these key odor active compounds surpassed their odor threshold values otv table 9 which may have also altered the sensory perception of the wines table 9 interestingly the most aromatic wines 1103 p and 41b had lower polyphenolic contents in accordance with the inverse relationship between polyphenols and aromatic compounds fig 1 and besides were those least preferred by the experts table 9 rather wines of low or medium aromaticity 161 49c 140ru 110r were the ones most preferred by the tasters they had the best scores in the olfactory phase and the best final sensory score agreeing with the significant inverse relationship between the concentration of aromatic compounds in the wine and the score obtained in the sensory tasting fig 2 these results are in agreement with other observations where wines of high quality had volatile profiles without extreme concentrations hopfer et al 2015 therefore not all volatile aromatic compounds are associated with a pleasant aroma and not all contribute to the aroma equally icc et al 2016 for example the most aromatic wines from rootstock 1103 p which was the worst evaluated in the olfactory phase table 9 had higher levels of total ha propanol hexanol esters such as ethyl dodecanoate 3 methyl ethyl butanoate above its otv also in 41b wine ethyl 3 oh butanoate and diethyl succinate and 2 octanone above its otv also in 41b and 140ru wines table 8 in wines with high ha levels red fruit aroma and woody character can be masked or suppressed thus decreasing the appreciation preference and perceived quality of fruity and woody wines de la fuente blanco et al 2016 de la et al 2017 in addition alcohols with six carbon atoms hexenols and hexanols bestowed plant grass and herbaceous nuances on the wines vilanova et al 2012 cortés dieguez et al 2015 propanol may also confer an odor quality described as pungent harsh ripe fruit and alcohol cortés dieguez et al 2015 besides diethyl succinate and 3 methyl ethyl butanoate are compounds related to ageing and or oxidation reactions and have been associated with green flavor dried fruit aroma hopfer et al 2015 while 2 octanone a methyl ketone may confer a fatty green cheese aroma and a bitter fruity and camphor taste giving altogether an unpleasant odor and flavor belitz and grosch 1999 similarly previous studies reported that with increased levels of some alcohols 1 butanol and esters 3 methyl ethyl butanoate ethyl 2 methyl butanoate among others wine experts scored the wines lower for quality hopfer et al 2015 in contrast 161 49c and 110r wines had lower concentrations of alcohols mainly hexanol esters mainly ethyl dodecanoate 3 methyl butyl butanoate ethyl 3 oh butanoate 161 49c and 2 octanone which may have contributed to a better olfactory perception of these wines 4 2 effects of the irrigation method pri vs rdi and its interaction with the rootstock the irrigation method pri vs rdi also altered the chemical composition and aromatic profile of the wines although to a lesser extent than the rootstock the differences observed in the berries romero et al 2018 were attenuated in the wines thus pri wines had significantly greater od620nm od520nm od420nm reducing sugars arginine and flavonol derivatives quercetin 3 o glucoside and lower dissolved oxygen ethyl acetate and k and zn concentrations compared to rdi wines previous studies in cs wines produced under pri showed a significant increase 15 in wine color density bindon et al 2008 greater color absorbance and higher concentrations of residual sugars non fermented and flavonols derivatives quercetin 3 o glucoside may contribute to perception of a more intense wine color greater perceived sweetness hopfer et al 2015 and increased nutraceutical potential of pri wines respectively lower dissolved oxygen can also avoid oxidation processes in sensitive young red wines which can be beneficial in this type of wine the lower k concentrations found in pri wines can be positive to avoid acidity losses and an increase in ph but on the other hand lower k and zn contents can decrease the nutritional value of the wine in addition overall pri wines were more aromatic than rdi wines since pri increased significantly the concentrations of total ha mainly 2 methyl 1 butanol the most abundant aromatic compound and naphthalene in the wines table 8 therefore the higher concentrations of both these aromatic compounds in pri wines which surpassed the detectable odor thresholds table 8 could have conferred an unpleasant aroma and flavor both 2 methyl 1 butanol and naphthalene confer strong and characteristic odors corresponding to alcohol harsh vinous and green for 2 methyl 1 butanol and mothballs for naphthalene nih pubchem 2018 this was reflected in the poor scores for pri wines in the sensory evaluation and organoleptic perception olfactory and gustatory phases table 9 in cs pri increased the presence of volatile c13 norisoprenoids some with positive sensory characteristics in wines β damascenone β ionone and others with negative characteristics such as a kerosene like odor 1 1 6 trimethyl 1 2 dihydronaphtalene tdn bindon et al 2007 nevertheless the significant interactive r x im effects on the wine chemical composition indicate that overall for low medium vigor rootstocks especially 161 49c followed by 41b pri was more beneficial than rdi since it increased blue red and yellow color components 161 49c 41b table 2 anthocyanin derivatives malvidin 161 49c amino acids arg 161 49c 41b reducing sugars 41b 161 49c fructose 161 49c total sugars 161 49c anthocyanins sugars ratio 161 49c qiwine 161 49c flavonol derivatives 41b and visual perception 41b in addition 110r pri wines showed also some improvements in their phenolic composition compared to 110r rdi wines but gustatory perception and final sensory score was significantly worse probably due to lower content of fructose and total sugars table 6 and higher content of aromatic compounds total alcohols table 8 on the other hand for rootstocks of higher vigor and productivity 1103 p 140ru pri did not produce clear advantages in the wine rather rdi was more beneficial for wine composition and global quality due to an improved polyphenolics concentration qiwine and sensory perception pca cluster analysis also showed that 161 49c pri wines were clearly differentiated from the other rootstock im combinations mainly for their best quality higher qiwine and alcohol pc3 in contrast 41b pri wines were also differentiated for pc2 and pc3 mainly for their worst quality higher tannins content lower qiwine and alcohol and worse sensory evaluation fig 3 5 conclusions based on these results and those of romero et al 2018 we conclude that the choice of the rootstock had a very significant effect on the monastrell berry and wine composition the application of low annual water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 with well designed di strategies to low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r resulted in moderate yields 7 400 9 900 kg ha 1 with higher global berry and wine quality and greater nutraceutical potential compared to other rootstocks interestingly grafting monastrell on 140ru increased substantially the berry yield and wue 72 compared to the average of the other rootstocks allowing the production of a greater volume of wine these wines had poorer polyphenolic contents nutraceutical potential and chromatic characteristics due mainly to greater dilution effects but a high content of lactic acid and amino acids and tartaric malic and anthocyanins tannins ratios as well as a low concentration of
