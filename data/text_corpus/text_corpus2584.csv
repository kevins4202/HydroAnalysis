1 5 ml sybr green were added in after a contact time for 15 min a flow cytometer bd the usa was used to detect the live and dead cells then the density map of live dead cells was obtained 6 3 result and discussion 3 1 the denitrification activity of fe mfc by sequencing batch operation in total 6 cycles were carried out to determine the denitrification efficiency of the fe mfc fig 2 a showed the trend of no3 n concentration along with time during each cycle in cycle 1 the no3 n concentration decreased sharply on the 1st day with rate of 0 13 mg n h and then slowly decreased in the remaining 5 days to around 5 mg n l in effluent the sharp decrease was deduced to be caused by the high no3 n concentration at the very beginning as denitrification was reported being a first order reaction 23 cycle 2 to cycle 6 shared the same trend as that in cycle 1 the first order kinetic reaction rate constants of bio cathode denitrification in all 6 cycles were calculated and shown in table 1 comparing with cycle 1 the kinetic reaction rate constant in cycle 6 decreased by 87 moreover the effluent no3 n concentration in cycle 6 became above 30 mg n l fig 2 b showed the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n from cycle 1 to cycle 6 in the control group with abiotic cathode no obvious decrease of nitrate was observed in 7 days with the bio cathode the vlr of no3 n remained stable at 0 006 kg n m3 d during 6 cycles the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n in cycle 1 were 92 and 0 0055 kg n m3 d respectively however in cycle 6 the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n decreased by 68 and 67 respectively even though the denitrification efficiency and rate deteriorated along with time the denitrification rate is still impressive an integrated short cut nitrification and autotrophic denitrification mfc was reported to remove nitrogen pollution by li et al 24 the nitrate reduction rate was 0 0037 kg n m3 d in denitrification mfc with pt cathode while it decreased to 0 0028 kg n m3 d in denitrification mfc without pt cathode 24 for the bio cathode denitrification with bio anode the nitrate reduction rate reached 0 101 kg n m3 d 11 which was much higher than that obtained in this study considering the adaption of microbes to the new environment the deterioration of fe mfc in short term 6 cycles in total 42 days was in expectation by the fluorescence method the proportion of live cells in biofilm before and after short term operation was determined almost the same 75 fig s2 the deterioration was speculated to be caused by 1 the decrease of active biomass on the bio cathode as shedding of biofilm was observed 2 the passivation of iron anode as a layer of ferrophosphorus precipitate was observed covering the iron anode 3 the consumption of iron as holes were observed on the iron anode fig s3 and 4 the increase of internal resistance detailed discussions were shown below during the whole operation no nitrite was detected in the effluent and the effluent nh4 n concentration maintained around 2 mg l 3 2 the electricity generation efficiency of fe mfc the electricity generation of fe mfc is closely related with the denitrification activity the output voltage and output power were detected to characterize the electricity generation of fe mfc fig 3 a showed the trend of output voltage of fe mfc along with time during the 6 cycles operation the output voltage in each cycle had a similar trend versus time that was all rose rapidly to the maximum about 540 20 mv in 2 h then decreased slightly and entered the plateau period about 460 50 mv for 80 h finally dropped linearly to below 15 mv at the beginning of each cycle the output voltage was very close to the open circuit voltage because of the instantaneous connection of circuit then the output voltage decreased slightly and stabilized at a certain value a bit lower than the open circuit voltage along with the stability of the circuit in this plateau period the output voltage 460 mv was higher than that in mfc with bio cathode and fe anode 350 mv 16 and even higher than that in mfc with bio cathode and bio anode 300 mv 11 with the consumption of substrate no3 the electron acceptor was insufficient thus the output voltage began to decrease until the replacement of cathode solution then a new cycle started zooming in the plateau period of 6 cycles the average output voltage of each cycle decreased slightly from cycle 1 to cycle 6 that might be caused by the consumption and passivation of iron anode by integrating the power curve along with time the power generated by mfc in each cycle was in order of 93 92 w 83 33 w 85 12 w 71 14 w 65 30 w 56 97 w which was enough for the lighting the cv curve of cathode was measured by cyclic voltammetry every 2 cycles fig s4 and by integrating the corresponding cv curve the volt ampere charge q of cathode was calculated fig 3 b the q value stands for the number of charges consumed by cathode 25 26 the decrease of q value signified the activity decrease of bio cathode 27 moreover the ce of mfc was calculated and shown in fig s5 the decrease of ce also supported the above conclusion all evidences here supported the conclusion in section 3 1 that the denitrification efficiency and rate deteriorated along with the operation time further eis was performed to determine the internal resistance of mfc fig 4 a table 2 according to section 2 5 4 only the ohmic resistance r ohm and the charge transfer resistance r ct were considered as the internal resistance even with nanowires around cells fig s6 the r ohm still increased slightly as nanowire was not the only factor to decrease the r ohm 28 the r ct is closely related with the biofilm activity the interaction between microbes and electrodes and the redox properties of electrode materials 29 the increase of r ct signified the decrease of bio cathode activity 30 from table 2 the internal resistance of mfc increased gradually from cycle 1 to cycle 6 which was in consistent with results of the power density curve in fig 4 b with the increase of internal resistance additionally the increase of anode potential and the decrease of cathode potential fig s7 no wonder the output voltage of fe mfc decreased which was already mentioned above 3 3 microbial community analysis further to reveal the mechanism of bio cathode denitrification microbial community analysis was performed the sample before cycle 1 was labeled as sample 1 and those after cycle 2 4 and 6 were labeled as sample 2 3and 4 respectively all dilution curves have flat ends indicating appropriate sequencing depth fig s8 systematic classification of microorganisms in biofilms was shown in fig 5 at the phylum level fig 5 a proteobacteria always accounted for the largest proportion during the whole continuous operation the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the samples 1 2 3 and 4 were 94 97 87 75 94 30 and 92 77 respectively there was no significant change of microbial communities at the phylum level as is known that most of the denitrifying bacteria belonged to proteobacteria 31 based on the analysis at the genus level fig 5 b pseudofulvimonas unclassified f rhodobacteraceae azoarcus and thauera were predominated among them pseudofulvimonas and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae were typical denitrifying bacteria 32 33 however their proportion in the biofilm gradually decreased it might be difficult for pseudofulvimonas and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae to adapt to use electrode electron as electron donor on the contrary the abundance of thauera and azoarcus increased along with operation time thauera was reported to reduce no3 n directly with electrode electrons as electron donors 34 but for azoarcus no reports about its bio cathode denitrification ability were available azoarcus was able to convert nitrite or nitrate to nitrogen with organic carbon as electron donor 35 36 thus it could not be ruled out that azoarcus used the dead bacterial organisms as electron donor to reduce nitrate 3 4 the look back and prospects of fe mfc to perform denitrification the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n reached maximum 93 and 0 0056 kg n m3 d in cycle 1 which were higher than the reported 0 0037 kg n m3 d in mfc with pt cathode 24 but lower than the reported 0 101 kg n m3 d in mfc with bio cathode and bio anode 11 however because of the loss of active biomass passivation consumption of iron anode and the increase of internal resistance the nitrate removal efficiency and rate deteriorated along with the operation time electricity generation was observed in fe mfc as electrons travelled from the iron anode to the bio cathode the output voltage could stabilize above 400 mv for 80 h which were higher than the reported 350 mv in mfc with bio cathode and fe anode 16 and 300 mv in mfc with bio cathode and bio anode 11 though the output voltage decreased a bit along with time the power generated was always above 50 w which was enough for municipal domestic lighting with fe mfc both co2 emission reduction and electricity generation came true for denitrification this technology will promote the development of denitrification under carbon neutralization policy what disappointed was that the deterioration of denitrification efficiency and electricity generation efficiency the future studies should focus on 1 the optimization and enrichment of the seeding sludge for fe mfc in the current study the seeding sludge was only dealt with starvation treatment to some extent the long term operation 6 cycles in total 42 days acted as the enrichment stage for microbial communities who could use electrode electron as electron donor those who could not use electrode electron as electron donor died finally and fell off from the bio cathode 30 to avoid the deterioration and keep stable denitrification performance the source of seeding sludge should be optimized and the acclimatization of seeding sludge should be prolonged 2 the frequency to replace the iron anode and the disposal of oxidized anode and chemical sludge ferrophosphorus precipitate as mentioned in section 3 1 a layer of ferrophosphorus precipitate was observed covering the iron anode during the short term operation however away from the precipitate on iron anode surface holes were observed indicating the consumption of iron therefore long term operation should be carried out to determine the frequency of iron anode replacement moreover to pursue sustainable development the proper treatment of deteriorated and oxidized anode should be paid attention the recycle of the ferrous iron salt solution in anode chamber and the chemical sludge ferrophosphorus precipitate should be considered 3 to decrease the internal resistance as mentioned in section 3 2 the internal resistance increased along with time the increasing internal resistance resulted in the decrease of output voltage and the output power measures such as salts addition should be adopted to maintain low internal resistance thus ensuring high output voltage and power besides the damage of long term operation on proton exchange membrane pem should be investigated and the frequency to replace pem should also be determined 4 conclusion with fe mfc both co2 emission reduction and electricity generation were achieved for denitrification the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n reached maximum 93 and 0 0056 kg n m3 d in cycle 1 the output voltage and electric power could stabilize above 400 mv and 50 w after 6 cycles operation the autotrophic denitrifier thauera dominated the microbial community on the bio cathode indicating the adaption of microbes to the new environment the fe mfc technology showed remarkable ability to treat nitrogen pollution in low c n wastewater without co2 emission this new technology also provides new thought for denitrification under carbon neutralization policy further researches should focus on the stabilities of fe mfc to perform denitrification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work the authors declare that they do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science

external circuit individually a digital multimeter was used to record the current the output voltage the cathode potential and the anode potential with each resistance 11 the cathode potential and anode potential were both relative to the potential of the ag agcl electrode 0 197 v vs the standard hydrogen electrode the power density p w m 3 was calculated according to eq 6 6 p u 2 rv where p

versus current the polarization curve was obtained by plotting the spots of power density versus current the power density curve was obtained 11 2 5 3 cyclic voltammetry cv test and voltammetric charge an electrochemical workstation solartron 1470e usa was used to conduct cv tests using three electrodes namely the working electrode the air cathode the counter electrode the iron anode and the reference electrode ag agcl the reference electrode was placed between the counter electrode and the working electrode but close to the working electrode with fresh substrate and external resistance of 1000 ω the cv scanning run only after 2 h in an open circuit the voltage scanning range was 0 4 v to 0 4 v and the scanning speed was 0 001 v s 12 by integrating the cv curve the voltammetric

spectroscopy eis test the electrochemical workstation solartron 1470e usa was applied to perform the eis test and determine the internal resistance of mfc every 2 cycles with fresh substrate and three electrodes mentioned above the eis test started after 2 h in an open circuit the frequency ranged from 1000 khz to 10 mhz the internal resistance consisted of the ohmic resistance the charge transfer resistance and the diffusion resistance the nyquist pattern was obtained by performing interference on the mfc system the contribution of ohmic resistance charge transfer resistance and diffusion resistance to the internal resistance were calculated accurately as there was no diffusion resistance detected only the ohmic resistance r ohm and the charge transfer resistance r ct were considered and discussed to determine the internal resistance of mfc system the equivalent circuit containing ohmic resistance and charge transfer resistance was shown in fig s1 the constant phase element cpe represented a capacitor which was formed at the interface between the electrode and its surroundings 19 the zsimpwin software was used to analyze the measured nyquist pattern to calculate the parametric values through the fitting process of the equivalent circuit model fig s1 and the measured data 20 2 6 microbiological analyses 2 6 1 microbial morphology field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi japan was used to observe the cell morphology samples were prepared according to the method described by wang et al 21 2 6 2 microbial community total dna of bio cathode microbes was extracted by a dna extraction kit mp biochemicals usa the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal bacterial primers 338f 50 actcctacgggaggcag 30 and 805r 50 gactaccagggtatct aatcc

kit axygen usa the gene sequencing and the primary analysis of microbial community were delegated to the majorbio co ltd shanghai china 22 2 6 3 the live cell percentage biofilm on the bio cathode was sampled and washed with phosphate buffered solution ph 7 by 3 times then flocs were crushed by ultrasound to obtain suspended cell solution for 1 ml suspended cell solution 1 5 ml propidium iodide and 1 5 ml sybr green were added in after a contact time for 15 min a flow cytometer bd the usa was used to detect the live and dead cells then the density map of live dead cells was obtained 6 3 result and discussion 3 1 the denitrification activity of fe mfc by sequencing batch operation in total 6 cycles were carried out to determine the denitrification efficiency of the fe mfc fig 2 a showed the trend of no3 n concentration along with time during each cycle in cycle 1 the no3 n concentration decreased sharply on the 1st day with rate of 0 13 mg n h and then slowly decreased in the remaining 5 days to around 5 mg n l in effluent the sharp decrease was deduced to be caused by the high no3 n concentration at the very beginning as denitrification was reported being a first order reaction 23 cycle 2 to cycle 6 shared the same trend as that in cycle 1 the first order kinetic reaction rate constants of bio cathode denitrification in all 6 cycles were calculated and shown in table 1 comparing with cycle 1 the kinetic reaction rate constant in cycle 6 decreased by 87 moreover the effluent no3 n concentration in cycle 6 became above 30 mg n l fig 2 b showed the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n from cycle 1 to cycle 6 in the control group with abiotic cathode no obvious decrease of nitrate was observed in 7 days with the bio cathode the vlr of no3 n remained stable at 0 006 kg n m3 d during 6 cycles the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n in cycle 1 were 92 and 0 0055 kg n m3 d respectively however in cycle 6 the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n decreased by 68 and 67 respectively even though the denitrification efficiency and rate deteriorated along with time the denitrification rate is still impressive an integrated short cut nitrification and autotrophic denitrification mfc was reported to remove nitrogen pollution by li et al 24 the nitrate reduction rate was 0 0037 kg n m3 d in denitrification mfc with pt cathode while it decreased to 0 0028 kg n m3 d in denitrification mfc without pt cathode 24 for the bio cathode denitrification with bio anode the nitrate reduction rate reached 0 101 kg n m3 d 11 which was much higher than that obtained in this study considering the adaption of microbes to the new environment the deterioration of fe mfc in short term 6 cycles in total 42 days was in expectation by the fluorescence method the proportion of live cells in biofilm before and after short term operation was determined almost the same 75 fig s2 the deterioration was speculated to be caused by 1 the decrease of active biomass on the bio cathode as shedding of biofilm was observed 2 the passivation of iron anode as a layer of ferrophosphorus precipitate was observed covering the iron anode 3 the consumption of iron as holes were observed on the iron anode fig s3 and 4 the increase of internal resistance detailed discussions were shown below during the whole operation no nitrite was detected in the effluent and the effluent nh4 n concentration maintained around 2 mg l 3 2 the electricity generation efficiency of fe mfc the electricity generation of fe mfc is closely related with the denitrification activity the output voltage and output power were detected to characterize the electricity generation of fe mfc fig 3 a showed the trend of output voltage of fe mfc along with time during the 6 cycles operation the output voltage in each cycle had a similar trend versus time that was all rose rapidly to the maximum about 540 20 mv in 2 h then decreased slightly and entered the plateau period about 460 50 mv for 80 h finally dropped linearly to below 15 mv at the beginning of each cycle the output voltage was very close to the open circuit voltage because of the instantaneous connection of circuit then the output voltage decreased slightly and stabilized at a certain value a bit lower than the open circuit voltage along with the stability of the circuit in this plateau period the output voltage 460 mv was higher than that in mfc with bio cathode and fe anode 350 mv 16 and even higher than that in mfc with bio cathode and bio anode 300 mv 11 with the consumption of substrate no3 the electron acceptor was insufficient thus the output voltage began to decrease until the replacement of cathode solution then a new cycle started zooming in the plateau period of 6 cycles the average output voltage of each cycle decreased slightly from cycle 1 to cycle 6 that might be caused by the consumption and passivation of iron anode by integrating the power curve along with time the power generated by mfc in each cycle was in order of 93 92 w 83 33 w 85 12 w 71 14 w 65 30 w 56 97 w which was enough for the lighting the cv curve of cathode was measured by cyclic voltammetry every 2 cycles fig s4 and by integrating the corresponding cv curve the volt ampere charge q of cathode was calculated fig 3 b the q value stands for the number of charges consumed by cathode 25 26 the decrease of q value signified the activity decrease of bio cathode 27 moreover the ce of mfc was calculated and shown in fig s5 the decrease of ce also supported the above conclusion all evidences here supported the conclusion in section 3 1 that the denitrification efficiency and rate deteriorated along with the operation time further eis was performed to determine the internal resistance of mfc fig 4 a table 2 according to section 2 5 4 only the ohmic resistance r ohm and the charge transfer resistance r ct were considered as the internal resistance even with nanowires around cells fig s6 the r ohm still increased slightly as nanowire was not the only factor to decrease the r ohm 28 the r ct is closely related with the biofilm activity the interaction between microbes and electrodes and the redox properties of electrode materials 29 the increase of r ct signified the decrease of bio cathode activity 30 from table 2 the internal resistance of mfc increased gradually from cycle 1 to cycle 6 which was in consistent with results of the power density curve in fig 4 b with the increase of internal resistance additionally the increase of anode potential and the decrease of cathode potential fig s7 no wonder the output voltage of fe mfc decreased which was already mentioned above 3 3 microbial community analysis further to reveal the mechanism of bio cathode denitrification microbial community analysis was performed the sample before cycle 1 was labeled as sample 1 and those after cycle 2 4 and 6 were labeled as sample 2 3and 4 respectively all dilution curves have flat ends indicating appropriate sequencing depth fig s8 systematic classification of microorganisms in biofilms was shown in fig 5 at the phylum level fig 5 a proteobacteria always accounted for the largest proportion during the whole continuous operation the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the samples 1 2 3 and 4 were 94 97 87 75 94 30 and 92 77 respectively there was no significant change of microbial communities at the phylum level as is known that most of the denitrifying bacteria belonged to proteobacteria 31 based on the analysis at the genus level fig 5 b pseudofulvimonas unclassified f rhodobacteraceae azoarcus and thauera were predominated among them pseudofulvimonas and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae were typical denitrifying bacteria 32 33 however their proportion in the biofilm gradually decreased it might be difficult for pseudofulvimonas and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae to adapt to use electrode electron as electron donor on the contrary the abundance of thauera and azoarcus increased along with operation time thauera was reported to reduce no3 n directly with electrode electrons as electron donors 34 but for azoarcus no reports about its bio cathode denitrification ability were available azoarcus was able to convert nitrite or nitrate to nitrogen with organic carbon as electron donor 35 36 thus it could not be ruled out that azoarcus used the dead bacterial organisms as electron donor to reduce nitrate 3 4 the look back and prospects of fe mfc to perform denitrification the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n reached maximum 93 and 0 0056 kg n m3 d in cycle 1 which were higher than the reported 0 0037 kg n m3 d in mfc with pt cathode 24 but lower than the reported 0 101 kg n m3 d in mfc with bio cathode and bio anode 11 however because of the loss of active biomass passivation consumption of iron anode and the increase of internal resistance the nitrate removal efficiency and rate deteriorated along with the operation time electricity generation was observed in fe mfc as electrons travelled from the iron anode to the bio cathode the output voltage could stabilize above 400 mv for 80 h which were higher than the reported 350 mv in mfc with bio cathode and fe anode 16 and 300 mv in mfc with bio cathode and bio anode 11 though the output voltage decreased a bit along with time the power generated was always above 50 w which was enough for municipal domestic lighting with fe mfc both co2 emission reduction and electricity generation came true for denitrification this technology will promote the development of denitrification under carbon neutralization policy what disappointed was that the deterioration of denitrification efficiency and electricity generation efficiency the future studies should focus on 1 the optimization and enrichment of the seeding sludge for fe mfc in the current study the seeding sludge was only dealt with starvation treatment to some extent the long term operation 6 cycles in total 42 days acted as the enrichment stage for microbial communities who could use electrode electron as electron donor those who could not use electrode electron as electron donor died finally and fell off from the bio cathode 30 to avoid the deterioration and keep stable denitrification performance the source of seeding sludge should be optimized and the acclimatization of seeding sludge should be prolonged 2 the frequency to replace the iron anode and the disposal of oxidized anode and chemical sludge ferrophosphorus precipitate as mentioned in section 3 1 a layer of ferrophosphorus precipitate was observed covering the iron anode during the short term operation however away from the precipitate on iron anode surface holes were observed indicating the consumption of iron therefore long term operation should be carried out to determine the frequency of iron anode replacement moreover to pursue sustainable development the proper treatment of deteriorated and oxidized anode should be paid attention the recycle of the ferrous iron salt solution in anode chamber and the chemical sludge ferrophosphorus precipitate should be considered 3 to decrease the internal resistance as mentioned in section 3 2 the internal resistance increased along with time the increasing internal resistance resulted in the decrease of output voltage and the output power measures such as salts addition should be adopted to maintain low internal resistance thus ensuring high output voltage and power besides the damage of long term operation on proton exchange membrane pem should be investigated and the frequency to replace pem should also be determined 4 conclusion with fe mfc both co2 emission reduction and electricity generation were achieved for denitrification the removal efficiency and the vrr of no3 n reached maximum 93 and 0 0056 kg n m3 d in cycle 1 the output voltage and electric power could stabilize above 400 mv and 50 w after 6 cycles operation the autotrophic denitrifier thauera dominated the microbial community on the bio cathode indicating the adaption of microbes to the new environment the fe mfc technology showed remarkable ability to treat nitrogen pollution in low c n wastewater without co2 emission this new technology also provides new thought for denitrification under carbon neutralization policy further researches should focus on the stabilities of fe mfc to perform denitrification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work the authors declare that they do not

performance was examined by activating peroxymonosulfate pms for methylene blue mb degradation mb can be completely removed within 30 min when the mass ratio of mno2 sbc is greater than 5 and the degradation kinetics of mb is more in line with the pseudo first order kinetic model in the mno2 sbc pms system besides the pseudo first order kinetic constants k in mno2 sbc pms are significantly higher than that in sbc pms and mno2 pms and the largest degradation rate of mb is in 5 mno2 sbc pms system mno2 sbc exhibited excellent pms activation ability in a wide range of ph 5 9 with complete degradation of mb in 30 min furthermore mno2 sbc has good stability after five usages still activating pms for complete degradation of mb in 180 min the quenching experiments and epr spectrum indicated that both so4 oh and 1o2 were the main reactive oxygen species finally the probable mb degradation pathway was proposed in the mno2 pms system this study provides a reliable insight into sludge resource utilization sludge biochar modification and its catalytic performance improvement graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge biochar manganese dioxide aops peroxymonosulfate methylene blue 1 introduction with the acceleration of urbanization and the continuous increase of the population the demand and consumption of water resources are increasing 1 3 therefore it directly leads to the increase in municipal sludge production it is reported that sludge production with 80 moisture content in china has risen from 3 4 107 tons in 2015 to 5 107 tons in 2017 and nearly 80 of the remaining sludges have not been properly disposed 4 municipal sludge contains harmful substances such as refractory organic pollutants heavy metals and viral microorganisms but it also contains a large amount of organic matter therefore it is very necessary to handle the sludge accordingly to realize the reutilization harmless and reducing treatment 5 at present the sludge treatment methods mainly include sludge aerobic composting mixing with other materials to prepare building materials preparing sludge biochar etc 6 7 among them the sludge biochar has the characteristics of a loose surface and relatively large specific surface area so it can provide more active sites to perform the pollutants removal 8 at present there are many reports about the successful application of sludge biochar in environmental remediation 9 11 sludge biochar has been widely used as adsorbent and catalyst in various types of sewage treatment but it is still necessary to further improve its efficiency in removing target pollutants 12 14 now chemical modification is the most common method for sludge biochar mainly including acid base modification redox and loading metals 15 in recent years modification by iron manganese nickel copper and other transition metal to improve catalysis has been increasing in advanced oxidation processes aops 16 18 among them the manganese catalyst has the advantages of low toxicity great natural content and friendly environment 19 in this study sludge biochar sbc was prepared by pyrolysis from dehydrated sludge in sewage treatment plant and a serious mno2 sbc with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 were prepared by co precipitation method the physicochemical properties of catalysts were characterized and the catalytic performance of catalyst was examined by activating peroxymonosulfate pms for mb degradation in addition the main influencing factors including ph mb concentration pms concentration and catalysis dose were also investigated in mno2 sbc pms mb degradation system the reusability and stability of mno2 sbc were explored finally the synergistic catalytic mechanism of mno2 sbc and the possible removal route of mb were also proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 materials all reagents used were analytical grade and the experimental aqueous solution prepared by ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 25 mω potassium permanganate kmno4 manganese sulfate monohydrate mnso4 h2o polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 pvp c6h9no n and methylene blue mb were purchased from sinopharma chemical reagent co ltd china peroxymonosulfate pms 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 was supplied by rhawn reagent d2o 99 9 was purchased from macklin china 2 2 synthesis of catalysts dewatered sludges were collected from kaifu wastewater treatment plant in changsha hunan province china based on previous research sludge biochar sbc was prepared by pyrolysis method 8 firstly the collected sludge was first dried naturally for two days and then dried in air dry oven at 105 c for 12 h secondly the dried sludge was pulverized and passed through a 0 25 mm sieve thirdly the sludge powders were placed in quartz boat and then transferred it in vacuum anneal furnace for thermal treatment at 550 c for 2 h 5 c min under nitrogen n2 atmosphere lastly sbc was sifted through a 0 25 mm sieve and stored in sealed bags under the condition of vacuum mno2 sbc with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 and mno2 were prepared by co precipitation method 20 for mno2 sbc the synthesis steps can be described in fig 1 to begin with 1 0 g pvp was dissolved in 150 ml ultrapure water and heated to 80 c for 1 h secondly sbc was added into the mixture aqueous solution and mixed well by magnetic stirrer next the na2co3 solution was added as buffer to the mixed solution and then kmno4 solution and the mnso4 h2o solution are both added to the mixed solution simultaneously in drop wise manner thereafter stirred for 1 h consistently at 80 c and aged for 12 h at room temperature finally mno2 sbc was washed alternately with ultrapure water and 50 ethanol 3 times and dried in vacuum drying oven at 80 c for 12 h ground and sifted for further utilization for comparison mno2 was prepared following the steps like the mno2 sbc synthesis methods except for the second step without adding sbc among them the prepared mechanisms of mno2 were revealed as eqs 1 2 1 3mn 2 2mno 4 2h 2 o 5mno 2 4h 2 4h 2na 2 co 3 2h 2 co 3 4na 2 3 characterization of catalysts the specific surface area and pore size of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were analyzed by brunauer emmett teller and barret joyner halenda mircomertics asap2020 usa scanning electron microscope sem mira3 lmu tescan china energy dispersive spectrometer eds x max20 oxford instruments uk and x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro mpd nalytical netherlands were used to analyze the surface morphology elemental composition and crystalline phases respectively zeta potentiometer nano zs series model zen3600 malvern was used to determine the isoelectric point of the mno2 sbc in addition fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir nicolet nexus 470 thermo electron usa and x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa were applied to distinguish the changes of functional groups and the valence of the main elements electronic paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emxplus 10 12 germany measurements were also conducted to identify the active species 2 4 experimental procedure the degradation experiments were implemented to assess the catalytic performance of catalyst in a general way 30 mg catalyst was added into 100 ml mb solution 35 mg l in a 250 ml conical flask subsequently 0 5 ml pms 100 mmol l was added into the mixture and then rotated in a mechanical shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c simultaneously the experiments with only catalyst and pms were set for comparison afterward 0 5 ml solution was withdrawn at regular intervals and added with 0 5 ml ethanol filtrated through 0 22 um membrane filters and then measured immediately by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 at wavelength 664 nm in addition the effects of solution ph catalyst dose pms dose and mb initial concentration were investigated the leaching amount of manganese in the reaction solution was detected by icp ms 7700 the reusability of mno2 sbc was studied to evaluate the stability and practical application the ph was adjusted with 0 1 m h2so4 and naoh solution all experiments were in triplicate 3 results 3 1 optimization of catalysts the removal efficiency of mb by sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 abbreviated as 3 5 10 or 20 mno2 sbc in below in adsorption and catalysis system were displayed in fig 2 sbc and all mno2 sbcs had weak adsorption capacity for mb as shown in fig 2 a the removal efficiency of mb by sbc and all mno2 sbcs was below 20 and the concentration of mb was reduced in the first 30 min and increased after that the large error bar about the removal efficiency of mb by sbc or mno2 sbcs indicated that the adsorption of mb was not stable in the initial stage a small part of mb might loosely bound to sbc or mno2 sbcs in the first 30 min then came back into solution and gradually reach equilibrium under oscillating at about 60 min in addition the removal rate of mb was approximately 70 by mno2 it might be due to the mno2 with strong oxidation oxidized mb into other substances 21 22 besides the surface area of mno2 is larger than that of sbc and mno2 sbc which is more favorable for the adsorption of mb therefore the catalytic oxidation experiments were carried out by adding catalyst and oxidant simultaneously to explore the catalytic performance of the catalyst as shown in fig 2 b mb can be removed more than 85 within 60 min in the presence of both catalyst and pms among them mno2 and mno2 sbc with mass ratios is 5 10 and 20 present the better performance on mb removal which can be degraded completely within 30 min the results indicate that mno2 and mno2 sbc can be applied as good catalysts to activate pms in mb degradation in addition the mb degradation kinetics were greatly fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model the results also revealed that the mb removal rate constant in 5 mno2 sbc is highest at 0 27089 min 1 r2 0 997 some reasons may be attributed to the proper amount of mno2 loaded on the surface of sbc makes the composite material have a synergistic catalytic effect 23 24 however the excessive manganese oxide supported on the sludge biochar makes the mno2 thickness increase which can affect the electron transfer between mno2 and sbc to weaken the activation of pms 25 considering the catalysts may undergo ion leaching during the reaction 5 mno2 sbc is selected as the optimization catalyst for further research 3 2 characterization of catalysts the bet surface area and pore size distribution of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption as presented in table 1 mno2 has the highest surface area and pore volume of 150 2198 m2 g and 0 289539 cm3 g based on the iupac classification the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve of mno2 are type iv feature with h1 hysteresis pattern fig 3 b revealing it is spherical particle aggregates with the cylindrical holes with uniform diameter distribution 26 comparted sbc it has obviously appeared that the surface area and pore volume of sbc increased significantly after loaded mno2 and they improved from 36 3631 m2 g and 0 120236 cm3 g to 71 4716 m2 g and 0 202204 cm3 g respectively while the average pore diameter decreased from 12 6727 nm to 9 9425 nm this may be attributed to the growth of mno2 to form spherical particles on the surface of the sbc the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve of sbc and mno2 sbc is fitting to type iv feature with h3 hysteresis pattern fig 3 a c showing that they are pellet material with slit structure 26 the surface morphology of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were imaged by sem as shown in fig 4 a c sbc presents a flake and porous structure with a rough surface and mno2 shows spherical particle structure with uniform surface when mno2 was impregnated in sbc mno2 sbc shows spherical particles on its surface these are consistent with the analysis of n2 adsorption desorption isotherm in addition the elemental analysis of mno2 sbc characterized by eds revealed that there existed si c mn al fe o and so on in mno2 sbc as shown in fig 4 d the xrd patterns of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were interpreted in fig 5 mno2 has amorphous structure due to its weak characteristic peaks the diffraction peaks at 2θ 36 1 37 5 65 1 65 5 were put down to manganese dioxide jcpsd 44 0141 and hausmannite jcpsd 24 0734 27 for sbc the diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 4 and 59 7 were due to graphite 2h jcpsd 41 1487 28 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 20 6 26 5 49 5 59 3 and 80 6 were ascribed to silicon oxide jcpsd 74 1811 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 4 40 0 42 2 54 6 67 6 and 80 9 were put down to berlinite jcpsd 76 1442 and the diffraction peaks at 2θ 19 4 27 2 and 36 2 were due to iron carbonyl jcpsd 84 2232 jcpsd 84 2232 except for the diffraction peaks of sbc mno2 sbc presented the weak diffraction peaks of mno2 and new diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 3 34 2 which were ascribed to manganite jcpsd 74 1632 therefore the sem and xrd analysis confirmed that manganese oxides were successfully loaded on the sbc surface fig 6 displayed the ftir pattern of sbc mno2 the broad band at 3698 cm 1 3427 cm 1 involved in the oh stretching vibration of hydrogen bonded water molecules 29 the adsorption band at 1737 cm 1 1632 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 corresponded to co cc carboxyl oco tertiary coh and co siom m si fe or mn respectively 30 31 the peaks at 825 cm 1 774 cm 1 and 694 cm 1 are ascribed to aromatic ch in addition the adsorption band at 554 cm 1 and 476 cm 1 belong to mno and mno alo stretching vibration respectively 32 33 after the reaction the peaks all weakened to some extent and even migrated the peaks at 1737 cm 1 obviously shifted to 1768 cm 1 which may be attributed to the adsorption between the co bond and mb and its intermediate products during the reaction 34 in addition the peaks obviously shifted from 1400 cm 1 to 1390 cm 1 may be due to the oh cooh participating in activating pms and absorbing mb and intermediate products 35 38 moreover the new peaks appeared at 1064 cm 1 and the peaks at 554 476 cm 1 obviously shifted to 558 480 cm 1 which might involve si fe and mn are more or less involved in the degradation of mb 39 41 on the one hand sio2 may improve the acidic microenvironment in sbc mno2 surface which is benefitical to improve the catalytic performance in sbc mno2 pms 41 on the other hand there exists a chemical reduction cycle reaction between fe and mn which promotes the generation of free radicals and improves the degradation efficiency 39 40 fig 7 a showed the survey spectra of sbc mno2 before and after reaction the individual peaks related to c 284 8 ev o 531 1 ev n 400 0 ev fe 2p 3 2 711 0 ev fe 2p 1 2 724 7

71 ev and 286 91 ev were referred to cc co and co respectively 44 after the reaction cc and co increased from 48 and 12 to 55 and 16 respectively while co decreased from 39 to 28 this is probably because mb and its degradation intermediates are adsorbed and complexed on the surface of sbc mno2 fig 7 c illustrated that the o1s profile for sbc mno2 was fitted by 529 99 ev 530 58 ev 531 35 ev and 532 51 ev referred to mno al feo mnoh and sio respectively 45 46 after reaction al feo and mno increased from 28 and 7 to 33 and 13 while mn oh and sio declined from 49 and 13 to 41 and 12 respectively this indicates that al fe mn and si are involved in catalytic degradation of mb which is consistent with ftir characterization in addition there are also changes in the valence state of mn shown in fig 7 d the mn2p peaks at 641 12 ev 642 6 653 5 ev and 644 49 654 61 ev are corresponding to mn2 mn3 and mn4 respectively 21 47 for mn 2p the proportion of mn3 and mn4 decreased while the proportion of mn2 increased from 18 to 34 that indicates that mn4 and mn3 are reduced to mn2 during catalytic degradation reactions furthermore the n1s peak deconvolution at 399 0 ev 400 2 ev 402 2 ev and 406 2 ev are ascribed to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidized n respectively 48 the content of pyridinic n and oxidized n decreased from 33 21 and 9 25 to 26 68 and 3 89 respectively while the change of pyrrolic n on sbc mno2 after the reaction was obvious which increased from 46 59 to 55 37 a similar tendency of changing n species was also observed in the research of mian et al 49 n has a higher electronegativity than c χn 3 04 and χc 2 55 which may tailor the charge distribution of adjacent carbon 50 the consumption of pyridinic n and oxidized n suggested that they participate in the degradation of mb 3 3 effect of key parameters on the catalytic activity in order to explore the environmental applicability of mno2 sbc and the optimal conditions for mb degradation the effect of ph pms concentration catalyst dose and initial mb concentration on the catalytic activity of mno2 sbc have been investigated as presented in fig 8 it is shown in fig 8 a that the degradation efficiency of mb under different ph 3 11 has been inquired apparently mb was degraded completely under the ph of 5 7 and 9 which suggested that mno2 sbc can be applied efficiently in relatively wide range of ph however the degradation efficiency decreased to 86 4 and 82 6 under the ph of 3 and 11 respectively the main reason is ph exist a direct influence on the state of the catalyst and oxidant in aqueous solution on the one hand the ph value which is lower than the isoelectric point of the catalyst materials would make the surface of mno2 sbc protonated and the effective functional groups are surrounded by h it would hinder the mb transfer to the surface of the material and reduce the degradation efficiency on the other hand the pka value of pms is 9 4 which means the dominant species is hso5 at ph 9 4 and so5 2 at ph 9 4 51 therefore when the aqueous solution ph is higher than 9 4 hso5 will self decompose to so5 2 which leads to the reduction of free radicals and prevents the degradation of mb 52 in addition the results showed that mb had the fastest degradation rate under weakly acidic conditions it is mainly because the acidic conditions were more conducive to the migration of metal ions from mno2 sbc surface to the liquid phase thus providing more effective catalytic components to activate pms to generate more radicals 53 the influence of pms concentration 0 2 0 8 mmol l on mb degradation was presented in fig 8 b the degradation efficiency can reach almost 100 in 60 min at pms concentration from 0 4 to 0 8 mmol l in addition the degradation rate increased with the increase of pms concentration when the concentration of pms was lower than 0 5 mmol l while decreased slightly when the concentration of pms is greater than 0 5 mmol l when the concentration of pms is 0 5 mmol l the maximum value of k is 0 17089 min 1 with the pms concentration increase the reactions shown in eqs 3 4 tend to occur it can generate more radicals and increase the degradation rate of mb 37 54 however as the concentration of pms concentration further increases it may cause quenching reactions eqs 5 6 between the radicals and reduce mb degradation rate 52 55 3 m 2 hso 5 m 3 so 4 m metal ions 4 mn 4 hso 5 mn 3 so 4 5 so 4 hso 5 so 5 hso 4 6 2so 5 s 2 o 8 2 o 2 to explore the optimal dosage of catalyst the mb degradation by mno2 sbc was investigated under different mno2 sbc doses 0 1 g l 0 2 g l 0 3 g l 0 4 g l and 0 5 g l as presented in fig 8 c the degradation ratio of mb was 100 within 30 min when the catalyst dosage is greater than 0 3 g l furthermore the rate constant of mb degradation increased with the increase of mno2 sbc dosage because the more catalyst the more active sites can be provided 9 56 considering the leaching of metal ion and conservation of raw materials the addition of 0 3 g l is the optimal addition the influence of initial mb concentration 10 mg l 20 mg l 35 mg l 55 mg l and 65 mg l on mb degradation was investigated as presented in fig 8 d mb was degraded completely in 30 min under initial mb concentrations of 10 mg l 20 mg l and 35 mg l but the degradation efficiency decreased to 88 53 and 80 35 under the initial mb concentration of 55 mg l and 65 mg l respectively as discussed above the active sites provided by mno2 sbc and radicals generated by the reaction are limited by the amount of catalyst and oxidant therefore the reaction system cannot provide enough radicals to degrade mb if the content of mb is too large 3 4 mechanism of catalytic process to distinguish the reactive oxygen species that participated in mb degradation quenching experiments were performed using ethanol etoh tert butyl alcohol tba and l histidine l his as scavengers for both so4 and oh only oh and 1o2 57 as presented in fig 9a it was obvious that the degradation efficiency of mb reduced from 100 to 42 and 67 with 5 m etoh and 5 m tba respectively it indicated that both etoh and tba had inhibition effects on mb degradation and both so4 and oh were the main reactive oxygen species besides so4 prevailed in the mno2 sbc pms mb system however there had no apparent decrease with 0 5 m etoh and tba this may be due to the high speed and quantity of free radicals generated by the catalyst activation of pms so as the low concentration of quenching agent had no great impact on the reaction in particular the degradation rate of mb was weakened to 91 even with low addition of 0 5 mm l his while the degradation efficiency of mb was significantly reduced to 31 with the addition of 5 mm l his therefore 1o2 was considered to be the active substance in the degradation of mb by non radical pathway further the epr technique was carried out to further determine the dominant free radicals generated within the mno2 sbc pms system as shown in fig 9b a seven line spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was assigned to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpo x as reported the dmpo x signal might be ascribed that dmpo oh or dmpo so4 adducts were highly unstable and immediately oxidized by the oh and so4 generated from mno2 sbc activating pms process 58 in fig 9c the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 triplet signals was observed and enhanced at 10 min proving that mno2 sbc could promote the decomposition of pms to generate 1o2 59 to further identify 1o2 solvent media h2o was replaced with the d2o as the lifetime of 1o2 extends up to 10 times in the d2o media thus the 1o2 based oxidation should be theoretically enhanced in the d2o solution 60 as shown in fig s1 there were no impacts for mb degradation showed slightly improved in the mno2 sbc pms system with d2o media indicating that 1o2 existed but played a limiting role in accelerating mb degradation to distinguish the reactive oxygen species that participated in mb degradation quenching experiments were performed using ethanol etoh tert butyl alcohol tba and l histidine l his as scavengers for both so4 and oh only oh and 1o2 57 as presented in fig 9a it was obvious that the degradation efficiency of mb reduced from 100 to 42 and 67 with 5 m etoh and 5 m tba respectively it indicated that both etoh and tba had inhibition effects on mb degradation and both so4 and oh were the main reactive oxygen species besides so4 prevailed in the mno2 sbc pms mb system however there had no apparent decrease with 0 5 m etoh and tba this may be due to the high speed and quantity of free radicals generated by the catalyst activation of pms so the low concentration of the quenching agent had no great impact on the reaction in particular the degradation rate of mb was weakened to 91 even with low addition of 0 5 mm l his while the degradation efficiency of mb was significantly reduced to 31 with the addition of 5 mm l his therefore 1o2 was considered to be the active substance in the degradation of mb by non radical pathway further the epr technique was carried out to further determine the dominant free radicals generated within the mno2 sbc pms system as shown in fig 9b a seven line spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was assigned to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpo x as reported the dmpo x signal might be ascribed that dmpo oh or dmpo so4 adducts were highly unstable and immediately oxidized by the oh and so4 generated from mno2 sbc activating pms process 58 in fig 9c the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 triplet signals was observed and enhanced at 10 min proving that mno2 sbc could promote the decomposition of pms to generate 1o2 59 to further identify 1o2 solvent media h2o was replaced with the d2o as the lifetime of 1o2 extends up to 10 times in the d2o media thus the 1o2 based oxidation should be theoretically enhanced in the d2o solution 60 as shown in fig s1 there were no impacts for mb degradation showed slightly improved in the mno2 sbc pms system with d2o media indicating that 1o2 existed but played a limiting role in accelerating mb degradation fig 9 d depicted the uv vis absorbance spectra in the range of 350 700 nm of mb by mno2 sbc in the presence of pms absorbance peaks of mb by products shifted to 636 625 602 nm as the reaction time prolonged from beginning to 60 min on account of n demethylation occurred during reaction 61 based on previous literature the peaks at 636 625 and 602 nm were close to the characteristic absorbance peak of azure b c15h16cln3s azure a c14h14n3s and thionin c12h10n3s 62 63 respectively after 120 min a new peak emerged in the uv vis absorbance spectra of the reaction solution at 555 449 and 304 nm because so4 and oh attack the hydroxylation of aromatic rings and turn them into small molecules 61 the results revealed that mno2 sbc can be used as a good catalyst to activate pms and mb molecule can be destructed in mno2 sbc pms system by analyzing and summarizing of quenching experiment uv vis absorbance spectra and ftir xps spectrum of mno2 sbc before and after the reaction mb degradation mechanism in mno2 sbc pms system might involve two ways as shown in fig 10 during the process of the reaction a part of mb was first complexed and adsorbed on the surface of the material by functional groups such as cc co and cooh oh on the surface of mno2 sbc then the mb which adsorbed on mno2 sbc and dispersed in solution were oxidatively degraded by radical way and non radical way on one hand the mn al and fe distributed on mno2 sbc surface might release into the liquid phase and participate in the activation of pms to generate free radicals for the oxidation of mb and its intermediates on the other hand surface functional groups of mno2 sbc dedicated to activating pms to generate 1o2 which also contributed to the degradation of mb and its intermediates by non radical way what s more the decrease of n species of pyridinic n and oxidized n were also indicated that mb might be degraded via another non radical way by electron transfer pyridinic n was reported that it could tailor electrons from adjacent carbon and produce c for adsorbing oo bond of pms 49 then the oo bond of pms was broken by the inner sphere or the electron from mb thus mb was oxidized to smaller molecules 3 5 reusability of catalyst regeneration ability is an important indicator to identify whether the material could be fully utilized and environment friendly therefore five recycling experiments were carried out to investigate the stability of mno2 sbc as presented in fig 11 mb is almost completely degraded at 180 min this manifests that the mno2 sbc has preferable stability and activity to apply in environmental remediation however it is obviously shown that the degradation rate of mb decreased significantly at the first and second recycle the rate constant of the first cycle 0 17796 min 1 was nearly six times that of the second recycling 0 03701 min 1 subsequently the degradation rate in the third fourth and fifth cycles decreased slightly which were 0 02836 min 1 0 02311 min 1 and 0 02084 min 1 respectively the consequence indicates that the catalytic activity of mno2 sbc is lost with recycle time increase which is mainly related to the physicochemical properties of the surface of mno2 sbc to begin with manganese ions as the mainly catalytic substance will leach to the aqueous solution during reaction resulting in a reduction in the manganese content of mno2 sbc the leaching amount of mn after reaction 180 min from first to five cycles was 0 51 mg l 1 29 mg l 0 49 mg l 0 39 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively these leaching amounts are lower than femn binary oxides loaded on biochar 2 03 mg l 64 secondly the content of effective functional groups such as hydroxyl on the surface of mno2 sbc decreased according to the analysis of ftir in addition some mb and its by products may be adsorbed on the surface or pore of mno2 sbc to prevent the active site from functioning 4 conclusion in this study we explored the catalysis performance of sbc and mno2 sbcs for mb degradation characterization of sem eds and xrd indicated that mno2 was successfully loaded on the surface of sbc and the specific surface area and pore volume of mno2 sbc increased significantly compared to sbc mno2 sbc showed higher catalytic performance for pms than sbc in the mno2 sbc pms catalytic system the degradation kinetics of mb is in line with the pseudo first order kinetic model mb was completely degraded within 30 min in mno2 sbc pms system at ph 5 9 mno2 sbc has excellent catalysis performance and stability because it still could active pms for complete degradation of mb in 180 min after five usages the radical quenching experiment manifested that both so4 oh and 1o2 are the main reactive oxygen species for mb degradation in the mno2 sbc pms system the functional groups of mno2 sbc such as oh cooh co cc and co acted as adsorptive sites for mb adsorption or acted as active sites to active pms to produce 1o2 for mb degradation by non radical way further the pyridinic n and oxides n on mno2 sbc also contributed mb degradation via electron transfer free radicals were generated in the pms activation by mn al and fe released from mno2 sbc contributing to the degradation of mb and its intermediates overall mno2 sbc as a catalyst exhibits a great potential for pms activation for the degradation of organics the following is the

12921,in this study sludge biochar sbc was prepared by pyrolysis method mno2 and mno2 sbcs with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 were synthesized by co precipitation method the catalytic performance was examined by activating peroxymonosulfate pms for methylene blue mb degradation mb can be completely removed within 30 min when the mass ratio of mno2 sbc is greater than 5 and the degradation kinetics of mb is more in line with the pseudo first order kinetic model in the mno2 sbc pms system besides the pseudo first order kinetic constants k in mno2 sbc pms are significantly higher than that in sbc pms and mno2 pms and the largest degradation rate of mb is in 5 mno2 sbc pms system mno2 sbc exhibited excellent pms activation ability in a wide range of ph 5 9 with complete degradation of mb in 30 min furthermore mno2 sbc has good stability after five usages still activating pms for complete degradation of mb in 180 min the quenching experiments and epr spectrum indicated that both so4 oh and 1o2 were the main reactive oxygen species finally the probable mb degradation pathway was proposed in the mno2 pms system this study provides a reliable insight into sludge resource utilization sludge biochar modification and its catalytic performance improvement graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge biochar manganese dioxide aops peroxymonosulfate methylene blue 1 introduction with the acceleration of urbanization and the continuous increase of the population the demand and consumption of water resources are increasing 1 3 therefore it directly leads to the increase in municipal sludge production it is reported that sludge production with 80 moisture content in china has risen from 3 4 107 tons in 2015 to 5 107 tons in 2017 and nearly 80 of the remaining sludges have not been properly disposed 4 municipal sludge contains harmful substances such as refractory organic pollutants heavy metals and viral microorganisms but it also contains a large amount of organic matter therefore it is very necessary to handle the sludge accordingly to realize the reutilization harmless and reducing treatment 5 at present the sludge treatment methods mainly include sludge aerobic composting mixing with other materials to prepare building materials preparing sludge biochar etc 6 7 among them the sludge biochar has the characteristics of a loose surface and relatively large specific surface area so it can provide more active sites to perform the pollutants removal 8 at present there are many reports about the successful application of sludge biochar in environmental remediation 9 11 sludge biochar has been widely used as adsorbent and catalyst in various types of sewage treatment but it is still necessary to further improve its efficiency in removing target pollutants 12 14 now chemical modification is the most common method for sludge biochar mainly including acid base modification redox and loading metals 15 in recent years modification by iron manganese nickel copper and other transition metal to improve catalysis has been increasing in advanced oxidation processes aops 16 18 among them the manganese catalyst has the advantages of low toxicity great natural content and friendly environment 19 in this study sludge biochar sbc was prepared by pyrolysis from dehydrated sludge in sewage treatment plant and a serious mno2 sbc with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 were prepared by co precipitation method the physicochemical properties of catalysts were characterized and the catalytic performance of catalyst was examined by activating peroxymonosulfate pms for mb degradation in addition the main influencing factors including ph mb concentration pms concentration and catalysis dose were also investigated in mno2 sbc pms mb degradation system the reusability and stability of mno2 sbc were explored finally the synergistic catalytic mechanism of mno2 sbc and the possible removal route of mb were also proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 materials all reagents used were analytical grade and the experimental aqueous solution prepared by ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 25 mω potassium permanganate kmno4 manganese sulfate monohydrate mnso4 h2o polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 pvp c6h9no n and methylene blue mb were purchased from sinopharma chemical reagent co ltd china

treatment plant in changsha hunan province china based on previous research sludge biochar sbc was prepared by pyrolysis method 8 firstly the collected sludge was first dried naturally for two days and then dried in air dry oven at 105 c for 12 h secondly the dried sludge was pulverized and passed through a 0 25 mm sieve thirdly the sludge powders were placed in quartz boat and then transferred it in vacuum anneal furnace for thermal treatment at 550 c for 2 h 5 c min under nitrogen n2 atmosphere lastly sbc was sifted through a 0 25 mm sieve and stored in sealed bags under the condition of vacuum mno2 sbc with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 and mno2 were prepared by co precipitation method 20 for mno2 sbc the synthesis steps can be described in fig 1 to begin with 1 0 g pvp was dissolved in 150 ml ultrapure water and heated to 80 c for 1 h secondly sbc was added into the mixture aqueous solution and mixed well by magnetic stirrer next the na2co3 solution was added as buffer to the mixed solution and then kmno4 solution and the mnso4 h2o solution are both added to the mixed solution simultaneously in drop wise manner thereafter stirred for 1 h consistently at 80 c and aged for 12 h at room temperature finally mno2 sbc was washed alternately with ultrapure water and 50 ethanol 3 times and dried in vacuum drying oven at 80 c for 12 h ground and sifted for further utilization for comparison mno2 was prepared following the steps like the mno2 sbc synthesis methods except for the second step without adding sbc among them the prepared mechanisms of mno2 were

x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro mpd nalytical netherlands were used to analyze the surface morphology elemental composition and crystalline phases respectively zeta potentiometer nano zs series model zen3600 malvern was used to determine the isoelectric point of the mno2 sbc in addition fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir nicolet nexus 470 thermo electron usa and x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa were applied to distinguish the changes of functional groups and the valence of the main elements electronic paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emxplus 10 12 germany measurements were also conducted to identify the active species 2 4 experimental procedure the degradation experiments were implemented to assess the catalytic performance of catalyst in a general way 30 mg catalyst was added into 100 ml mb solution 35 mg l in a 250 ml conical flask subsequently 0 5 ml pms 100 mmol l was added into the mixture and then rotated in a mechanical shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c simultaneously the experiments with only catalyst and pms were set for comparison afterward 0 5 ml solution was withdrawn at regular intervals and added with 0 5 ml ethanol filtrated through 0 22 um membrane filters and then measured immediately by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 at wavelength 664 nm in addition the effects of solution ph catalyst dose pms dose and mb initial concentration were investigated the leaching amount of manganese in the reaction solution was detected by icp ms 7700 the reusability of mno2 sbc was studied to evaluate the stability and practical application the ph was adjusted with 0 1 m h2so4 and naoh solution all experiments were in triplicate 3 results 3 1 optimization of catalysts the removal efficiency of mb by sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc with different mno2 sbc mass ratios 3 5 10 and 20 abbreviated as 3 5 10 or 20 mno2 sbc in below in adsorption and catalysis system were displayed in fig 2 sbc and all mno2 sbcs had weak adsorption capacity for mb as shown in fig 2 a the removal efficiency of mb by sbc and all mno2 sbcs was below 20 and the concentration of mb was reduced in the first 30 min and increased after that the large error bar about the removal efficiency of mb by sbc or mno2 sbcs indicated that the adsorption of mb was not stable in the initial stage a small part of mb might loosely bound to sbc or mno2 sbcs in the first 30 min then came back into solution and gradually reach equilibrium under oscillating at about 60 min in addition the removal rate of mb was approximately 70 by mno2 it might be due to the mno2 with strong oxidation oxidized mb into other substances 21 22 besides the surface area of mno2 is larger than that of sbc and mno2 sbc which is more favorable for the adsorption of mb therefore the catalytic oxidation experiments were carried out by adding catalyst and oxidant simultaneously to explore the catalytic performance of the catalyst as shown in fig 2 b mb can be removed more than 85 within 60 min in the presence of both catalyst and pms among them mno2 and mno2 sbc with mass ratios is 5 10 and 20 present the better performance on mb removal which can be degraded completely within 30 min the results indicate that mno2 and mno2 sbc can be applied as good catalysts to activate pms in mb degradation in addition the mb degradation kinetics were greatly fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model the results also revealed that the mb removal rate constant in 5 mno2 sbc is highest at 0 27089 min 1 r2 0 997 some reasons may be attributed to the proper amount of mno2 loaded on the surface of sbc makes the composite material have a synergistic catalytic effect 23 24 however the excessive manganese oxide supported on the sludge biochar makes the mno2 thickness increase which can affect the electron transfer between mno2 and sbc to weaken the activation of pms 25 considering the catalysts may undergo ion leaching during the reaction 5 mno2 sbc is selected as the optimization catalyst for further research 3 2 characterization of catalysts the bet surface area and pore size distribution of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption as presented in table 1 mno2 has the highest surface area and pore volume of 150 2198 m2 g and 0 289539 cm3 g based on the iupac classification the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve of mno2 are type iv feature with h1 hysteresis pattern fig 3 b revealing it is spherical particle aggregates with the cylindrical holes with uniform diameter distribution 26 comparted sbc it has obviously appeared that the surface area and pore volume of sbc increased significantly after loaded mno2 and they improved from 36 3631 m2 g and 0 120236 cm3 g to 71 4716 m2 g and 0 202204 cm3 g respectively while the average pore diameter decreased from 12 6727 nm to 9 9425 nm this may be attributed to the growth of mno2 to form spherical particles on the surface of the sbc the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve of sbc and mno2 sbc is fitting to type iv feature with h3 hysteresis pattern fig 3 a c showing that they are pellet material with slit structure 26 the surface morphology of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were imaged by sem as shown in fig 4 a c sbc presents a flake and porous structure with a rough surface and mno2 shows spherical particle structure with uniform surface when mno2 was impregnated in sbc mno2 sbc shows spherical particles on its surface these are consistent with the analysis of n2 adsorption desorption isotherm in addition the elemental analysis of mno2 sbc characterized by eds revealed that there existed si c mn al fe o and so on in mno2 sbc as shown in fig 4 d the xrd patterns of sbc mno2 and mno2 sbc were interpreted in fig 5 mno2 has amorphous structure due to its weak characteristic peaks the diffraction peaks at 2θ 36 1 37 5 65 1 65 5 were put down to manganese dioxide jcpsd 44 0141 and hausmannite jcpsd 24 0734 27 for sbc the diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 4 and 59 7 were due to graphite 2h jcpsd 41 1487 28 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 20 6 26 5 49 5 59 3 and 80 6 were ascribed to silicon oxide jcpsd 74 1811 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 4 40 0 42 2 54 6 67 6 and 80 9 were put down to berlinite jcpsd 76 1442 and the diffraction peaks at 2θ 19 4 27 2 and 36 2 were due to iron carbonyl jcpsd 84 2232 jcpsd 84 2232 except for the diffraction peaks of sbc mno2 sbc presented the weak diffraction peaks of mno2 and new diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 3 34 2 which were ascribed to manganite jcpsd 74 1632 therefore the sem and xrd analysis confirmed that manganese oxides were successfully loaded on the sbc surface fig 6 displayed the ftir pattern of sbc mno2 the broad band at 3698 cm 1 3427 cm 1 involved in the oh stretching vibration of hydrogen bonded water molecules 29 the adsorption band at 1737 cm 1 1632 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 corresponded to co cc carboxyl oco tertiary coh and co siom m si fe or mn respectively 30 31 the peaks at 825 cm 1 774 cm 1 and 694 cm 1 are ascribed to aromatic ch in addition the adsorption band at 554 cm 1 and 476 cm 1 belong to mno and mno alo stretching vibration respectively 32 33 after the reaction the peaks all weakened to some extent and even migrated the peaks at 1737 cm 1 obviously shifted to 1768 cm 1 which may be attributed to the adsorption between the co bond and mb and its intermediate products during the reaction 34 in addition the peaks obviously shifted from 1400 cm 1 to 1390 cm 1 may be due to the oh cooh participating in activating pms and absorbing mb and intermediate products 35 38 moreover the new peaks appeared at 1064 cm 1 and the peaks at 554 476 cm 1 obviously shifted to 558 480 cm 1 which might involve si fe and mn are more or less involved in the degradation of mb 39 41 on the one hand sio2 may improve the acidic microenvironment in sbc mno2 surface which is benefitical to improve the catalytic performance in sbc mno2 pms 41 on the other hand there exists a chemical reduction cycle reaction between fe and mn which promotes the generation of free radicals and improves the degradation efficiency 39 40 fig 7 a showed the survey spectra of sbc mno2 before and after reaction the individual peaks related to c 284 8 ev o 531 1 ev n 400 0 ev fe 2p 3 2 711 0 ev fe 2p 1 2 724 7

71 ev and 286 91 ev were referred to cc co and co respectively 44 after the reaction cc and co increased from 48 and 12 to 55 and 16 respectively while co decreased from 39 to 28 this is probably because mb and its degradation intermediates are adsorbed and complexed on the surface of sbc mno2 fig 7 c illustrated that the o1s profile for sbc mno2 was fitted by 529 99 ev 530 58 ev 531 35 ev and 532 51 ev referred to mno al feo mnoh and sio respectively 45 46 after reaction al feo and mno increased from 28 and 7 to 33 and 13 while mn oh and sio declined from 49 and 13 to 41 and 12 respectively this indicates that al fe mn and si are involved in catalytic degradation of mb which is consistent with ftir characterization in addition there are also changes in the valence state of mn shown in fig 7 d the mn2p peaks at 641 12 ev 642 6 653 5 ev and 644 49 654 61 ev are corresponding to mn2 mn3 and mn4 respectively 21 47 for mn 2p the proportion of mn3 and mn4 decreased while the proportion of mn2 increased from 18 to 34 that indicates that mn4 and mn3 are reduced to mn2 during catalytic degradation reactions furthermore the n1s peak deconvolution at 399 0 ev 400 2 ev 402 2 ev and 406 2 ev are ascribed to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidized n respectively 48 the content of pyridinic n and oxidized n decreased from 33 21 and 9 25 to 26 68 and 3 89 respectively while the change of pyrrolic n on sbc mno2 after the reaction was obvious which increased from 46 59 to 55 37 a similar tendency of changing n species was also observed in the research of mian et al 49 n has a higher electronegativity than c χn 3 04 and χc 2 55 which may tailor the charge distribution of adjacent carbon 50 the consumption of pyridinic n and oxidized n suggested that they participate in the degradation of mb 3 3 effect of key parameters on the catalytic activity in order to explore the environmental applicability of mno2 sbc and the optimal conditions for mb degradation the effect of ph pms concentration catalyst dose and initial mb concentration on the catalytic activity of mno2 sbc have been investigated as presented in fig 8 it is shown in fig 8 a that the degradation efficiency of mb under different ph 3 11 has been inquired apparently mb was degraded completely under the ph of 5 7 and 9 which suggested that mno2 sbc can be applied efficiently in relatively wide range of ph however the degradation efficiency decreased to 86 4 and 82 6 under the ph of 3 and 11 respectively the main reason is ph exist a direct influence on the state of the catalyst and oxidant in aqueous solution on the one hand the ph value which is lower than the isoelectric point of the catalyst materials would make the surface of mno2 sbc protonated and the effective functional groups are surrounded by h it would hinder the mb transfer to the surface of the material and reduce the degradation efficiency on the other hand the pka value of pms is 9 4 which means the dominant species is hso5 at ph 9 4 and so5 2 at ph 9 4 51 therefore when the aqueous solution ph is higher than 9 4 hso5 will self decompose to so5 2 which leads to the reduction of free radicals and prevents the degradation of mb 52 in addition the results showed that mb had the fastest degradation rate under weakly acidic conditions it is mainly because the acidic conditions were more conducive to the migration of metal ions from mno2 sbc surface to the liquid phase thus providing more effective catalytic components to activate pms to generate more radicals 53 the influence of pms concentration 0 2 0 8 mmol l on mb degradation was presented in fig 8 b the degradation efficiency can reach almost 100 in 60 min at pms concentration from 0 4 to 0 8 mmol l in addition the degradation rate increased with the increase of pms concentration when the concentration of pms was lower than 0 5 mmol l while decreased slightly when the concentration of pms is greater than 0 5 mmol l when the concentration of pms is 0 5 mmol l the maximum value of k is 0 17089 min 1 with the pms concentration increase the reactions shown in eqs 3 4 tend to occur it can generate more radicals and increase the degradation rate of mb 37 54 however as the concentration of pms concentration further increases it may cause quenching reactions eqs 5 6 between the radicals and reduce mb degradation rate 52 55 3 m 2 hso 5 m 3 so 4 m metal ions 4 mn 4 hso 5 mn 3 so 4 5 so 4 hso 5 so 5 hso 4 6 2so 5 s 2 o 8 2 o 2 to explore the optimal dosage of catalyst the mb degradation by mno2 sbc was investigated under different mno2 sbc doses 0 1 g l 0 2 g l 0 3 g l 0 4 g l and 0 5 g l as presented in fig 8 c the degradation ratio of mb was 100 within 30 min when the catalyst dosage is greater than 0 3 g l furthermore the rate constant of mb degradation increased with the increase of mno2 sbc dosage because the more catalyst the more active sites can be provided 9 56 considering the leaching of metal ion and conservation of raw materials the addition of 0 3 g l is the optimal addition the influence of initial mb concentration 10 mg l 20 mg l 35 mg l 55 mg l and 65 mg l on mb degradation was investigated as presented in fig 8 d mb was degraded completely in 30 min under initial mb concentrations of 10 mg l 20 mg l and 35 mg l but the degradation efficiency decreased to 88 53 and 80 35 under the initial mb concentration of 55 mg l and 65 mg l respectively as discussed above the active sites provided by mno2 sbc and radicals generated by the reaction are limited by the amount of catalyst and oxidant therefore the reaction system cannot provide enough radicals to degrade mb if the content of mb is too large 3 4 mechanism of catalytic process to distinguish the reactive oxygen species that participated in mb degradation quenching experiments were performed using ethanol etoh tert butyl alcohol tba and l histidine l his as scavengers for both so4 and oh only oh and 1o2 57 as presented in fig 9a it was obvious that the degradation efficiency of mb reduced from 100 to 42 and 67 with 5 m etoh and 5 m tba respectively it indicated that both etoh and tba had inhibition effects on mb degradation and both so4 and oh were the main reactive oxygen species besides so4 prevailed in the mno2 sbc pms mb system however there had no apparent decrease with 0 5 m etoh and tba this may be due to the high speed and quantity of free radicals generated by the catalyst activation of pms so as the low concentration of quenching agent had no great impact on the reaction in particular the degradation rate of mb was weakened to 91 even with low addition of 0 5 mm l his while the degradation efficiency of mb was significantly reduced to 31 with the addition of 5 mm l his therefore 1o2 was considered to be the active substance in the degradation of mb by non radical pathway further the epr technique was carried out to further determine the dominant free radicals generated within the mno2 sbc pms system as shown in fig 9b a seven line spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was assigned to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpo x as reported the dmpo x signal might be ascribed that dmpo oh or dmpo so4 adducts were highly unstable and immediately oxidized by the oh and so4 generated from mno2 sbc activating pms process 58 in fig 9c the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 triplet signals was observed and enhanced at 10 min proving that mno2 sbc could promote the decomposition of pms to generate 1o2 59 to further identify 1o2 solvent media h2o was replaced with the d2o as the lifetime of 1o2 extends up to 10 times in the d2o media thus the 1o2 based oxidation should be theoretically enhanced in the d2o solution 60 as shown in fig s1 there were no impacts for mb degradation showed slightly improved in the mno2 sbc pms system with d2o media indicating that 1o2 existed but played a limiting role in accelerating mb degradation to distinguish the reactive oxygen species that participated in mb degradation quenching experiments were performed using ethanol etoh tert butyl alcohol tba and l histidine l his as scavengers for both so4 and oh only oh and 1o2 57 as presented in fig 9a it was obvious that the degradation efficiency of mb reduced from 100 to 42 and 67 with 5 m etoh and 5 m tba respectively it indicated that both etoh and tba had inhibition effects on mb degradation and both so4 and oh were the main reactive oxygen species besides so4 prevailed in the mno2 sbc pms mb system however there had no apparent decrease with 0 5 m etoh and tba this may be due to the high speed and quantity of free radicals generated by the catalyst activation of pms so the low concentration of the quenching agent had no great impact on the reaction in particular the degradation rate of mb was weakened to 91 even with low addition of 0 5 mm l his while the degradation efficiency of mb was significantly reduced to 31 with the addition of 5 mm l his therefore 1o2 was considered to be the active substance in the degradation of mb by non radical pathway further the epr technique was carried out to further determine the dominant free radicals generated within the mno2 sbc pms system as shown in fig 9b a seven line spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was assigned to 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpo x as reported the dmpo x signal might be ascribed that dmpo oh or dmpo so4 adducts were highly unstable and immediately oxidized by the oh and so4 generated from mno2 sbc activating pms process 58 in fig 9c the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 triplet signals was observed and enhanced at 10 min proving that mno2 sbc could promote the decomposition of pms to generate 1o2 59 to further identify 1o2 solvent media h2o was replaced with the d2o as the lifetime of 1o2 extends up to 10 times in the d2o media thus the 1o2 based oxidation should be theoretically enhanced in the d2o solution 60 as shown in fig s1 there were no impacts for mb degradation showed slightly improved in the mno2 sbc pms system with d2o media indicating that 1o2 existed but played a limiting role in accelerating mb degradation fig 9 d depicted the uv vis absorbance spectra in the range of 350 700 nm of mb by mno2 sbc in the presence of pms absorbance peaks of mb by products shifted to 636 625 602 nm as the reaction time prolonged from beginning to 60 min on account of n demethylation occurred during reaction 61 based on previous literature the peaks at 636 625 and 602 nm were close to the characteristic absorbance peak of azure b c15h16cln3s azure a c14h14n3s and thionin c12h10n3s 62 63 respectively after 120 min a new peak emerged in the uv vis absorbance spectra of the reaction solution at 555 449 and 304 nm because so4 and oh attack the hydroxylation of aromatic rings and turn them into small molecules 61 the results revealed that mno2 sbc can be used as a good catalyst to activate pms and mb molecule can be destructed in mno2 sbc pms system by analyzing and summarizing of quenching experiment uv vis absorbance spectra and ftir xps spectrum of mno2 sbc before and after the reaction mb degradation mechanism in mno2 sbc pms system might involve two ways as shown in fig 10 during the process of the reaction a part of mb was first complexed and adsorbed on the surface of the material by functional groups such as cc co and cooh oh on the surface of mno2 sbc then the mb which adsorbed on mno2 sbc and dispersed in solution were oxidatively degraded by radical way and non radical way on one hand the mn al and fe distributed on mno2 sbc surface might release into the liquid phase and participate in the activation of pms to generate free radicals for the oxidation of mb and its intermediates on the other hand surface functional groups of mno2 sbc dedicated to activating pms to generate 1o2 which also contributed to the degradation of mb and its intermediates by non radical way what s more the decrease of n species of pyridinic n and oxidized n were also indicated that mb might be degraded via another non radical way by electron transfer pyridinic n was reported that it could tailor electrons from adjacent carbon and produce c for adsorbing oo bond of pms 49 then the oo bond of pms was broken by the inner sphere or the electron from mb thus mb was oxidized to smaller molecules 3 5 reusability of catalyst regeneration ability is an important indicator to identify whether the material could be fully utilized and environment friendly therefore five recycling experiments were carried out to investigate the stability of mno2 sbc as presented in fig 11 mb is almost completely degraded at 180 min this manifests that the mno2 sbc has preferable stability and activity to apply in environmental remediation however it is obviously shown that the degradation rate of mb decreased significantly at the first and second recycle the rate constant of the first cycle 0 17796 min 1 was nearly six times that of the second recycling 0 03701 min 1 subsequently the degradation rate in the third fourth and fifth cycles decreased slightly which were 0 02836 min 1 0 02311 min 1 and 0 02084 min 1 respectively the consequence indicates that the catalytic activity of mno2 sbc is lost with recycle time increase which is mainly related to the physicochemical properties of the surface of mno2 sbc to begin with manganese ions as the mainly catalytic substance will leach to the aqueous solution during reaction resulting in a reduction in the manganese content of mno2 sbc the leaching amount of mn after reaction 180 min from first to five cycles was 0 51 mg l 1 29 mg l 0 49 mg l 0 39 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively these leaching amounts are lower than femn binary oxides loaded on biochar 2 03 mg l 64 secondly the content of effective functional groups such as hydroxyl on the surface of mno2 sbc decreased according to the analysis of ftir in addition some mb and its by products may be adsorbed on the surface or pore of mno2 sbc to prevent the active site from functioning 4 conclusion in this study we explored the catalysis performance of sbc and mno2 sbcs for mb degradation characterization of sem eds and xrd indicated that mno2 was successfully loaded on the surface of sbc and the specific surface area and pore volume of mno2 sbc increased significantly compared to sbc mno2 sbc showed higher catalytic performance for pms than sbc in the mno2 sbc pms catalytic system the degradation kinetics of mb is in line with the pseudo first order kinetic model mb was completely degraded within 30 min in mno2 sbc pms system at ph 5 9 mno2 sbc has excellent catalysis performance and stability because it still could active pms for complete degradation of mb in 180 min after five usages the radical quenching experiment manifested that both so4 oh and 1o2 are the main reactive oxygen species for mb degradation in the mno2 sbc pms system the functional groups of mno2 sbc such as oh cooh co cc and co acted as adsorptive sites for mb adsorption or acted as active sites to active pms to produce 1o2 for mb degradation by non radical way further the pyridinic n and oxides n on mno2 sbc also contributed mb degradation via electron transfer free radicals were generated in the pms activation by mn al and fe released from mno2 sbc contributing to the degradation of mb and its intermediates overall mno2 sbc as a catalyst exhibits a great potential for pms activation for the degradation of organics the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 the effect of solvent exchange on mb degradation reaction conditions mno2 sbc 0 3 g l t 25 c initial mb concentration 40 mg l ph 7 5 pms dosage 0 5

12922,the purpose of this study was to effectively purify uranium u vi contaminated soil washing effluent using a precipitation flocculation process reuse the purified water and dispose of the solid waste the u vi ions in the effluent were easily removed as sediments by neutralization and the metal sediments and suspended soils were flocculated precipitated by polyacrylamide pam the precipitate generated through the precipitation flocculation process was completely separated into solid liquid phases by membrane filtration pore size 45 μm and ca2 and mg2 ions remaining in the effluent were removed by distillation even if neutralized or distilled effluent was reused for soil washing soil decontamination performance was maintained pam an organic component of the filter cake was successfully removed by thermal decomposition without loss of metal deposits including u vi therefore the treatment method of u vi contaminated soil washing effluent using the precipitation flocculation process presented in this study can be used to effectively treat the washing waste of u vi contaminated soil and dispose of the generated solids keywords uranium soil washing precipitation flocculation radioactive waste disposal 1 introduction with the increasing application of nuclear energy a large amount of waste containing u is generated from activities such as fuel fabrication fuel reprocessing and research and development 1 6 u is generally present in the form of soluble uo2 2 ions and has dramatic mobility and high chemotoxicity 7 8 in particular u vi ions in soil can be solvated ion exchanged in certain reactions complexed with soil organic matter or precipitated as pure or mixed solids 9 therefore the u in the soil migrates to water air and the food supply through these various physicochemical reaction pathways where it adversely affects the environment and human health 10 11 various methods have been developed for decontamination of u contaminated soil such as soil washing electrokinetic extraction vitrification and phytoremediation 12 14 among these soil decontamination methods soil washing has several advantages first the process is conducted in a closed system in which the surrounding environmental conditions can be controlled second the process can substantially reduce the volume of contaminants in addition the cost of soil washing is relatively low compared with that of other soil decontamination methods 15 16 although u vi ions are efficiently and economically decontaminated from soil by soil washing the effluent generated during soil washing contains not only u vi ion but also various metal ions it therefore becomes a new wastewater that must be treated conventional methods for treating soil washing effluent include chemical precipitation adsorption ion exchange evaporation electrochemical treatment and photocatalytic degradation 17 23 among these methods the chemical precipitation method is more practical as a soil washing effluent treatment because it uses inexpensive commercial chemicals and the process configuration is relatively simple 24 the removal of u vi ions by chemical precipitation involves the formation of u vi ions as insoluble uranium hydroxide precipitates by the addition of chemical ph adjusters such as naoh ca oh 2 and cao 25 26 however because u vi sedimentation particles formed by chemical precipitation remain mixed with suspended soil particles of soil washing effluent these particles must be completely separated for the effluent to be reused or discharge to the environment 27 for solid liquid separation methods such as membrane filtration filter pressing and centrifugation can be used because very small particles cause clogging of the filter or are difficult to settle increasing the particle size of fine particles is necessary to prevent clogging of the filter and improve the separation efficiency 28 in the present study precipitation flocculation processes were investigated for the removal of u vi ions and suspended soil from u vi contaminated soil washing effluent the effluent was prepared by washing u contaminated soil with sulfuric acid to remove u vi ions from the aqueous phase a precipitation method was applied by neutralizing the soil washing effluent the neutralized sediment and suspended soil were easily separated from the resultant solid liquid mixture via flocculation induced by an organic flocculant in addition distillation and thermal treatment methods were applied for water reuse and solid waste disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the u contaminated soil used in the present study was prepared by a dry sieving method using a sieve shaker as200 retsch germany after fractionation at the waste storage facility of the korea atomic energy research institute after the soil was dry sieved the 0 2 0 5 mm size fraction was used in soil washing experiments sulfuric acid h2so4 98 and sodium hydroxide naoh 98 were purchased from duksan chemicals south korea flocculant ha 510 polyacrylamide was obtained from hansol chemical south korea deionized di water was obtained from a water purification system aqua max basic 360 younglin south korea 2 2 preparation of u vi contaminated soil washing effluent the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent used in the experiments was prepared referring to the decontamination conditions reported in our previous study 29 the procedure is outlined as follows first u contaminated soil and 0 5 m h2so4 solution were mixed in a 50 ml conical tube polystyrene spl south korea the tube containing the mixture was shaken for 1 h at 25 c at 200 rpm using a hybridization incubator combi d24 finepcr south korea the soil washing effluent delivered to the waste treatment process might have contained suspended soil particles the mixture was therefore sieved using a 106 μm sieve to collect soil washing effluent containing fine soil particles to create conditions similar to those of the waste solution generated in the actual soil decontamination process the u vi and fe ion concentrations of the filtrate supernatant were analyzed after the soil washing effluent was sieved through a 106 μm sieve and allowed to stand for 5 min 2 3 treatment of the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent fig 1 shows the treatment process of the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent generated during the washing process of u contaminated soil the main mechanisms are described as follows first u vi ions and the suspended soil of the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent are precipitated into a solid phase via a precipitation flocculation process using naoh powder and an organic flocculant second the precipitate containing u vi and fine soil is separated from the effluent by membrane filtration and formed into a filter cake if the organic matter content of this filter cake does not meet the waste acceptance criteria of the final disposal facility 30 the organic flocculant in the filter cake is removed by thermal decomposition meanwhile the filtrate generated through the filtration is directly recycled to the soil washing process or distilled water is circulated after distillation if the ionic strength affects the soil decontamination efficiency in this process only the precipitate generated in the precipitation flocculation process becomes radioactive waste 2 3 1 precipitation flocculation process u ions were precipitated by neutralizing the filtrate of the soil washing effluent containing fine soil particles using naoh powder and the ph was measured using a ph meter orionstar t910 thermo scientific usa to confirm the precipitation characteristics of u vi according to the ph conditions the residual rate of u vi and other dominant cations was investigated at 3 ph 9 the ion concentration was analyzed after particulate matter was completed removed using a 0 2 μm nylon syringe filter whatman uk after the neutralization treatment the precipitate and suspended soil which are particulate matter present in the neutralized soil washing effluent were aggregated using a flocculant changes in the turbidity and in the u vi and fe concentrations were checked while 0 1 ml of flocculant was injected into 100 ml of neutralized soil washing effluent containing suspended soil 2 3 2 filtration of flocculated suspension to investigate the separation characteristics of particles after the neutralization flocculation treatment turbid untreated effluent and neutralized effluent containing soil with particles larger than 150 μm were each subjected to the flocculation treatment thereafter turbidity changes were confirmed by filtration using membrane filters with various pore sizes of 45 20 6 and 2 5 μm after filtration the solid liquid separation performance was evaluated on the basis of the turbidity value under untreated effluent and neutralized effluent conditions 2 3 3 distillation after filtration the filtrate obtained through filtration was distilled at 200 c using a heating mantle ms dmsb misung scientific south korea the distillation performance was evaluated by analyzing the concentration of major cations including u vi cations before and after distillation of the filtered liquid 2 3 4 reuse of purified effluent when the soil washing effluent was purified by neutralization precipitation or distillation and reused as washing water for decontamination of u contaminated soil the effect on the decontamination efficiency was evaluated as follows first untreated effluent neutralized effluent and distilled effluent were prepared using the primary soil washing effluent the neutralized effluent was prepared by injecting naoh powder into untreated effluent neutralizing it to ph 7 and then completely separating the resulting precipitate from the solid liquid mixture using a centrifuge to obtain a supernatant the distilled effluent was also prepared by heating neutralized effluent at 200 c using a heating mantle ms dmsb misung scientific korea equipped with a distilling receiver the ph of the neutralized effluent and distilled effluent was adjusted before treatment by injecting 98 h2so4 before reuse in the next soil washing the changes in concentration of the u vi and fe ions were measured while the same soil sample was washed three times using untreated effluent neutralized effluent and distilled effluent 2 3 5 thermal decomposition of filter cake the filter cake was thermally decomposed by heat treatment at 700 c for 3 h using a muffle furnace b180 nabertherm germany the thermal decomposition characteristics were investigated by checking the changes in weight and elemental components before and after thermal decomposition of the filter cake 2 3 6 analytical methods to accurately analyze the u concentration in the washed soil the washing solution on the washed soil was removed with di water the soil was dried at 60 c and then finely crushed using a mixer mill mm400 retsch germany to prepare a sample for xrf xepos spectro germany analysis to confirm the residual concentration of u in the soil the turbidity value of the solution was measured using a turbidity meter tu 2016 lutron usa the ion concentration in the experimental solution was analyzed by a portable xrf x 200 sciaps usa inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes icap 7400 duo thermo fisher scientific usa and icp mass spectrometry icp ms redtop varian usa a u concentration of 81 mg l was converted to 1 bq g element scanning of the prepared samples was carried out using a scanning electron microscope su8010 hitachi japan equipped with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 decontamination of u contaminated soil fig 2 shows the change of the residual u concentration in soil after decontamination of u decontaminated soil using 0 5 m h2so4 solution after the first washing the u concentration of the soil rinsed with di water was confirmed to be 0 69 bq g after repeated washing in the same manner the u concentration of the soil was confirmed to be 0 45 bq g therefore the u decontaminated soil was confirmed to have been decontaminated to a clearance level of less than 1 bq g 31 through first or second soil washing including di rinsing however the u concentration in soil particles smaller than 106 μm 32 wt after the second washing soil was 2 44 bq g the u concentration of fine soil particles did not decrease to less than 1 bq g even after the second washing this result was expected because a smaller soil particle size corresponds to a higher initial u concentration 32 these results indicate that removing fine soil particles that might be included in the effluent is important for efficient reuse of soil washing effluents 3 2 precipitation flocculation process fig 3 shows the turbidity values of the supernatant and the changes in the u vi and fe concentrations after precipitation induced by neutralization treatment of the soil washing effluent the turbidity values of the first washing effluent second soil washing effluent and mixed solutions of the first and second soil washing effluents were 762 884 and 843 ntu respectively by contrast after the mixed solution was neutralized and allowed to stand for 5 min the turbidity value of the supernatant rapidly decreased to 94 ntu this result was expected because suspended soil coprecipitates during precipitation of metal hydroxide particles generated during a neutralization treatment 33 u ions were precipitated from the mixed effluent by neutralization reaction 34 35 our group has reported that u vi ions in an acidic solution are completely precipitated by the corresponding neutralization reaction 29 in the present work we were able to precipitate u vi ions by neutralizing the mixed solution fe ions were also precipitated by the neutralization treatment however in the supernatant of the mixed effluent neutralized to ph 7 the concentrations u vi and fe ions were found to be 45 mg l and 24 mg l respectively these results suggest that the concentrations of u vi and fe in the mixed effluent were rapidly reduced by the neutralization treatment but were not completely removed because of the suspended particles remaining in the supernatant fig 4 shows the residual rates according to ph conditions of u vi and fe ions as well as other dominant cations eluted by soil washing the residual rates of u vi fe si and al decreased rapidly as the ph increased and then reached almost 0 at ph 7 these results demonstrate that the u vi and fe found in the supernatant of the neutralized and precipitated effluent fig 3 originated from suspended particles rather than from ionic forms in the case of k ca and mg ions the results confirmed that 100 91 and 86 of the ions remained at ph 9 respectively therefore if the neutralized effluent is reused repeatedly the concentration of k ca and mg ions not precipitated by the neutralization treatment are accumulated and the ionic strength can be increased because a high ionic strength can cause a decrease in the decontamination efficiency when reused in the soil washing process 12 36 the ionic strength of recirculated water can be controlled through treatment methods such as distillation fig 5 shows the flocculation of the precipitate of the neutralized soil washing effluent including suspended soil and the change in the u vi and fe concentrations in the supernatant the turbidity value of the supernatant gradually decreased with increasing flocculant dosage and was found to be 12 43 ntu and 12 42 ntu at dosages of 0 3 v v and 0 4 v v respectively in addition as the turbidity value of the supernatant decreased the concentrations of u vi and fe also decreased the concentrations of u vi and fe at 0 3 v v dosage were confirmed to be 1 mg l and 12 0 mg l respectively even if the flocculant dosage exceeded 0 3 v v neither the turbidity value of the neutralized soil washing effluent nor the u vi and fe concentrations substantially changed therefore the optimum flocculant dosage for forming a stable floc of soil washing effluent particles used in the present experiment is judged to be 0 3 v v 3 3 filtration of flocculated suspension table 1 shows the changes in turbidity between the untreated and neutralized effluents during the flocculation and filtration steps the initial turbidity values of both types of effluents exceeded 990 ntu and both effluents were very turbid however the turbidity of the untreated and neutralized effluents could be substantially reduced by injecting 0 3 v v of flocculant when solid liquid separation was performed with a 45 μm pore size membrane after the flocculation process the turbidity value of the untreated effluent was 42 ntu whereas the turbidity of the neutralized effluent was confirmed to be 0 these results were expected because of the cross linking and bridging effects of the flocculant under neutral conditions and because of the heavy and dense flocs formed by a large amount of particles containing neutralized precipitates fig 6 b 37 38 however in the case of untreated effluent most of the suspended soil was precipitated by a 2 5 μm pore size membrane after the flocculation process 0 2 ntu however the solution was bright yellow because of the metal ions not removed by the neutralization treatment fig 6 a therefore the neutralization treatment not only precipitates and removes metal ions contained in the soil washing effluent but also facilitates solid liquid separation in the flocculation process 3 4 distillation after filtration although the ph of a waste liquid that has undergone the neutralization precipitation process is 7 experiments were also performed at ph 4 and 8 to confirm the effect of the initial ph conditions during distillation because the concentration of sulfuric acid in the soil washing effluent was 0 5 m the effluent started to boil slowly at 200 c which is lower than the boiling point of sulfuric acid at 337 c 39 table 2 shows the concentration of the major cations in the distilled solution after distillation of the soil washing effluent samples whose ph was adjusted to 4 7 and 8 the concentration of u vi ions detected in the distilled solution decreased with increasing initial ph this result was expected because as the ph increases u vi ions are precipitated as uo2 oh 2 or change to uo2 2co3 oh 3 with a high molecular weight 34 40 41 which makes it difficult to evaporate however we confirmed that a greater initial ph due to a higher naoh injection amount which is the ph adjusting agent corresponds to a higher concentration of na ions remaining after the distillation treatment however because the major metal ions including u vi and na ions were separated by more than 99 from the neutralized effluent by distillation the results suggest that distillation is an effective method to sufficiently reduce the ionic strength of the effluent 3 5 reuse of purified effluent to evaluate the effect on decontamination efficiency when reused in the washing process of u contaminated soil after the soil washing effluent was treated by neutralization or distillation we investigated the change in concentration of u vi and fe ions eluted from the soil according to the number of reuses fig 7 when the untreated effluent was reused the eluted u vi and fe concentrations reached a plateau at the second reuse however no substantial difference was observed between the second and third times by contrast in the cases of neutralized effluent and distilled effluent the eluted u vi concentration increased steadily from the first to the third reuse and the fe concentration reached a plateau after the third reuse the u concentration in the soil corresponded to the elution characteristics of u vi ions according to the number of reuses table 3 with increasing number of reuses of the untreated effluent the u concentration in the soil increased this result was expected because as the eluted u vi ions accumulate in the solution a driving force e g solubilization and a concentration gradient that moves u from the soil to the solution is not created 42 43 these results suggest that the effluent purified by neutralization or distillation treatment can maintain the u decontamination performance in the soil even if it is reused three times for soil washing as evidenced by its ability to remove u vi ions from the solution 3 6 thermal decomposition of filter cake in korea disposal of wastes containing organic matter is not allowed for safety reasons therefore to remove polyacrylamide pam an organic component of the precipitate formed by flocculant thermal treatment was performed at 700 c during the treatment as the temperature rises pam is completely decomposed into gaseous phases such as h2o nh3 n2 co and co2 through several thermal decomposition steps 44 45 fig 8 shows the analysis results for the components of the particles obtained by drying 60 c and thermally decomposing the precipitate generated during the precipitation flocculation process the dried precipitate was bright red after thermal decomposition likely because of the oxidation of the fe component to hematite 46 in addition the content of u after thermal decomposition was confirmed to be 4 9 wt a comparison of the edx spectra of the dried and thermally treated precipitates fig 8 d reveals that they are almost identical to each other these results suggest that the precipitate itself does not deteriorate even after the thermal decomposition of pma at 700 c and that in particular metal elements including u are stably present in the precipitate 4 conclusions in the present study u ions and suspended soil were removed from u vi contaminated soil washing effluent via neutralization and flocculation methods the u vi ions were phase changed to a solid phase at ph 7 at the same time ions of major metals such as fe and al were removed as precipitates however u vi remained in the supernatant even after neutralization precipitation because of suspended particles although the suspended particles could be completely precipitated by flocculation using pam in the neutralized effluent denser and larger flocs were formed by the metal hydroxide particles thus better separation was achieved than with the untreated effluent when solid liquid separation was conducted using a membrane filter because the remaining ions after precipitation flocculation and filtration were easily purified by distillation distillation is proposed as a method to lower the ionic strength during repeated reuse of treated effluent even when neutralized or distilled effluent was reused for soil washing the soil decontamination performance was maintained however the performance was not maintained when untreated effluent was reused meanwhile to achieve disposal suitability pam an organic component of the filter cake was successfully removed by thermal decomposition without loss of metal deposits including u therefore the treatment method of u vi contaminated soil washing effluent using the precipitation flocculation process presented in the present study can be used to effectively treat the washing waste of u contaminated soil and dispose of

12922,the purpose of this study was to effectively purify uranium u vi contaminated soil washing effluent using a precipitation flocculation process reuse the purified water and dispose of the solid waste the u vi ions in the effluent were easily removed as sediments by neutralization and the metal sediments and suspended soils were flocculated precipitated by polyacrylamide pam the precipitate generated through the precipitation flocculation process was completely separated into solid liquid phases by membrane filtration pore size 45 μm and ca2 and mg2 ions remaining in the effluent were removed by distillation even if neutralized or distilled effluent was reused for soil washing soil decontamination performance was maintained pam an organic component of the filter cake was successfully removed by thermal decomposition without loss of metal deposits including u vi therefore the treatment method of u vi contaminated soil washing effluent using the precipitation flocculation process presented in this study can be used to effectively treat the washing waste of u vi contaminated soil and dispose of the generated solids keywords uranium soil washing precipitation flocculation radioactive waste disposal 1 introduction with the increasing application of nuclear energy a large amount of waste containing u is generated from activities such as fuel fabrication fuel reprocessing and research and development 1 6 u is generally present in the form of soluble uo2 2 ions and has dramatic mobility and high chemotoxicity 7 8 in particular u vi ions in soil can be solvated ion exchanged in certain reactions complexed with soil organic matter or precipitated as pure or mixed solids 9 therefore the u in the soil migrates to water air and the food supply through these various physicochemical reaction pathways where it adversely affects the environment and human health 10 11 various methods have been developed for decontamination of u contaminated soil such as soil washing electrokinetic extraction vitrification and phytoremediation 12 14 among these soil decontamination methods soil washing has several advantages first the process is conducted in a closed system in which the surrounding environmental conditions can be controlled second the process can substantially reduce the volume of contaminants in addition the cost of soil washing is relatively low compared with that of other soil decontamination methods 15 16 although u vi ions are efficiently and economically decontaminated from soil by soil washing the effluent generated during soil washing contains not only u vi ion but also various metal ions it therefore becomes a new wastewater that must be treated conventional methods for treating soil washing effluent include chemical precipitation adsorption ion exchange evaporation electrochemical treatment and photocatalytic degradation 17 23 among these methods the chemical precipitation method is more practical as a soil washing effluent treatment because it uses inexpensive commercial chemicals and the process configuration is relatively simple 24 the removal of u vi ions by chemical precipitation involves the formation of u vi ions as insoluble uranium hydroxide precipitates by the addition of chemical ph adjusters such as naoh ca oh 2 and cao 25 26 however because u vi sedimentation particles formed by chemical precipitation remain mixed with suspended soil particles of soil washing effluent these particles must be completely separated for the effluent to be reused or discharge to the environment 27 for solid liquid separation methods such as membrane filtration filter pressing and centrifugation can be used because very small particles cause clogging of the filter or are difficult to settle increasing the particle size of fine particles is necessary to prevent clogging of the filter and improve the separation efficiency 28 in the present study precipitation flocculation processes were investigated for the removal of u vi ions and suspended soil from u vi contaminated soil washing effluent the effluent was prepared by washing u contaminated soil with sulfuric acid to remove u vi ions from the aqueous phase a precipitation method was applied by neutralizing the soil washing effluent the neutralized sediment and suspended soil were easily separated from the resultant solid liquid mixture via flocculation induced by an organic flocculant in addition distillation and thermal treatment methods were applied for water reuse and solid waste disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the u contaminated soil used in the present study was prepared by a dry sieving method using a sieve shaker as200 retsch germany after fractionation at the waste storage facility of the korea atomic energy research institute after the soil was dry sieved the 0 2 0 5 mm size fraction was used in soil washing experiments sulfuric acid h2so4 98 and sodium hydroxide naoh 98 were purchased from duksan chemicals south korea flocculant ha 510 polyacrylamide was obtained from hansol chemical south korea deionized di water was obtained from a water purification system aqua max basic 360 younglin south korea 2 2 preparation of u vi contaminated soil washing effluent the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent used in the experiments was prepared referring to the decontamination conditions reported in our previous study 29 the procedure is outlined as follows first u contaminated soil and 0 5 m h2so4 solution were mixed in a 50 ml conical tube polystyrene spl south korea the tube containing the mixture was shaken for 1 h at 25 c at 200 rpm using a hybridization incubator combi d24 finepcr south korea the soil washing effluent delivered to the waste treatment process might have contained suspended soil particles the mixture was therefore sieved using a 106 μm sieve to collect soil washing effluent containing fine soil particles to create conditions similar to those of the waste solution generated in the actual soil decontamination process the u vi and fe ion concentrations of the filtrate supernatant were analyzed after the soil washing effluent was sieved through a 106 μm sieve and allowed to stand for 5 min 2 3 treatment of the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent fig 1 shows the treatment process of the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent generated during the washing process of u contaminated soil the main mechanisms are described as follows first u vi ions and the suspended soil of the u vi contaminated soil washing effluent are precipitated into a solid phase via a precipitation flocculation process using naoh powder and an organic flocculant second the precipitate containing u vi and fine soil is separated from the effluent by membrane filtration and formed into a filter cake if the organic matter content of this filter cake does not meet the waste acceptance criteria of the final disposal facility 30 the organic flocculant in the filter cake is removed by thermal decomposition meanwhile the filtrate generated through the filtration is directly recycled to the soil washing process or distilled water is circulated after distillation if the ionic strength affects the soil decontamination efficiency in this process only the precipitate generated in the precipitation flocculation process becomes radioactive waste 2 3 1 precipitation flocculation process u ions were precipitated by neutralizing the filtrate of the soil washing effluent containing fine soil particles using naoh powder and the ph was measured using a ph meter orionstar t910 thermo scientific usa to confirm the precipitation characteristics of u vi according to the ph conditions the residual rate of u vi and other dominant cations was investigated at 3 ph 9 the ion concentration was analyzed after particulate matter was completed removed using a 0 2 μm nylon syringe filter whatman uk after the neutralization treatment the precipitate and suspended soil which are particulate matter present in the neutralized soil washing effluent were aggregated using a flocculant changes in the turbidity and in the u vi and fe concentrations were checked while 0 1 ml of flocculant was injected into 100 ml of neutralized soil washing effluent containing suspended soil 2 3 2 filtration of flocculated suspension to investigate the separation characteristics of particles after the neutralization flocculation treatment turbid untreated effluent and neutralized effluent containing soil with particles larger than 150 μm were each subjected to the flocculation treatment thereafter turbidity changes were confirmed by filtration using membrane filters with various pore sizes of 45 20 6 and 2 5 μm after filtration the solid liquid separation performance was evaluated on the basis of the turbidity value under untreated effluent and neutralized effluent conditions 2 3 3 distillation after filtration the filtrate obtained through filtration was distilled at 200 c using a heating mantle ms dmsb misung scientific south korea the distillation performance was evaluated by analyzing the concentration of major cations including u vi cations before and after distillation of the filtered liquid 2 3 4 reuse of purified effluent when the soil washing effluent was purified by neutralization precipitation or distillation and reused as washing water for decontamination of u contaminated soil the effect on the decontamination efficiency was evaluated as follows first untreated effluent neutralized effluent and distilled effluent were prepared using the primary soil washing effluent the neutralized effluent was prepared by injecting naoh powder into untreated effluent neutralizing it to ph 7 and then completely separating the resulting precipitate from the solid liquid mixture using a centrifuge to obtain a supernatant the distilled effluent was also prepared by heating neutralized effluent at 200 c using a heating mantle ms dmsb misung scientific korea equipped with a distilling receiver the ph of the neutralized effluent and distilled effluent was adjusted before treatment by injecting 98 h2so4 before reuse in the next soil washing the changes in concentration of the u vi and fe ions were measured while the same soil sample was washed three times using untreated effluent neutralized effluent and distilled effluent 2 3 5 thermal decomposition of filter cake the filter cake was thermally decomposed by heat treatment at 700 c for 3 h using a muffle furnace b180 nabertherm germany the thermal decomposition characteristics were investigated by checking the changes in weight and elemental components before and after thermal decomposition of the filter cake 2 3 6 analytical methods to accurately analyze the u concentration in the washed soil the washing solution on the washed soil was removed with di water the soil was dried at 60 c and then finely crushed using a mixer mill mm400 retsch germany to prepare a sample for xrf xepos spectro germany analysis to confirm the residual concentration of u in the soil the turbidity value of the solution was measured using a turbidity meter tu 2016 lutron usa the ion concentration in the experimental solution was analyzed by a portable xrf x 200 sciaps usa inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes icap 7400 duo thermo fisher scientific usa and icp mass spectrometry icp ms redtop varian usa a u concentration of 81 mg l was converted to 1 bq g element scanning of the prepared samples was carried out using a scanning electron microscope su8010 hitachi japan equipped with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 decontamination of u contaminated soil fig 2 shows the change of the residual u concentration in soil after decontamination of u decontaminated soil using 0 5 m h2so4 solution after the first washing the u concentration of the soil rinsed with di water was confirmed to be 0 69 bq g after repeated washing in the same manner the u concentration of the soil was confirmed to be 0 45 bq g therefore the u decontaminated soil was confirmed to have been decontaminated to a clearance level of less than 1 bq g 31 through first or second soil washing including di rinsing however the u concentration in soil particles smaller than 106 μm 32 wt after the second washing soil was 2 44 bq g the u concentration of fine soil particles did not decrease to less than 1 bq g even after the second washing this result was expected because a smaller soil particle size corresponds to a higher initial u concentration 32 these results indicate that removing fine soil particles that might be included in the effluent is important for efficient reuse of soil washing effluents 3 2 precipitation flocculation process fig 3 shows the turbidity values of the supernatant and the changes in the u vi and fe concentrations after precipitation induced by neutralization treatment of the soil washing effluent the turbidity values of the first washing effluent second soil washing effluent and mixed solutions of the first and second soil washing effluents were 762 884 and 843 ntu respectively by contrast after the mixed solution was neutralized and allowed to stand for 5 min the turbidity value of the supernatant rapidly decreased to 94 ntu this result was expected because suspended soil coprecipitates during precipitation of metal hydroxide particles generated during a neutralization treatment 33 u ions were precipitated from the mixed effluent by neutralization reaction 34 35 our group has reported that u vi ions in an acidic solution are completely precipitated by the corresponding neutralization reaction 29 in the present work we were able to precipitate u vi ions by neutralizing the mixed solution fe ions were also precipitated by the neutralization treatment however in the supernatant of the mixed effluent neutralized to ph 7 the concentrations u vi and fe ions were found to be 45 mg l and 24 mg l respectively these results suggest that the concentrations of u vi and fe in the mixed effluent were rapidly reduced by the neutralization treatment but were not completely removed because of the suspended particles remaining in the supernatant fig 4 shows the residual rates according to ph conditions of u vi and fe ions as well as other dominant cations eluted by soil washing the residual rates of u vi fe si and al decreased rapidly as the ph increased and then reached almost 0 at ph 7 these results demonstrate that the u vi and fe found in the supernatant of the neutralized and precipitated effluent fig 3 originated from suspended particles rather than from ionic forms in the case of k ca and mg ions the results confirmed that 100 91 and 86 of the ions remained at ph 9 respectively therefore if the neutralized effluent is reused repeatedly the concentration of k ca and mg ions not precipitated by the neutralization treatment are accumulated and the ionic strength can be increased because a high ionic strength can cause a decrease in the decontamination efficiency when reused in the soil washing process 12 36 the ionic strength of recirculated water can be controlled through treatment methods such as distillation fig 5 shows the flocculation of the precipitate of the neutralized soil washing effluent including suspended soil and the change in the u vi and fe concentrations in the supernatant the turbidity value of the supernatant gradually decreased with increasing flocculant dosage and was found to be 12 43 ntu and 12 42 ntu at dosages of 0 3 v v and 0 4 v v respectively in addition as the turbidity value of the supernatant decreased the concentrations of u vi and fe also decreased the concentrations of u vi and fe at 0 3 v v dosage were confirmed to be 1 mg l and 12 0 mg l respectively even if the flocculant dosage exceeded 0 3 v v neither the turbidity value of the neutralized soil washing effluent nor the u vi and fe concentrations substantially changed therefore the optimum flocculant dosage for forming a stable floc of soil washing effluent particles used in the present experiment is judged to be 0 3 v v 3 3 filtration of flocculated suspension table 1 shows the changes in turbidity between the untreated and neutralized effluents during the flocculation and filtration steps the initial turbidity values of both types of effluents exceeded 990 ntu and both effluents were very turbid however the turbidity of the untreated and neutralized effluents could be substantially reduced by injecting 0 3 v v of flocculant when solid liquid separation was performed with a 45 μm pore size membrane after the flocculation process the turbidity value of the untreated effluent was 42 ntu whereas the turbidity of the neutralized effluent was confirmed to be 0 these results were expected because of the cross linking and bridging effects of the flocculant under neutral conditions and because of the heavy and dense flocs formed by a large amount of particles containing neutralized precipitates fig 6 b 37 38 however in the case of untreated effluent most of the suspended soil was precipitated by a 2 5 μm pore size membrane after the flocculation process 0 2 ntu however the solution was bright yellow because of the metal ions not removed by the neutralization treatment fig 6 a therefore the neutralization treatment not only precipitates and removes metal ions contained in the soil washing effluent but also facilitates solid liquid separation in the flocculation process 3 4 distillation after filtration although the ph of a waste liquid that has undergone the neutralization precipitation process is 7 experiments were also performed at ph 4 and 8 to confirm the effect of the initial ph conditions during distillation because the concentration of sulfuric acid in the soil washing effluent was 0 5 m the effluent started to boil slowly at 200 c which is lower than the boiling point of sulfuric acid at 337 c 39 table 2 shows the concentration of the major cations in the distilled solution after distillation of the soil washing effluent samples whose ph was adjusted to 4 7 and 8 the concentration of u vi ions detected in the distilled solution decreased with increasing initial ph this result was expected because as the ph increases u vi ions are precipitated as uo2 oh 2 or change to uo2 2co3 oh 3 with a high molecular weight 34 40 41 which makes it difficult to evaporate however we confirmed that a greater initial ph due to a higher naoh injection amount which is the ph adjusting agent corresponds to a higher concentration of na ions remaining after the distillation treatment however because the major metal ions including u vi and na ions were separated by more than 99 from the neutralized effluent by distillation the results suggest that distillation is an effective method to sufficiently reduce the ionic strength of the effluent 3 5 reuse of purified effluent to evaluate the effect on decontamination efficiency when reused in the washing process of u contaminated soil after the soil washing effluent was treated by neutralization or distillation we investigated the change in concentration of u vi and fe ions eluted from the soil according to the number of reuses fig 7 when the untreated effluent was reused the eluted u vi and fe concentrations reached a plateau at the second reuse however no substantial difference was observed between the second and third times by contrast in the cases of neutralized effluent and distilled effluent the eluted u vi concentration increased steadily from the first to the third reuse and the fe concentration reached a plateau after the third reuse the u concentration in the soil corresponded to the elution characteristics of u vi ions according to the number of reuses table 3 with increasing number of reuses of the untreated effluent the u concentration in the soil increased this result was expected because as the eluted u vi ions accumulate in the solution a driving force e g solubilization and a concentration gradient that moves u from the soil to the solution is not created 42 43 these results suggest that the effluent purified by neutralization or distillation treatment can maintain the u decontamination performance in the soil even if it is reused three times for soil washing as evidenced by its ability to remove u vi ions from the solution 3 6 thermal decomposition of filter cake in korea disposal of wastes containing organic matter is not allowed for safety reasons therefore to remove polyacrylamide pam an organic component of the precipitate formed by flocculant thermal treatment was performed at 700 c during the treatment as the temperature rises pam is completely decomposed into gaseous phases such as h2o nh3 n2 co and co2 through several thermal decomposition steps 44 45 fig 8 shows the analysis results for the components of the particles obtained by drying 60 c and thermally decomposing the precipitate generated during the precipitation flocculation process the dried precipitate was bright red after thermal decomposition likely because of the oxidation of the fe component to hematite 46 in addition the content of u after thermal decomposition was confirmed to be 4 9 wt a comparison of the edx spectra of the dried and thermally treated precipitates fig 8 d reveals that they are almost identical to each other these results suggest that the precipitate itself does not deteriorate even after the thermal decomposition of pma at 700 c and that in particular metal elements including u are stably present in the precipitate 4 conclusions in the present study u ions and suspended soil were removed from u vi contaminated soil washing effluent via neutralization and flocculation methods the u vi ions were phase changed to a solid phase at ph 7 at the same time ions of major metals such as fe and al were removed as precipitates however u vi remained in the supernatant even after neutralization precipitation because of suspended particles although the suspended particles could be completely precipitated by flocculation using pam in the neutralized effluent denser and larger flocs were formed by the metal hydroxide particles thus better separation was achieved than with the untreated effluent when solid liquid separation was conducted using a membrane filter because the remaining ions after precipitation flocculation and filtration were easily purified by distillation distillation is proposed as a method to lower the ionic strength during repeated reuse of treated effluent even when neutralized or distilled effluent was reused for soil washing the soil decontamination performance was maintained however the performance was not maintained when untreated effluent was reused meanwhile to achieve disposal suitability pam an organic component of the filter cake was successfully removed by thermal decomposition without loss of metal deposits including u therefore the treatment method of u vi contaminated soil washing effluent using the precipitation flocculation process presented in the present study can be used to effectively treat the washing waste of u contaminated soil and dispose of

12923,devising effective measures for removing heavy metals from water has become a serious concern in this study mgal layered double hydroxide nanosheets were assembled on graphene oxide gl and its magnetic product fe3o4 gl as excellent adsorbents for cu2 cd2 and pb2 and were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method the morphology and surface chemical properties were observed to establish the construct activity relationships the characterization results showed that the adsorbents combined rich functional groups with large specific surface areas the effective removal of heavy metals by gl and fe3o4 gl was achieved under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the pseudo second order kinetic equation described the experimental results well and the equilibrium data were in good agreement with the freundlich model for cu2 and cd2 and the langmuir model for pb2 the maximum adsorption capacity of gl cu2 89 26 mg g cd2 76 67 mg g pb2 226 98 mg g was slightly larger than that of fe3o4 gl cu2 80 72 mg g cd2 70 26 mg g pb2 213 96 mg g the main mechanisms include the surface complexation of hydroxyl groups precipitation reactions of metal hydroxides and metal carbonates and isomorphic substitution of divalent metal cations thus the enhanced adsorption capacity and mechanistic study provide new insights into the environmental remediation of heavy metals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide synergistic effect heavy metal adsorption behavior mechanistic study 1 introduction unreasonable discharge of heavy metal wastewater has become a serious environmental threat 1 2 copper cu cadmium cd and lead pb are commonly detected in industrial wastewater and cause ecosystem problems 3 various nanomaterials have been developed and applied for the removal of heavy metals such as graphene family nanomaterials gfns metal oxides clay minerals and polymerides 4 6 gfns are a topic of great concern in multidisciplinary areas because of their extraordinary physicochemical properties 5 7 owing to their large theoretical surface area abundant functional groups and good dispersibility gfns are more attractive than other carbon based nanomaterials 8 9 in particular graphene oxide go has great potential for wastewater treatment because it possesses abundant oxygen containing functional groups e g oh o cooh and co 1 2 9 thus go can be easily functionalized and hybridized with other nanomaterials and is endowed with remarkable features for excellent removal of pollutants 3 10 11 unfortunately there are some obstacles in the direct application of go as an attractive adsorbent 7 9 go tends to aggregate because of van der waals interactions between neighboring sheets which eventually reduces the available surface area and consequently reduces the number of active adsorption sites 4 7 go is strongly hydrophilic and can be easily dispersed in aqueous solutions making it difficult to recover from aquatic environments and even causing significant cytotoxicity to human health 3 8 12 in addition the complexity of the preparation process and the high cost limit its widespread use in environmental remediation to improve its widespread application in heavy metal remediation various studies have been conducted to solve the aggregation problem and increase the coordination between go and heavy metals 2 3 12 14 for example a sio2 graphene composite was prepared by a two step reaction and was considered to be a highly selective adsorbent for pb2 ions 14 guo et al combined the advantages of the functional groups of graphene with the magnetic characteristics of fe3o4 to fabricate a magnetic graphene composite material fe3o4 gs and used it for pb2 hg2 cd2 and ni2 adsorption 3 cui et al presented the adsorption mechanism of pb2 hg2 and cu2 on ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid modified magnetic go 2 wang et al reviewed modification methods for nitrogen containing amino compound functionalized go 13 therefore the go composite not only inherited the advantage of a single component but also showed a synergistic effect layered double hydroxides ldhs which are 2d layered anionic clay minerals possess attractive properties such as adjustable chemical composition reactive surface and low cost 7 15 19 although ldh has been widely used as a promising scavenger of heavy metal ions few studies have been conducted on ldh nanosheets assembled between layers of go to construct a sandwiched structure the special structure not only resolves the problem of agglomeration of go but also improves the adsorption activity of heavy metals by a synergistic effect 9 20 moreover ldh can aggregate with a target nanomaterial i e go forming new minerals secondary minerals to enhance the removal of heavy metals and reduce the toxicity of go in aqueous solutions 7 taking full advantage of go and ldh the go ldh composites would be one of the promising nanomaterials in wastewater remediation 5 21 for example yuan et al synthesized calcined graphene mgal ldh nanocomposites to evaluate their adsorption performance for cr6 9 magnetite graphene ldh composites exhibited a higher adsorption ability for as3 than pure ldh 20 powder composites are difficult to separate from aqueous solutions for environmental applications fe3o4 is a widely used magnetic material in magnetic fluids 2 3 magnetic nanomaterials containing fe3o4 can achieve facile and effective solid liquid separation which will eventually simplify the post treatment process and reduce operating costs 22 23 moreover the excellent magnetic recycling performance of nanomaterials can prevent adsorbents from flowing away and increase their reusability 24 26 herein based on the advantages e g rich functional groups and large surface area of go effective dispersion and abundant adsorption sites of ldh and magnetic performance of fe3o4 we successfully synthesized go ldh gl and magnetic fe3o4 go ldh fe3o4 gl through a facile cooperation method and applied them to adsorb cu2 cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solutions the objectives of this study were 1 to study the adsorption performance of gl and fe3o4 gl including the effects of adsorption conditions kinetics and isotherms 2 to investigate the adsorption mechanism using characteristic techniques x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem transmission electron microscopy tem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and zeta potential and 3 to evaluate the regeneration and practical application of gl and fe3o4 gl 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all analytical grade agents were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent beijing co ltd graphite powder was obtained from shanghai macklin

salt solution 2 56 g mg no3 2 6h2o 1 87 g al no3 3 9h2o were added simultaneously the ph of the solution was maintained at approximately 10 when the reaction was complete the precipitate was vigorously stirred for another 4 h the precipitate was washed repeatedly with deionized water and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 2 4 preparation of fe3o4 go ldh fe3o4 gl fe3o4 gl was also synthesized using the co precipitation method typically 0 39 g fe3o4 was dispersed in 20 ml deionized water and then 100 ml mixed solution 0 05 g go 0 2 g ca was added to the above solution under continuous stirring the remaining steps of ldh assembly on go were the same as in section 2 2 3 the obtained black product was denoted as fe3o4 gl 2 3 characterization methods the phase constitution of the adsorbents was analyzed using a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer bruker germany at 40 kv and 40 ma with cu kα radiation functional groups were characterized using a vertex 70 ftir spectrometer bruker germany the morphology and microstructure were examined using sem s570 hitachi japan and tem fei corporation united states the chemical composition and state of the samples were recorded using xps thermo united states the surface area and pore volume were monitored using a surface area and porosity analyzer asap 2460 micromeritics united states magnetization was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm 7410 lake shore united states the zeta potential of the adsorbent suspensions was determined using a nano zs90 zetasizer analyzer malvern united kingdom 2 4 batch adsorption procedure to evaluate the removal abilities of gl and fe3o4 gl adsorption experiments were carried out simultaneously the batch adsorption study was conducted by mixing the adsorbent with 20 ml of pb2 cd2 and cu2 in a 50 ml centrifuge tube the centrifuge tube was then placed in an oscillation box at a speed of 200 rpm after centrifugation a flame atomic absorption spectrometer aa 7000 shimadzu japan was used to monitor the residual concentrations of cu2 at 324 8 nm cd2 at 228 8 nm and pb2 at 283 3 nm the removal rate and adsorption capacity were calculated as the differences between the initial and equilibrium concentrations the adsorbent was regenerated by continuous adsorption desorption tests and 0 005 mol l edta 2na was selected as the eluent after adsorption and filtration 20 ml of eluent was added to the centrifuge tube and shaken at a speed of 200 rpm for 240 min the regenerated adsorbent was obtained from the mixture washed to neutral ph with di water dried at 60 c and used in the next adsorption desorption test cycle to further verify the environmental application simulated wastewater remediation using gl and fe3o4 gl was also carried out detailed ion compositions of the simulated surface water and groundwater are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results the morphologies and microstructures of gl and fe3o4 gl are shown in fig 1 compared with gl fe3o4 gl had a rougher surface and stronger granular sense on the surface fig 1a and b the ldhs were evenly loaded onto the flakes of the go sheets fig 1c fe3o4 was distributed on the large gl surface fig 1d tem results indicated that the go composites exhibited better dispersion characteristics after treatment with ldh the interplanar spacing of 0 261 nm was in good agreement with the 012 lattice plane of the ldh fig 1e in addition fe3o4 gl displayed perfect crystallinity fig 1f the lattice spacings were 0 205 0 248 and 0 264 nm which correspond to the 400 and 311 planes of fe3o4 and the 012 plane of the ldh respectively the xrd patterns of gl and fe3o4 gl are shown in fig 2a the characteristic xrd peaks of 003 006 012 015 018 110 and 113 were ascribed to ldh nanosheets pdf 89 0460 27 29 the main gl peaks fit well with those of ldh however the characteristic diffraction peak of 002 of go was not present in gl and may have been shielded by the 003 ldh peak 26 according to the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 gl the peaks of 003 006 and 012 were attributed to ldh whereas those of 220 311 400 511 and 440 were in agreement with fe3o4 pdf 89 0691 and no other extra peaks appeared in fe3o4 gl consequently gl and fe3o4 gl were composites of go ldh and fe3o4 the formation of new bonds destroyed the layered crystal structure of ldh during synthesis weakening some characteristic peaks such as 015 018 110 and 113 30 the ftir spectra of gl and fe3o4 gl are shown in fig 2b the characteristic spectrum of go was located at 3340 cm 1 oh 1718 cm 1 co in the carboxyl group 1613 cm 1 cc 1393 cm 1 coh and 1042 cm 1 alkoxy co 12 31 32 which proved that go had abundant oxygen containing groups the stretching vibration bands of ldh appeared at 3404 cm 1 oh 1355 cm 1 co 668 cm 1 mo and 557 cm 1 mom 26 27 notably the gl composite spectra were similar to those of ldh and go compared with pristine go the infrared peak intensity at 1718 cm 1 co in the carboxyl group and 1042 cm 1 alkoxy co in gl was weakened or disappeared suggesting that the deoxidation reaction of the surface functional groups of go may occur during the synthesis process resulting in the reduction of go to rgo moreover a peak at 553 cm 1 was observed which was attributed to the feo lattice vibration of fe3o4 gl 24 26 as presented in fig 2c mg al o and c appeared in the survey spectra of gl and fe3o4 gl and fe 2p was clearly exhibited in fe3o4 gl compared with gl the peaks in the fe 2p spectra could be divided into fe 2p1 2 724 8 ev and fe 2p3 2 710 1 ev indicating the presence of fe3o4 in fe3o4 gl fig 2d to confirm the presence of go in gl and fe3o4 gl the hr xps spectra of c 1s were analyzed fig s1a and b the c 1s could be divided into four carbon peaks and the be value was 284 7 ev for cc 285 6 ev for co 286 6 ev for coc and 289 1 ev for oco the n2 adsorption desorption isothermal curves and pore parameters of ldh gl and fe3o4 gl are illustrated in fig s2a and table s2 the specific surface area of gl 114 2 m2 g and fe3o4 gl 82 31 m2 g was improved over ldh 48 64 m2 g by the incorporation of go fig s2b shows the vsm curves of fe3o4 gl and fe3o4 the magnetization of fe3o4 gl was slightly lower than that of fe3o4 indicating that fe3o4 gl could be easily and rapidly separated from the suspension under an applied magnetic field 3 2 effects of experimental conditions on adsorption behavior although go has good physical and chemical properties some obstacles limit its widespread use for heavy metal removal such as easy aggregation difficulty in recovery complexity of preparation and cytotoxicity to human health the modified gl and fe3o4 gl solutions resolved these problems therefore ldh gl and fe3o4 gl were used in the adsorption experiments as the dosage increased from 0 01 g to 0 15 g in 20 ml solution the adsorption efficiency gradually increased and reached an equilibrium state fig 3a c compared to the pristine ldh gl and fe3o4 gl exhibited an obviously higher removal efficiency this may have resulted from the larger specific surface area and more oxygen containing functional groups e g oh co and cooh of the gl and fe3o4 gl composites these features would provide more adsorption sites and facilitate the formation of coordination bonds with heavy metals compared to ldh notably the adsorption capacity of gl was slightly higher than that of fe3o4 gl this result proved that fe3o4 occupied some of the active adsorption sites of gl to ensure good adsorption efficiency 0 05 g gl and fe3o4 gl were selected as the optimal dosages in the following experiments based on the metal ion distribution at different solution ph values the metal species mainly include m2 moh and m oh 2 16 according to the k sp of cu2 cd2 and pb2 a higher ph could cause metal hydroxide formation fig s3 therefore the initial solution ph was set to different ranges cu2 ph 2 6 cd2 ph 2 8 5 pb2 ph 2 6 the effect of the solution ph on adsorption by gl and fe3o4 gl is shown in fig 3d e under strongly acidic conditions abundant h is adsorbed on the layer to form a positive charge which could cause electrostatic repulsion with heavy metal ions 33 thus the adsorption capacities of gl and fe3o4 gl are lower at ph 3 with an increase in ph the decrease in h3o ions and the deprotonation of functional groups could benefit the adsorption process moreover the equilibrium ph values were higher than the initial values after adsorption fig s4a c this phenomenon is caused by the accumulation of basic cations by adsorbents 16 because the initial ph values of the cu2 cd2 and pb2 solutions were all approximately 6 such adsorption conditions over a wide ph range are beneficial for practical environmental remediation the influence of contact time ranging from 5 to 480 min was investigated for the gl and fe3o4 gl composites fig 3f with the increase in contact time the adsorption capacity of gl for cu2 cd2 and pb2 significantly increased in the first 30 min and then tended to reach an equilibrium state at 240 min the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 gl was slightly lower than that of gl and the adsorption trend was similar to that of gl the optional contact time was set to 240 min 3 3 adsorption kinetics and isotherms kinetic equations were used to analyze the adsorption behavior and rate controlling steps in the overall adsorption process 34 the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion equations eqs s1 s4 were used to fit the experimental data the calculated parameters and linear fit of the pseudo second order kinetic equation are listed in table 1 and fig 4a b because the r 2 value of the pseudo second order equation was approximately 0 99 the adsorption of cu2 cd2 and pb2 on gl and fe3o4 gl followed the pseudo second order equation well the experimental adsorption capacities q e exp were very close to the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities q e cal of the pseudo second order equation that is the differences δq t were lower than those of the pseudo first order equation the error function eq s5 was used to prove the feasibility of the kinetic models 16 and a comparatively lower relative error χ 0 04 0 22 was obtained from the pseudo second order equation the excellent fitting of the pseudo second order model was similar to previous reports of heavy metal adsorption such as mos4 2 anion intercalated ldh 29 humate modified ldh 35 nh2 rich polymer go 12 and edta modified magnetic go 2 the diffusion mechanism was elucidated by the intra particle diffusion model and the value of c i was proportional to the thickness of the boundary layer 24 the values of c i in this work were calculated and were not zero table 1 indicating that some other chemical reaction was involved in the adsorption process except diffusion the linear fit of the intraparticle diffusion model included two linear portions fig s5 the first region was caused by rapid surface adsorption which was driven by the high concentration of heavy metals the second region achieved an adsorption equilibrium state based on the above results the rate limiting step is chemisorption during the adsorption process 12 29 36 the adsorption behavior might contain valency forces via electron sharing or transfer between adsorbents and heavy metals and is also mainly attributed to the oxygen containing active groups on the surface of go 2 12 under optimal adsorption conditions adsorption isotherm experiments were performed by changing the initial concentration of heavy metal ions in the solution the widely used langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson isothermal models eqs s6 s8 were used to fit the experimental data the relevant calculated parameters and nonlinearity of the langmuir and freundlich models are shown in table 2 and fig 4c d according to the r 2 values the freundlich model was more appropriate than the langmuir model for cu2 and cd2 adsorption on gl and fe3o4 gl suggesting that the adsorbent surface was heterogeneous and active adsorption sites were unevenly distributed on the surface 16 28 37 however the r 2 values of the langmuir and redlich peterson models for pb2 were higher than those of the freundlich model indicating that homogeneous adsorption occurred during the adsorption process and no interaction took place 16 28 38 the maximum adsorption capacity of gl cu2 89 26 mg g cd2 76 67 mg g pb2 226 98 mg g was higher than that of fe3o4 gl cu2 80 72 mg g cd2 70 26 mg g pb2 213 96 mg g 3 4 adsorption mechanism study to investigate the detailed adsorption mechanisms of gl and fe3o4 gl for cu2 cd2 and pb2 the xrd patterns xps spectra and zeta potentials were analyzed as illustrated in fig 5a and b there was a new characteristic peak of cu oh 2 pdf 72 0140 in gl and fe3o4 gl after cu2 adsorption according to the authentication by the software of mdi jade 6 5 cu 2p was also clearly detected in the wide scan xps spectra of gl and fe3o4 gl with adsorbed cu2 fig 6a and b the characteristic cu 2p peak can be divided into four peaks fig 6c and d of 934 3 943 0 and 954 3 ev for cu 2p3 2 and 962 8 ev for cu 2p1 2 respectively implying the formation of cu hydroxides e g sur oh cu or sur o cu during adsorption 1 39 40 precipitation and surface complexation occurred during cu2 adsorption by gl and fe3o4 gl respectively because the radius of cu2 0 072 nm is closer to that of mg2 0 066 nm isomorphic substitution is more likely to occur in the reaction 40 41 through analyzing the xps spectra the atomic ratio of mg al decreased from 1 56 to 0 68 for gl and from 1 45 to 0 79 for fe3o4 gl respectively simultaneously the release of mg ions into the aqueous solution was detected by flame atomic absorption spectrometry after the heavy metal adsorption process the release value was calculated to be 10 66 mg g for gl and 9 38 mg g for fe3o4 gl these results indicate that isomorphic substitution is involved in the removal of cu2 the surface charge of the adsorbent is a key factor for heavy metal removal 42 the zeta potentials of gl and fe3o4 gl before and after adsorption were monitored at different ph values fig 7a and b after cu2 adsorption the isoelectric point increased from 10 2 to 11 0 for gl and from 10 3 to 10 9 for fe3o4 gl under weakly acidic conditions fig s4a the surface charge of the adsorbents was positive resulting in electrostatic repulsion with heavy metals 16 this phenomenon illustrates that adsorption is less influenced by electrostatic interactions after the adsorption of cd2 the new peaks of gl and fe3o4 gl located at 30 34 36 54 43 68 49 88 and 57 81 were attributed to cdco3 pdf 72 1939 fig 5a and b 25 the complexation of cdco3 was ascribed to the abundant carboxyl functional groups of go the characteristic xps peaks at 405 4 ev cd 3d5 2 and 412 2 ev cd 3d3 2 corresponded to the cadmium hydroxide and carbon oxides indicating the formation of surface complexation between cd2 and deprotonated hydroxyl groups fig 6e and f the same conclusions were drawn by shan et al 25 and cao et al 43 the xps spectra showed that the atomic ratio of mg al decreased from 1 56 to 0 52 for gl and from 1 45 to 0 65 for fe3o4 gl respectively the release value of mg2 was calculated to be 7 34 mg g for gl and 6 91 mg g for fe3o4 gl due to the ionic radius of cd2 0 095 nm being close to mg2 0 073 nm 25 26 38 44 thus isomorphic substitution contributes to the adsorption process for cd2 after cd2 adsorption the isoelectric point increased from 10 2 to 11 1 for gl and from 10 3 to 10 9 for fe3o4 gl respectively fig 7 indicating that the adsorption of cd2 at ph 2 0 8 5 was not dominated by electrostatic interaction after the adsorption of pb2 a series of bright signal spots appeared in the xrd patterns of gl and fe3o4 gl fig 5a and b indicating that pb2 complexes were formed specially the new peaks at 2θ 20 00 20 99 24 75 27 18 34 07 40 43 42 75 44 25 48 90 54 03 and 58 10 were ascribed to the lead carbonate of pb3 co3 2 oh 2 pdf 13 0131 moreover pb 4f5 2 and pb 4f7 2 were located at 143 3 and 138 4 ev respectively fig 6g and h confirming the formation of surface complexations sur oh pb sur o pb or sur coo pb 2 35 the peak at 138 4 ev was between 137 3 ev lead hydroxide and 138 7 ev lead carbon oxides proving the coexistence of hydroxides and carbon oxides in the form of pb3 co3 2 oh 2 35 in the xps analysis the slight decrease in the atomic ratio of mg al after adsorption of pb2 gl 1 56 to 1 21 fe3o4 gl 1 45 to 1 26 indicated that the larger radius of pb2 0 119 nm was more difficult to displace by isomorphic substitution 38 the release value of mg2 was calculated to be 8 29 mg g for gl and 7 46 mg g for fe3o4 gl respectively as shown in fig 7 the isoelectric point increased from 10 2 to 11 3 for gl and 10 3 to 11 2 for fe3o4 gl respectively in conclusion the main mechanisms of cu2 cd2 and pb2 adsorption by gl and fe3o4 gl were ascribed to i surface complexion between functional groups and heavy metals ii precipitation of metal hydroxides or metal carbon oxides iii isomorphic substitution of heavy metal cations by replacing the mg2 in the layer of ldhs 3 5 environmental applications the adsorption abilities of gl and fe3o4 gl for the three heavy metal ions were higher than that of ldh the removal efficiency was also less influenced by the initial solution ph moreover the sorption amounts of gl and fe3o4 gl were similar or superior to those of other adsorbents table 3 therefore the excellent removal behavior and rapid solid liquid separation demonstrated that gl and fe3o4 gl were effective materials for the removal of toxic metal ions from wastewater to further verify its practical application in a complex environment adsorptive recycling of the adsorbent and its application in simulated wastewater were performed edta 2na was used as the elution agent for coordination with heavy metals and regeneration of the adsorbent after four cycles the adsorptive abilities of gl and fe3o4 gl decreased slightly fig 7a and b due to the gradual reduction in adsorption sites and loss of adsorbents the desorption kinetics of the adsorbents were also examined during the desorption process the pseudo first order eq s9 and pseudo second order eq s10 models were adopted to fit the desorption data for the fourth cycle the desorption kinetic data were better fitted by the pseudo second order rate equation r 2 0 999 than the pseudo first order equation fig s6 and table s3 demonstrating that the rate controlling step in desorption is a chemical process the adsorption capacity for heavy metals was also tested in distilled water surface water from the yellow river seawater tap water synthetic surface water and underground water fig 8c and d for low concentrations of heavy metal ions in a real water environment the water samples were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of heavy metals as described by manos and kanatzidis 48 for gl and fe3o4 gl the removal amounts of cu2 cd2 and pb2 were higher than that of distilled water whereas they decreased in seawater a high salt concentration affects the physical and surface properties of adsorbents some organic compounds such as small molecule acids usually exist in real water systems and are easily complexed with heavy metals other background electrolytes ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 did not decrease the adsorption process these results indicate that both gl and fe3o4 gl exhibit good removal performance for simulated real water samples compared to gl the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 gl for heavy metal ions was slightly reduced however fe3o4 gl containing fe3o4 nanoparticles could easily and quickly achieve solid liquid separation reduce secondary pollution and increase the practicability of the adsorptive material consequently the magnetic nanoadsorbent of fe3o4 gl has broad application prospects in water remediation 4 conclusion in this study gl and fe3o4 gl were synthesized by a facile co precipitation method and characterized by xrd ftir sem tem and xps techniques the xrd and high resolution tem results showed that ldhs were uniformly loaded on the surface of the go nanosheets and spherical fe3o4 particles were present in fe3o4 gl both gl and fe3o4 gl exhibited enhanced adsorption performance for cu2 cd2 and pb2 compared to pristine ldh which mainly contributed to the abundant functional groups of go and the good dispersion performance of the composites the adsorption capacity remained unchanged under neutral and weakly acidic conditions the experimental data fit well with a pseudo second order kinetic equation implying that the rate limiting step was chemisorption during the overall adsorption process the adsorption isotherm data were in good agreement with the freundlich model for cu2 and cd2 and the langmuir model for pb2 the maximum adsorption capacity of gl was 89 26 mg g for cu2 76 67 mg g for cd2 226 98 mg g for pb2 and that of fe3o4 gl was 80 72 mg g for cu2 70 26 mg g for cd2 and 213 96 mg g for pb2 the adsorption mechanisms were studied by xrd xps and zeta potential in detail including surface complexation precipitation and isomorphic substitution moreover the excellent magnetic properties of fe3o4 gl endowed it with facile solid liquid separation and simplified the adsorption post treatment process declaration of competing

12923,devising effective measures for removing heavy metals from water has become a serious concern in this study mgal layered double hydroxide nanosheets were assembled on graphene oxide gl and its magnetic product fe3o4 gl as excellent adsorbents for cu2 cd2 and pb2 and were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method the morphology and surface chemical properties were observed to establish the construct activity relationships the characterization results showed that the adsorbents combined rich functional groups with large specific surface areas the effective removal of heavy metals by gl and fe3o4 gl was achieved under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the pseudo second order kinetic equation described the experimental results well and the equilibrium data were in good agreement with the freundlich model for cu2 and cd2 and the langmuir model for pb2 the maximum adsorption capacity of gl cu2 89 26 mg g cd2 76 67 mg g pb2 226 98 mg g was slightly larger than that of fe3o4 gl cu2 80 72 mg g cd2 70 26 mg g pb2 213 96 mg g the main mechanisms include the surface complexation of hydroxyl groups precipitation reactions of metal hydroxides and metal carbonates and isomorphic substitution of divalent metal cations thus the enhanced adsorption capacity and mechanistic study provide new insights into the environmental remediation of heavy metals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide synergistic effect heavy metal adsorption behavior mechanistic study 1 introduction unreasonable discharge of heavy metal wastewater has become a serious environmental threat 1 2 copper cu cadmium cd and lead pb are commonly detected in industrial wastewater and cause ecosystem problems 3 various nanomaterials have been developed and applied for the removal of heavy metals such as graphene family nanomaterials gfns metal oxides clay minerals and polymerides 4 6 gfns are a topic of great concern in multidisciplinary areas because of their extraordinary physicochemical properties 5 7 owing to their large theoretical surface area abundant functional groups and good dispersibility gfns are more attractive than other carbon based nanomaterials 8 9 in particular graphene oxide go has great potential for wastewater treatment because it possesses abundant oxygen containing functional groups e g oh o cooh and co 1 2 9 thus go can be easily functionalized and hybridized with other nanomaterials and is endowed with remarkable features for excellent removal of pollutants 3 10 11 unfortunately there are some obstacles in the direct application of go as an attractive adsorbent 7 9 go tends to aggregate because of van der waals interactions between neighboring sheets which eventually reduces the available surface area and consequently reduces the number of active adsorption sites 4 7 go is strongly hydrophilic and can be easily dispersed in aqueous solutions making it difficult to recover from aquatic environments and even causing significant cytotoxicity to human health 3 8 12 in addition the complexity of the preparation process and the high cost limit its widespread use in environmental remediation to improve its widespread application in heavy metal remediation various studies have been conducted to solve the aggregation problem and increase the coordination between go and heavy metals 2 3 12 14 for example a sio2 graphene composite was prepared by a two step reaction and was considered to be a highly selective adsorbent for pb2 ions 14 guo et al combined the advantages of the functional groups of graphene with the magnetic characteristics of fe3o4 to fabricate a magnetic graphene composite material fe3o4 gs and used it for pb2 hg2 cd2 and ni2 adsorption 3 cui et al presented the adsorption mechanism of pb2 hg2 and cu2 on ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid modified magnetic go 2 wang et al reviewed modification methods for nitrogen containing amino compound functionalized go 13 therefore the go composite not only inherited the advantage of a single component but also showed a synergistic effect layered double hydroxides ldhs which are 2d layered anionic clay minerals possess attractive properties such as adjustable chemical composition reactive surface and low cost 7 15 19 although ldh has been widely used as a promising scavenger of heavy metal ions few studies have been conducted on ldh nanosheets assembled between layers of go to construct a sandwiched structure the special structure not only resolves the problem of agglomeration of go but also improves the adsorption activity of heavy metals by a synergistic effect 9 20 moreover ldh can aggregate with a target nanomaterial i e go forming new minerals secondary minerals to enhance the removal of heavy metals and reduce the toxicity of go in aqueous solutions 7 taking full advantage of go and ldh the go ldh composites would be one of the promising nanomaterials in wastewater remediation 5 21 for example yuan et al synthesized calcined graphene mgal ldh nanocomposites to evaluate their adsorption performance for cr6 9 magnetite graphene ldh composites exhibited a higher adsorption ability for as3 than pure ldh 20 powder composites are difficult to separate from aqueous solutions for environmental applications fe3o4 is a widely used magnetic material in magnetic fluids 2 3 magnetic nanomaterials containing fe3o4 can achieve facile and effective solid liquid separation which will eventually simplify the post treatment process and reduce operating costs 22 23 moreover the excellent magnetic recycling performance of nanomaterials can prevent adsorbents from flowing away and increase their reusability 24 26 herein based on the advantages e g rich functional groups and large surface area of go effective dispersion and abundant adsorption sites of ldh and magnetic performance of fe3o4 we successfully synthesized go ldh gl and magnetic fe3o4 go ldh fe3o4 gl through a facile cooperation method and applied them to adsorb cu2 cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solutions the objectives of this study were 1 to study the adsorption performance of gl and fe3o4 gl including the effects of adsorption conditions kinetics and isotherms 2 to investigate the adsorption mechanism using characteristic techniques x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem transmission electron microscopy tem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and zeta potential and 3 to evaluate the regeneration and practical application of gl and fe3o4 gl 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all analytical grade agents were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent beijing co ltd graphite powder was obtained from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd hcl 37 h2so4 98 hydrogen peroxide 30 ethylenediamine and ethylene were supplied by tianjin fuyu fine chemical co ltd deionized water was used throughout the experimental process 2 2 preparation of adsorbents 2 2 1 preparation of go go was prepared from graphite powder using a modified hummers method 26 27 briefly graphite powder 1 0 g was put into 46 ml h2so4 slowly in an ice bath environment and then 1 0 g nano3 was dispersed after that 6 0 g kmno4 was slowly added to the mixture under magnetic stirring for 120 min the homogeneous mixture was then transferred to an oil bath at 35 c for another 120 min deionized water 46 ml was subsequently added and purple smoke appeared immediately finally with magnetic stirring for 15 min at 98 c 100 ml of deionized water and 20 ml of hydrogen peroxide were quickly added and the color changed from reddish brown to bright yellow the remaining solution was washed with 5 hcl and deionized water the prepared go was dried in a vacuum freeze dryer 2 2 2 preparation of fe3o4 fe3o4 was synthesized as described in our previous study 25 28 fecl3 6h2o 2 00 g and naac 6 00 g were dispersed in 40 ml of glycol to form a transparent solution and then 20 ml of anhydrous ethylenediamine was added under magnetic stirring for 30 min the mixture was then transferred to a teflon lined autoclave and allowed to react at 200 c for 8 h the black sample was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 2 3 preparation of go ldh gl gl was synthesized using a facile co precipitation method go 0 05 g and 0 2 g citric acid ca were dispersed in 100 ml of deionized water under ultrasonic treatment the uniform solution was then transferred to a five neck flask at 60 c next the alkali solution 1 28 g naoh 1 06 g na2co3 as well as salt solution 2 56 g mg no3 2 6h2o 1 87 g al no3 3 9h2o were added simultaneously the ph of the solution was maintained at approximately 10 when the reaction was complete the precipitate was vigorously stirred for another 4 h the precipitate was washed repeatedly with deionized water and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 2 4 preparation of fe3o4 go ldh fe3o4 gl fe3o4 gl was also synthesized using the co precipitation method typically 0 39 g fe3o4 was dispersed in 20 ml deionized water and then 100 ml mixed solution 0 05 g go 0 2 g ca was added to the above solution under continuous stirring the remaining steps of ldh assembly on go were the same as in section 2 2 3 the obtained black product was denoted as fe3o4 gl 2 3 characterization methods the phase constitution of the adsorbents was analyzed using a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer bruker germany at 40 kv and 40 ma with cu kα radiation functional groups were characterized using a vertex 70 ftir spectrometer bruker germany the morphology and microstructure were examined using sem s570 hitachi japan and tem fei corporation united states the chemical composition and state of the samples were recorded using xps thermo united states the surface area and pore volume were monitored using a surface area and porosity analyzer asap 2460 micromeritics united states magnetization was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm 7410 lake shore united states the zeta potential of the adsorbent suspensions was determined using a nano zs90 zetasizer analyzer malvern united kingdom 2 4 batch adsorption procedure to evaluate the removal abilities of gl and fe3o4 gl adsorption experiments were carried out simultaneously the batch adsorption study was conducted by mixing the adsorbent with 20 ml of pb2 cd2 and cu2 in a 50 ml centrifuge tube the centrifuge tube was then placed in an oscillation box at a speed of 200 rpm after centrifugation a flame atomic absorption spectrometer aa 7000 shimadzu japan was used to monitor the residual concentrations of cu2 at 324 8 nm cd2 at 228 8 nm and pb2 at 283 3 nm the removal rate and adsorption capacity were calculated as the differences between the initial and equilibrium concentrations the adsorbent was regenerated by continuous adsorption desorption tests and 0 005 mol l edta 2na was selected as the eluent after adsorption and filtration 20 ml of eluent was added to the centrifuge tube and shaken at a speed of 200 rpm for 240 min the regenerated adsorbent was obtained from the mixture washed to neutral ph with di water dried at 60 c and used in the next adsorption desorption test cycle to further verify the environmental application simulated wastewater remediation using gl and fe3o4 gl was also carried out detailed ion compositions of the simulated surface water and groundwater are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results the morphologies and microstructures of gl and fe3o4 gl are shown in fig 1 compared with gl fe3o4 gl had a rougher surface and stronger granular sense on the surface fig 1a and b the ldhs were evenly loaded onto the flakes of the go sheets fig 1c fe3o4 was distributed on the large gl surface fig 1d tem results indicated that the go composites exhibited better dispersion characteristics after treatment with ldh the interplanar spacing of 0 261 nm was in good agreement with the 012 lattice plane of the ldh fig 1e in addition fe3o4 gl displayed perfect crystallinity fig 1f the lattice spacings were 0 205 0 248 and 0 264 nm which correspond to the 400 and 311 planes of fe3o4 and the 012 plane of the ldh respectively the xrd patterns of gl and fe3o4 gl are shown in fig 2a the characteristic xrd peaks of 003 006 012 015 018 110 and 113 were ascribed to ldh nanosheets pdf 89 0460 27 29 the main gl peaks fit well with those of ldh however the characteristic diffraction peak of 002 of go was not present in gl and may have been shielded by the 003 ldh peak 26 according to the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 gl the peaks of 003 006 and 012 were attributed to ldh whereas those of 220 311 400 511 and 440 were in agreement with fe3o4 pdf 89 0691 and no other extra peaks appeared in fe3o4 gl consequently gl and fe3o4 gl were composites of go ldh and fe3o4 the formation of new bonds destroyed the layered crystal structure of ldh during synthesis weakening some characteristic peaks such as 015 018 110 and 113 30 the ftir spectra of gl and fe3o4 gl are shown in fig 2b the characteristic spectrum of go was located at 3340 cm 1 oh 1718 cm 1 co in the carboxyl group 1613 cm 1 cc 1393 cm 1 coh and 1042 cm 1 alkoxy co 12 31 32 which proved that go had abundant oxygen containing groups the stretching vibration bands of ldh appeared at 3404 cm 1 oh 1355 cm 1 co 668 cm 1 mo and 557 cm 1 mom 26 27 notably the gl composite spectra were similar to those of ldh and go compared with pristine go the infrared peak intensity at 1718 cm 1 co in the carboxyl group and 1042 cm 1 alkoxy co in gl was weakened or disappeared suggesting that the deoxidation reaction of the surface functional groups of go may occur during the synthesis process resulting in the reduction of go to rgo moreover a peak at 553 cm 1 was observed which was attributed to the feo lattice vibration of fe3o4 gl 24 26 as presented in fig 2c mg al o and c appeared in the survey spectra of gl and fe3o4 gl and fe 2p was clearly exhibited in fe3o4 gl compared with gl the peaks in the fe 2p spectra could be divided into fe 2p1 2 724 8 ev and fe 2p3 2 710 1 ev indicating the presence of fe3o4 in fe3o4 gl fig 2d to confirm the presence of go in gl and fe3o4 gl the hr xps spectra of c 1s were analyzed fig s1a and b the c 1s could be divided into four carbon peaks and the be value was 284 7 ev for cc 285 6 ev for co 286 6 ev for coc and 289 1 ev for oco the n2 adsorption desorption isothermal curves and pore parameters of ldh gl and fe3o4 gl are illustrated in fig s2a and table s2 the specific surface area of gl 114 2 m2 g and fe3o4 gl 82 31 m2 g was improved over ldh 48 64 m2 g by the incorporation of go fig s2b shows the vsm curves of fe3o4 gl and fe3o4 the magnetization of fe3o4 gl was slightly lower than that of fe3o4 indicating that fe3o4 gl could be easily and rapidly separated from the suspension under an applied magnetic field 3 2 effects of experimental conditions on adsorption behavior although go has good physical and chemical properties some obstacles limit its widespread use for heavy metal removal such as easy aggregation difficulty in recovery complexity of preparation and cytotoxicity to human health the modified gl and fe3o4 gl solutions resolved these problems therefore ldh gl and fe3o4 gl were used in the adsorption experiments as the dosage increased from 0 01 g to 0 15 g in 20 ml solution the adsorption efficiency gradually increased and reached an equilibrium state fig 3a c compared to the pristine ldh gl and fe3o4 gl exhibited an obviously higher removal efficiency this may have resulted from the larger specific surface area and more oxygen containing functional groups e g oh co and cooh of the gl and fe3o4 gl composites these features would provide more adsorption sites and facilitate the formation of coordination bonds with heavy metals compared to ldh notably the adsorption capacity of gl was slightly higher than that of fe3o4 gl this result proved that fe3o4 occupied some of the active adsorption sites of gl to ensure good adsorption efficiency 0 05 g gl and fe3o4 gl were selected as the optimal dosages in the following experiments based on the metal ion distribution at different solution ph values the metal species mainly include m2 moh and m oh 2 16 according to the k sp of cu2 cd2 and pb2 a higher ph could cause metal hydroxide formation fig s3 therefore the initial solution ph was set to different ranges cu2 ph 2 6 cd2 ph 2 8 5 pb2 ph 2 6 the effect of the solution ph on adsorption by gl and fe3o4 gl is shown in fig 3d e under strongly acidic conditions abundant h is adsorbed on the layer to form a positive charge which could cause electrostatic repulsion with heavy metal ions 33 thus the adsorption capacities of gl and fe3o4 gl are lower at ph 3 with an increase in ph the decrease in h3o ions and the deprotonation of functional groups could benefit the adsorption process moreover the equilibrium ph values were higher than the initial values after adsorption fig s4a c this phenomenon is caused by the accumulation of basic cations by adsorbents 16 because the initial ph values of the cu2 cd2 and pb2 solutions were all approximately 6 such adsorption conditions over a wide ph range are beneficial for practical environmental remediation the influence of contact time ranging from 5 to 480 min was investigated for the gl and fe3o4 gl composites fig 3f with the increase in contact time the adsorption capacity of gl for cu2 cd2 and pb2 significantly increased in the first 30 min and then tended to reach an equilibrium state at 240 min the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 gl was slightly lower than that of gl and the adsorption trend was similar to that of gl the optional contact time was set to 240 min 3 3 adsorption kinetics and isotherms kinetic equations were used to analyze the adsorption behavior and rate controlling steps in the overall adsorption process 34 the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion equations eqs s1 s4 were used to fit the experimental data the calculated parameters and linear fit of the pseudo second order kinetic equation are listed in table 1 and fig 4a b because the r 2 value of the pseudo second order equation was approximately 0 99 the adsorption of cu2 cd2 and pb2 on gl and fe3o4 gl followed the pseudo second order equation well the experimental adsorption capacities q e exp were very close to the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities q e cal of the pseudo second order equation that is the differences δq t were lower than those of the pseudo first order equation the error function eq s5 was used to prove the feasibility of the kinetic models 16 and a comparatively lower relative error χ 0 04 0 22 was obtained from the pseudo second order equation the excellent fitting of the pseudo second order model was similar to previous reports of heavy metal adsorption such as mos4 2 anion intercalated ldh 29 humate modified ldh 35 nh2 rich polymer go 12 and edta modified magnetic go 2 the diffusion mechanism was elucidated by the intra particle diffusion model and the value of c i was proportional to the thickness of the boundary layer 24 the values of c i in this work were calculated and were not zero table 1 indicating that some other chemical reaction was involved in the adsorption process except diffusion the linear fit of the intraparticle diffusion model included two linear portions fig s5 the first region was caused by rapid surface adsorption which was driven by the high concentration of heavy metals the second region achieved an adsorption equilibrium state based on the above results the rate limiting step is chemisorption during the adsorption process 12 29 36 the adsorption behavior might contain valency forces via electron sharing or transfer between adsorbents and heavy metals and is also mainly attributed to the oxygen containing active groups on the surface of go 2 12 under optimal adsorption conditions adsorption isotherm experiments were performed by changing the initial concentration of heavy metal ions in the solution the widely used langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson isothermal models eqs s6 s8 were used to fit the experimental data the relevant calculated parameters and nonlinearity of the langmuir and freundlich models are shown in table 2 and fig 4c d according to the r 2 values the freundlich model was more appropriate than the langmuir model for cu2 and cd2 adsorption on gl and fe3o4 gl suggesting that the adsorbent surface was heterogeneous and active adsorption sites were unevenly distributed on the surface 16 28 37 however the r 2 values of the langmuir and redlich peterson models for pb2 were higher than those of the freundlich model indicating that homogeneous adsorption occurred during the adsorption process and no interaction took place 16 28 38 the maximum adsorption capacity of gl cu2 89 26 mg g cd2 76 67 mg g pb2 226 98 mg g was higher than that of fe3o4 gl cu2 80 72 mg g cd2 70 26 mg g pb2 213 96 mg g 3 4 adsorption mechanism study to investigate the detailed adsorption mechanisms of gl and fe3o4 gl for cu2 cd2 and pb2 the xrd patterns xps spectra and zeta potentials were analyzed as illustrated in fig 5a and b there was a new characteristic peak of cu oh 2 pdf 72 0140 in gl and fe3o4 gl after cu2 adsorption according to the authentication by the software of mdi jade 6 5 cu 2p was also clearly detected in the wide scan xps spectra of gl and fe3o4 gl with adsorbed cu2 fig 6a and b the characteristic cu 2p peak can be divided into four peaks fig 6c and d of 934 3 943 0 and 954 3 ev for cu 2p3 2 and 962 8 ev for cu 2p1 2 respectively implying the formation of cu hydroxides e g sur oh cu or sur o cu during adsorption 1 39 40 precipitation and surface complexation occurred during cu2 adsorption by gl and fe3o4 gl respectively because the radius of cu2 0 072 nm is closer to that of mg2 0 066 nm isomorphic substitution is more likely to occur in the reaction 40 41 through analyzing the xps spectra the atomic ratio of mg al decreased from 1 56 to 0 68 for gl and from 1 45 to 0 79 for fe3o4 gl respectively simultaneously the release of mg ions into the aqueous solution was detected by flame atomic absorption spectrometry after the heavy metal adsorption process the release value was calculated to be 10 66 mg g for gl and 9 38 mg g for fe3o4 gl these results indicate that isomorphic substitution is involved in the removal of cu2 the surface charge of the adsorbent is a key factor for heavy metal removal 42 the zeta potentials of gl and fe3o4 gl before and after adsorption were monitored at different ph values fig 7a and b after cu2 adsorption the isoelectric point increased from 10 2 to 11 0 for gl and from 10 3 to 10 9 for fe3o4 gl under weakly acidic conditions fig s4a the surface charge of the adsorbents was positive resulting in electrostatic repulsion with heavy metals 16 this phenomenon illustrates that adsorption is less influenced by electrostatic interactions after the adsorption of cd2 the new peaks of gl and fe3o4 gl located at 30 34 36 54 43 68 49 88 and 57 81 were attributed to cdco3 pdf 72 1939 fig 5a and b 25 the complexation of cdco3 was ascribed to the abundant carboxyl functional groups of go the characteristic xps peaks at 405 4 ev cd 3d5 2 and 412 2 ev cd 3d3 2 corresponded to the cadmium hydroxide and carbon oxides indicating the formation of surface complexation between cd2 and deprotonated hydroxyl groups fig 6e and f the same conclusions were drawn by shan et al 25 and cao et al 43 the xps spectra showed that the atomic ratio of mg al decreased from 1 56 to 0 52 for gl and from 1 45 to 0 65 for fe3o4 gl respectively the release value of mg2 was calculated to be 7 34 mg g for gl and 6 91 mg g for fe3o4 gl due to the ionic radius of cd2 0 095 nm being close to mg2 0 073 nm 25 26 38 44 thus isomorphic substitution contributes to the adsorption process for cd2 after cd2 adsorption the isoelectric point increased from 10 2 to 11 1 for gl and from 10 3 to 10 9 for fe3o4 gl respectively fig 7 indicating that the adsorption of cd2 at ph 2 0 8 5 was not dominated by electrostatic interaction after the adsorption of pb2 a series of bright signal spots appeared in the xrd patterns of gl and fe3o4 gl fig 5a and b indicating that pb2 complexes were formed specially the new peaks at 2θ 20 00 20 99 24 75 27 18 34 07 40 43 42 75 44 25 48 90 54 03 and 58 10 were ascribed to the lead carbonate of pb3 co3 2 oh 2 pdf 13 0131 moreover pb 4f5 2 and pb 4f7 2 were located at 143 3 and 138 4 ev respectively fig 6g and h confirming the formation of surface complexations sur oh pb sur o pb or sur coo pb 2 35 the peak at 138 4 ev was between 137 3 ev lead hydroxide and 138 7 ev lead carbon oxides proving the coexistence of hydroxides and carbon oxides in the form of pb3 co3 2 oh 2 35 in the xps analysis the slight decrease in the atomic ratio of mg al after adsorption of pb2 gl 1 56 to 1 21 fe3o4 gl 1 45 to 1 26 indicated that the larger radius of pb2 0 119 nm was more difficult to displace by isomorphic substitution 38 the release value of mg2 was calculated to be 8 29 mg g for gl and 7 46 mg g for fe3o4 gl respectively as shown in fig 7 the isoelectric point increased from 10 2 to 11 3 for gl and 10 3 to 11 2 for fe3o4 gl respectively in conclusion the main mechanisms of cu2 cd2 and pb2 adsorption by gl and fe3o4 gl were ascribed to i surface complexion between functional groups and heavy metals ii precipitation of metal hydroxides or metal carbon oxides iii isomorphic substitution of heavy metal cations by replacing the mg2 in the layer of ldhs 3 5 environmental applications the adsorption abilities of gl and fe3o4 gl for the three heavy metal ions were higher than that of ldh the removal efficiency was also less influenced by the initial solution ph moreover the sorption amounts of gl and fe3o4 gl were similar or superior to those of other adsorbents table 3 therefore the excellent removal behavior and rapid solid liquid separation demonstrated that gl and fe3o4 gl were effective materials for the removal of toxic metal ions from wastewater to further verify its practical application in a complex environment adsorptive recycling of the adsorbent and its application in simulated wastewater were performed edta 2na was used as the elution agent for coordination with heavy metals and regeneration of the adsorbent after four cycles the adsorptive abilities of gl and fe3o4 gl decreased slightly fig 7a and b due to the gradual reduction in adsorption sites and loss of adsorbents the desorption kinetics of the adsorbents were also examined during the desorption process the pseudo first order eq s9 and pseudo second order eq s10 models were adopted to fit the desorption data for the fourth cycle the desorption kinetic data were better fitted by the pseudo second order rate equation r 2 0 999 than the pseudo first order equation fig s6 and table s3 demonstrating that the rate controlling step in desorption is a chemical process the adsorption capacity for heavy metals was also tested in distilled water surface water from the yellow river seawater tap water synthetic surface water and underground water fig 8c and d for low concentrations of heavy metal ions in a real water environment the water samples were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of heavy metals as described by manos and kanatzidis 48 for gl and fe3o4 gl the removal amounts of cu2 cd2 and pb2 were higher than that of distilled water whereas they decreased in seawater a high salt concentration affects the physical and surface properties of adsorbents some organic compounds such as small molecule acids usually exist in real water systems and are easily complexed with heavy metals other background electrolytes ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 did not decrease the adsorption process these results indicate that both gl and fe3o4 gl exhibit good removal performance for simulated real water samples compared to gl the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 gl for heavy metal ions was slightly reduced however fe3o4 gl containing fe3o4 nanoparticles could easily and quickly achieve solid liquid separation reduce secondary pollution and increase the practicability of the adsorptive material consequently the magnetic nanoadsorbent of fe3o4 gl has broad application prospects in water remediation 4 conclusion in this study gl and fe3o4 gl were synthesized by a facile co precipitation method and characterized by xrd ftir sem tem and xps techniques the xrd and high resolution tem results showed that ldhs were uniformly loaded on the surface of the go nanosheets and spherical fe3o4 particles were present in fe3o4 gl both gl and fe3o4 gl exhibited enhanced adsorption performance for cu2 cd2 and pb2 compared to pristine ldh which mainly contributed to the abundant functional groups of go and the good dispersion performance of the composites the adsorption capacity remained unchanged under neutral and weakly acidic conditions the experimental data fit well with a pseudo second order kinetic equation implying that the rate limiting step was chemisorption during the overall adsorption process the adsorption isotherm data were in good agreement with the freundlich model for cu2 and cd2 and the langmuir model for pb2 the maximum adsorption capacity of gl was 89 26 mg g for cu2 76 67 mg g for cd2 226 98 mg g for pb2 and that of fe3o4 gl was 80 72 mg g for cu2 70 26 mg g for cd2 and 213 96 mg g for pb2 the adsorption mechanisms were studied by xrd xps and zeta potential in detail including surface complexation precipitation and isomorphic substitution moreover the excellent magnetic properties of fe3o4 gl endowed it with facile solid liquid separation and simplified the adsorption post treatment process declaration of competing

12924,photocatalysis suffers two major drawbacks namely the separation of the photocatalyst from treated water and the utilisation of expensive uv light this has limited its application on an industrial scale a novel nanocomposite of cusm0 06fe1 94o4 g c3n4 with exceptional magnetic electrochemical and optical properties was synthesised using the hydrothermal method the ratio of cusm0 06fe1 94o4 and g c3n4 was optimised sm cfgnc 3 3 1 was found to exhibit the highest photodegradation efficiency of 95 7 towards methyl orange mo in 90 min at ph 3 5 using visible light in addition 90 1 degradation of mo was observed in the scaled up experiment while high mo degradation efficiencies were also obtained for the spiked raw water from the rand water treatment plant 83 4 and hazelmere treatment plant 76 6 furthermore good removal efficiencies were obtained during the photodegradation of dyes congo red tartrazine metanil yellow and pharmaceuticals carbamazepine zidovudine acetaminophen the influence of various reaction parameters such as catalyst amount ph dye concentration oxidant effect trapping experiments catalyst reusability and reaction mechanism were investigated lastly the reusability study showed a minimal loss in photocatalytic performance after 4 cycles and the nanocomposite was easily separated from the treated water using a magnet thus the synthesised nanocomposite is a potential candidate for the application of photocatalysis at an industrial scale graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite photodegradation pharmaceuticals dyes raw water mixed dyes visible light 1 introduction the desire to sustain a pollution free environment with clean water bodies has come under threat due to the large waste discharged by industries 1 a significant amount of this waste consists of dyes which are the major source of water pollution these dyes are used mainly as colourants in various industrial applications such as foodstuffs textiles laser materials laser printing cosmetics papers additives and xerography 2 4 unfortunately during the manufacturing process about 12 of these dyes are lost and they find their way into our water systems 2 5 6 amid the classes of dyes the azo dyes cause great concern due to their non degradable nature caused by the presence of stable azo group nn and aromatic groups in the structure which contribute to the colouring of the water this study focuses on carcinogenic azo dye methyl orange mo as a model reaction while other dyes namely congo red cr tartrazine tz and metanil yellow my were also explored 3 7 8 the carcinogenic effect aromatic structure and metals present in their structure pose health concerns to human beings and aquatic animals 9 11 besides dyes pharmaceuticals are emerging water pollutants of concern because of the difficulty in removing them during water treatment and the lack of regulations regarding their permissible concentrations in drinking water 12 14 to relieve pain caused by different afflictions human beings use a variety of prescribed pharmaceutical drugs 12 15 unfortunately the bodily systems do not fully break down these pharmaceuticals hence 10 to 90 of the initial dose is excreted while the rest is defaecated as metabolites and or conjugated forms back into the water systems 16 in addition the direct discharge of unused pharmaceuticals from households and expired drugs from industry contributes to water pollution 15 in this work pharmaceuticals namely carbamazepine cb zidovudine zd and acetaminophen am were explored even at low concentrations drinking water contaminated with these drugs causes drug resistance and long term irreversible changes to the genomes of microorganisms 13 17 18 some of these pharmaceuticals have an endocrine disrupting effect and toxicity that cause death in human beings and aquatic animals 12 19 20 to eliminate these contaminants from the water systems different methods such as physicochemical adsorption ozonation chemical oxidation enzymatic decomposition electrochemical degradation and photocatalysis have been employed 1 19 21 23 each of the methods stated above has its advantages and disadvantages with regards to the mentioned method photocatalysis is the most promising and efficient technique for the complete elimination of azo dyes and pharmaceuticals as it mineralises them to carbon dioxide and water in a short period using reactive radical species various photocatalysts have been used in the photodegradation of pharmaceutical and azo dyes however the majority of these photocatalysts are in powder form and this presents a separation challenge following photocatalysis 24 26 in addition fast electron hole recombination which reduces photocatalytic performance and utilisation of expensive uv light has limited the application of these photocatalysts on an industrial scale 27 28 thus to move photocatalysis from bench scale to pilot and industrial scale it is vital to develop an efficient magnetic visible light driven photocatalyst that addresses the separation cost and performance challenges 24 in this work a nanocomposite of samarium doped copper ferrite coated with graphitic carbon nitride cusm0 06fe1 94o4 g c3n4 was constructed through an optimised process the magnetic cusm0 06fe1 94o4 sm cf will enable the nanocomposite to be easily separated from treated water using an external magnetic field in addition to the magnetic property sm cf has other desirable properties such as good photochemical stability strong and wide visible light response the small bandgap energy 1 50 1 60 ev 29 furthermore the as synthesised sm cf can easily form a good synergy with other materials and has shown good photocatalytic performance when applied in photodegradation 24 29 30 irrespective of these numerous good properties sm cf has poor adsorption capacity and suffers from high electron hole recombination due to its small bandgap 24 31 32 to address these challenges an n semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 with a bandgap of about 2 7 ev was incorporated on the surface of sm cf via a heterojunction 33 in recent years g c3n4 has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts that possess good properties such as high chemical stability non toxicity simple preparation and good adsorption capacity 34 36 thus the synthesised nanocomposite is expected to improve the shortcomings of both materials through the synergy that is formed by the heterojunctions previous formed heterojunctions such as cufe2o4 cuo 37 cufe2o4 ceo2 38 cufe2o4 tio2 39 cufe2o4 agbr 30 cufe2o4 g c3n4 31 cofe2o4 c3n4 40 cufe2o4 g c3n4 32 coo cufe2o4 41 and cufe2o4 g c3n4 42 have managed to significantly improve the separation of the photogenerated electrons while it has been noted that the copper ferrite high saturation magnetisation is greatly reduced upon coupling with g c3n4 which has a negative effect on the separation efficiency and recovery of the photocatalyst 43 44 to fabricate this novel cusm0 06fe1 94o4 g c3n4 nanocomposite sm cfgnc that possesses both effective charge separation of photogenerated electrons holes while retaining high saturation magnetisation the optimal synthesis conditions found in our previous studies for each component were employed 29 36 in this study much emphasis was placed on finding the optimal coating ratio between sm cf and g c3n4 that improves the photocatalytic properties of these materials in addition the physical and chemical interactions involved between these two semiconductors were investigated the synthesised nanocomposite was eventually evaluated for its photocatalysis performance using mo the influence of various reaction parameters such as catalyst amount ph dye concentration oxidant effect trapping experiments catalyst reusability and reaction mechanism was investigated the impact of scaling up the reaction and the effect of multiple contaminants present in raw water were examined lastly the best performing nanocomposite was applied to a variety of organic pollutants namely my cr tz cb zd and am to evaluate the removal efficiencies 2 experimental details 2 1 chemicals used all the chemicals that were used in this study were acquired from sigma aldrich south africa samarium iii chloride

sampling intervals were expanded to 15 min from 30 to 90 min before the analysis with a uv vis spectrophotometer the sampled aliquots were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter for experiments namely the influence of ph mo dye concentration scavengers amount of catalyst mixed dyes raw water and recycle tests sm cfgnc 3 was used as a photocatalyst while other parameters were only changed when they were investigated to investigate the impact of scavenges on mo degradation 15 ml of 5 mm benzoquinone isopropanol and edta was added to 120 ml of dye solution and the same procedure was followed for the subsequent experiments for ph studies 1 m of naoh and hcl was used to adjust the ph the reusability studies were carried out under the same reaction conditions for 4 cycles with the

indexed 100 and 002 shown in red colour confirm the formation of g c3n4 36 the 002 plane is attributed to the interplanar stacking of the conjugated aromatics whereas the 100 plane is credited to the periodic array of in plane tri s triazine 32 48 49 while the braggs reflection peaks indexed 111 220 200 400 311 222 400 440 422 511 and 440 shown in black colour signify the presence of sm cf 29 50 the coexistence of both phases of g c3n4 and sm cf in the p xrd patterns of sm cfgncs confirms the successful coating of g c3n4 onto the surface of sm cf in addition the main diffraction peak 002 of g c3n4 was zoomed as shown in fig s1a and it was observed that the peak shifted slightly from 27 8 to 28 2 c this observed slight shift is attributed to the formed synergy in the sm cfgncs through the transfer of electrons from the nitrogen triple bonds of g c3n4 to the empty d and f orbitals of sm cf 32 also the peak intensity of the 002 plane of g c3n4 was found to decrease with an increase in the weight ratio of sm cf due to the importance of the photocatalyst surface area in photocatalysis n2 sorption experiment was conducted and adsorption desorption isotherms are presented in figs 1b and s1c the observed isotherms are classified as type iv isotherms with an h3 hysteresis loop according to the brunauer deming deming teller bddt classification which shows that the produced sm cfgncs are mesoporous 51 52 in addition the obtained pore size of sm cfgncs was in the range of 3 06 3 41 nm which confirms the mesoporous nature of synthesised materials except for the sm cfgnc 0 5 which has a pore size of 1 76 nm which informs us of the formation of micropores the obtained bet surface area bjh pore volume and bjh pore sizes of the synthesised materials are presented in table 1 the g c3n4 was found to have a bet surface area of 44 89 m2 g however its surface area decreased greatly upon immobilisation of sm cf which can be ascribed to the filling of g c3n4 pores by sm cf which is supported by the observed decrease in pore volume 53 thus the observed decrease in the surface area confirms the successful in cooperation of sm cf on the surface of g c3n4 53 the bet surface area of sm cfgncs was found to be between 3 76 and 7 55 m2 g while they have very small pore volumes which are in the range of 0 039 to 0 095 cm3 g as compared to g c3n4 0 244 cm3 g the challenge of separating the photocatalyst from treated water after photocatalysis is well known hence in this study the magnetic properties of produced sm cfgncs were studied the saturation magnetisation ms coercivity hc and remanent magnetization mr were estimated from the magnet hysteresis loops shown in fig 1 c and d and the observed properties are presented in table 1 the ms of sm cf was found to decrease from 52 6 emu g to 17 7 emu g and 10 6 emu g for sm cfgnc 3 and sm cfgnc 2 respectively the observed decrease is attributed to the presence of a nonmagnetic carbon component which dilutes the magnetic property and causes a disturbance on the surface spins of sm cf 29 42 54 the hc was found to increase from 58 5 to 107 8 oe due to an increase in the amount of g c3n4 whereas the mr decreased from 6 13 to 2 66 emu g imperatively the mr ms ratio was found to be in the range between 0 117 and 0 262 which is less than 0 5 thus the fabricated sm cfgncs show uniaxial anisotropy instead of cubic anisotropy 55 56 3 2 chemical composition and stability the ftir spectra of g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs are presented in fig 2a and their zoomed spectra in fig 2b the vibration band seen at 582 cm 1 can be ascribed to the tetrahedral metal oxygen molecular bonding of sm cf 29 57 in addition the vibration band intensity at 582 cm 1 was observed to increase with an increase in sm cf content in the sm cfgnc the fingerprint vibration bands 812 1402 cm 1 of g c3n4 were observed in all sm cfgncs the breathing mode of triazine units of g c3n4 is signified by the vibration band seen at 812 cm 1 36 58 whereas those vibration bands seen between 886 and 1402 cm 1 can be ascribed to the cn heterocyclic ring including vibrations of bridging cnhc units and trigonal cn c c 58 59 the vibrations visible at 1654 and 3385 cm 1 are credited to the adsorbed carbon dioxide and water molecules from the atmosphere respectively 51 57 60 the thermal stability of fabricated g c3n4 and sm cfgncs was investigated and their tga profiles are presented in fig 2c in all samples 2 major weight losses were observed at around 70 130 c and 545 700 c which are credited to loss of absorbed water molecules and g c3n4 decomposition to gaseous products respectively 40 the tga profiles also show that pure g c3n4 has higher thermal stability compared to sm cfgncs as highlighted by its decomposition commencement taking place at a slightly higher temperature the lower thermal stability of sm cfgncs can be ascribed to the weakened cross linkage rings of g c3n4 caused by the incorporation of sm cf on the surface 40 42 lastly the observed final weight loss for sm cfgncs agreed with the feed ratio 3 3 photoelectrochemical and optical properties fig 3a shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs sm cf exhibited strong and wide absorption in the visible light region 360 800 nm which is ascribed to the excitation of electrons from the valence band of the o 2p level to the conduction band of the fe 3d level and sm 4f level 29 40 while the g c3n4 and sm cfgnc showed two major absorption peaks at around 275 and 385 nm these absorption peaks are attributed to the π π and n π electronic transitions from the valence band populated by n 2p orbitals to the conduction band populated by c 2p orbitals 36 42 61 the sm cfgncs showed an enhanced absorption intensity and a broader absorption edge compared to g c3n4 hence the sm cfgncs are better equipped to harvest more visible light than g c3n4 which might improve their photocatalytic performance tauc plots of αhν 2 against photon energy hν were plotted as shown in fig 3b and were used to estimate the bandgap energies through extrapolation fig s2 eq 2 was used to describe the tauc plots whereby α ν k h and eg are the adsorption coefficient incident light energy proportionality constant planck constant and bandgap respectively 2 αhν k hv e g n 2 for all synthesised materials the optical transition of n 1 was considered as the absorption was deemed to be direct 51 62 the bandgap energy of sm cf and g c3n4 was found to be 1 61 and 2 63 ev respectively whereas the bandgap energies of sm cfgncs were found to be between those of sm cf and g c3n4 table 1 eqs 3 and 4 were used to estimate the conduction band potential ecb and valence band potential evb of sm cf and g c3n4 respectively 3 e cb x e e 0 5 e g 4 e vb e cb e g the free electron energy ee on the hydrogen scale was considered to be approximately 4 5 ev 40 the absolute electronegativity x of 4 ev and 4 72 ev were used for sm cf and g c3n4 respectively 29 40 63 lastly the band edge potentials of sm cfgncs could not be accurately calculated due to the difference in absolute electronegativity of sm cf and g c3n4 hence not reported to gain more insight into the ability of synthesised sm cfgncs to effectively prevent photo recombination of generated electrons and holes pl was employed and its spectra are displayed in fig 2d the low emission peak intensity of the pl spectra signifies the higher probability of the material being able to effectively separate the photoinduced electrons and holes 32 58 thus it was observed in fig 2d that sm cfgnc 3 exhibited the weakest intensity compared to other fabricated materials the effective charge separation of fabricated materials was found to be in the decreasing order of sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 g c3n4 this effective charge separation in sm cfgncs may be attributed to the synergy formed by sm cf and g c3n4 which allows electrons in the more negative cb of sm cf 1 305 ev to diffuse into the cb of g c3n4 1 10 ev while at the vb the photogenerated holes diffuse from the most positive g c3n4 1 53 ev to the vb of sm cf 0 305 ev 32 to further confirm the pl analysis results the sm cfgncs were characterised using cv and eis from the cyclic voltammogram presented in fig 3c sm cfgncs have shown the most enhanced anodic peak which was also shifted to the negative potential compared to synthesised materials this proved that there is a faster transfer of electrons on the surface of the material 64 66 thus fast electron transfer of synthesised materials was found to be in the decreasing order of sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 sm cf the eis nyquist plots of fabricated sm cfgncs are displayed in figs 3d and s1b the arc radius of eis nyquist plots is used to estimate the charge transfer resistance of the material at the surface thus the smaller the arc radius the lower the charge transfer resistance 32 58 the zoomed eis nyquist plots presented in fig s1b showed that sm cfgn 3 has the smallest charge transfer resistance comparable to other synthesised materials hence it demonstrates effective charge transfer capacities the charge transfer resistance was found to be 154 5 ώ 251 8 ώ 1613 8 ώ 2160 4 ώ 3641 3 ώ and 3806 6 ώ for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 and sm cf respectively these results corroborate with the results observed on cv and pl in a nutshell producing sm cfgnc with high charge transfer and low recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is of great importance for photocatalytic applications 3 4 surface morphology and microstructure the sem images of the g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs are presented in fig 4 the g c3n4 had well defined exfoliated sheets with a proper lamellar structure whereas the sm cf had an irregular surface morphological structure that resembled a quasi cubic in shape and was made up of small blocks and flakes whereas the sm cfgnc showed that the flakes and blocks of sm cf were intertwined into the exfoliated sheets of g c3n4 to form a hybrid structure the formed hybrid is validated by the observed encapsulation of sm cf nanoparticles by g c3n4 to form an intimate heterojunction on the tem images fig 5e and f the tem image of g c3n4 and sm cf which are shown in fig 5 a d confirms that both particles are in the nanoparticle range in size to confirm the purity of the fabricated materials edx was employed and the observed spectra are displayed in fig s3 for sm cfgncs only sm fe cu c n and o peaks were observed while for g c3n4 only c and n peaks were observed the sm cf showed only sm fe cu and o peaks thus the eds analysis results confirm the high purity of the synthesised materials 4 photodegradation experiments 4 1 photodegradation of mo using different catalysts the photocatalytic efficiency of g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs of different ratios was explored by monitoring the photodegradation of mo under visible light irradiation and their degradation profiles are presented in fig 6a whereas their uv spectra are shown in fig s4 the mo concentration in water was observed to decrease with an increase in reaction time 0 90 min for all catalysts to examine the role of direct photolysis mo was exposed to visible light in the absence of the photocatalyst and ammonium persulphate aps the mo was observed to be stable in the presence of visible light as no detectable degradation was observed fig 6a in this experiment aps was added to mo and exposed to visible light in the absence of the photocatalyst and a 66 1 mo degradation was observed in 90 min this is ascribed to the activation of aps by visible light to produce highly reactive sulphate radicals that aid in mo degradation 67 when sm cfgnc 3a was used in mo photodegradation in the absence of aps 45 degradation was achieved after combining the catalysts with aps higher photodegradation efficiencies and rate constants were witnessed as presented in table s1 the sm cfgnc 3 was found to be the best photocatalyst amongst the synthesised material as it showed the highest mo degradation of 88 3 within 90 min this enhanced photocatalytic activity of sm cfgnc 3 compared to other nanocomposites is attributed to the reduced recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which shows that the synergy between these two materials was optimal for the efficient movement of electrons and holes 40 58 in addition these observed results agree with the findings obtained from the pl cv and eis studies where sm cfgnc 3 showed effective charge separation faster electron transfer and lower charge transfer resistance compared to other catalysts respectively the photocatalytic activities for catalysts were found in the decreasing order of 88 3 86 3 84 8 84 6 83 6 76 1 and 60 4 for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 g c3n4 sm cfgnc 0 3 and sm cf after 90 min visible light irradiation respectively the higher mo degradation efficiency of 83 6 within 90 min observed for pure g c3n4 can be attributed to its relatively higher surface area of 44 89 m2 g compared to those of sm cfgncs even though its pl spectra showed a higher chance of recombination of holes and electrons which predicts it to have lower photocatalytic performance the lower mo degradation efficiency found for sm cf may be attributed to its smaller band gap which permits high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which is validated by cv and eis results to have an appreciation on the reaction kinetics of synthesised catalysts on photodegradation of mo a pseudo first order model was employed using the kinetic equation of ln c0 c kt and the degradation kinetic curves are shown in fig 6b 68 accordingly the rate constants were found to be 0 02052 min 1 0 01877 min 1 0 01739 min 1 0 01735 min 1 0 01240 min 1 0 00834 min 1 0 01647 min 1 0 00554 min 1 and 0 00987 min 1 for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 sm cf g c3n4 sm cfgnc 3a and aps respectively 4 2 impact of dye concentration ph and amount of aps added on the photodegradation of mo the effect of the initial mo concentration on the degradation efficacy of the photocatalyst was investigated and the degradation profiles are shown in fig 6c while its uv spectra are presented in fig s5 the removal efficiency of mo was found to decrease from 93 8 to 82 1 with an increase in mo concentration from 5 to 20 ppm bearing in mind that the amount of catalyst and aps was kept constant the observed decrease can be ascribed to the occupation of more active sites on the surface of the photocatalyst by added mo which results in a decrease in the production of reactive radicals that are responsible for mo degradation 67 besides a further increase in mo to a higher concentration gave rise to a dense solution which reduces the penetration of light to the photocatalyst surface a lower percentage of degradation is consequently observed 42 the number of hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions in the solution is known to affect the surface charge of the catalyst or the pollutant this in turn impacts their interaction during photocatalytic degradation 69 hence in this study the influence of ph was examined and their degradation profiles are shown in fig 6d while their uv spectra are presented in fig s6 at an acidic ph of 3 5 the photodegradation efficiency of mo was found to increase to 95 7 in 90 min however when the ph was raised to ph 12 the photodegradation of mo decreased to 78 in 90 min as shown in fig 6d the difference in mo removal was found to be negligible at ph 6 and ph 9 as seen in scheme 1 reducing the ph to 3 5 results in the protonation of the nitrogen attached to the methyl groups while the azo linked bond between two aromatic rings gets converted from a strong double bond to a weak single bond which causes the colour of the solution to change from orange to red 70 thus the newly formed structure of mo is more susceptible to degradation by highly reactive radicals that are present in the solution 36 71 in addition the sm cfgnc 3 catalyst is easily protonated in acidic conditions which improves the adsorption of the mo on the catalyst by electrostatic attraction as evidenced by the high adsorption observed in the dark at ph 3 5 fig 6d however when the ph is raised to 12 the sulphate group will be expected to accept a proton to produce a neutral structure of mo which gives rise to a change in colour from orange to yellow 70 this newly formed structure has poor interaction with the sm cfgnc 3 catalyst which results in poor degradation efficiency 72 the impact of water soluble oxidant aps on the photodegradation of mo was investigated and its degradation profiles are shown in fig 6e while their uv spectra are presented in fig s7 it was observed that the photodegradation of mo increased from 71 2 to 90 3 with an increase in the amount of aps added from 10 to 50 mg in 90 min this improved photocatalytic degradation of mo is ascribed to the produced highly reactive sulphate radicals so4 that are formed from both direct illuminations of s2o8 2 with visible light and interaction of photogenerated electrons in cb of semiconductors with s2o8 2 as depicted in eqs 9 and 7 respectively 73 74 the so4 has a larger oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 ev and a longer radical lifetime approximately 30 40 ms compared to that of oh radicals which have an oxidation potential of 1 8 2 8 ev which gave it superior degradation efficiency 67 69 75 besides the formation of highly reactive so4 and s2o8 2 it can also act as an efficient electron acceptor eq 8 consequently reduces the photorecombination of electrons and holes thereby promoting better photocatalytic degradation of mo 67 4 3 photodegradation of different dyes since industrial wastewater effluent is usually composed of a mixture of dyes in this work the applicability of the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalytic system over a variety and a mixture of dyes was explored 76 fig 6f shows the degradation profiles of different dyes namely mo cr my tz and dye mixtures dy whereas their uv spectra are presented in fig s8 the photodegradation susceptibility of these dyes was found in the decreasing order of 98 9 88 3 77 and 40 in 90 min for cr mo my and tz respectively given that the reaction conditions were kept constant the observed differences in their removal efficiencies may be credited to the differences in their structures chemical and physical properties since photocatalysis relies more on the efficient interaction of the pollutant with the photocatalyst 76 77 thus the higher photodegradation efficiency observed for cr can be ascribed to its superior interaction with sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst which is validated by the observed high adsorption of it in the dark as compared to others fig 6f even though the structures of my and mo are similar my has a phenyl ring in place of methyl groups that are more difficult to degrade hence a lower degradation efficiency relative to mo was observed 77 the least degradation efficiency observed for tz may be attributed to its poor adsorption to the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst due to its being a neutral molecule as seen in fig 6f from the dye mixture cr mo my and tz uv spectra shown in fig s8e it was observed that the specific wavelength where these individual dyes absorb light disappears and a new broad peak at 447 nm was observed and used for monitoring degradation the dy showed a 73 3 photodegradation efficiency which shows that these fabricated sm cfgnc 3 photocatalysts can be applied in complex mixtures to have a benchmark for comparing the sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite photocatalytic efficiency towards dyes kinetic rate constants k space time yield sty and photochemical space time yield psty towards each pollutant were calculated fig 7a show the degradation kinetic curves and the obtained rate constants are presented in table 2 the obtained sty and psty are also presented in table 2 4 4 influence of scaling up the reaction and use of raw water on the photodegradation of mo most photocatalytic systems are known to work at small volumes but when they are scaled up the photodegradation efficacy is known to decrease which is usually attributed to poor diffusion rates of the pollutant to and from the catalyst poor dispersion of the photocatalyst in solution will result in poor light penetration to the surface of the photocatalyst 78 the impact of increasing the reaction volume from 120 ml to 1000 ml on the degradation of mo was investigated and the degradation profile is shown in fig 8b while the uv spectrum is presented in fig s8a it was observed that scaling up the reaction volume didn t have a negative effect on the photodegradation of mo in this system as a high degradation efficiency of 90 1 was obtained in 90 min which is comparable to the 88 3 in 90 min using a smaller volume 120 ml with the idea of applying the fabricated sm cfgnc 3 on an industrial scale raw water was sampled from the rand water treatment plant and the hazelmere water treatment plant before purification to investigate the influence of different organic pollutants and salts present in these waters on the photocatalytic degradation of mo using our system 79 from the uv spectra shown in fig 8a water from both treatment plants showed some absorbance below 400 nm which confirms that there are some organic pollutants present in this water while milli q water gave a flat line the degradation profile of spiked raw water with 10 ppm of mo is presented in fig 8b whereas the uv spectra are shown in fig s8 the photodegradation efficiency was found to decrease from 88 3 for milli q water to 83 4 and 76 6 for rand water and hazelmere water respectively after 90 min this decrease in photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of mo with other organic pollutants that are present in the water to the active sites of the photocatalyst also some salts and pollutants present in the water can act as scavengers for the photogenerated reactive radicals which results in a reduction of photodegradation efficacy 69 4 5 photodegradation of pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals are part of emerging water pollutants that are of concern because of the difficulty in removing them during water treatment and the lack of regulations regarding their permissible concentrations in drinking water 12 13 hence in this study the best performing photocatalyst sm cfgnc 3 was employed for the degradation of three pharmaceuticals namely cb zd and am their degradation profiles are shown in fig 8c while the uv spectra are presented in fig s9 am showed the highest photodegradation of 73 9 in 140 min about 71 5 of zd was removed in 140 min while cb showed the least removal of 47 7 in 140 min the differences in removal capacities of these pharmaceuticals can be attributed to their different chemical structures that are associated with their different physicochemical properties and adsorption abilities over the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst 80 in addition the k sty and psty obtained for the degraded pharmaceuticals are presented in table 2 while its kinetic degradation curve is shown in fig 7b comparing the removal capacities of dyes and pharmaceuticals explored in this work sm cfgnc 3 shows better degradation efficiencies towards dyes overall the great versatility of the sm cfgnc 3 catalytic system allows it to treat a wide range of organic pollutants 4 6 scavenger experiments and reaction mechanism elucidation to explore the probable mechanism that was followed during the photodegrading of mo utilizing visible light in the presence of sm cfgnc 3 and aps the influence of main reactive species namely holes h hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 during photocatalysis were studied in this study benzoquinone edta and isopropanol were used as scavengers for o2 h and oh respectively 36 69 and their uv spectra are presented in fig s11 fig 8d shows that photodegradation of mo was greatly reduced upon the addition of benzoquinone which implies that o2 radicals are the principal active species involved this is attributed to the ease of converting o2 to o2 radicals at the conduction bands cb of g c3n4 1 10 ev and sm cf 1 305 ev which are more negative compared to the redox potential of the o2 o2 couple 0 33 ev vs nhe 36 81 83 whereas upon the addition of edta the photodegradation of mo was found to decrease moderately indicating that h is involved to a lesser extent through direct oxidation of the molecule lastly isopropanol was observed to have a tiny effect on mo photodegradation as seen in fig 8d implying that the oh radicals play only a trivial function this result is supported by the fact that the valence band vb of g c3n4 1 53 ev and sm cf 0 305 ev are less positive compared to that of oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe and h2o oh 2 68 ev vs nhe indicating that it cannot directly oxidise oh or h2o to form oh radicals 40 thus a small amount of oh radicals that are involved in the photodegradation of mo come from the reaction between water and o2 or so4 58 65 67 from the scavenger experiments observed optical properties and results obtained by other scholars the reaction mechanism for the photodegradation of mo shown in fig 9 was proposed 42 58 to initiate the reaction visible light is shone on the sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite and both g c3n4 and sm cf absorb photons of energy higher than their energy band gaps which excites the electrons e from their vb to the cb leaving h in the vb eq 5 as shown in fig 9 the vb of g c3n4 1 53 ev is more positive relative to the vb of sm cf 0 305 ev hence the photogenerated h will diffuse from the vb of g c3n4 to the vb of sm cf 32 58 while the photogenerated e will move from the cb of sm cf 1 305 ev to the cb of g c3n4 1 10 ev because the cb of sm cf is more negative than that of g c3n4 32 58 the inner electric field that exists in the p n heterojunction drives the movement of photogenerated e and h in the mentioned directions 42 hence the formed electron hole pairs are effectively separated by the p n junction that is formed by these two semiconductors which results in the extended life of these produced h and e pairs due to the retardation of electron hole recombination 42 84 86 the photogenerated e in the cb of g c3n4 and sm cf can directly reduce dissolved o2 to o2 radicals eq 6 and s2o8 2 to so4 radicals eq 7 because of the favourable potential difference besides so4 radicals are also activated by direct illumination of s2o8 2 with visible light eq 9 58 67 in addition the s2o8 2 can act as an electron acceptor thereby increasing the chance of the formation of superoxide radicals on the semiconductor vb eq 8 67 direct production of oh radicals from h2o or oh using h generated at vb of semiconductors is prohibited because of unfavourable potential differences 36 42 however a small amount of oh radicles are produced from the radical reaction of h2o with o2 or so4 radicals eqs 10 and 11 finally the mo has completely degraded o2 so4 oh radicals or h via several intermediates to h2o co2 5 sm cfgnc 3 hv h e 6 o 2 e o 2 7 s 2 o 8 2 e so 4 so 4 2 8 s 2 o 8 2 2e 2so 4 2 9 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2so 4 10 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 h 11 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh 12 mo o 2 or 2so 4 or oh or h h 2 o co 2 intermediate products 4 7 comparison of sm cfgnc 3 with other catalytic systems that were used in mo degradation the photocatalytic performance of sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was compared to the performance of other photocatalyst systems that have been used recently to degrade mo as shown in table 3 even though making a direct comparison of photocatalysts is difficult to do since different parameters such as light source catalyst quantity added oxidant ph initial dye concentration and reaction time were used during the experiments by just comparing the percentage degradation of mo in this investigation to those described in the literature it can be shown that the photocatalyst utilised in this study performed substantially above the average under mild conditions sm cfgnc 3 at ph 3 5 exhibited the highest mo degradation 95 7 of all the systems that used visible light and its ability to be easily separated from treated water gave it an edge thus sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposites remain a potential candidate for the removal of mo from water using visible light amongst other available photocatalysts 4 8 catalyst reusability and its stability during the photodegradation of mo due to the cost that is associated with developing a photocatalyst it is vital to develop a catalyst that can be used many times without losing its photocatalytic efficiency in addition separating the photocatalyst from the reaction mixture is an important factor to consider during the design of the photocatalyst for it to have a chance to be used on a large scale thus in this study a magnetically separable sm cfgnc 3 17 7 emu g was exposed to 4 cycles of photodegrading mo while it was separated from the reaction mixture using a bar magnet according to fig 10a the photodegradation efficiency of sm cfgnc 3 decrease slightly from 85 7 1st cycle to 76 7 in the 4th cycle this loss in photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the small amount of photocatalyst that was lost during filtration of the aliquots that were sampled for analysis since only 110 mg was recovered after the 4th cycle of the initial 120 mg to check if the photocatalyst stability and its structural integrity were preserved during the reaction ftir and sem were employed for analysing the functional groups and the surface morphology respectively after the 4th cycle fig 10b shows that there is no noticeable distinction between the reused and fresh photocatalyst which confirms that the structural integrity of sm cfgnc 3 was maintained whereas the sem image of the fresh and reused photocatalyst was found to be similar which validates the preservation of the surface morphology of the photocatalyst fig 10c the edx spectrum exhibited in fig 10d and the elemental mapping in fig 10e for used sm cfgnc 3 were found to be similar to that of the fresh photocatalyst which confirms that there is very minimal leaching of the elements from the nanocomposite 5 conclusion the successful fabrication of sm cfgncs was confirmed by a variety of characterisation techniques namely p xrd tem ftir tga sem vsm uv vis edx and bet optimising the ratio of sm cf and g c3n4 proved to be crucial as important photocatalyst properties such as effective charge separation faster electron transfer and lower charge transfer resistance were all found to improve with varying the two materials according to the pl cv and eis studies sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite demonstrated the most desired photocatalyst properties which were further validated by the observed high degradation efficiency of dyes and pharmaceuticals thus confirming it has the best ratio of sm cf and g c3n4 besides having good electrochemical properties sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was found to have a ms of 17 7 emu g while its hc 89 4 oe and mr 4 63 emu g were relatively low the successful formation of the sm cfgncs and their purity was confirmed by the p xrd analysis which was further supported by the data observed in tga analysis and edx spectra sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was found to have a surface area of 5 26 m2 g and its pore size was 3 06 nm in addition the sm cfgncs exhibited strong and wide absorption bands in the visible light region 360 800 nm of the uv vis spectra and a moderate band gap in the range of 1 85 2 29 ev which allow them to effectively utilize visible light during photocatalysts the photocatalytic activities for catalysts during the degradation of mo were found in the decreasing order of 88 3 86 3 84 8 84 6 83 6 76 1 and 60 4 for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 g c3n4 sm cfgnc 0 3 and sm cf respectively after 90 min at ph 6 at ph 3 5 the highest photodegradation of mo 95 7 was observed in 90 min which shows that acidic conditions provide the best environment for efficient photodegradation the photodegradation of mo was found to increase with an increase in aps amount 0 50 mg however it decreased with the increase in mo initial concentration 5 20 ppm from the trapping experiments superoxide radicals were found to be the responsible species for degrading mo thus using the results from the scavenger s studies and optical properties the reaction mechanism was proposed in addition 90 1 degradation of mo was observed in the scaled up experiment while good mo degradation efficiencies were also obtained for the spiked raw water from the rand water treatment plant 83 4 and hazelmere treatment plant 76 6 the sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was also applied to the photodegradation of different dyes and pharmaceuticals the photodegradation susceptibility of these dyes was found in the decreasing order of 98 9 88 3 77 and 40 in 90 min for cr mo my and tz respectively while 73 3 removal was obtained for the dye mixture whereas for am zd and cb a removal of 73 9 71 5 and 47 7 in 140 min was observed respectively lastly the reusability study showed a minimal loss in photocatalytic performance after 4 cycles while the integrity of the photocatalyst was preserved hence

12924,photocatalysis suffers two major drawbacks namely the separation of the photocatalyst from treated water and the utilisation of expensive uv light this has limited its application on an industrial scale a novel nanocomposite of cusm0 06fe1 94o4 g c3n4 with exceptional magnetic electrochemical and optical properties was synthesised using the hydrothermal method the ratio of cusm0 06fe1 94o4 and g c3n4 was optimised sm cfgnc 3 3 1 was found to exhibit the highest photodegradation efficiency of 95 7 towards methyl orange mo in 90 min at ph 3 5 using visible light in addition 90 1 degradation of mo was observed in the scaled up experiment while high mo degradation efficiencies were also obtained for the spiked raw water from the rand water treatment plant 83 4 and hazelmere treatment plant 76 6 furthermore good removal efficiencies were obtained during the photodegradation of dyes congo red tartrazine metanil yellow and pharmaceuticals carbamazepine zidovudine acetaminophen the influence of various reaction parameters such as catalyst amount ph dye concentration oxidant effect trapping experiments catalyst reusability and reaction mechanism were investigated lastly the reusability study showed a minimal loss in photocatalytic performance after 4 cycles and the nanocomposite was easily separated from the treated water using a magnet thus the synthesised nanocomposite is a potential candidate for the application of photocatalysis at an industrial scale graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite photodegradation pharmaceuticals dyes raw water mixed dyes visible light 1 introduction the desire to sustain a pollution free environment with clean water bodies has come under threat due to the large waste discharged by industries 1 a significant amount of this waste consists of dyes which are the major source of water pollution these dyes are used mainly as colourants in various industrial applications such as foodstuffs textiles laser materials laser printing cosmetics papers additives and xerography 2 4 unfortunately during the manufacturing process about 12 of these dyes are lost and they find their way into our water systems 2 5 6 amid the classes of dyes the azo dyes cause great concern due to their non degradable nature caused by the presence of stable azo group nn and aromatic groups in the structure which contribute to the colouring of the water this study focuses on carcinogenic azo dye methyl orange mo as a model reaction while other dyes namely congo red cr tartrazine tz and metanil yellow my were also explored 3 7 8 the carcinogenic effect aromatic structure and metals present in their structure pose health concerns to human beings and aquatic animals 9 11 besides dyes pharmaceuticals are emerging water pollutants of concern because of the difficulty in removing them during water treatment and the lack of regulations regarding their permissible concentrations in drinking water 12 14 to relieve pain caused by different afflictions human beings use a variety of prescribed pharmaceutical drugs 12 15 unfortunately the bodily systems do not fully break down these pharmaceuticals hence 10 to 90 of the initial dose is excreted while the rest is defaecated as metabolites and or conjugated forms back into the water systems 16 in addition the direct discharge of unused pharmaceuticals from households and expired drugs from industry contributes to water pollution 15 in this work pharmaceuticals namely carbamazepine cb zidovudine zd and acetaminophen am were explored even at low concentrations drinking water contaminated with these drugs causes drug resistance and long term irreversible changes to the genomes of microorganisms 13 17 18 some of these pharmaceuticals have an endocrine disrupting effect and toxicity that cause death in human beings and aquatic animals 12 19 20 to eliminate these contaminants from the water systems different methods such as physicochemical adsorption ozonation chemical oxidation enzymatic decomposition electrochemical degradation and photocatalysis have been employed 1 19 21 23 each of the methods stated above has its advantages and disadvantages with regards to the mentioned method photocatalysis is the most promising and efficient technique for the complete elimination of azo dyes and pharmaceuticals as it mineralises them to carbon dioxide and water in a short period using reactive radical species various photocatalysts have been used in the photodegradation of pharmaceutical and azo dyes however the majority of these photocatalysts are in powder form and this presents a separation challenge following photocatalysis 24 26 in addition fast electron hole recombination which reduces photocatalytic performance and utilisation of expensive uv light has limited the application of these photocatalysts on an industrial scale 27 28 thus to move photocatalysis from bench scale to pilot and industrial scale it is vital to develop an efficient magnetic visible light driven photocatalyst that addresses the separation cost and performance challenges 24 in this work a nanocomposite of samarium doped copper ferrite coated with graphitic carbon nitride cusm0 06fe1 94o4 g c3n4 was constructed through an optimised process the magnetic cusm0 06fe1 94o4 sm cf will enable the nanocomposite to be easily separated from treated water using an external magnetic field in addition to the magnetic property sm cf has other desirable properties such as good photochemical stability strong and wide visible light response the small bandgap energy 1 50 1 60 ev 29 furthermore the as synthesised sm cf can easily form a good synergy with other materials and has shown good photocatalytic performance when applied in photodegradation 24 29 30 irrespective of these numerous good properties sm cf has poor adsorption capacity and suffers from high electron hole recombination due to its small bandgap 24 31 32 to address these challenges an n semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 with a bandgap of about 2 7 ev was incorporated on the surface of sm cf via a heterojunction 33 in recent years g c3n4 has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts that possess good properties such as high chemical stability non toxicity simple preparation and good adsorption capacity 34 36 thus the synthesised nanocomposite is expected to improve the shortcomings of both materials through the synergy that is formed by the heterojunctions previous formed heterojunctions such as cufe2o4 cuo 37 cufe2o4 ceo2 38 cufe2o4 tio2 39 cufe2o4 agbr 30 cufe2o4 g c3n4 31 cofe2o4 c3n4 40 cufe2o4 g c3n4 32 coo cufe2o4 41 and cufe2o4 g c3n4 42 have managed to significantly improve the separation of the photogenerated electrons while it has been noted that the copper ferrite high saturation magnetisation is greatly reduced upon coupling with g c3n4 which has a negative effect on the separation efficiency and recovery of the photocatalyst 43 44 to fabricate this novel cusm0 06fe1 94o4 g c3n4 nanocomposite sm cfgnc that possesses both effective charge separation of photogenerated electrons holes while retaining high saturation magnetisation the optimal synthesis conditions found in our previous studies for each component were employed 29 36 in this study much emphasis was placed on finding the optimal coating ratio between sm cf and g c3n4 that improves the photocatalytic properties of these materials in addition the physical and chemical interactions involved between these two semiconductors were investigated the synthesised nanocomposite was eventually evaluated for its photocatalysis performance using mo the influence of various reaction parameters such as catalyst amount ph dye concentration oxidant effect trapping experiments catalyst reusability and reaction mechanism was investigated the impact of scaling up the reaction and the effect of multiple contaminants present in raw water were examined lastly the best performing nanocomposite was applied to a variety of organic pollutants namely my cr tz cb zd and am to evaluate the removal efficiencies 2 experimental details 2 1 chemicals used all the chemicals that were used in this study were acquired from sigma aldrich south africa samarium iii chloride

a pre heated silicon oil bath with a set temperature of 60 c then the ph was adjusted to 12 by adding drops of freshly prepared 4 m of naoh to the solution that was continuously stirred the solution was left to stir for 4 h before the precipitate of sm cf was collected using a centrifuge this was followed by washing the formed product 3 times using deionized water to remove impurities lastly the collected sm cf particles were dried in an oven set at 100 c for 12 h the formed powder was grounded before they were placed in a lidded crucible for annealing the samples were annealed in a muffle furnace for 4 h at 850 c using a ramping rate of 4 2 c min 2 2 2 synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride the g c3n4 sample was made by precisely weighing 10 g of melamine and placing it in a leaded

samarium doped copper ferrite coated with graphitic carbon nitride for the fabrication of sm cfgncs a desired amount of g c3n4 was dispersed in 30 ml of 1 3 butylene glycol and sonicated for 30 min then an appropriate amount of sm cf was added to the sonicated solution of g c3n4 and left to sonicate for a further 30 min before the solution was transferred to a teflon lined autoclave the autoclave was placed in an oven that was set at 160 c for 24 h and the solution was centrifuged to the formed sm cfgncs the obtained pellet was washed 2 times with deionized water before it was placed in a vacuum oven that was set at 90 c for 24 h to dry the obtained sm cfgncs were labelled sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 and sm cfgnc 0 3 based on the mixed ratio sm cf g c3n4 of 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 respectively 2 3 characterisation techniques rigaku smartlab x ray diffractometer that is equipped with a cu kα λ 0 154059 nm radiation at 2 min was used for p xrd measurements porosity studies were investigated using an anton paar autosorb iq3 that is fitted with a vacuum pump degassing unit the samples were degassed at 100 c for 5 h before the analysis uv vis nir spectrometer lambda 1050 and ftir spectrometer frontier which are supplied by perkinelmer were employed for optical properties measurements and chemical properties respectively the photoluminescence

their images were taken using jeol jsm it300 series scanning electron microscopy sem that is coupled with eds oxford x maxn detector while the tem images were taken by the tecnai f20 high resolution transmission electron microscopy using an accelerated voltage of 200 kv before analysis the samples were dispersed in methanol and drop casted on a holey carbon coated copper grid vibrating sample magnetometer vsm quantum design versa lab was used for magnetic measurements using the temperature of 300 k with an applied magnetic field of h 5 h 5 koe 2 4 electrochemical analysis for electrochemical characterisation a three electrode cell was used the glassy carbon electrode gce was used as a working electrode while platinum wire and ag agcl 3 m were used as counter and reference electrodes respectively before drop casting the synthesised sm cfgncs on the working electrode the gce was cleaned by polishing it with alumina slurries 1 0 3 and 0 05 μm and rinsing with deionized water in between each step the gce was then sonicated in deionized water and ethanol for 5 min each to achieve a mirror like surface then dried at room temperature sm cfgncs solution was prepared by dispersing 4 mg of the synthesised sm cfgncs in 4 ml dimethylformamide dmf and the solution was sonicated for 30 min at 25 c then a volume of 5 μl of the dispersed sm cfgncs was dropped on a cleaned gce surface and air dried at room temperature lastly the electrode was gently rinsed with deionized water before use to take measurements 5 mm of ferri ferrocyanide in 0 1 m kcl was used as a redox probe for cv measurements the scan rate of 50 mv s and potential range of 200 mv to 700 mv the eis studies were conducted using the frequency range of 0 1 hz to 100 000 hz 2 5 sampling of raw water samples the raw water samples were collected at the rand water treatment plant and hazelmere water treatment plant just before the water enter the treatment plants for purification the samples were collected in triplicate using clean 1 l amber glass bottles fitted with teflon lined caps these samples were kept at 4 c and were filtered using a 0 45 μm gf f filter before analysis 2 6 photocatalysis of dyes the photocatalyst of sm cfgncs was conducted using a photoreactor that is equipped with a visible light emitting diodes led chip in each experiment 120 mg of the photocatalyst was added to 120 ml of 10 ppm mo dye and stirred in the dark for 20 min using an overhead stirring system the reaction was carried out using a custom made reactor shown in fig s1d the 5 w rated led chip with a wavelength range of 400 to 600 nm was attached to the wall of a metal reactor and connected to a dimer which was used to select the light intensity ranging from 20 to 100 for experiments the led power was set at 80 the reactions were conducted at the neutral ph of the solution and room temperature 20 25 c the sample aliquots 3 ml were taken every 10 min for the first 30 min while the sampling intervals were expanded to 15 min from 30 to 90 min before the analysis with a uv vis spectrophotometer the sampled aliquots were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter for experiments namely the influence of ph mo dye concentration scavengers amount of catalyst mixed dyes raw water and recycle tests sm cfgnc 3 was used as a photocatalyst while other parameters were only changed when they were investigated to investigate the impact of scavenges on mo degradation 15 ml of 5 mm benzoquinone isopropanol and edta was added to 120 ml of dye solution and the same procedure was followed for the subsequent experiments for ph studies 1 m of naoh and hcl was used to adjust the ph the reusability studies were carried out under the same reaction conditions for 4 cycles with the photocatalyst being recovered by a magnet and washed with deionized water at the end of each cycle during raw water degradation experiments 10 ppm of mo was spiked and the following reaction conditions were used ammonium persulphate aps 40 mg sm cfgnc 3 amount 120 mg and ph 6 the reaction was monitored at 465 nm and the degradation efficiency was calculated using the following eq 1 1 degradation efficiency c 0 c c 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of dye and c is the determined concentration after adsorption and photoirradiation the space time yield sty and photochemical space time yield psty calculations were done following the protocol developed by leblebici et al 46 47 a detailed description of these parameters and subsequent calculations is presented in the supplementary information 2 7 photocatalysis of pharmaceuticals the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals was carried out using the setup described above briefly an initial concentration of 10 ppm of the pharmaceutical was used while the ph of the solution was used without any adjustment and sm cfgnc 3 120 mg was used as a photocatalyst the solution was stirred in the dark for 20 min using an overhead stirring system before light irradiation the sample aliquots 3 ml were taken every 20 min and were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter before analysis each pharmaceutical degradation profile was monitored at its highest absorbance 2 8 reusability and stability test of the catalyst the reusability studies were carried under the same reaction conditions for 4 cycles mo 10 ppm ph 6 aps 40 mg sm cfgnc 3 amount 120 mg the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst was recovered from the treated solution at the end of each cycle by placing a bar magnet at the bottom of the beaker the photocatalyst was attracted to the magnet which allow the solution to be discarded while retaining the photocatalyst lastly the photocatalyst was washed 2 times with water and was dried at 100 c for 1 h in an oven 3 characterisation 3 1 structural magnetic and porosity studies to confirm the formation of sm cfgncs p xrd was employed and the obtained patterns are displayed in fig 1a the braggs reflection peaks indexed 100 and 002 shown in red colour confirm the formation of g c3n4 36 the 002 plane is attributed to the interplanar stacking of the conjugated aromatics whereas the 100 plane is credited to the periodic array of in plane tri s triazine 32 48 49 while the braggs reflection peaks indexed 111 220 200 400 311 222 400 440 422 511 and 440 shown in black colour signify the presence of sm cf 29 50 the coexistence of both phases of g c3n4 and sm cf in the p xrd patterns of sm cfgncs confirms the successful coating of g c3n4 onto the surface of sm cf in addition the main diffraction peak 002 of g c3n4 was zoomed as shown in fig s1a and it was observed that the peak shifted slightly from 27 8 to 28 2 c this observed slight shift is attributed to the formed synergy in the sm cfgncs through the transfer of electrons from the nitrogen triple bonds of g c3n4 to the empty d and f orbitals of sm cf 32 also the peak intensity of the 002 plane of g c3n4 was found to decrease with an increase in the weight ratio of sm cf due to the importance of the photocatalyst surface area in photocatalysis n2 sorption experiment was conducted and adsorption desorption isotherms are presented in figs 1b and s1c the observed isotherms are classified as type iv isotherms with an h3 hysteresis loop according to the brunauer deming deming teller bddt classification which shows that the produced sm cfgncs are mesoporous 51 52 in addition the obtained pore size of sm cfgncs was in the range of 3 06 3 41 nm which confirms the mesoporous nature of synthesised materials except for the sm cfgnc 0 5 which has a pore size of 1 76 nm which informs us of the formation of micropores the obtained bet surface area bjh pore volume and bjh pore sizes of the synthesised materials are presented in table 1 the g c3n4 was found to have a bet surface area of 44 89 m2 g however its surface area decreased greatly upon immobilisation of sm cf which can be ascribed to the filling of g c3n4 pores by sm cf which is supported by the observed decrease in pore volume 53 thus the observed decrease in the surface area confirms the successful in cooperation of sm cf on the surface of g c3n4 53 the bet surface area of sm cfgncs was found to be between 3 76 and 7 55 m2 g while they have very small pore volumes which are in the range of 0 039 to 0 095 cm3 g as compared to g c3n4 0 244 cm3 g the challenge of separating the photocatalyst from treated water after photocatalysis is well known hence in this study the magnetic properties of produced sm cfgncs were studied the saturation magnetisation ms coercivity hc and remanent magnetization mr were estimated from the magnet hysteresis loops shown in fig 1 c and d and the observed properties are presented in table 1 the ms of sm cf was found to decrease from 52 6 emu g to 17 7 emu g and 10 6 emu g for sm cfgnc 3 and sm cfgnc 2 respectively the observed decrease is attributed to the presence of a nonmagnetic carbon component which dilutes the magnetic property and causes a disturbance on the surface spins of sm cf 29 42 54 the hc was found to increase from 58 5 to 107 8 oe due to an increase in the amount of g c3n4 whereas the mr decreased from 6 13 to 2 66 emu g imperatively the mr ms ratio was found to be in the range between 0 117 and 0 262 which is less than 0 5 thus the fabricated sm cfgncs show uniaxial anisotropy instead of cubic anisotropy 55 56 3 2 chemical composition and stability the ftir spectra of g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs are presented in fig 2a and their zoomed spectra in fig 2b the vibration band seen at 582 cm 1 can be ascribed to the tetrahedral metal oxygen molecular bonding of sm cf 29 57 in addition the vibration band intensity at 582 cm 1 was observed to increase with an increase in sm cf content in the sm cfgnc the fingerprint vibration bands 812 1402 cm 1 of g c3n4 were observed in all sm cfgncs the breathing mode of triazine units of g c3n4 is signified by the vibration band seen at 812 cm 1 36 58 whereas those vibration bands seen between 886 and 1402 cm 1 can be ascribed to the cn heterocyclic ring including vibrations of bridging cnhc units and trigonal cn c c 58 59 the vibrations visible at 1654 and 3385 cm 1 are credited to the adsorbed carbon dioxide and water molecules from the atmosphere respectively 51 57 60 the thermal stability of fabricated g c3n4 and sm cfgncs was investigated and their tga profiles are presented in fig 2c in all samples 2 major weight losses were observed at around 70 130 c and 545 700 c which are credited to loss of absorbed water molecules and g c3n4 decomposition to gaseous products respectively 40 the tga profiles also show that pure g c3n4 has higher thermal stability compared to sm cfgncs as highlighted by its decomposition commencement taking place at a slightly higher temperature the lower thermal stability of sm cfgncs can be ascribed to the weakened cross linkage rings of g c3n4 caused by the incorporation of sm cf on the surface 40 42 lastly the observed final weight loss for sm cfgncs agreed with the feed ratio 3 3 photoelectrochemical and optical properties fig 3a shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs sm cf exhibited strong and wide absorption in the visible light region 360 800 nm which is ascribed to the excitation of electrons from the valence band of the o 2p level to the conduction band of the fe 3d level and sm 4f level 29 40 while the g c3n4 and sm cfgnc showed two major absorption peaks at around 275 and 385 nm these absorption peaks are attributed to the π π and n π electronic transitions from the valence band populated by n 2p orbitals to the conduction band populated by c 2p orbitals 36 42 61 the sm cfgncs showed an enhanced absorption intensity and a broader absorption edge compared to g c3n4 hence the sm cfgncs are better equipped to harvest more visible light than g c3n4 which might improve their photocatalytic performance tauc plots of αhν 2 against photon energy hν were plotted as shown in fig 3b and were used to estimate the bandgap energies through extrapolation fig s2 eq 2 was used to describe the tauc plots whereby α ν k h and eg are the adsorption coefficient incident light energy proportionality constant planck constant and bandgap respectively 2 αhν k hv e g n 2 for all synthesised materials the optical transition of n 1 was considered as the absorption was deemed to be direct 51 62 the bandgap energy of sm cf and g c3n4 was found to be 1 61 and 2 63 ev respectively whereas the bandgap energies of sm cfgncs were found to be between those of sm cf and g c3n4 table 1 eqs 3 and 4 were used to estimate the conduction band potential ecb and valence band potential evb of sm cf and g c3n4 respectively 3 e cb x e e 0 5 e g 4 e vb e cb e g the free electron energy ee on the hydrogen scale was considered to be approximately 4 5 ev 40 the absolute electronegativity x of 4 ev and 4 72 ev were used for sm cf and g c3n4 respectively 29 40 63 lastly the band edge potentials of sm cfgncs could not be accurately calculated due to the difference in absolute electronegativity of sm cf and g c3n4 hence not reported to gain more insight into the ability of synthesised sm cfgncs to effectively prevent photo recombination of generated electrons and holes pl was employed and its spectra are displayed in fig 2d the low emission peak intensity of the pl spectra signifies the higher probability of the material being able to effectively separate the photoinduced electrons and holes 32 58 thus it was observed in fig 2d that sm cfgnc 3 exhibited the weakest intensity compared to other fabricated materials the effective charge separation of fabricated materials was found to be in the decreasing order of sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 g c3n4 this effective charge separation in sm cfgncs may be attributed to the synergy formed by sm cf and g c3n4 which allows electrons in the more negative cb of sm cf 1 305 ev to diffuse into the cb of g c3n4 1 10 ev while at the vb the photogenerated holes diffuse from the most positive g c3n4 1 53 ev to the vb of sm cf 0 305 ev 32 to further confirm the pl analysis results the sm cfgncs were characterised using cv and eis from the cyclic voltammogram presented in fig 3c sm cfgncs have shown the most enhanced anodic peak which was also shifted to the negative potential compared to synthesised materials this proved that there is a faster transfer of electrons on the surface of the material 64 66 thus fast electron transfer of synthesised materials was found to be in the decreasing order of sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 sm cf the eis nyquist plots of fabricated sm cfgncs are displayed in figs 3d and s1b the arc radius of eis nyquist plots is used to estimate the charge transfer resistance of the material at the surface thus the smaller the arc radius the lower the charge transfer resistance 32 58 the zoomed eis nyquist plots presented in fig s1b showed that sm cfgn 3 has the smallest charge transfer resistance comparable to other synthesised materials hence it demonstrates effective charge transfer capacities the charge transfer resistance was found to be 154 5 ώ 251 8 ώ 1613 8 ώ 2160 4 ώ 3641 3 ώ and 3806 6 ώ for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 and sm cf respectively these results corroborate with the results observed on cv and pl in a nutshell producing sm cfgnc with high charge transfer and low recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is of great importance for photocatalytic applications 3 4 surface morphology and microstructure the sem images of the g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs are presented in fig 4 the g c3n4 had well defined exfoliated sheets with a proper lamellar structure whereas the sm cf had an irregular surface morphological structure that resembled a quasi cubic in shape and was made up of small blocks and flakes whereas the sm cfgnc showed that the flakes and blocks of sm cf were intertwined into the exfoliated sheets of g c3n4 to form a hybrid structure the formed hybrid is validated by the observed encapsulation of sm cf nanoparticles by g c3n4 to form an intimate heterojunction on the tem images fig 5e and f the tem image of g c3n4 and sm cf which are shown in fig 5 a d confirms that both particles are in the nanoparticle range in size to confirm the purity of the fabricated materials edx was employed and the observed spectra are displayed in fig s3 for sm cfgncs only sm fe cu c n and o peaks were observed while for g c3n4 only c and n peaks were observed the sm cf showed only sm fe cu and o peaks thus the eds analysis results confirm the high purity of the synthesised materials 4 photodegradation experiments 4 1 photodegradation of mo using different catalysts the photocatalytic efficiency of g c3n4 sm cf and sm cfgncs of different ratios was explored by monitoring the photodegradation of mo under visible light irradiation and their degradation profiles are presented in fig 6a whereas their uv spectra are shown in fig s4 the mo concentration in water was observed to decrease with an increase in reaction time 0 90 min for all catalysts to examine the role of direct photolysis mo was exposed to visible light in the absence of the photocatalyst and ammonium persulphate aps the mo was observed to be stable in the presence of visible light as no detectable degradation was observed fig 6a in this experiment aps was added to mo and exposed to visible light in the absence of the photocatalyst and a 66 1 mo degradation was observed in 90 min this is ascribed to the activation of aps by visible light to produce highly reactive sulphate radicals that aid in mo degradation 67 when sm cfgnc 3a was used in mo photodegradation in the absence of aps 45 degradation was achieved after combining the catalysts with aps higher photodegradation efficiencies and rate constants were witnessed as presented in table s1 the sm cfgnc 3 was found to be the best photocatalyst amongst the synthesised material as it showed the highest mo degradation of 88 3 within 90 min this enhanced photocatalytic activity of sm cfgnc 3 compared to other nanocomposites is attributed to the reduced recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which shows that the synergy between these two materials was optimal for the efficient movement of electrons and holes 40 58 in addition these observed results agree with the findings obtained from the pl cv and eis studies where sm cfgnc 3 showed effective charge separation faster electron transfer and lower charge transfer resistance compared to other catalysts respectively the photocatalytic activities for catalysts were found in the decreasing order of 88 3 86 3 84 8 84 6 83 6 76 1 and 60 4 for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 g c3n4 sm cfgnc 0 3 and sm cf after 90 min visible light irradiation respectively the higher mo degradation efficiency of 83 6 within 90 min observed for pure g c3n4 can be attributed to its relatively higher surface area of 44 89 m2 g compared to those of sm cfgncs even though its pl spectra showed a higher chance of recombination of holes and electrons which predicts it to have lower photocatalytic performance the lower mo degradation efficiency found for sm cf may be attributed to its smaller band gap which permits high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which is validated by cv and eis results to have an appreciation on the reaction kinetics of synthesised catalysts on photodegradation of mo a pseudo first order model was employed using the kinetic equation of ln c0 c kt and the degradation kinetic curves are shown in fig 6b 68 accordingly the rate constants were found to be 0 02052 min 1 0 01877 min 1 0 01739 min 1 0 01735 min 1 0 01240 min 1 0 00834 min 1 0 01647 min 1 0 00554 min 1 and 0 00987 min 1 for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 sm cfgnc 0 3 sm cf g c3n4 sm cfgnc 3a and aps respectively 4 2 impact of dye concentration ph and amount of aps added on the photodegradation of mo the effect of the initial mo concentration on the degradation efficacy of the photocatalyst was investigated and the degradation profiles are shown in fig 6c while its uv spectra are presented in fig s5 the removal efficiency of mo was found to decrease from 93 8 to 82 1 with an increase in mo concentration from 5 to 20 ppm bearing in mind that the amount of catalyst and aps was kept constant the observed decrease can be ascribed to the occupation of more active sites on the surface of the photocatalyst by added mo which results in a decrease in the production of reactive radicals that are responsible for mo degradation 67 besides a further increase in mo to a higher concentration gave rise to a dense solution which reduces the penetration of light to the photocatalyst surface a lower percentage of degradation is consequently observed 42 the number of hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions in the solution is known to affect the surface charge of the catalyst or the pollutant this in turn impacts their interaction during photocatalytic degradation 69 hence in this study the influence of ph was examined and their degradation profiles are shown in fig 6d while their uv spectra are presented in fig s6 at an acidic ph of 3 5 the photodegradation efficiency of mo was found to increase to 95 7 in 90 min however when the ph was raised to ph 12 the photodegradation of mo decreased to 78 in 90 min as shown in fig 6d the difference in mo removal was found to be negligible at ph 6 and ph 9 as seen in scheme 1 reducing the ph to 3 5 results in the protonation of the nitrogen attached to the methyl groups while the azo linked bond between two aromatic rings gets converted from a strong double bond to a weak single bond which causes the colour of the solution to change from orange to red 70 thus the newly formed structure of mo is more susceptible to degradation by highly reactive radicals that are present in the solution 36 71 in addition the sm cfgnc 3 catalyst is easily protonated in acidic conditions which improves the adsorption of the mo on the catalyst by electrostatic attraction as evidenced by the high adsorption observed in the dark at ph 3 5 fig 6d however when the ph is raised to 12 the sulphate group will be expected to accept a proton to produce a neutral structure of mo which gives rise to a change in colour from orange to yellow 70 this newly formed structure has poor interaction with the sm cfgnc 3 catalyst which results in poor degradation efficiency 72 the impact of water soluble oxidant aps on the photodegradation of mo was investigated and its degradation profiles are shown in fig 6e while their uv spectra are presented in fig s7 it was observed that the photodegradation of mo increased from 71 2 to 90 3 with an increase in the amount of aps added from 10 to 50 mg in 90 min this improved photocatalytic degradation of mo is ascribed to the produced highly reactive sulphate radicals so4 that are formed from both direct illuminations of s2o8 2 with visible light and interaction of photogenerated electrons in cb of semiconductors with s2o8 2 as depicted in eqs 9 and 7 respectively 73 74 the so4 has a larger oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 ev and a longer radical lifetime approximately 30 40 ms compared to that of oh radicals which have an oxidation potential of 1 8 2 8 ev which gave it superior degradation efficiency 67 69 75 besides the formation of highly reactive so4 and s2o8 2 it can also act as an efficient electron acceptor eq 8 consequently reduces the photorecombination of electrons and holes thereby promoting better photocatalytic degradation of mo 67 4 3 photodegradation of different dyes since industrial wastewater effluent is usually composed of a mixture of dyes in this work the applicability of the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalytic system over a variety and a mixture of dyes was explored 76 fig 6f shows the degradation profiles of different dyes namely mo cr my tz and dye mixtures dy whereas their uv spectra are presented in fig s8 the photodegradation susceptibility of these dyes was found in the decreasing order of 98 9 88 3 77 and 40 in 90 min for cr mo my and tz respectively given that the reaction conditions were kept constant the observed differences in their removal efficiencies may be credited to the differences in their structures chemical and physical properties since photocatalysis relies more on the efficient interaction of the pollutant with the photocatalyst 76 77 thus the higher photodegradation efficiency observed for cr can be ascribed to its superior interaction with sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst which is validated by the observed high adsorption of it in the dark as compared to others fig 6f even though the structures of my and mo are similar my has a phenyl ring in place of methyl groups that are more difficult to degrade hence a lower degradation efficiency relative to mo was observed 77 the least degradation efficiency observed for tz may be attributed to its poor adsorption to the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst due to its being a neutral molecule as seen in fig 6f from the dye mixture cr mo my and tz uv spectra shown in fig s8e it was observed that the specific wavelength where these individual dyes absorb light disappears and a new broad peak at 447 nm was observed and used for monitoring degradation the dy showed a 73 3 photodegradation efficiency which shows that these fabricated sm cfgnc 3 photocatalysts can be applied in complex mixtures to have a benchmark for comparing the sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite photocatalytic efficiency towards dyes kinetic rate constants k space time yield sty and photochemical space time yield psty towards each pollutant were calculated fig 7a show the degradation kinetic curves and the obtained rate constants are presented in table 2 the obtained sty and psty are also presented in table 2 4 4 influence of scaling up the reaction and use of raw water on the photodegradation of mo most photocatalytic systems are known to work at small volumes but when they are scaled up the photodegradation efficacy is known to decrease which is usually attributed to poor diffusion rates of the pollutant to and from the catalyst poor dispersion of the photocatalyst in solution will result in poor light penetration to the surface of the photocatalyst 78 the impact of increasing the reaction volume from 120 ml to 1000 ml on the degradation of mo was investigated and the degradation profile is shown in fig 8b while the uv spectrum is presented in fig s8a it was observed that scaling up the reaction volume didn t have a negative effect on the photodegradation of mo in this system as a high degradation efficiency of 90 1 was obtained in 90 min which is comparable to the 88 3 in 90 min using a smaller volume 120 ml with the idea of applying the fabricated sm cfgnc 3 on an industrial scale raw water was sampled from the rand water treatment plant and the hazelmere water treatment plant before purification to investigate the influence of different organic pollutants and salts present in these waters on the photocatalytic degradation of mo using our system 79 from the uv spectra shown in fig 8a water from both treatment plants showed some absorbance below 400 nm which confirms that there are some organic pollutants present in this water while milli q water gave a flat line the degradation profile of spiked raw water with 10 ppm of mo is presented in fig 8b whereas the uv spectra are shown in fig s8 the photodegradation efficiency was found to decrease from 88 3 for milli q water to 83 4 and 76 6 for rand water and hazelmere water respectively after 90 min this decrease in photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of mo with other organic pollutants that are present in the water to the active sites of the photocatalyst also some salts and pollutants present in the water can act as scavengers for the photogenerated reactive radicals which results in a reduction of photodegradation efficacy 69 4 5 photodegradation of pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals are part of emerging water pollutants that are of concern because of the difficulty in removing them during water treatment and the lack of regulations regarding their permissible concentrations in drinking water 12 13 hence in this study the best performing photocatalyst sm cfgnc 3 was employed for the degradation of three pharmaceuticals namely cb zd and am their degradation profiles are shown in fig 8c while the uv spectra are presented in fig s9 am showed the highest photodegradation of 73 9 in 140 min about 71 5 of zd was removed in 140 min while cb showed the least removal of 47 7 in 140 min the differences in removal capacities of these pharmaceuticals can be attributed to their different chemical structures that are associated with their different physicochemical properties and adsorption abilities over the sm cfgnc 3 photocatalyst 80 in addition the k sty and psty obtained for the degraded pharmaceuticals are presented in table 2 while its kinetic degradation curve is shown in fig 7b comparing the removal capacities of dyes and pharmaceuticals explored in this work sm cfgnc 3 shows better degradation efficiencies towards dyes overall the great versatility of the sm cfgnc 3 catalytic system allows it to treat a wide range of organic pollutants 4 6 scavenger experiments and reaction mechanism elucidation to explore the probable mechanism that was followed during the photodegrading of mo utilizing visible light in the presence of sm cfgnc 3 and aps the influence of main reactive species namely holes h hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 during photocatalysis were studied in this study benzoquinone edta and isopropanol were used as scavengers for o2 h and oh respectively 36 69 and their uv spectra are presented in fig s11 fig 8d shows that photodegradation of mo was greatly reduced upon the addition of benzoquinone which implies that o2 radicals are the principal active species involved this is attributed to the ease of converting o2 to o2 radicals at the conduction bands cb of g c3n4 1 10 ev and sm cf 1 305 ev which are more negative compared to the redox potential of the o2 o2 couple 0 33 ev vs nhe 36 81 83 whereas upon the addition of edta the photodegradation of mo was found to decrease moderately indicating that h is involved to a lesser extent through direct oxidation of the molecule lastly isopropanol was observed to have a tiny effect on mo photodegradation as seen in fig 8d implying that the oh radicals play only a trivial function this result is supported by the fact that the valence band vb of g c3n4 1 53 ev and sm cf 0 305 ev are less positive compared to that of oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe and h2o oh 2 68 ev vs nhe indicating that it cannot directly oxidise oh or h2o to form oh radicals 40 thus a small amount of oh radicals that are involved in the photodegradation of mo come from the reaction between water and o2 or so4 58 65 67 from the scavenger experiments observed optical properties and results obtained by other scholars the reaction mechanism for the photodegradation of mo shown in fig 9 was proposed 42 58 to initiate the reaction visible light is shone on the sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite and both g c3n4 and sm cf absorb photons of energy higher than their energy band gaps which excites the electrons e from their vb to the cb leaving h in the vb eq 5 as shown in fig 9 the vb of g c3n4 1 53 ev is more positive relative to the vb of sm cf 0 305 ev hence the photogenerated h will diffuse from the vb of g c3n4 to the vb of sm cf 32 58 while the photogenerated e will move from the cb of sm cf 1 305 ev to the cb of g c3n4 1 10 ev because the cb of sm cf is more negative than that of g c3n4 32 58 the inner electric field that exists in the p n heterojunction drives the movement of photogenerated e and h in the mentioned directions 42 hence the formed electron hole pairs are effectively separated by the p n junction that is formed by these two semiconductors which results in the extended life of these produced h and e pairs due to the retardation of electron hole recombination 42 84 86 the photogenerated e in the cb of g c3n4 and sm cf can directly reduce dissolved o2 to o2 radicals eq 6 and s2o8 2 to so4 radicals eq 7 because of the favourable potential difference besides so4 radicals are also activated by direct illumination of s2o8 2 with visible light eq 9 58 67 in addition the s2o8 2 can act as an electron acceptor thereby increasing the chance of the formation of superoxide radicals on the semiconductor vb eq 8 67 direct production of oh radicals from h2o or oh using h generated at vb of semiconductors is prohibited because of unfavourable potential differences 36 42 however a small amount of oh radicles are produced from the radical reaction of h2o with o2 or so4 radicals eqs 10 and 11 finally the mo has completely degraded o2 so4 oh radicals or h via several intermediates to h2o co2 5 sm cfgnc 3 hv h e 6 o 2 e o 2 7 s 2 o 8 2 e so 4 so 4 2 8 s 2 o 8 2 2e 2so 4 2 9 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2so 4 10 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 h 11 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh 12 mo o 2 or 2so 4 or oh or h h 2 o co 2 intermediate products 4 7 comparison of sm cfgnc 3 with other catalytic systems that were used in mo degradation the photocatalytic performance of sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was compared to the performance of other photocatalyst systems that have been used recently to degrade mo as shown in table 3 even though making a direct comparison of photocatalysts is difficult to do since different parameters such as light source catalyst quantity added oxidant ph initial dye concentration and reaction time were used during the experiments by just comparing the percentage degradation of mo in this investigation to those described in the literature it can be shown that the photocatalyst utilised in this study performed substantially above the average under mild conditions sm cfgnc 3 at ph 3 5 exhibited the highest mo degradation 95 7 of all the systems that used visible light and its ability to be easily separated from treated water gave it an edge thus sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposites remain a potential candidate for the removal of mo from water using visible light amongst other available photocatalysts 4 8 catalyst reusability and its stability during the photodegradation of mo due to the cost that is associated with developing a photocatalyst it is vital to develop a catalyst that can be used many times without losing its photocatalytic efficiency in addition separating the photocatalyst from the reaction mixture is an important factor to consider during the design of the photocatalyst for it to have a chance to be used on a large scale thus in this study a magnetically separable sm cfgnc 3 17 7 emu g was exposed to 4 cycles of photodegrading mo while it was separated from the reaction mixture using a bar magnet according to fig 10a the photodegradation efficiency of sm cfgnc 3 decrease slightly from 85 7 1st cycle to 76 7 in the 4th cycle this loss in photocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the small amount of photocatalyst that was lost during filtration of the aliquots that were sampled for analysis since only 110 mg was recovered after the 4th cycle of the initial 120 mg to check if the photocatalyst stability and its structural integrity were preserved during the reaction ftir and sem were employed for analysing the functional groups and the surface morphology respectively after the 4th cycle fig 10b shows that there is no noticeable distinction between the reused and fresh photocatalyst which confirms that the structural integrity of sm cfgnc 3 was maintained whereas the sem image of the fresh and reused photocatalyst was found to be similar which validates the preservation of the surface morphology of the photocatalyst fig 10c the edx spectrum exhibited in fig 10d and the elemental mapping in fig 10e for used sm cfgnc 3 were found to be similar to that of the fresh photocatalyst which confirms that there is very minimal leaching of the elements from the nanocomposite 5 conclusion the successful fabrication of sm cfgncs was confirmed by a variety of characterisation techniques namely p xrd tem ftir tga sem vsm uv vis edx and bet optimising the ratio of sm cf and g c3n4 proved to be crucial as important photocatalyst properties such as effective charge separation faster electron transfer and lower charge transfer resistance were all found to improve with varying the two materials according to the pl cv and eis studies sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite demonstrated the most desired photocatalyst properties which were further validated by the observed high degradation efficiency of dyes and pharmaceuticals thus confirming it has the best ratio of sm cf and g c3n4 besides having good electrochemical properties sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was found to have a ms of 17 7 emu g while its hc 89 4 oe and mr 4 63 emu g were relatively low the successful formation of the sm cfgncs and their purity was confirmed by the p xrd analysis which was further supported by the data observed in tga analysis and edx spectra sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was found to have a surface area of 5 26 m2 g and its pore size was 3 06 nm in addition the sm cfgncs exhibited strong and wide absorption bands in the visible light region 360 800 nm of the uv vis spectra and a moderate band gap in the range of 1 85 2 29 ev which allow them to effectively utilize visible light during photocatalysts the photocatalytic activities for catalysts during the degradation of mo were found in the decreasing order of 88 3 86 3 84 8 84 6 83 6 76 1 and 60 4 for sm cfgnc 3 sm cfgnc 2 sm cfgnc 1 sm cfgnc 0 5 g c3n4 sm cfgnc 0 3 and sm cf respectively after 90 min at ph 6 at ph 3 5 the highest photodegradation of mo 95 7 was observed in 90 min which shows that acidic conditions provide the best environment for efficient photodegradation the photodegradation of mo was found to increase with an increase in aps amount 0 50 mg however it decreased with the increase in mo initial concentration 5 20 ppm from the trapping experiments superoxide radicals were found to be the responsible species for degrading mo thus using the results from the scavenger s studies and optical properties the reaction mechanism was proposed in addition 90 1 degradation of mo was observed in the scaled up experiment while good mo degradation efficiencies were also obtained for the spiked raw water from the rand water treatment plant 83 4 and hazelmere treatment plant 76 6 the sm cfgnc 3 nanocomposite was also applied to the photodegradation of different dyes and pharmaceuticals the photodegradation susceptibility of these dyes was found in the decreasing order of 98 9 88 3 77 and 40 in 90 min for cr mo my and tz respectively while 73 3 removal was obtained for the dye mixture whereas for am zd and cb a removal of 73 9 71 5 and 47 7 in 140 min was observed respectively lastly the reusability study showed a minimal loss in photocatalytic performance after 4 cycles while the integrity of the photocatalyst was preserved hence this great versatility of the sm cfgnc 3 catalytic system to photodegrade a wide range of organic pollutants using visible light and with ease separation from purified water using an external magnetic
