5880,the shrinking groundwater resource is a major cause of ecosystem imbalance which is further intensified by rapid changes in land use and land cover lulc and climate in the lower chenab canal lcc of pakistan present study aims to investigate groundwater dynamics using a novel approach by incorporating remote sensing data in combination with actual patterns of lulc while statistical approach is employed for downscaling of climatic data under two emission scenarios including h3a2 and h3b2 a 3 d numerical groundwater flow model is used for evaluating current patterns of groundwater use and its dynamics the results of water budget show a total horizontal groundwater inflow of 2844 mm3 and an outflow of 2720 2 mm3 the groundwater abstraction through pumping is about 17374 43 mm3 as compared to groundwater recharge of 19933 20 mm3 yields a surplus of 2682 87 mm3 which raises groundwater levels in major parts of lcc change in rice cultivation has the highest impact on groundwater levels in upper regions of lcc whereas higher negative changes are observed for lower parts under decreased fodder area in place of rice cotton and sugarcane for climate scenarios a rise in groundwater level is observed for 2011 to 2025 whereas its drop is expected for the periods 2026 2035 and 2036 2045 under h3a2 scenario due to no imminent threats to groundwater there is an opportunity for groundwater development through water re allocation groundwater status under h3b2 emission regime is rather complex during 2011 2025 water management under such situation requires revisiting of cropping patterns and augmenting water supply through additional surface water resources considering the limitations of the current study it is recommended to update model with river flow under changing climate and to extend investigations for combined effects of lulc and climate change keywords groundwater modelling statistical downscaling land use land cover water budget climate change scenarios 1 introduction groundwater constitutes one of the largest fresh water resources and plays a myriad of roles through supporting hydrological cycle taylor et al 2013 supplying water for human consumption and helping to maintain ecological values of many regions in the world ipcc 2007 other major beneficiaries of groundwater include industrial uses and irrigation application globally the share of groundwater for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes is estimated to be 36 42 and 27 respectively taylor et al 2013 agriculture is thus considered to be the major consumer of groundwater and this share is even greater in case of arid and semi arid regions of the world including india pakistan china and middle eastern countries gleeson et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 utilization of water supplies for successful agriculture in pakistan is dependent both on surface and groundwater resources the decreased river water supplies in the recent years have put extra pressure on groundwater for irrigated agriculture which is depicted by quantum increase in groundwater pumping from 10 billion m3 in 1965 to 68 billion m3 in 2002 usman et al 2014 as a result this situation poses a big challenge for sustainable groundwater management in the country implying that water resources need to be utilized for an indefinite time without causing unacceptable environmental social and economic consequences gleeson et al 2012 it is only possible if every single drop of water is used in the context of socio economic development and protection of ecosystems katko and hukka 2015 however despite the critical importance of groundwater in integrated water resources management it is not duly considered optimally worldwide foster and ait kadi 2012 unep cbd 2010 similar concerns have been raised by the european commission groundwater directive and water framework directive according to which it is necessary to investigate how groundwater use may affect ecosystems and vice versa land use and land cover lulc changes are main human induced parameters altering the groundwater dynamics especially in agricultural areas albhaisi et al 2013 nevertheless impact of these changes on groundwater system and its behaviour has not been investigated extensively narany et al 2017 majority of studies on hydrology are based on stream flows dynamics relating lulc and effects of forest changes on hydrological behaviours e g dams et al 2008 brown et al 2005 for instance bahremand et al 2006 have assessed the impact of reforestation on the hydrology of watershed similarly sarwar and eggers 2006 investigated the impact of lulc change on groundwater behaviour in the indus basin all of the afore mentioned studies have utilized hypothetical lulc scenarios for analysis thus lacking in investigation under real patterns of such changes there are also studies where lulc models were employed to generate future lulc scenarios under expected anthropogenic conditions niehoff et al 2002 lin et al 2007 tong and liu 2006 tang et al 2005 mccoll and aggett 2007 dams et al 2008 most of the above mentioned modelling studies only focus on the surface hydrological processes ignoring groundwater spatiality due to computational constraints data availability and model complexities exception to this are dams et al 2008 batelaan and de smedt 2007 klöcking and haberlandt 2002 and batelaan et al 2003 who have investigated the impacts of lulc change on groundwater with a fully distributed modelling approach they used wetspass model which estimates groundwater recharge by incorporating actual evapotranspiration and precipitation albhaisi et al 2013 nevertheless this model cannot utilize irrigation as an input parameter for estimation of distributed recharge which is an important input for the current study region therefore another approach is utilized where a distributed recharge was estimated by using a complex water balance model by incorporating data of actual evapotranspiration lulc from remote sensing techniques at higher spatial resolutions climate change is another potential variable which can induce changes in natural ecosystem pakistan is considered to be 7th most vulnerable country to climate change ipcc 2007 the reality of neglecting groundwater under climate change is also not very different from lulc according to taylor et al 2012 groundwater and dependent ecosystem have received least attention from the scientific communities in another ipcc report it is admitted that there has been very little research on the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater although its share in world s water use particularly in rural areas of arid and semi arid regions is considerable ipcc 2008 effects of climate change on nature are not as simple as are considered for instance crosbie et al 2009 show considerable variation in trend and magnitude of climate change in terms of temperature rainfall evapotranspiration and vapour pressure another simplistic rule posits that annual recharge is considerably affected by annual rainfall only mccallum et al 2010 however there are some exceptions to the rule of more rainfall leading to more recharge as it can also be affected by rainfall seasonality intensity humidity air temperature and crop evapotranspiration under changing concentrations of co2 increased variability in rainfall may increase groundwater recharge due to intensive rainfalls that ultimately infiltrate to become part of water table at the same time although higher temperature means higher crop evapotranspiration rates and hence there is less net groundwater recharge hetze et al 2008 and vice versa crosbie et al 2009 have also reported that increase in rainfall does not always lead to an increase in recharge it is therefore necessary to undertake local studies that assess the specific combination of parameters which could be affected by climate change for irrigated regions such as for the current study region the potential parameters of interest may be rainfall and crop evapotranspiration as both can behave differently due to changes in climate harmsen et al 2009 therefore the current study was designed to evaluate groundwater resources and to study their dynamics under changing lulc and climate in a complex agricultural region with limited data availability the specific objectives include i development of realistic lulc change scenarios and downscaling of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration for the synthesis of future climate change projections under ipcc emission scenarios including h3a2 and h3b2 ii assessment of water budget at different spatial scales of lcc and iii to investigate the effects of lulc and climate change on groundwater dynamics using modelling approach 2 study area data 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location the current study is conducted in punjab pakistan targeting one of the largest irrigation schemes of the indus basin irrigation system ibis called rechna doab it is a land between ravi and chenab rivers mainly covering the districts of gujranwala hafizabad sheikhupura faisalabad jhang chiniot and toba tek singh the gross area of this irrigation system is about 2 98 million hectares mha out of which 2 3 mha is cultivated and irrigated land present study targets the eastern parts of the lower chenab canal lcc east mainly comprised of districts of faisalabad and toba tek singh fig 1 2 1 2 irrigation system agriculture lower chenab canal lcc constitutes a major portion of rechna doab which off takes from khanki headwork on the river chenab lcc is divided into two parts lcc east and lcc west for irrigation administration purposes entire lcc is split into different irrigation subdivisons lcc east comprised of 10 irrigation subdivisions with overall area of about 1 24 million hectares fig 1 these irrigation subdivisions include sagar chuharkana paccadala mohlan buchiana tandlianwala kanya tarkhani bhagat and sultanpur the cropping year can be sub divided into two seasons namely kharif and rabi the kharif season generally starts from may and ends in october while rabi season prevails from november to april rice and wheat are the two major crops during kharif and rabi seasons respectively the other crops cultivated during rabi season are rabi fodders mainly barseem and oat while cotton and kharif fodders mainly sorghum maize and millet are grown in kharif season sugarcane is the annual crop which is cultivated in the months of september and february usman et al 2012 2015a 2 1 3 climate the climate of the area is mainly arid to semi arid with very hot summers during which temperatures range between 21 and 50 c whereas winters are cold with temperature ranges between 0 and 27 c the average annual precipitation varies from 290 mm in the south west to 1046 mm in the north east of the irrigation scheme and highest rainfalls occur during the monsoon months i e from july to september which is about 60 of the total average annual rainfall usman et al 2012 2 1 4 topography soil the area is relatively flat with mean sea elevation range between 200 m in the north eastern side to 130 m in south western side the study area is a part of an abandoned flood plain of which deeper parts are formed by the underlying metamorphic and igneous rocks of precambrian age loam and sandy clay loam is predominant in the upper parts of lcc whereas the lower parts consist of fine sandy loam and sandy loam hydro geological investigations were carried out during the 1957 1960 period in and around the study region wherein 327 test holes were drilled the maximum thickness of alluvium is not accurately known however these investigations show the lithological information over 200 m depth nearly everywhere in lcc the alluvial complex is of heterogeneous nature and forms a fairly transmissive aquifer system usman et al 2018 illustrated the lithological details of selected test boreholes at three different cross sections in lcc according to which thickness of alluvium complex is relatively higher in lower regions compared to upper regions which comprise of small lenses of clay and gravel throughout the area khan 1978 has summarized the results of pumping tests and lithological mechanical analyses of test holes according to which hydraulic conductivity varies from 24 to 264 m day 1 and specific yield values vary from 1 to 33 in the entire rechna doab 2 2 data major data types for the current study are collected and utilized from secondary sources e g governmental and private organizations the brief description of each data

features like model boundaries rivers canals pumping wells etc are collected from punjab irrigation department the other data include shape geometries of different canals and information on their lined unlined canal sections 2 2 2 hydrogeological data well log data at different locations of the study region are collected from water and power development authority wapda pakistan tube well abstraction is a major outflow of water from the study region the census data of tube wells were collected form punjab development statistics while data of different aquifer properties were collected from the international water management institute iwmi lahore 2 2 3 meteorological and crop data the meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and rainfall are required for fulfilling different specific objectives these data were collected from pakistan meteorological department pmd for different meteorological stations located in lcc including lahore faisalabad toba tek singh and pindi bhattian the secondary data of cultivated crops over the years in the study region are collected from crop reporting services of the government of punjab 2 2 4 statistical downscaling model sdsm data requirements two types of daily time series namely daily historic weather station data and large scale variables ncep daily predictors are used to develop sdsm there are mainly four weather stations located in or near to study area including faisalabad toba tek singh lahore and pindi bhattian since daily based long period weather data is required for sdsm which was only available for lahore and faisalabad stations from these two stations daily data regarding maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and rainfall were collected from 1970 to 2014 sdsm output daily time series by forcing the ncep or hadcm3 predictors usman et al 2018 mahmood and babel 2012 huang et al 2011 the data of which were obtained cost free from http www cics uvic ca scenarios index cgi scenarios for the period of 1961 2010 and 1996 2050 respectively 3 method fig 2 shows the detailed work flow of the current study according to which the overall methodology can be divided into three parts including data pre processing methods analysis method and modelling method 3 1 data pre process method 3 1 1 groundwater levels piezometric groundwater level data are collected from salinity monitoring organization smo pakistan from 2005 to 2012 these data are available twice a year once pre monsoon and other post monsoon further details on processing of these data for the current study can be read from usman et al 2015c 3 1 2 remote sensing data monthly rainfall data were retrieved from tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm at a spatial scale of 25 km which were downscaled to 1 km for further use by employing the procedure reported by chen et al 2014 this data were utilized in estimation of groundwater recharge the other data from remote sensing sources include surface elevation which were required for describing the geometry of the 3 d groundwater flow model this data were derived form a digital elevation model dem at 90 m spatial resolution by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm from the website of the consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar consortium for spatial information cgiar csi http srtm csi cgiar org the data required for construction of land use land cover maps and estimation of actual evapotranspiration include normalized difference vegetation index ndvi emissivity albedo land surface temperature this data were retrieved from modis at different spatial resolutions from both aqua and terra sensors 3 2 analysis method 3 2 1 crop inventory crop inventory were prepared using modis ndvi data with a spatial resolution of 250 m downloaded from both aqua and terra sensors the data available from mid may to mid october were downloaded for kharif and similarly all data during mid november to mid april were used for rabi season crops during year 2005 2012 for identification of different crops the temporal profile of ndvi trends were drawn after performing unsupervised clustering using isodata algorithm tou and gonzalez 1974 for instance the classified crop map of kharif 2007 and rabi 2007 08 can be seen in annex 1 the classification results were verified by constructing error matrix and its comparison with secondary source crop census data results show that wheat and rice are major crops in rabi and kharif seasons respectively the overall accuracies for different rabi and kharif seasons are 82 83 and 78 21 respectively the kappa values for rabi seasons are 0 73 and 0 71 for kharif seasons land use land cover change detection results indicate that rice and wheat are less volatile for change moreover change between cotton and rice is less common due to their different agro climatic cropping conditions the more detailed descripting of methodology and results can be read from usman et al 2015a 3 2 2 actual evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is the single term that links land surface energy balance and surface water balances zhao et al 2013 this forms a key process of hydrological cycle and regarded valuable in water balance modelling especially for irrigated areas usman et al 2015a evapotranspiration is generally not considered directly in hydrological studies but as a recharge which varies spatially due to differences in water use for various land uses wegehenkel 2009 surface energy balance algorithm sebal devised by bastiaanssen et al 1998 is adopted for the current study for the estimation of evapotranspiration as reported in usman et al 2015b 2014 the results show almost doubled crop water use 546 mm in kharif as compared to 274 mm in rabi with significant variability for different years from 2005 to 2012 crop specific water use shows rice and sugarcane as major consumers with average values of 593 mm and 580 mm respectively followed by cotton 541 5 mm and kharif fodder 509 5 mm 3 2 3 groundwater recharge water balance approaches using conventional data and the remote sensing data were used for the estimation of groundwater recharge during 2005 2012 conventional application of water balance method results in recharge at a regional scale whereas using remote sensing data for the purpose yield recharge at finer scales i e for the current study at 1 km spatial resolution recharge results obtained from water balance method and water table fluctuation approach are comparable both at irrigation subdivision and 1 km2 spatial scales rainfall is the main recharge source during the kharif season followed by field percolation losses during rabi seasons seepage from canal is the major source net groundwater recharge is mainly positive during all kharif seasons resulted in gradual increase in groundwater levels in major parts of the study area the more details of recharge results can be read from usman et al 2015c 3 3 modeling method 3 3 1 groundwater numerical model the groundwater modelling system feflow v6 1 was used for the modelling procedure which has been successfully tested and applied in various benchmark studies around the world diersch et al 2002 a 3 d finite element groundwater flow model is set up the fundamental basis of that it introduces the darcy equation in the mass conservation equation to represent the mass conservation of any phase diersch et al 2002 1 t ε α ρ α x i ε α ρ α v i α ε α ρ α q ρ α where t is time t ε α is volume fraction of α phase ρ α is density of α phase ml 3 xi is eulerian spatial coordinate vector v i α is velocity vector of α phase lt 1 q ρ α is mass supply of α phase t 1 further the equation was modified for the mass conservation of water with uniform density and viscosity 2 t ε f x i q i f q ρ f the term q i f is known as the darcy flux which can be described for water with uniform density and viscosity as below 3 q i f k i j h x j ρ f e j where k i j is tensor of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ρ f is water density ml 3 and e j is gravitational unit vector both steady and transient groundwater numerical models are setup by utilizing various data and their calibration validation and sensitivity analysis are performed fig 3 shows the flow diagram of modelling setting up and running different tasks before its utilization for the current study this modeling study employs pest to automate calibration of a transient flow model results of automated calibrated models are compared with manually calibrated models an advanced tikhonov regularization algorithm was employed for carrying out the automated pilot point pp method the results show that automated pp is more flexible as compared to other approaches statistical indicators show that this method result reliable model calibration as values of coefficient of determination range from 0 98 to 0 99 nash sutcliffe efficiency range from 0 964 to 0 976 and root mean square errors range from 1 68 m to 1 23 m for manual and automated approaches respectively validation of automated pp result me as 0 969 and rmse as 1 31 m sensitivity analysis results show that hydraulic conductivity is a more influential parameter the more detailed results can be found in usman et al 2018 3 3 2 statistical downscaling of climatic parameters global circulation models gcms are considered as major tools to predict the changes and variability in climate variables on global and continental levels the outputs of gcm models cannot be used directly to investigate the impact of climate change in environmental and hydrological studies on local regional scale wilby et al 2000 the most important solution in this regard is to build a bridge between gcm scales a coarse scale and local scale 0 50 km is downscaling wetterhall et al 2006 xu 1999 statistical downscaling sd approaches establish statistical links among the local scale and large scale variables and such methods are computationally inexpensive and fast and hence have been adopted by a wider community of researchers wilby et al 2000 sdsm is one of many statistical models which is widely used throughout the world to downscale important climatic variables like precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration etc for assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrologic responses chu et al 2010 this model is a hybrid of multiple linear regression and stochastic weather generator wilby and harris 2006 multiple linear regression is used to identify and select some suitable predictors from the atmospheric predictors in sdsm by utilizing the combination of the correlation matrix partial correlation histograms scatter plots and p values wilby and dawson 2013 the current study uses sdsm by employing the annual model which considers similar type of regression parameters for each month of year the other category of model includes conditional and unconditional models the conditional sub model is used for variables such as precipitation while the unconditional sub model is used for independent variable such as temperature chu et al 2010 wilby and dawson 2013 the fourth root transformation function is used for precipitation data to render it to normal before its further application for regression analysis huang et al 2011 mahmood and babel 2012 h3a2 and h3b2 are the ipcc emission scenarios a2 and b2 of hadcm3 respectively hadcm3 is selected for sdsm because it showed better agreement during evaluation of various gcms mahmood and babel 2012 akhtar et al 2008 huang et al 2011 selection of predictands and screening of predictors temperature and precipitation are considered to be most important factors for agricultural region because the first one directly control crop water needs by affecting evapotranspiration and second one causes major contribution to groundwater recharge usman et al 2015c since there is no direct use of temperature for recharge estimation but it is a major variable for estimation of crop evapotranspiration therefore actual evapotranspiration is estimated using temperature data along with other necessary climatic parameters by employing advection aridity approach usman et al 2015b 2014 screening of predictors is key to statistical downscaling using sdsm wilby et al 2000 there are about 26 predictors for using in downscaling process and the complete list of which with detailed description is available from mahmood and babel 2012 the process of predictors screening adopted in the current study employs an approach where a combination of partial correlation correlation matrix and p value is used as devised by gagnon et al 2005 and mahmood and babel 2012 this process of predictor selection is a quantitative procedure where the selection of first and most suitable predictor is relatively straightforward and easy but the selection of subsequent predictors is more subjective in the first step of this quantitative approach a correlation matrix between ncep predictors and predictands is made then only the predictors of high correlation coefficient are screened out and ranked in descending order the first predictor having the strongest correlation among all predictors is selected as a super predictor following this the regressing of highly correlated predictors is performed individually in the presence of super predictor and the absolute correlation coefficient between the predictor and predictand r1 the absolute correlation coefficient between individual predictors r2 absolute partial correlation pr and p value are obtained in the next step the predictors are eliminated with p value greater than α 0 05 to render the statistically significant results and the highly correlated predictors 0 5 in this case are taken out in order to avoid any multi co linearity for each predictor percentage reduction in an absolute partial correlation prp is calculated with respect to absolute correlation the relationship p r p p r r 1 r 1 is used for the purpose the predictor with minimum prp value is selected as the second suitable predictor because this predictor has very insignificant multi co linearity with super predictor the subsequent predictors can be selected by following the same procedure but there will be two super predictors in the second repetition according to mahmood and babel 2012 mostly one to three predictors are enough during calibration of predictands without multi co linearity the screening of potential predictors for precipitation and actual evapotranspiration at different meteorological stations can be seen from annex 2 calibration validation of sdsm results and bias correction daily data of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration from 1961 to 1995 is used for the calibration of sdsm annual sub models are developed individually for each predictands for precipitation unconditional sub models with fourth root transformation while for actual evapotranspiration conditional sub models without transformation are used huang et al 2011 ordinary least square algorithm is used for optimization of the best fit the calibrated models are used for simulation of the predictands from 1996 to 2010 using ncep h3a2 and h3b2 predictors by generating 20 ensembles and the mean of these ensembles is used different statistical indicators are used for comparison of sdsm results with observed data the indictors include coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean m standard deviation sd relative error in mean re m and relative error in standard deviation re sd for the periods of calibration and validation bias correction is applied to compensate for any tendency to over or under estimate the mean of conditional processes by sdsm wilby and dawson 2013 for this purpose a standard quantile mapping technique using qmap r programming package was utilized for the validated period from 1996 to 2010 the statistical comparison is performed between un biased sdsm downscaled data of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration and observed data it is done to achieve a more realistic picture of future climate mahmood and babel 2012 3 3 3 land use scenarios water utilizations of different crop types are calculated by combining the information of actual evapotranspiration with their cultivation areas both of these information are integrated for establishing patterns of crop water use within lulc classes and to identify potential areas of different lulc change in different irrigation subdivisions of lcc employing zonal statistics practically the cultivated area under a particular lulc class is not spread uniform throughout the lcc but some specific lulc classes are dominant in particular irrigation subdivisions similarly lulc change is also not uniform throughout lcc but it is highly dependent on overall areal coverage of a particular class in specific sub region due to this fact and hence to consider spatial variability of any lulc change total area under any lulc class is segregated at irrigation subdivision level the estimated proportions take into consideration the overall suggested change in any lulc at lcc scale subsequently different lulc scenarios are generated in order to feed their results to modelling and to explore their impacts on possible changes in groundwater levels to achieve this end the following two conditions are followed while devising lulc change scenarios 1 ensuring the realistic limits of the cropped area of all lulc classes while introducing changes in a particular lulc class based on estimated results type i scenarios 2 maintaining the cropped area of a particular lulc class within its realistic change limits without consideration to cropped areas of other lulc classes type ii scenarios there are total seven lulc scenarios which were finalized for the current study it is also to be noted that increase decrease in lulc area of any particular class is based on its current status in lcc i e year 2011 12 the latest study year moreover lulc change scenarios are based only on classes in kharif cropping seasons as options for change are limited during rabi seasons and also the difference in consumptive water use is less among rabi crops usman et al 2015b 2014 table 1 represents the summary of the selected lulc scenarios for future groundwater simulations 3 3 4 climate change scenarios six climate change scenarios are devised considering actual evapotranspiration precipitation and combined effect of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation under both h3a2 and h3b2 emission scenarios utilization of lulc and climate change scenarios for groundwater modelling is accompanied by a complex procedure as both types of scenarios do affect groundwater recharge since raster based recharge is utilized for groundwater modelling as explained in usman et al 2018 2015b the same approach is adopted for preparation of recharge data under different scenarios of lulc and climate change since specific change is always relative to some baseline time or period therefore different baselines were selected for both lulc and climate change scenarios as mentioned above construction of lulc scenarios is based on changes in cropping patterns prevailing in cropping year 2011 12 however for climate change scenarios a baseline period from 2002 to 2012 is selected and any change is worked out for future periods 2016 2025 2026 35 and 2036 45 by using the following relationship 6 c h a n g e x y y 100 where x is the mean for the future period e g 2016 2025 and y is the mean for the baseline period of 2002 2012 there are different ways to deal with climate change data depending on their further application and objective however for the current study change is a constant value for any year during the considered period for instance a constant change e g 10 in 2016 will be the change with respect to 2002 similarly 10 change in 2025 will be with respect to 2012 there is another way where different values for each individual year can be estimated by comparing data of particular future year to the baseline data 2002 2012 and therefore to capture the time variation of change from year to year however for the current study future climate change data is dealt by considering a constant change because the objective is not to track the changes in groundwater behaviour yearly rather it is to investigate the general situation at the end of a particular time period other reason is to simplify the preparation of 1 km 1 km spatial resolution pixel based recharge data of more than 30 years for regional groundwater flow model 3 3 5 model updating in order to address the spatial variability the water saving or its more utilization is treated at pixel scale instead of irrigation subdivision level annex 3 shows the procedure of preparing land use thematic maps whereas fig 4 depicts the methodology of preparing updated recharge rasters under changed lulc for preparing such rasters target regions of particular lulc change are identified from results of lulc change detection usman et al 2015a and then pixels are identified to be converted from a particular lulc to another stratified randomized pixels selection was made using specialized code written using r programming it is to be noted that decrease increase in cultivated area of a particular lulc under each scenario is not an abrupt change instead it is based on a uniform gradual change from base period to 2030 precipitation and actual evapotranspiration are not used independently in groundwater modelling but they are utilized in form of recharge fig 5 represents the procedure of preparing rasters of recharge under changing climate scenarios the rasters of changed evapotranspiration are used directly for estimation of modified recharge while rasters of changed precipitation are first processed by excluding effective precipitation and other losses from total rainfall as explained in usman et al 2015c before its utilization for estimation of modified recharge 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of groundwater flow models reliable calibration process means to develop a model which reasonably represents nature including recharge and discharge groundwater flow with a result of reasonable matches between simulated and observed groundwater levels usman et al 2018 in the first step the groundwater model was calibrated manually in steady state by varying values of hydraulic conductivity and groundwater heads of october 2005 were utilized as an initial condition different statistical indicators are used which show reasonable agreement between simulated and observed groundwater heads as coefficient of determination r2 mean error me root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient are 0 99 m 0 98 m 1 58 m and 0 98 m respectively after steady state calibration the model was transformed to transient case with initial heads from steady model modeller s pre calibration expert judgment and automated calibration was performed for automated calibration using pest the parameters bound set for all pilot points ranged between 10 6 m day 1 to 300 m day 1 and 10 7 m day 1 to 30 m day 1 for horizontal and vertical conductivities respectively and for effective porosity it was ranged between 0 009 and 0 250 usman et al 2018 the upper model layer could be well represented in explaining most of results as the groundwater is well connected in the region thus it could have been simulated with 2d model settings as well for controlling the automation of pest for transient model calibration about 585 observations of piezometric water heads were used the comparison was made between simulated and observed piezometric water levels for performance of the groundwater flow simulated by feflow in fefelow measured piezometric heads are calculated with reference to mean sea level i e requirement of feflow 3d model the piezometric data winter 2005 to winter 2008 were used for the transient model calibration the measured and modelled heads were drawn on a scatter plot fig 6 a which indicates successful calibration of the model as majority of the points fall near or on the diagonal line different statistical error parameters including r2 me pbias and rmse indicate reliable results of calibration the value of r2 for calibration is 0 99 similarly me is 0 976 which shows that the deviation of modelled heads from observed heads is only 2 2 the value of percent bias pbias is only 0 026 whereas the rmse of the modelled heads from observed ones is 1 23 m after successful transient model calibration it was validated for the piezometric data from summer 2009 to winter 2011 the results of model validation are represented in scatter chart as presented in fig 6b the value of me is 0 969 which indicates that deviation of modelled heads from observed heads is only 3 0 the values of pbias and rmse are 0 205 and 1 31 m respectively pointing towards reasonable validation results further details of these results can be read from usman et al 2018 4 2 water budget and variation of darcy flux water budget provides detail information about different components of model inflow and outflow along with providing clues to check whether model solution remained stable during simulation or not water budget calculated for the groundwater model calibration and validation period of model simulation is presented in table 2 the results are presented at whole lcc scale as well as for upper and lower lcc scales these results show the detailed summary of flow for each boundary condition type for source and sinks and for storage capture and release whereas imbalance term reflects the residual error horizontal inflow and outflow calculated by the model refer to water flow rates horizontally these rates are generally in order of magnitude less than the vertical exchange rates total period water budget of lcc shows the total horizontal water inflow of 2632 mm3 and 212 mm3 through dirichlet and neumann boundaries respectively whereas water outflow through these boundaries is 1156 4 mm3 and 1563 8 mm3 respectively water outflow through pumping from lcc is about 17374 4 mm3 while water inflow through groundwater recharge is about 19933 2 mm3 the difference of storage capture and release with a positive value of 2682 4 mm3 for whole lcc indicates rising groundwater level during calibration and validation periods the results are in concurrence with usman et al 2015c who show an increasing trend in water level at majority irrigation subdivisions of lcc the results also show some discrepancies in the form of water imbalance which amounts to about 1 10 mm3 being negligible for lcc considering magnitude of total water inflows and outflows to model domain while comparing results for water budget in table 2 it is clear that dirichlet inflow and outflow is quite less for upper lcc in relation to lower lcc this difference arises due to the fact that the lower parts of lower lcc are connected to river ravi and trimu sidhnai link canal whereas the upper lcc is only connected to qadirabad balloki link canal horizontal inflow to upper lcc through neumann boundaries is also less as compared to lower lcc however the difference is larger for outflows where the outflow through neumann i e 1120 7 mm3 is quite large for upper lcc as compared to lower lcc i e 443 1 mm3 the groundwater pumping from the upper and lower lcc is about 8078 2 mm3 and 9296 4 mm3 against recharge of 9997 7 mm3 and 9935 5 mm3 respectively water budget for lcc shows an average total water influx of about 1 11323e 6 m3 day in the model domain through dirichlet and neumann boundaries with an average outflow of 1 064657e 6 m3 day respectively likewise average total influx in the model domain by areal recharge is about 7 802e 6 m3 day whereas average total outflow through pumping is about 6 800e 6 m3 day analysis of the darcy flux variations in four different model layers for different irrigation subdivisions is presented in fig 7 whereas the spatial distribution of flux is given in annex 4 for all four model layers results indicate relatively higher flux in lower parts of lcc in third and fourth model layers whereas higher values are observed in upper lcc in first and second model layers the gradient of regional groundwater flow indicates potential aquifer zones in shallow depths of upper lcc and deeper depths of lower lcc overall average flux for different model layers the highest for third layer with a value of 0 0375 m day followed by 0 0343 m day for fourth model layer whereas it is 0 0171 and 0 0261 m day for model layers first and second respectively 4 3 water utilization by various land use the details of different lulc change scenarios and overall possible water saving or more water utilization against each scenario relative to current water usage are presented in table 3 at each irrigation subdivisions level out of many possible scenarios provided in usman et al 2015a only 7 lulc scenarios are selected for the current study based on their impact on water utilization in different parts of lcc for instance scenarios 1 6 and 7 show greater change in water utilization in upper irrigation subdivisions while scenarios 4 5 and 7 target middle irrigation subdivisions and scenarios 2 4 and 7 have greater impact on water utilization in downstream irrigation subdivisions the overall analysis of more water utilization saving at lcc level indicate that only scenarios 1 3 and 4 result in decrease of water consumption than previous and rest of the scenarios show more demand for water under modified lulc the negative values depict increased water demand and vice versa under changed lulc scenarios very few scenarios show similar changes in consumptive water use at lcc scale however the variation of change for each irrigation subdivision is significant and leads to spatial variability of water table which would be further prominent at 1 km spatial scale 4 4 statistical downscaling and climate change scenarios 4 4 1 calibration of sdsm the selected predictors for the calibration of sdsm can be seen from annex 2 the results presented in table 4 shows that the model performed reasonably well in case of actual evapotranspiration however the results for precipitation are relatively weak for both stations the difference between model mean precipitation and observed mean precipitation is large relative errors of mean and relative errors of standard deviation are much greater for precipitation than actual evapotranspiration different researchers have evaluated sdsm for different variables including precipitation using different models and reported similar types of results for instance huang et al 2011 developed three different models for downscaling of precipitation and their results vary from weak to medium values for different performance indicators e g r2 ranges from 0 11 to 0 97 whereas mahmood and babel 2012 investigated sdsm for two models monthly and annual and according to them monthly model performed better r2 is 0 992 as compared to annual model r2 is 0 688 overall there is a consensus among different studies that temperature and evapotranspiration performed better that precipitation in all cases mahmood and babel 2012 khan et al 2006 dibike and coulibaly 2005 wilby et al 2000 the reason is heterogeneous nature of the precipitation occurrence amounts and therefore difficult to simulate accurately wilby et al 2000 fig 8 indicate the graphical comparison between the observed data and the monthly simulated mean output of sdsm in case of evapotranspiration sdsm underestimates the results from march to may for lahore and march to june for faisalabad whereas it overestimates the results for november december january and february for both stations it also overestimates results during july to october which is more prominent for faisalabad in comparison to lahore with regard to precipitation the results by sdsm are underestimated in majority of the months during whole year especially in rainy months july to august there is only small overestimation of sdsm results during october and november in comparison to observed precipitation 4 4 2 validation of sdsm prior bias correction fig 8 depict that the validation results are better for actual evapotranspiration than for precipitation the r2 values for evapotranspiration range between 0 89 and 0 98 and 0 83 to 0 92 for lahore and faisalabad respectively the relative error in mean and relative error in standard deviation range between 1 02 and 2 03 and 13 87 to 20 64 respectively for lahore and they are ranged between 1 55 and 3 82 and 19 35 to 21 59 respectively for faisalabad the values of different performance indicators for precipitation indicate that this variable is reproduced relatively weak as compared to evapotranspiration as values of r2 ranged from 0 80 to 0 83 for lahore and from 0 76 to 0 80 for faisalabad the other parameters including the relative error in mean and relative error in standard deviation also confirm the results as considerable higher values of these parameters are obtained for both stations in comparison to evapotranspiration table 5 nevertheless it is to be noted that the results of coefficient of determination and predicting mean are quite comparable with observed precipitation with more variation for relative errors this indicate that the models lack in predicting full variation in observed precipitation for both stations however the mean precipitation simulated by sdsm is comparable with observed data 4 4 3 validation of sdsm with bias correction the results in the previous section indicate that there are large biases especially for precipitation which should be removed to further improve the validation results the detail results of which in form of different statistical indicators are presented in table 6 the bias corrected downscaled mean results are also compared graphically with observed data as shown in fig 9 from all the statistical indicators it is obvious that both evapotranspiration and precipitation results were improved especially the precipitation results improved significantly as r2 values increased from 0 80 to 0 84 to 0 98 0 99 root mean square values decreased from 26 52 to 28 08 mm to 4 04 7 30 mm and relative errors in mean and standard deviation decreased from 41 09 to 58 13 and 58 42 64 19 to 10 01 22 47 and 8 07 14 79 respectively for lahore similarly the results for precipitation at faisalabad also showed significant improvement as r2 increased from 0 76 to 0 80 to 0 98 0 99 root mean square values decreased from 17 72 to 17 91 mm to 6 18 10 72 mm and relative errors in mean and standard deviation are decreased from 28 34 to 32 59 to 6 67 13 34 and 49 11 52 64 to 7 14 11 54 respectively the results from all variables including ncep h3a2 and h3b2 are satisfactory now and indicate strong applicability of sdsm to downscaling evapotranspiration and precipitation under both emission scenarios i e h3a2 and h3b2 4 4 4 downscaling evapotranspiration and precipitation under future emission scenarios table 7 presents the projected results of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation for different time durations i e 2016 25 2026 35 and 2036 45 with reference to base line period according to both emission scenarios the change in evapotranspiration at both stations is consistence with difference in magnitude during rabi seasons with increase of 2 23 and 1 51 in 2016 25 at faisalabad similarly there is an increase of 6 19 and 2 52 in 2026 35 and 5 87 and 7 29 in 2036 45 for lahore during the same season there is an increase in evapotranspiration of 2 20 and 1 18 in 2016 25 9 46 and 2 59 in 2036 45 the change during kharif seasons is majorly consistence except during 2026 35 where the change in evapotranspiration is 2 22 and 0 95 at faisalabad whereas at lahore the change is 1 36 and 5 36 under h3a2 and h3b2 respectively with regard to precipitation the future change during rabi seasons is more inconsistence for both emission scenarios for instance there is an increase of 1 68 in 2016 25 at faisalabad 4 67 and 5 79 at lahore in 2016 25 and 2036 45 against a decrease of 4 57 32 19 and 31 61 respectively under scenarios h3a2 and h3b2 conversely there is a decrease of 7 31 and 0 18 in 2026 35 and 2036 45 against an increase of 4 26 3 08 at faisalabad in case of kharif seasons the change suggests that precipitation at both stations is generally increasing for all future periods and it is also mostly consistence except for 2016 25 at lahore where there is an increase of 33 for h3a2 and decrease of 13 1 for h3b2 emission scenarios is expected since the groundwater recharge in this study region take place majorly during kharif season due to intensive monsoon rainfalls therefore it is expected that rainfall recharge would increase in some future times similar kinds of results are presented by awan et al 2014 according to them an increase in recharge is expected from rainfall from 2012 to 2020 under changing climate conditions 5 discussion 5 1 investigating correlation among meteorological stations for recharge based on the changes of future climate variables it was obvious that degree of change was quite different at both stations particularly for the case of precipitation the other point is that lahore is located outside of the study area the selection of lahore and faisalabad for downscaling of climatic data was done because long time series data was only available for these two stations the other two stations located inside study region one at upper locations and other at down locations named as pindi bhattian and toba tek singh respectively there was a need to investigate about any significant relationship existed between different stations i e between lahore and pindi bhattian and between faisalabad and toba tek singh owing to time series data auto correlations were worked out to see any current time or lag time relationship between different stations fig 10 show the autocorrelations of precipitation between different stations this analysis is based on the daily precipitation data from 2005 to 2012 for pindi bhattian and from 2009 to 2012 for toba tek singh the highest correlation 0 72 was found between lahore and pindi bhattian followed by 0 5 for faisalabad and toba tek singh the correlations between other stations were not very strong for instance a correlation of 0 321 0 30 0 421 0 305 were found between faisalabad and lahore toba tek singh and lahore faisalabad and pindi bhattian and toba tek singh respectively generally the lag time correlation relationship did not depict any strong relationship for any case nevertheless in the case of faisalabad and toba tek singh it was seen if there is precipitation at faisalabad then there are fair chances of precipitation at toba tek singh on the next day the autocorrelation results showed that better correlation found between lahore and pindi bhattian and between faisalabad and toba tek singh also pindi bhattian and toba tek singh are located at the central locations of upper and lower irrigation subdivisions respectively therefore it was decided to utilize climate change results of lahore for upper irrigation subdivisions including chuharkana paccadala buchiana and mohlan and results of faisalabad for lower irrigation subdivisions including tandlianwala tarkhani bhagat and sultanpur 5 2 groundwater dynamics under different future lulc and climate change scenarios 5 2 1 groundwater under changing lulc the temporal changes in average groundwater levels for different irrigation subdivisions are presented in fig 11 to facilitate identification of locations for lcc with groundwater level increase decrease with the advent of simulation time generally two independent trends in groundwater dynamics are observed i e increasing groundwater levels in upper irrigation subdivisions including chuharkana paccadala and mohlan whereas decreasing levels in middle and lower subdivisions of lcc the highest individual positive change in groundwater level from base period is observed for mohlan with a value of 3 88 m under first scenario while the highest negative change in groundwater level is observed for tarkhani with a value of 3 23 m under seventh scenario detailed analysis for individual irrigation subdivision shows that decrease in rice area i e scenario 1 has the highest positive impact on groundwater level change in chuharkana irrigation subdivision with a value of 2 07 m the next major change is observed under the third scenario 1 53 m where fodder cultivation increases up to 50 compared to its present cultivation from base time the change observed under this scenario is almost similar to those arising under other scenarios for example second 1 37 m fourth 1 41 m and fifth 1 38 m the change in groundwater level under sixth scenario slightly increases from base time to april 2026 i e 0 78 m especially from april 2021 to april 2026 i e 0 04 m afterwards a slight decreasing trend of 0 04 m between april 2026 to april 2030 is observed this outcome possibly arises from the fact that lulc changes are not based on the whole year rather limited to only kharif season crops with no change during rabi seasons therefore any temporal change in general trend of groundwater level may continue in the same direction with varying pace until a point when this trend would reverse this becomes evident from the progression of trend lines under different scenarios against average condition i e business as usual scenario changes in groundwater head for paccadala and mohlan irrigation subdivisions are also mainly affected by first scenario the change for paccadala is mostly positive for all scenarios except sixth scenario where there is a slowly decreasing trend in groundwater level from april 2016 onwards the change for mohlan irrigation subdivision remains positive under all proposed scenarios considering the results of overall groundwater level changes rice crop seems to exert most influence on any change in the upper lcc change in the groundwater level for rest of the irrigation subdivisions located at middle and lower reaches of lcc show decreasing trends for all scenarios for these irrigation subdivisions largest decrease is observed under seventh scenario however the rate of change varies for different irrigation subdivisions as for instance the decrease in case of tarkhani irrigation subdivision is maximum i e 2 6 m compared with 2 09 m 1 81 m 1 38 m 1 35 m and 0 06 m for buchiana kanya bhagat tandlianwala and paccadala irrigation subdivisions respectively this is generally due to a higher difference in crop water use between kharif fodder and rice as well as between kharif fodder and sugarcane mainly in tarkhani and buchiana irrigation subdivisions there are some scenarios wherein groundwater shows a constant trend after april 2021 for majority of the irrigation subdivisions e g fourth scenario these irrigation subdivisions include buchiana bhagat kanya and to some extent tarkhani and sultanpur under third scenario an increase in groundwater level is observed wherein there is initially a drop of 0 69 m in groundwater from base time to april 2021 but later on it rises by 0 15 m till april 2030 the detailed increase decrease in groundwater levels for various time periods under other scenarios is presented in fig 11 the preceding discussion on groundwater level results was with respect to base time without normalizing the effects under business as usual conditions the analysis therefore is extended to evaluate real time changes through incorporation of these effects the results so far depict the highest impact on groundwater level in upper irrigation subdivisions through change in rice cultivation e g scenario 1 the highest positive change is observed in paccadala 0 73 m followed by 0 67 m and 0 43 m for chuharkana and mohlan irrigation subdivisions respectively the highest negative change in groundwater level is found under sixth scenario where an increase of 25 in rice area is proposed the second major negative change is under seventh scenario i e 75 decrease in fodder area and its substitution by rice cotton and sugarcane changes under this scenario are equal to 0 48 m 0 24 m and 0 20 m 0 52 m for paccadala chuharkana mohlan and buchiana irrigation subdivisions respectively variation in groundwater level under other scenarios is not so high in upper irrigation subdivisions except for buchiana where changes observed are 0 40 m and 0 50 m under third and fourth scenarios respectively fluctuations in groundwater level for lower lcc clearly indicate higher negative changes under seventh scenario with values of 0 93 m for bhagat followed by 0 80 m 0 50 m 0 15 m and 0 14 m for tarkhani kanya sultanpur and tandlianwala irrigation subdivisions respectively moreover a maximum positive change is observed for bhagat under third scenario with a value of 0 61 m followed by 0 60 m and 0 43 m for tarkhani and kanya respectively under fourth scenario the summary of results under present lulc scenarios indicates a fluctuation of only 1 m depth for groundwater level which is almost negligible it is noteworthy that majority of proposed lulc changes under different scenarios are based on real trends of actual changes that occurred during last seven years in order to effectively manage groundwater by changes in lulc the current cropping patterns would not help achieve this goal nevertheless this goal is achievable through policy intervention and persuasion of farmers to adopt new cropping plans 5 2 2 groundwater under changing climate conditions results presented in the previous section include groundwater dynamics under proposed lulc changes irrespective of looking at climate change impacts here we describe groundwater behaviour under future climate scenarios for this actual evapotranspiration and precipitation under h3a2 and h3b2 emission scenarios are used to simulate groundwater from baseline period to 2045 the temporal and spatial changes in groundwater levels are presented in fig 12 table 8 depicts the summary of proposed climate change scenarios utilized in this study contrary to the outcomes under lulc scenarios groundwater seemed to be quite dynamic under future climate changes two distinct trends in groundwater levels are generally found according to which groundwater is expected to increase for majority of regions in around chuharkana mohlan and paccadala irrigation subdivisions for all future scenarios in contrast there is generally a dropping trend in groundwater between baseline time period to 2045 for rest of the regions nevertheless a varying positive or negative change in groundwater level is also observed spatio temporally in different parts of lcc analysis of groundwater levels for different irrigation subdivisions without normalizing the effects of general groundwater trends i e behaviour under business as usual situations show that there is an increase of about 6 62 m for mohlan followed by 3 95 m and 3 75 m for paccadala and chuharkana irrigation subdivisions respectively under h3a2 emission scenario anticipated changes under h3b2 are 3 36 m 1 17 m and 0 76 m for mohlan chuharkana and paccadala respectively the largest negative groundwater change is observed for tarkhani with a value of 7 19 m and 6 85 m under h3b2 and h3a2 respectively other prominent changes are in kanya 4 76 m and 4 65 m buchiana 5 95 m 4 18 m and bhagat 3 91 m and 4 38 m under h3b2 and h3a2 emission scenarios respectively likewise net changes in groundwater level i e excluding trends for business as usual case under different scenarios are also worked out for the whole duration accordingly net changes for chuharkana 1 71 m mohlan 1 91 m and paccadala 2 50 m irrigation subdivisions are positive but with varying compared with those for h3a2 similarly changes in groundwater level for h3b2 emission scenario are 0 32 m 0 29 m and 1 32 m for chuharkana mohlan and paccadala irrigation subdivisions respectively projected changes in groundwater level at lower lcc are 4 27 m and 4 03 m for tarkhani 0 72 m and 0 85 m for tandlianwala 0 56 m and 0 59 m for sultanpur 2 84 m and 2 75 m for kanya 2 27 m and 3 54 m for buchiana and 3 18 m and 2 70 m for bhagat under h3a2 and h3b2 emission scenarios respectively it is to be noted that above results are based on overall study period but these results deviate considerably for various simulation periods to counter this results are segregated into several time periods i e 2011 to 2025 2026 to 2035 and 2036 to 2045 as presented in fig 13 we draw some valuable information from these results for instance groundwater level in all irrigation subdivisions may rise between period 2011 to 2025 under h3a2 emission scenario expected changes in the upper parts would be even higher these positive changes are due to both lower consumptive water use by crops and increased precipitation in various irrigation subdivisions they are relatively high in upper parts due to reduced consumptive water use whereas in lower parts it is due to increased precipitation consequently the threat of groundwater shortage is almost non existent for these parts thus implying that water can be reallocated to surface water deficit or lower lcc regions this would not only help to avoid possible water logging in some parts of mohlan and paccadala but also conserve groundwater at lower regions for future use where groundwater table is deeper than upper regions this rationality in groundwater utilization during 2011 2025 is expected to facilitate water supply during the periods 2026 2035 and 2036 2045 due to anticipated drop in groundwater level courtesy increased consumptive crop water use and decreased precipitations under h3a2 scenario consequently effective water management during 2011 2026 could safeguard against possible water shortages under projected conditions second option would be to alter current cropping patterns and grow crops with less water demand along with developing new crop breeds needing less water with no effect on yields a more complex groundwater situation is observed under h3b2 emission scenario as compared to h3a2 under h3b2 expected increase in groundwater level from future precipitations is almost negligible any positive change in groundwater is mainly associated with changes in crop consumptive water use such situation requires integrated management of water resources by emphasizing changes in current cropping patterns and creating options to acquire water from additional surface water resources on farm water management through optimizing irrigation schedules levelling of farms and addressing low irrigation application efficiencies along with long term solutions through construction of small medium and large water reservoirs is required because the river water flow in the country is generally highly variable and uncertain bhatti 1999 5 2 3 limitations and source of uncertainties for the current study feflow simulates the groundwater dynamics but insufficiently reflect the impacts of surface flow and streamflow in the current study we have incorporated the effect of surface water indirectly in the form of spatially distributed recharge using remotely sensed data and techniques the use of spatially distributed hydrological model e g swat model could be another option but non availability of canal gauge data the cross sections of canals and other important spatial variables were limitations moreover the groundwater recharge was estimated at 1 km 1 km spatial resolution which could result in an approximation of recharge at the finite element grids with the borders of recharge pixels due to their spatial mismatch another possible limitation of the current modelling setup lies in its inability to consider any changes in river flow due to climate change effects such as melting of glaciers also the behaviour of groundwater dynamics are studied separately under changing climate and lulc without exploring its cumulative effects the lulc scenarios are rather arbitrarily set in current study it would have been better if it could match or reflect some local planning or regulations about to take effective the major limitation to this point is non control by the state on the practicing of copping pattern by the farmers which is mainly exercised by traditional farming practices and local market dynamics however such information from local market are not available from any source 6 conclusions modelling approach is used to evaluate impacts of climate and land use changes on groundwater in the present study high resolution remote sensing data 250 m 250 m are used for land use classification and change detection along with statistical downscaling techniques for specifying future climate change scenarios climate and land use land cover changes are translated into modified groundwater recharge which is then utilized in groundwater flow model for detecting changes thereof following key conclusions are noted based on the study findings 1 future change in precipitation during rabi seasons is inconsistence under both emission scenarios in case of kharif seasons both stations exhibit an increasing trend for all future periods consistently except for the period 2016 25 at lahore where an increase of 33 for h3a2 and decrease of 13 1 for h3b2 emission is noted 2 the period water budget for lcc shows a total horizontal water inflow of 2632 mm3 and 212 mm3 through dirichlet and neumann boundaries while the water outflow through these boundaries is 1156 4 mm3 and 1563 8 mm3 respectively water outflow through pumping from lcc is about 17374 43 mm3 while the water inflow through groundwater recharge is about 19933 20 mm3 there is a storage change of 2682 87 mm3 for whole lcc this leads to increase in groundwater levels in most of lcc 3 the rate water budget of lcc shows average total water inflow of the model domain amounting to about 1 11323e 6 m3 day including dirichlet and neumann boundaries while an outflow of 1 064657e 6 m3 day from these boundaries respectively the average total influx of the model domain by areal recharge is about 7 801e 6 m3 day and average total out flux of pumping is about 6 800e 6 m3 day 4 groundwater in upper irrigation subdivisions is highly influenced by rice cultivation the groundwater levels for lower lcc regions indicate high negative changes under decreased fodder area replaced by rice cotton and sugarcane the highest positive change is observed for bhagat irrigation subdivision under third scenario followed by tarkhani and kanya irrigation subdivisions under fourth scenario fluctuations in groundwater level among different scenarios are within 1 m implying a limited potential of proposed lulc changes for groundwater management 5 groundwater dynamics under future climate scenarios show a rise in its level for whole lcc during the period 2011to 2025 under h3a2 emission scenario the changes for upper irrigation subdivisions are relatively higher such changes in different irrigation subdivisions result from decreased consumptive water use by crops as well as increased precipitation however the change is relatively higher due to consumptive water use at upper parts while increased precipitation is responsible for such changes in lower parts 6 currently a need is there to reallocate surface water for its sustainable supply to lower parts although an immediate threat of water shortage is not felt this can also lead to potentially halt water logging in some parts of upper lcc 7 judicious utilization of groundwater resources during 2011 2025 is also important given groundwater behaviour for periods 2026 2035 and 2036 2045 where a substantial drop in groundwater is expected due to increased consumptive water use by crops coupled with decreased precipitations under h3a2 scenario this situation warrants effective planning for water management during 2011 2025 to escape any water shortages some possible options can include the alteration of existing cropping patterns with main focus on crops with less water demand as well as in integrated breeding plan to safeguard farmers incomes in the long run 8 groundwater situation under h3b2 emission scenario is relatively complex compared with h3a2 where very little changes in groundwater level are expected through precipitation any positive change in groundwater under such scenarios is mainly associated with crop consumptive water use changes such situation only demands integrated water resources management through more emphasis on changes in current crop cultivation patterns as

5880,the shrinking groundwater resource is a major cause of ecosystem imbalance which is further intensified by rapid changes in land use and land cover lulc and climate in the lower chenab canal lcc of pakistan present study aims to investigate groundwater dynamics using a novel approach by incorporating remote sensing data in combination with actual patterns of lulc while statistical approach is employed for downscaling of climatic data under two emission scenarios including h3a2 and h3b2 a 3 d numerical groundwater flow model is used for evaluating current patterns of groundwater use and its dynamics the results of water budget show a total horizontal groundwater inflow of 2844 mm3 and an outflow of 2720 2 mm3 the groundwater abstraction through pumping is about 17374 43 mm3 as compared to groundwater recharge of 19933 20 mm3 yields a surplus of 2682 87 mm3 which raises groundwater levels in major parts of lcc change in rice cultivation has the highest impact on groundwater levels in upper regions of lcc whereas higher negative changes are observed for lower parts under decreased fodder area in place of rice cotton and sugarcane for climate scenarios a rise in groundwater level is observed for 2011 to 2025 whereas its drop is expected for the periods 2026 2035 and 2036 2045 under h3a2 scenario due to no imminent threats to groundwater there is an opportunity for groundwater development through water re allocation groundwater status under h3b2 emission regime is rather complex during 2011 2025 water management under such situation requires revisiting of cropping patterns and augmenting water supply through additional surface water resources considering the limitations of the current study it is recommended to update model with river flow under changing climate and to extend investigations for combined effects of lulc and climate change keywords groundwater modelling statistical downscaling land use land cover water budget climate change scenarios 1 introduction groundwater constitutes one of the largest fresh water resources and plays a myriad of roles through supporting hydrological cycle taylor et al 2013 supplying water for human consumption and helping to maintain ecological values of many regions in the world ipcc 2007 other major beneficiaries of groundwater include industrial uses and irrigation application globally the share of groundwater for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes is estimated to be 36 42 and 27 respectively taylor et al 2013 agriculture is thus considered to be the major consumer of groundwater and this share is even greater in case of arid and semi arid regions of the world including india pakistan china and middle eastern countries gleeson et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 utilization of water supplies for successful agriculture in pakistan is dependent both on surface and groundwater resources the decreased river water supplies in the recent years have put extra pressure on groundwater for irrigated agriculture which is depicted by quantum increase in groundwater pumping from 10 billion m3 in 1965 to 68 billion m3 in 2002 usman et al 2014 as a result this situation poses a big challenge for sustainable groundwater management in the country implying that water resources need to be utilized for an indefinite time without causing unacceptable environmental social and economic consequences gleeson et al 2012 it is only possible if every single drop of water is used in the context of socio economic development and protection of ecosystems katko and hukka 2015 however despite the critical importance of groundwater in integrated water resources management it is not duly considered optimally worldwide foster and ait kadi 2012 unep cbd 2010 similar concerns have been raised by the european commission groundwater directive and water framework directive according to which it is necessary to investigate how groundwater use may affect ecosystems and vice versa land use and land cover lulc changes are main human induced parameters altering the groundwater dynamics especially in agricultural areas albhaisi et al 2013 nevertheless impact of these changes on groundwater system and its behaviour has not been investigated extensively narany et al 2017 majority of studies on hydrology are based on stream flows dynamics relating lulc and effects of forest changes on hydrological behaviours e g dams et al 2008 brown et al 2005 for instance bahremand et al 2006 have assessed the impact of reforestation on the hydrology of watershed similarly sarwar and eggers 2006 investigated the impact of lulc change on groundwater behaviour in the indus basin all of the afore mentioned studies have utilized hypothetical lulc scenarios for analysis thus lacking in investigation under real patterns of such changes there are also studies where lulc models were employed to generate future lulc scenarios under expected anthropogenic conditions niehoff et al 2002 lin et al 2007 tong and liu 2006 tang et al 2005 mccoll and aggett 2007 dams et al 2008 most of the above mentioned modelling studies only focus on the surface hydrological processes ignoring groundwater spatiality due to computational constraints data availability and model complexities exception to this are dams et al 2008 batelaan and de smedt 2007 klöcking and haberlandt 2002 and batelaan et al 2003 who have investigated the impacts of lulc change on groundwater with a fully distributed modelling approach they used wetspass model which estimates groundwater recharge by incorporating actual evapotranspiration and precipitation albhaisi et al 2013 nevertheless this model cannot utilize irrigation as an input parameter for estimation of distributed recharge which is an important input for the current study region therefore another approach is utilized where a distributed recharge was estimated by using a complex water balance model by incorporating data of actual evapotranspiration lulc from remote sensing techniques at higher spatial resolutions climate change is another potential variable which can induce changes in natural ecosystem pakistan is considered to be 7th most vulnerable country to climate change ipcc 2007 the reality of neglecting groundwater under climate change is also not very different from lulc according to taylor et al 2012 groundwater and dependent ecosystem have received least attention from the scientific communities in another ipcc report it is admitted that there has been very little research on the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater although its share in world s water use particularly in rural areas of arid and semi arid regions is considerable ipcc 2008 effects of climate change on nature are not as simple as are considered for instance crosbie et al 2009 show considerable variation in trend and magnitude of climate change in terms of temperature rainfall evapotranspiration and vapour pressure another simplistic rule posits that annual recharge is considerably affected by annual rainfall only mccallum et al 2010 however there are some exceptions to the rule of more rainfall leading to more recharge as it can also be affected by rainfall seasonality intensity humidity air temperature and crop evapotranspiration under changing concentrations of co2 increased variability in rainfall may increase groundwater recharge due to intensive rainfalls that ultimately infiltrate to become part of water table at the same time although higher temperature means higher crop evapotranspiration rates and hence there is less net groundwater recharge hetze et al 2008 and vice versa crosbie et al 2009 have also reported that increase in rainfall does not always lead to an increase in recharge it is therefore necessary to undertake local studies that assess the specific combination of parameters which could be affected by climate change for irrigated regions such as for the current study region the potential parameters of interest may be rainfall and crop evapotranspiration as both can behave differently due to changes in climate harmsen et al 2009 therefore the current study was designed to evaluate groundwater resources and to study their dynamics under changing lulc and climate in a complex agricultural region with limited data availability the specific objectives include i development of realistic lulc change scenarios and downscaling of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration for the synthesis of future climate change projections under ipcc emission scenarios including h3a2 and h3b2 ii assessment of water budget at different spatial scales of lcc and iii to investigate the effects of lulc and climate change on groundwater dynamics using modelling approach 2 study area data 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location the current study is conducted in punjab pakistan targeting one of the largest irrigation schemes of the indus basin irrigation system ibis called rechna doab it is a land between ravi and chenab rivers mainly covering the districts of gujranwala hafizabad sheikhupura faisalabad jhang chiniot and toba tek singh the gross area of this irrigation system is about 2 98 million hectares mha out of which 2 3 mha is cultivated and irrigated land present study targets the eastern parts of the lower chenab canal lcc east mainly comprised of districts of faisalabad and toba tek singh fig 1 2 1 2 irrigation system agriculture lower chenab canal lcc constitutes a major portion of rechna doab which off takes from khanki headwork on the river chenab lcc is divided into two parts lcc east and lcc west for irrigation administration purposes entire lcc is split into different irrigation subdivisons lcc east comprised of 10 irrigation subdivisions with overall area of about 1 24 million hectares fig 1 these irrigation subdivisions include sagar chuharkana paccadala mohlan buchiana tandlianwala kanya tarkhani bhagat and sultanpur the cropping year can be sub divided into two seasons namely kharif and rabi the kharif season generally starts from may and ends in october while rabi season prevails from november to april rice and wheat are the two major crops during kharif and rabi seasons respectively the other crops cultivated during rabi season are rabi fodders mainly barseem and oat while cotton and kharif fodders mainly sorghum maize and millet are grown in kharif season sugarcane is the annual crop which is cultivated in the months of september and february usman et al 2012 2015a 2 1 3 climate the climate of the area is mainly arid to semi arid with very hot summers during which temperatures range between 21 and 50 c whereas winters are cold with temperature ranges between 0 and 27 c the average annual precipitation varies from 290 mm in the south west to 1046 mm in the north east of the irrigation scheme and highest rainfalls occur during the monsoon months i e from july to september which is about 60 of the total average annual rainfall usman et al 2012 2 1 4 topography soil the area is relatively flat with mean sea elevation range between 200 m in the north eastern side to 130 m in south western side the study area is a part of an abandoned flood plain of which deeper parts are formed by the underlying metamorphic and igneous rocks of precambrian age loam and sandy clay loam is predominant in the upper parts of lcc whereas the lower parts consist of fine sandy loam and sandy loam hydro geological investigations were carried out during the 1957 1960 period in and around the study region wherein 327 test holes were drilled the maximum thickness of alluvium is not accurately known however these investigations show the lithological information over 200 m depth nearly everywhere in lcc the alluvial complex is of heterogeneous nature and forms a fairly transmissive aquifer system usman et al 2018 illustrated the lithological details of selected test boreholes at three different cross sections in lcc according to which thickness of alluvium complex is relatively higher in lower regions compared to upper regions which comprise of small lenses of clay and gravel throughout the area khan 1978 has summarized the results of pumping tests and lithological mechanical analyses of test holes according to which hydraulic conductivity varies from 24 to 264 m day 1 and specific yield values vary from 1 to 33 in the entire rechna doab 2 2 data major data types for the current study are collected and utilized from secondary sources e g governmental and private organizations the brief description of each data

lcc including lahore faisalabad toba tek singh and pindi bhattian the secondary data of cultivated crops over the years in the study region are collected from crop reporting services of the government of punjab 2 2 4 statistical downscaling model sdsm data requirements two types of daily time series namely daily historic weather station data and large scale variables ncep daily predictors are used to develop sdsm there are mainly four weather stations located in or near to study area including faisalabad toba tek singh lahore and pindi bhattian since daily based long period weather data is

were obtained cost free from http www cics uvic ca scenarios index cgi scenarios for the period of 1961 2010 and 1996 2050 respectively 3 method fig 2 shows the detailed work flow of the current study according to which the overall methodology can be divided into three parts including data pre processing methods analysis method and modelling method 3 1 data pre process method 3 1 1 groundwater levels piezometric groundwater level data are collected from salinity monitoring organization smo pakistan from 2005 to 2012 these data are available twice a year once pre monsoon and other post monsoon further details on processing of these data for the current study can be read from usman et al 2015c 3 1 2 remote sensing data monthly rainfall data were retrieved from tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm at a spatial scale of 25 km which were downscaled to 1 km for further use by employing the procedure reported by chen et al 2014 this data were utilized in estimation of groundwater recharge the other data from remote sensing sources include surface elevation which were required for describing the geometry of the 3 d groundwater flow model this data were derived form a digital elevation model dem at 90 m spatial resolution by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm from the website of the consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar consortium for spatial information cgiar csi http srtm csi cgiar org the data required for construction of land use land cover maps and estimation of actual evapotranspiration include normalized difference vegetation index ndvi emissivity albedo land surface temperature this data were retrieved from modis at different spatial resolutions from both aqua and terra sensors 3 2 analysis method 3 2 1 crop inventory crop inventory were prepared using modis ndvi data with a spatial resolution of 250 m downloaded from both aqua and terra sensors the data available from mid may to mid october were downloaded for kharif and similarly all data during mid november to mid april were used for rabi season crops during year 2005 2012 for identification of different crops the temporal profile of ndvi trends were drawn after performing unsupervised clustering using isodata algorithm tou and gonzalez 1974 for instance the classified crop map of kharif 2007 and rabi 2007 08 can be seen in annex 1 the classification results were verified by constructing error matrix and its comparison with secondary source crop census data results show that wheat and rice are major crops in rabi and kharif seasons respectively the overall accuracies for different rabi and kharif seasons are 82 83 and 78 21 respectively the kappa values for rabi seasons are 0 73 and 0 71 for kharif seasons land use land cover change detection results indicate that rice and wheat are less volatile for change moreover change between cotton and rice is less common due to their different agro climatic cropping conditions the more detailed descripting of methodology and results can be read from usman et al 2015a 3 2 2 actual evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is the single term that links land surface energy balance and surface water balances zhao et al 2013 this forms a key process of hydrological cycle and regarded valuable in water balance modelling especially for irrigated areas usman et al 2015a evapotranspiration is generally not considered directly in hydrological studies but as a recharge which varies spatially due to differences in water use for various land uses wegehenkel 2009 surface energy balance algorithm sebal devised by bastiaanssen et al 1998 is adopted for the current study for the estimation of evapotranspiration as reported in usman et al 2015b 2014 the results show almost doubled crop water use 546 mm in kharif as compared to 274 mm in rabi with significant variability for different years from 2005 to 2012 crop specific water use shows rice and sugarcane as major consumers with average values of 593 mm and 580 mm respectively followed by cotton 541 5 mm and kharif fodder 509 5 mm 3 2 3 groundwater recharge water balance approaches using conventional data and the remote sensing data were used for the estimation of groundwater recharge during 2005 2012 conventional application of water balance method results in recharge at a regional scale whereas using remote sensing data for the purpose yield recharge at finer scales i e for the current study at 1 km spatial resolution recharge results obtained from water balance method and water table fluctuation approach are comparable both at irrigation subdivision and 1 km2 spatial scales rainfall is the main recharge source during the kharif season followed by field percolation losses during rabi seasons seepage from canal is the major source net groundwater recharge is mainly positive during all kharif seasons resulted in gradual increase in groundwater levels in major parts of the study area the more details of recharge results can be read from usman et al 2015c 3 3 modeling method 3 3 1 groundwater numerical model the groundwater modelling system feflow v6 1 was used for the modelling procedure which has been successfully tested and applied in various benchmark studies around the world diersch et al 2002 a 3 d finite element groundwater flow model is set up the fundamental basis of that it introduces the darcy equation in the mass conservation equation to represent the mass conservation of any phase diersch et al 2002 1 t ε α ρ α x i ε α ρ α v i α ε α ρ α q ρ α where t is time t ε α is volume fraction of α phase ρ α is density of α phase ml 3 xi is eulerian spatial coordinate vector v i α is velocity vector of α phase lt 1 q ρ α is mass supply of α phase t 1 further the equation was modified for the mass conservation of water with uniform density and viscosity 2 t ε f x i q i f q ρ f the term q i f is known as the darcy flux which can be described for water with uniform density and viscosity as below 3 q i f k i j h x j ρ f e j where k i j is tensor of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ρ f is water density ml 3 and e j is gravitational unit vector both steady and transient groundwater numerical models are setup by utilizing various data and their calibration validation and sensitivity analysis are performed fig 3 shows the flow diagram of modelling setting up and running different tasks before its utilization for the current study this modeling study employs pest to automate calibration of a transient flow model results of automated calibrated models are compared with manually calibrated models an advanced tikhonov regularization algorithm was employed for carrying out the automated pilot point pp method the results show that automated pp is more flexible as compared to other approaches statistical indicators show that this method result reliable model calibration as values of coefficient of determination range from 0 98 to 0 99 nash sutcliffe efficiency range from 0 964 to 0 976 and root mean square errors range from 1 68 m to 1 23 m for manual and automated approaches respectively validation of automated pp result me as 0 969 and rmse as 1 31 m sensitivity analysis results show that hydraulic conductivity is a more influential parameter the more detailed results can be found in usman et al 2018 3 3 2 statistical downscaling of climatic parameters global circulation models gcms are considered as major tools to predict the changes and variability in climate variables on global and continental levels the outputs of gcm models cannot be used directly to investigate the impact of climate change in environmental and hydrological studies on local regional scale wilby et al 2000 the most important solution in this regard is to build a bridge between gcm scales a coarse scale and local scale 0 50 km is downscaling wetterhall et al 2006 xu 1999 statistical downscaling sd approaches establish statistical links among the local scale and large scale variables and such methods are computationally inexpensive and fast and hence have been adopted by a wider community of researchers wilby et al 2000 sdsm is one of many statistical models which is widely used throughout the world to downscale important climatic variables like precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration etc for assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrologic responses chu et al 2010 this model is a hybrid of multiple linear regression and stochastic weather generator wilby and harris 2006 multiple linear regression is used to identify and select some suitable predictors from the atmospheric predictors in sdsm by utilizing the combination of the correlation matrix partial correlation histograms scatter plots and p values wilby and dawson 2013 the current study uses sdsm by employing the annual model which considers similar type of regression parameters for each month of year the other category of model includes conditional and unconditional models the conditional sub model is used for variables such as precipitation while the unconditional sub model is used for independent variable such as temperature chu et al 2010 wilby and dawson 2013 the fourth root transformation function is used for precipitation data to render it to normal before its further application for regression analysis huang et al 2011 mahmood and babel 2012 h3a2 and h3b2 are the ipcc emission scenarios a2 and b2 of hadcm3 respectively hadcm3 is selected for sdsm because it showed better agreement during evaluation of various gcms mahmood and babel 2012 akhtar et al 2008 huang et al 2011 selection of predictands and screening of predictors temperature and precipitation are considered to be most important factors for agricultural region because the first one directly control crop water needs by affecting evapotranspiration and second one causes major contribution to groundwater recharge usman et al 2015c since there is no direct use of temperature for recharge estimation but it is a major variable for estimation of crop evapotranspiration therefore actual evapotranspiration is estimated using temperature data along with other necessary climatic parameters by employing advection aridity approach usman et al 2015b 2014 screening of predictors is key to statistical downscaling using sdsm wilby et al 2000 there are about 26 predictors for using in downscaling process and the complete list of which with detailed description is available from mahmood and babel 2012 the process of predictors screening adopted in the current study employs an approach where a combination of partial correlation correlation matrix and p value is used as devised by gagnon et al 2005 and mahmood and babel 2012 this process of predictor selection is a quantitative procedure where the selection of first and most suitable predictor is relatively straightforward and easy but the selection of subsequent predictors is more subjective in the first step of this quantitative approach a correlation matrix between ncep predictors and predictands is made then only the predictors of high correlation coefficient are screened out and ranked in descending order the first predictor having the strongest correlation among all predictors is selected as a super predictor following this the regressing of highly correlated predictors is performed individually in the presence of super predictor and the absolute correlation coefficient between the predictor and predictand r1 the absolute correlation coefficient between individual predictors r2 absolute partial correlation pr and p value are obtained in the next step the predictors are eliminated with p value greater than α 0 05 to render the statistically significant results and the highly correlated predictors 0 5 in this case are taken out in order to avoid any multi co linearity for each predictor percentage reduction in an absolute partial correlation prp is calculated with respect to absolute correlation the relationship p r p p r r 1 r 1 is used for the purpose the predictor with minimum prp value is selected as the second suitable predictor because this predictor has very insignificant multi co linearity with super predictor the subsequent predictors can be selected by following the same procedure but there will be two super predictors in the second repetition according to mahmood and babel 2012 mostly one to three predictors are enough during calibration of predictands without multi co linearity the screening of potential predictors for precipitation and actual evapotranspiration at different meteorological stations can be seen from annex 2 calibration validation of sdsm results and bias correction daily data of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration from 1961 to 1995 is used for the calibration of sdsm annual sub models are developed individually for each predictands for precipitation unconditional sub models with fourth root transformation while for actual evapotranspiration conditional sub models without transformation are used huang et al 2011 ordinary least square algorithm is used for optimization of the best fit the calibrated models are used for simulation of the predictands from 1996 to 2010 using ncep h3a2 and h3b2 predictors by generating 20 ensembles and the mean of these ensembles is used different statistical indicators are used for comparison of sdsm results with observed data the indictors include coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean m standard deviation sd relative error in mean re m and relative error in standard deviation re sd for the periods of calibration and validation bias correction is applied to compensate for any tendency to over or under estimate the mean of conditional processes by sdsm wilby and dawson 2013 for this purpose a standard quantile mapping technique using qmap r programming package was utilized for the validated period from 1996 to 2010 the statistical comparison is performed between un biased sdsm downscaled data of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration and observed data it is done to achieve a more realistic picture of future climate mahmood and babel 2012 3 3 3 land use scenarios water utilizations of different crop types are calculated by combining the information of actual evapotranspiration with their cultivation areas both of these information are integrated for establishing patterns of crop water use within lulc classes and to identify potential areas of different lulc change in different irrigation subdivisions of lcc employing zonal statistics practically the cultivated area under a particular lulc class is not spread uniform throughout the lcc but some specific lulc classes are dominant in particular irrigation subdivisions similarly lulc change is also not uniform throughout lcc but it is highly dependent on overall areal coverage of a particular class in specific sub region due to this fact and hence to consider spatial variability of any lulc change total area under any lulc class is segregated at irrigation subdivision level the estimated proportions take into consideration the overall suggested change in any lulc at lcc scale subsequently different lulc scenarios are generated in order to feed their results to modelling and to explore their impacts on possible changes in groundwater levels to achieve this end the following two conditions are followed while devising lulc change scenarios 1 ensuring the realistic limits of the cropped area of all lulc classes while introducing changes in a particular lulc class based on estimated results type i scenarios 2 maintaining the cropped area of a particular lulc class within its realistic change limits without consideration to cropped areas of other lulc classes type ii scenarios there are total seven lulc scenarios which were finalized for the current study it is also to be noted that increase decrease in lulc area of any particular class is based on its current status in lcc i e year 2011 12 the latest study year moreover lulc change scenarios are based only on classes in kharif cropping seasons as options for change are limited during rabi seasons and also the difference in consumptive water use is less among rabi crops usman et al 2015b 2014 table 1 represents the summary of the selected lulc scenarios for future groundwater simulations 3 3 4 climate change scenarios six climate change scenarios are devised considering actual evapotranspiration precipitation and combined effect of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation under both h3a2 and h3b2 emission scenarios utilization of lulc and climate change scenarios for groundwater modelling is accompanied by a complex procedure as both types of scenarios do affect groundwater recharge since raster based recharge is utilized for groundwater modelling as explained in usman et al 2018 2015b the same approach is adopted for preparation of recharge data under different scenarios of lulc and climate change since specific change is always relative to some baseline time or period therefore different baselines were selected for both lulc and climate change scenarios as mentioned above construction of lulc scenarios is based on changes in cropping patterns prevailing in cropping year 2011 12 however for climate change scenarios a baseline period from 2002 to 2012 is selected and any change is worked out for future periods 2016 2025 2026 35 and 2036 45 by using the following relationship 6 c h a n g e x y y 100 where x is the mean for the future period e g 2016 2025 and y is the mean for the baseline period of 2002 2012 there are different ways to deal with climate change data depending on their further application and objective however for the current study change is a constant value for any year during the considered period for instance a constant change e g 10 in 2016 will be the change with respect to 2002 similarly 10 change in 2025 will be with respect to 2012 there is another way where different values for each individual year can be estimated by comparing data of particular future year to the baseline data 2002 2012 and therefore to capture the time variation of change from year to year however for the current study future climate change data is dealt by considering a constant change because the objective is not to track the changes in groundwater behaviour yearly rather it is to investigate the general situation at the end of a particular time period other reason is to simplify the preparation of 1 km 1 km spatial resolution pixel based recharge data of more than 30 years for regional groundwater flow model 3 3 5 model updating in order to address the spatial variability the water saving or its more utilization is treated at pixel scale instead of irrigation subdivision level annex 3 shows the procedure of preparing land use thematic maps whereas fig 4 depicts the methodology of preparing updated recharge rasters under changed lulc for preparing such rasters target regions of particular lulc change are identified from results of lulc change detection usman et al 2015a and then pixels are identified to be converted from a particular lulc to another stratified randomized pixels selection was made using specialized code written using r programming it is to be noted that decrease increase in cultivated area of a particular lulc under each scenario is not an abrupt change instead it is based on a uniform gradual change from base period to 2030 precipitation and actual evapotranspiration are not used independently in groundwater modelling but they are utilized in form of recharge fig 5 represents the procedure of preparing rasters of recharge under changing climate scenarios the rasters of changed evapotranspiration are used directly for estimation of modified recharge while rasters of changed precipitation are first processed by excluding effective precipitation and other losses from total rainfall as explained in usman et al 2015c before its utilization for estimation of modified recharge 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of groundwater flow models reliable calibration process means to develop a model which reasonably represents nature including recharge and discharge groundwater flow with a result of reasonable matches between simulated and observed groundwater levels usman et al 2018 in the first step the groundwater model was calibrated manually in steady state by varying values of hydraulic conductivity and groundwater heads of october 2005 were utilized as an initial condition different statistical indicators are used which show reasonable agreement between simulated and observed groundwater heads as coefficient of determination r2 mean error me root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient are 0 99 m 0 98 m 1 58 m and 0 98 m respectively after steady state calibration the model was transformed to transient case with initial heads from steady model modeller s pre calibration expert judgment and automated calibration was performed for automated calibration using pest the parameters bound set for all pilot points ranged between 10 6 m day 1 to 300 m day 1 and 10 7 m day 1 to 30 m day 1 for horizontal and vertical conductivities respectively and for effective porosity it was ranged between 0 009 and 0 250 usman et al 2018 the upper model layer could be well represented in explaining most of results as the groundwater is well connected in the region thus it could have been simulated with 2d model settings as well for controlling the automation of pest for transient model calibration about 585 observations of piezometric water heads were used the comparison was made between simulated and observed piezometric water levels for performance of the groundwater flow simulated by feflow in fefelow measured piezometric heads are calculated with reference to mean sea level i e requirement of feflow 3d model the piezometric data winter 2005 to winter 2008 were used for the transient model calibration the measured and modelled heads were drawn on a scatter plot fig 6 a which indicates successful calibration of the model as majority of the points fall near or on the diagonal line different statistical error parameters including r2 me pbias and rmse indicate reliable results of calibration the value of r2 for calibration is 0 99 similarly me is 0 976 which shows that the deviation of modelled heads from observed heads is only 2 2 the value of percent bias pbias is only 0 026 whereas the rmse of the modelled heads from observed ones is 1 23 m after successful transient model calibration it was validated for the piezometric data from summer 2009 to winter 2011 the results of model validation are represented in scatter chart as presented in fig 6b the value of me is 0 969 which indicates that deviation of modelled heads from observed heads is only 3 0 the values of pbias and rmse are 0 205 and 1 31 m respectively pointing towards reasonable validation results further details of these results can be read from usman et al 2018 4 2 water budget and variation of darcy flux water budget provides detail information about different components of model inflow and outflow along with providing clues to check whether model solution remained stable during simulation or not water budget calculated for the groundwater model calibration and validation period of model simulation is presented in table 2 the results are presented at whole lcc scale as well as for upper and lower lcc scales these results show the detailed summary of flow for each boundary condition type for source and sinks and for storage capture and release whereas imbalance term reflects the residual error horizontal inflow and outflow calculated by the model refer to water flow rates horizontally these rates are generally in order of magnitude less than the vertical exchange rates total period water budget of lcc shows the total horizontal water inflow of 2632 mm3 and 212 mm3 through dirichlet and neumann boundaries respectively whereas water outflow through these boundaries is 1156 4 mm3 and 1563 8 mm3 respectively water outflow through pumping from lcc is about 17374 4 mm3 while water inflow through groundwater recharge is about 19933 2 mm3 the difference of storage capture and release with a positive value of 2682 4 mm3 for whole lcc indicates rising groundwater level during calibration and validation periods the results are in concurrence with usman et al 2015c who show an increasing trend in water level at majority irrigation subdivisions of lcc the results also show some discrepancies in the form of water imbalance which amounts to about 1 10 mm3 being negligible for lcc considering magnitude of total water inflows and outflows to model domain while comparing results for water budget in table 2 it is clear that dirichlet inflow and outflow is quite less for upper lcc in relation to lower lcc this difference arises due to the fact that the lower parts of lower lcc are connected to river ravi and trimu sidhnai link canal whereas the upper lcc is only connected to qadirabad balloki link canal horizontal inflow to upper lcc through neumann boundaries is also less as compared to lower lcc however the difference is larger for outflows where the outflow through neumann i e 1120 7 mm3 is quite large for upper lcc as compared to lower lcc i e 443 1 mm3 the groundwater pumping from the upper and lower lcc is about 8078 2 mm3 and 9296 4 mm3 against recharge of 9997 7 mm3 and 9935 5 mm3 respectively water budget for lcc shows an average total water influx of about 1 11323e 6 m3 day in the model domain through dirichlet and neumann boundaries with an average outflow of 1 064657e 6 m3 day respectively likewise average total influx in the model domain by areal recharge is about 7 802e 6 m3 day whereas average total outflow through pumping is about 6 800e 6 m3 day analysis of the darcy flux variations in four different model layers for different irrigation subdivisions is presented in fig 7 whereas the spatial distribution of flux is given in annex 4 for all four model layers results indicate relatively higher flux in lower parts of lcc in third and fourth model layers whereas higher values are observed in upper lcc in first and second model layers the gradient of regional groundwater flow indicates potential aquifer zones in shallow depths of upper lcc and deeper depths of lower lcc overall average flux for different model layers the highest for third layer with a value of 0 0375 m day followed by 0 0343 m day for fourth model layer whereas it is 0 0171 and 0 0261 m day for model layers first and second respectively 4 3 water utilization by various land use the details of different lulc change scenarios and overall possible water saving or more water utilization against each scenario relative to current water usage are presented in table 3 at each irrigation subdivisions level out of many possible scenarios provided in usman et al 2015a only 7 lulc scenarios are selected for the current study based on their impact on water utilization in different parts of lcc for instance scenarios 1 6 and 7 show greater change in water utilization in upper irrigation subdivisions while scenarios 4 5 and 7 target middle irrigation subdivisions and scenarios 2 4 and 7 have greater impact on water utilization in downstream irrigation subdivisions the overall analysis of more water utilization saving at lcc level indicate that only scenarios 1 3 and 4 result in decrease of water consumption than previous and rest of the scenarios show more demand for water under modified lulc the negative values depict increased water demand and vice versa under changed lulc scenarios very few scenarios show similar changes in consumptive water use at lcc scale however the variation of change for each irrigation subdivision is significant and leads to spatial variability of water table which would be further prominent at 1 km spatial scale 4 4 statistical downscaling and climate change scenarios 4 4 1 calibration of sdsm the selected predictors for the calibration of sdsm can be seen from annex 2 the results presented in table 4 shows that the model performed reasonably well in case of actual evapotranspiration however the results for precipitation are relatively weak for both stations the difference between model mean precipitation and observed mean precipitation is large relative errors of mean and relative errors of standard deviation are much greater for precipitation than actual evapotranspiration different researchers have evaluated sdsm for different variables including precipitation using different models and reported similar types of results for instance huang et al 2011 developed three different models for downscaling of precipitation and their results vary from weak to medium values for different performance indicators e g r2 ranges from 0 11 to 0 97 whereas mahmood and babel 2012 investigated sdsm for two models monthly and annual and according to them monthly model performed better r2 is 0 992 as compared to annual model r2 is 0 688 overall there is a consensus among different studies that temperature and evapotranspiration performed better that precipitation in all cases mahmood and babel 2012 khan et al 2006 dibike and coulibaly 2005 wilby et al 2000 the reason is heterogeneous nature of the precipitation occurrence amounts and therefore difficult to simulate accurately wilby et al 2000 fig 8 indicate the graphical comparison between the observed data and the monthly simulated mean output of sdsm in case of evapotranspiration sdsm underestimates the results from march to may for lahore and march to june for faisalabad whereas it overestimates the results for november december january and february for both stations it also overestimates results during july to october which is more prominent for faisalabad in comparison to lahore with regard to precipitation the results by sdsm are underestimated in majority of the months during whole year especially in rainy months july to august there is only small overestimation of sdsm results during october and november in comparison to observed precipitation 4 4 2 validation of sdsm prior bias correction fig 8 depict that the validation results are better for actual evapotranspiration than for precipitation the r2 values for evapotranspiration range between 0 89 and 0 98 and 0 83 to 0 92 for lahore and faisalabad respectively the relative error in mean and relative error in standard deviation range between 1 02 and 2 03 and 13 87 to 20 64 respectively for lahore and they are ranged between 1 55 and 3 82 and 19 35 to 21 59 respectively for faisalabad the values of different performance indicators for precipitation indicate that this variable is reproduced relatively weak as compared to evapotranspiration as values of r2 ranged from 0 80 to 0 83 for lahore and from 0 76 to 0 80 for faisalabad the other parameters including the relative error in mean and relative error in standard deviation also confirm the results as considerable higher values of these parameters are obtained for both stations in comparison to evapotranspiration table 5 nevertheless it is to be noted that the results of coefficient of determination and predicting mean are quite comparable with observed precipitation with more variation for relative errors this indicate that the models lack in predicting full variation in observed precipitation for both stations however the mean precipitation simulated by sdsm is comparable with observed data 4 4 3 validation of sdsm with bias correction the results in the previous section indicate that there are large biases especially for precipitation which should be removed to further improve the validation results the detail results of which in form of different statistical indicators are presented in table 6 the bias corrected downscaled mean results are also compared graphically with observed data as shown in fig 9 from all the statistical indicators it is obvious that both evapotranspiration and precipitation results were improved especially the precipitation results improved significantly as r2 values increased from 0 80 to 0 84 to 0 98 0 99 root mean square values decreased from 26 52 to 28 08 mm to 4 04 7 30 mm and relative errors in mean and standard deviation decreased from 41 09 to 58 13 and 58 42 64 19 to 10 01 22 47 and 8 07 14 79 respectively for lahore similarly the results for precipitation at faisalabad also showed significant improvement as r2 increased from 0 76 to 0 80 to 0 98 0 99 root mean square values decreased from 17 72 to 17 91 mm to 6 18 10 72 mm and relative errors in mean and standard deviation are decreased from 28 34 to 32 59 to 6 67 13 34 and 49 11 52 64 to 7 14 11 54 respectively the results from all variables including ncep h3a2 and h3b2 are satisfactory now and indicate strong applicability of sdsm to downscaling evapotranspiration and precipitation under both emission scenarios i e h3a2 and h3b2 4 4 4 downscaling evapotranspiration and precipitation under future emission scenarios table 7 presents the projected results of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation for different time durations i e 2016 25 2026 35 and 2036 45 with reference to base line period according to both emission scenarios the change in evapotranspiration at both stations is consistence with difference in magnitude during rabi seasons with increase of 2 23 and 1 51 in 2016 25 at faisalabad similarly there is an increase of 6 19 and 2 52 in 2026 35 and 5 87 and 7 29 in 2036 45 for lahore during the same season there is an increase in evapotranspiration of 2 20 and 1 18 in 2016 25 9 46 and 2 59 in 2036 45 the change during kharif seasons is majorly consistence except during 2026 35 where the change in evapotranspiration is 2 22 and 0 95 at faisalabad whereas at lahore the change is 1 36 and 5 36 under h3a2 and h3b2 respectively with regard to precipitation the future change during rabi seasons is more inconsistence for both emission scenarios for instance there is an increase of 1 68 in 2016 25 at faisalabad 4 67 and 5 79 at lahore in 2016 25 and 2036 45 against a decrease of 4 57 32 19 and 31 61 respectively under scenarios h3a2 and h3b2 conversely there is a decrease of 7 31 and 0 18 in 2026 35 and 2036 45 against an increase of 4 26 3 08 at faisalabad in case of kharif seasons the change suggests that precipitation at both stations is generally increasing for all future periods and it is also mostly consistence except for 2016 25 at lahore where there is an increase of 33 for h3a2 and decrease of 13 1 for h3b2 emission scenarios is expected since the groundwater recharge in this study region take place majorly during kharif season due to intensive monsoon rainfalls therefore it is expected that rainfall recharge would increase in some future times similar kinds of results are presented by awan et al 2014 according to them an increase in recharge is expected from rainfall from 2012 to 2020 under changing climate conditions 5 discussion 5 1 investigating correlation among meteorological stations for recharge based on the changes of future climate variables it was obvious that degree of change was quite different at both stations particularly for the case of precipitation the other point is that lahore is located outside of the study area the selection of lahore and faisalabad for downscaling of climatic data was done because long time series data was only available for these two stations the other two stations located inside study region one at upper locations and other at down locations named as pindi bhattian and toba tek singh respectively there was a need to investigate about any significant relationship existed between different stations i e between lahore and pindi bhattian and between faisalabad and toba tek singh owing to time series data auto correlations were worked out to see any current time or lag time relationship between different stations fig 10 show the autocorrelations of precipitation between different stations this analysis is based on the daily precipitation data from 2005 to 2012 for pindi bhattian and from 2009 to 2012 for toba tek singh the highest correlation 0 72 was found between lahore and pindi bhattian followed by 0 5 for faisalabad and toba tek singh the correlations between other stations were not very strong for instance a correlation of 0 321 0 30 0 421 0 305 were found between faisalabad and lahore toba tek singh and lahore faisalabad and pindi bhattian and toba tek singh respectively generally the lag time correlation relationship did not depict any strong relationship for any case nevertheless in the case of faisalabad and toba tek singh it was seen if there is precipitation at faisalabad then there are fair chances of precipitation at toba tek singh on the next day the autocorrelation results showed that better correlation found between lahore and pindi bhattian and between faisalabad and toba tek singh also pindi bhattian and toba tek singh are located at the central locations of upper and lower irrigation subdivisions respectively therefore it was decided to utilize climate change results of lahore for upper irrigation subdivisions including chuharkana paccadala buchiana and mohlan and results of faisalabad for lower irrigation subdivisions including tandlianwala tarkhani bhagat and sultanpur 5 2 groundwater dynamics under different future lulc and climate change scenarios 5 2 1 groundwater under changing lulc the temporal changes in average groundwater levels for different irrigation subdivisions are presented in fig 11 to facilitate identification of locations for lcc with groundwater level increase decrease with the advent of simulation time generally two independent trends in groundwater dynamics are observed i e increasing groundwater levels in upper irrigation subdivisions including chuharkana paccadala and mohlan whereas decreasing levels in middle and lower subdivisions of lcc the highest individual positive change in groundwater level from base period is observed for mohlan with a value of 3 88 m under first scenario while the highest negative change in groundwater level is observed for tarkhani with a value of 3 23 m under seventh scenario detailed analysis for individual irrigation subdivision shows that decrease in rice area i e scenario 1 has the highest positive impact on groundwater level change in chuharkana irrigation subdivision with a value of 2 07 m the next major change is observed under the third scenario 1 53 m where fodder cultivation increases up to 50 compared to its present cultivation from base time the change observed under this scenario is almost similar to those arising under other scenarios for example second 1 37 m fourth 1 41 m and fifth 1 38 m the change in groundwater level under sixth scenario slightly increases from base time to april 2026 i e 0 78 m especially from april 2021 to april 2026 i e 0 04 m afterwards a slight decreasing trend of 0 04 m between april 2026 to april 2030 is observed this outcome possibly arises from the fact that lulc changes are not based on the whole year rather limited to only kharif season crops with no change during rabi seasons therefore any temporal change in general trend of groundwater level may continue in the same direction with varying pace until a point when this trend would reverse this becomes evident from the progression of trend lines under different scenarios against average condition i e business as usual scenario changes in groundwater head for paccadala and mohlan irrigation subdivisions are also mainly affected by first scenario the change for paccadala is mostly positive for all scenarios except sixth scenario where there is a slowly decreasing trend in groundwater level from april 2016 onwards the change for mohlan irrigation subdivision remains positive under all proposed scenarios considering the results of overall groundwater level changes rice crop seems to exert most influence on any change in the upper lcc change in the groundwater level for rest of the irrigation subdivisions located at middle and lower reaches of lcc show decreasing trends for all scenarios for these irrigation subdivisions largest decrease is observed under seventh scenario however the rate of change varies for different irrigation subdivisions as for instance the decrease in case of tarkhani irrigation subdivision is maximum i e 2 6 m compared with 2 09 m 1 81 m 1 38 m 1 35 m and 0 06 m for buchiana kanya bhagat tandlianwala and paccadala irrigation subdivisions respectively this is generally due to a higher difference in crop water use between kharif fodder and rice as well as between kharif fodder and sugarcane mainly in tarkhani and buchiana irrigation subdivisions there are some scenarios wherein groundwater shows a constant trend after april 2021 for majority of the irrigation subdivisions e g fourth scenario these irrigation subdivisions include buchiana bhagat kanya and to some extent tarkhani and sultanpur under third scenario an increase in groundwater level is observed wherein there is initially a drop of 0 69 m in groundwater from base time to april 2021 but later on it rises by 0 15 m till april 2030 the detailed increase decrease in groundwater levels for various time periods under other scenarios is presented in fig 11 the preceding discussion on groundwater level results was with respect to base time without normalizing the effects under business as usual conditions the analysis therefore is extended to evaluate real time changes through incorporation of these effects the results so far depict the highest impact on groundwater level in upper irrigation subdivisions through change in rice cultivation e g scenario 1 the highest positive change is observed in paccadala 0 73 m followed by 0 67 m and 0 43 m for chuharkana and mohlan irrigation subdivisions respectively the highest negative change in groundwater level is found under sixth scenario where an increase of 25 in rice area is proposed the second major negative change is under seventh scenario i e 75 decrease in fodder area and its substitution by rice cotton and sugarcane changes under this scenario are equal to 0 48 m 0 24 m and 0 20 m 0 52 m for paccadala chuharkana mohlan and buchiana irrigation subdivisions respectively variation in groundwater level under other scenarios is not so high in upper irrigation subdivisions except for buchiana where changes observed are 0 40 m and 0 50 m under third and fourth scenarios respectively fluctuations in groundwater level for lower lcc clearly indicate higher negative changes under seventh scenario with values of 0 93 m for bhagat followed by 0 80 m 0 50 m 0 15 m and 0 14 m for tarkhani kanya sultanpur and tandlianwala irrigation subdivisions respectively moreover a maximum positive change is observed for bhagat under third scenario with a value of 0 61 m followed by 0 60 m and 0 43 m for tarkhani and kanya respectively under fourth scenario the summary of results under present lulc scenarios indicates a fluctuation of only 1 m depth for groundwater level which is almost negligible it is noteworthy that majority of proposed lulc changes under different scenarios are based on real trends of actual changes that occurred during last seven years in order to effectively manage groundwater by changes in lulc the current cropping patterns would not help achieve this goal nevertheless this goal is achievable through policy intervention and persuasion of farmers to adopt new cropping plans 5 2 2 groundwater under changing climate conditions results presented in the previous section include groundwater dynamics under proposed lulc changes irrespective of looking at climate change impacts here we describe groundwater behaviour under future climate scenarios for this actual evapotranspiration and precipitation under h3a2 and h3b2 emission scenarios are used to simulate groundwater from baseline period to 2045 the temporal and spatial changes in groundwater levels are presented in fig 12 table 8 depicts the summary of proposed climate change scenarios utilized in this study contrary to the outcomes under lulc scenarios groundwater seemed to be quite dynamic under future climate changes two distinct trends in groundwater levels are generally found according to which groundwater is expected to increase for majority of regions in around chuharkana mohlan and paccadala irrigation subdivisions for all future scenarios in contrast there is generally a dropping trend in groundwater between baseline time period to 2045 for rest of the regions nevertheless a varying positive or negative change in groundwater level is also observed spatio temporally in different parts of lcc analysis of groundwater levels for different irrigation subdivisions without normalizing the effects of general groundwater trends i e behaviour under business as usual situations show that there is an increase of about 6 62 m for mohlan followed by 3 95 m and 3 75 m for paccadala and chuharkana irrigation subdivisions respectively under h3a2 emission scenario anticipated changes under h3b2 are 3 36 m 1 17 m and 0 76 m for mohlan chuharkana and paccadala respectively the largest negative groundwater change is observed for tarkhani with a value of 7 19 m and 6 85 m under h3b2 and h3a2 respectively other prominent changes are in kanya 4 76 m and 4 65 m buchiana 5 95 m 4 18 m and bhagat 3 91 m and 4 38 m under h3b2 and h3a2 emission scenarios respectively likewise net changes in groundwater level i e excluding trends for business as usual case under different scenarios are also worked out for the whole duration accordingly net changes for chuharkana 1 71 m mohlan 1 91 m and paccadala 2 50 m irrigation subdivisions are positive but with varying compared with those for h3a2 similarly changes in groundwater level for h3b2 emission scenario are 0 32 m 0 29 m and 1 32 m for chuharkana mohlan and paccadala irrigation subdivisions respectively projected changes in groundwater level at lower lcc are 4 27 m and 4 03 m for tarkhani 0 72 m and 0 85 m for tandlianwala 0 56 m and 0 59 m for sultanpur 2 84 m and 2 75 m for kanya 2 27 m and 3 54 m for buchiana and 3 18 m and 2 70 m for bhagat under h3a2 and h3b2 emission scenarios respectively it is to be noted that above results are based on overall study period but these results deviate considerably for various simulation periods to counter this results are segregated into several time periods i e 2011 to 2025 2026 to 2035 and 2036 to 2045 as presented in fig 13 we draw some valuable information from these results for instance groundwater level in all irrigation subdivisions may rise between period 2011 to 2025 under h3a2 emission scenario expected changes in the upper parts would be even higher these positive changes are due to both lower consumptive water use by crops and increased precipitation in various irrigation subdivisions they are relatively high in upper parts due to reduced consumptive water use whereas in lower parts it is due to increased precipitation consequently the threat of groundwater shortage is almost non existent for these parts thus implying that water can be reallocated to surface water deficit or lower lcc regions this would not only help to avoid possible water logging in some parts of mohlan and paccadala but also conserve groundwater at lower regions for future use where groundwater table is deeper than upper regions this rationality in groundwater utilization during 2011 2025 is expected to facilitate water supply during the periods 2026 2035 and 2036 2045 due to anticipated drop in groundwater level courtesy increased consumptive crop water use and decreased precipitations under h3a2 scenario consequently effective water management during 2011 2026 could safeguard against possible water shortages under projected conditions second option would be to alter current cropping patterns and grow crops with less water demand along with developing new crop breeds needing less water with no effect on yields a more complex groundwater situation is observed under h3b2 emission scenario as compared to h3a2 under h3b2 expected increase in groundwater level from future precipitations is almost negligible any positive change in groundwater is mainly associated with changes in crop consumptive water use such situation requires integrated management of water resources by emphasizing changes in current cropping patterns and creating options to acquire water from additional surface water resources on farm water management through optimizing irrigation schedules levelling of farms and addressing low irrigation application efficiencies along with long term solutions through construction of small medium and large water reservoirs is required because the river water flow in the country is generally highly variable and uncertain bhatti 1999 5 2 3 limitations and source of uncertainties for the current study feflow simulates the groundwater dynamics but insufficiently reflect the impacts of surface flow and streamflow in the current study we have incorporated the effect of surface water indirectly in the form of spatially distributed recharge using remotely sensed data and techniques the use of spatially distributed hydrological model e g swat model could be another option but non availability of canal gauge data the cross sections of canals and other important spatial variables were limitations moreover the groundwater recharge was estimated at 1 km 1 km spatial resolution which could result in an approximation of recharge at the finite element grids with the borders of recharge pixels due to their spatial mismatch another possible limitation of the current modelling setup lies in its inability to consider any changes in river flow due to climate change effects such as melting of glaciers also the behaviour of groundwater dynamics are studied separately under changing climate and lulc without exploring its cumulative effects the lulc scenarios are rather arbitrarily set in current study it would have been better if it could match or reflect some local planning or regulations about to take effective the major limitation to this point is non control by the state on the practicing of copping pattern by the farmers which is mainly exercised by traditional farming practices and local market dynamics however such information from local market are not available from any source 6 conclusions modelling approach is used to evaluate impacts of climate and land use changes on groundwater in the present study high resolution remote sensing data 250 m 250 m are used for land use classification and change detection along with statistical downscaling techniques for specifying future climate change scenarios climate and land use land cover changes are translated into modified groundwater recharge which is then utilized in groundwater flow model for detecting changes thereof following key conclusions are noted based on the study findings 1 future change in precipitation during rabi seasons is inconsistence under both emission scenarios in case of kharif seasons both stations exhibit an increasing trend for all future periods consistently except for the period 2016 25 at lahore where an increase of 33 for h3a2 and decrease of 13 1 for h3b2 emission is noted 2 the period water budget for lcc shows a total horizontal water inflow of 2632 mm3 and 212 mm3 through dirichlet and neumann boundaries while the water outflow through these boundaries is 1156 4 mm3 and 1563 8 mm3 respectively water outflow through pumping from lcc is about 17374 43 mm3 while the water inflow through groundwater recharge is about 19933 20 mm3 there is a storage change of 2682 87 mm3 for whole lcc this leads to increase in groundwater levels in most of lcc 3 the rate water budget of lcc shows average total water inflow of the model domain amounting to about 1 11323e 6 m3 day including dirichlet and neumann boundaries while an outflow of 1 064657e 6 m3 day from these boundaries respectively the average total influx of the model domain by areal recharge is about 7 801e 6 m3 day and average total out flux of pumping is about 6 800e 6 m3 day 4 groundwater in upper irrigation subdivisions is highly influenced by rice cultivation the groundwater levels for lower lcc regions indicate high negative changes under decreased fodder area replaced by rice cotton and sugarcane the highest positive change is observed for bhagat irrigation subdivision under third scenario followed by tarkhani and kanya irrigation subdivisions under fourth scenario fluctuations in groundwater level among different scenarios are within 1 m implying a limited potential of proposed lulc changes for groundwater management 5 groundwater dynamics under future climate scenarios show a rise in its level for whole lcc during the period 2011to 2025 under h3a2 emission scenario the changes for upper irrigation subdivisions are relatively higher such changes in different irrigation subdivisions result from decreased consumptive water use by crops as well as increased precipitation however the change is relatively higher due to consumptive water use at upper parts while increased precipitation is responsible for such changes in lower parts 6 currently a need is there to reallocate surface water for its sustainable supply to lower parts although an immediate threat of water shortage is not felt this can also lead to potentially halt water logging in some parts of upper lcc 7 judicious utilization of groundwater resources during 2011 2025 is also important given groundwater behaviour for periods 2026 2035 and 2036 2045 where a substantial drop in groundwater is expected due to increased consumptive water use by crops coupled with decreased precipitations under h3a2 scenario this situation warrants effective planning for water management during 2011 2025 to escape any water shortages some possible options can include the alteration of existing cropping patterns with main focus on crops with less water demand as well as in integrated breeding plan to safeguard farmers incomes in the long run 8 groundwater situation under h3b2 emission scenario is relatively complex compared with h3a2 where very little changes in groundwater level are expected through precipitation any positive change in groundwater under such scenarios is mainly associated with crop consumptive water use changes such situation only demands integrated water resources management through more emphasis on changes in current crop cultivation patterns as

5881,due to the strong variation of precipitation in time and space it is necessary to generate accurate precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution this is essential for many applications such as hydrological and meteorological analysis however achieving such data over a large area remains a tremendous challenge in this study we presented a downscaling merging method to solve this problem first an integrated temporal upscaling spatial downscaling temporal downscaling strategy is introduced to spatially downscale satellite based daily precipitation data to a high spatial resolution of 0 01 the downscaled daily precipitation estimates are then merged with gauge observations in a multivariate geostatistical framework to avoid the adverse effects of sparse gauges the semivariogram model of daily precipitation is inferred from the downscaled results the method was applied to the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm daily precipitation product covering central china s henan province for the period 1 january 2015 31 december 2016 the experimental results show that 1 the downscaling strategy can effectively spatially downscale the trmm daily precipitation product maintaining not only the accuracy of the original trmm data but also providing greater spatial detail 2 a seasonal timescale is appropriate for downscaling analysis and 3 the merging scheme greatly enhances the accuracy of downscaled daily precipitation estimates reducing the mean absolute error and root mean square error by 57 and 42 respectively and increasing the critical success index by 0 17 the proposed method provided an efficient solution for producing accurate daily precipitation data with high spatial resolution over a large area keywords trmm spatial downscaling daily precipitation data fusion 1 introduction precipitation is a vital part of the water cycle and plays a critical role in global surface energy exchange and material circulation donohoe 2016 huntington 2006 trenberth et al 2003 precipitation has strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity which is of great importance not only for investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of regional precipitation but also for the analysis and management of hydrological and water related resources zhu et al 2018 ecological environment simulation damiano et al 2018 and dynamic monitoring of droughts and floods maggioni and massari 2018 traditionally the spatial distribution of precipitation has been mapped by interpolating gauge observations however accurate spatial interpolation of fine timescale daily or finer timescales precipitation has long been a problem in the field grimes and pardo igúzquiza 2010 one of the major reasons for this issue is the strong spatial variation of precipitation for example in a precipitation event there can be a pronounced discontinuity between a precipitation area and non precipitation area owing to its own smoothing behavior spatial interpolation cannot accurately identify such discontinuities moreover gauge observations are frequently sparse and unevenly distributed it is generally believed that the spatial resolution of interpolated precipitation results should be consistent with the density of gauge observations to ensure reliable results haylock et al 2008 therefore it is difficult to generate accurate precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution solely by interpolating gauge observations unlike spatial interpolation that generates only one optimal estimate stochastic spatial time precipitation models kyriakidis et al 2004 paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2018 can provide a range of realizations of precipitation fields in a probabilistic simulation framework and is more suitable for risk analysis and design of hydrological system meanwhile they are computationally intensive although weather radar has the capability of capturing the precipitation fields in high space time resolution fabry et al 1994 kim et al 2018 its spatial coverage is limited the fast development of satellite based observation technology over the past few decades has provided an unprecedented opportunity for precipitation observation and a range of global satellite based precipitation products have been released ashouri et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 for satellite observation high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution are contradictory making it impossible to obtain images with high spatiotemporal resolution in view of the cumulative nature of precipitation satellite must observe precipitation frequently resulting in a low spatial resolution of satellite precipitation data e g 0 25 for the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm as a result this spatial resolution is too coarse for applications at the local scale spatial downscaling can effectively solve this problem and is therefore critical for expanding the application scope of satellite precipitation data sorooshian et al 2011 spatial downscaling for coarse satellite precipitation data is based on high resolution local environmental factors lef and uses the significant interrelationship between the factors and precipitation to construct a downscaling model it is critical to accurately explore and describe this relationship which directly determines the effectiveness of a spatial downscaling model and further affects the quality of the downscaled precipitation estimates many methods have been developed in previous studies to spatially downscale satellite precipitation data chen et al 2014 2018 immerzeel et al 2009 joyce and xie 2011 lu et al 2019 ma et al 2017 tao et al 2018 zheng and bastiaanssen 2013 zorzetto and marani 2019 related studies have largely focused on satellite based annual and monthly precipitation data the reason behind this is that on annual and monthly timescales there are strong interactions between precipitation and lef these relationships do not exist on finer timescales e g daily for example vegetation responds significantly to partial rather than all precipitation events and a subtle change in vegetation caused by a light precipitation event may not be monitored by the sensor aboard satellite therefore according to the above principle spatial downscaling cannot be directly applied to satellite precipitation data with fine temporal resolution although a few attempts have been made to spatially downscale high temporal resolution satellite precipitation data fang et al 2013 guan et al 2009 they overemphasized the effect of topographic factors on precipitation distribution resulting in the following limitations 1 the methods are only applicable to mountainous areas and cannot be extended to other low relief areas and 2 in view of the strong variation of precipitation in time and space topographic factors which remain unchanged over a short period cannot significantly affect the spatial distribution of each precipitation event in other words it is impossible to establish an accurate spatial downscaling model for each event based solely on the relationship between the precipitation distribution and topographic factors although spatial downscaling studies have been applied to satellite based annual and monthly precipitation products it is essential to develop spatial downscaling techniques for high temporal resolution satellite precipitation data in future work due to the fact that no additional accurate precipitation observations are introduced during the downscaling procedure the accuracy of downscaled results is affected by the original satellite precipitation data numerous studies have found that the accuracy of satellite precipitation data varies in time and space and the accuracy of such data with high temporal resolution daily or finer timescales is much less than that of satellite based monthly precipitation data chen and li 2016 chen et al 2013 chen and gao 2018 fang et al 2019 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 maggioni et al 2016 sun et al 2018 tang et al 2016 therefore it can be affirmed that the downscaled results of satellite precipitation data with high temporal resolution also have poor accuracy and errors are temporally and spatially variable in recent years several studies have been conducted to boost the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates though merging the satellite based observations with gauge observations chao et al 2018 cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 huffman et al 2007 nie et al 2015 rozante et al 2010 wu et al 2018 xie and xiong 2011 yang et al 2017 these studies can be roughly classified into two categories known as direct and indirect merging direct merging blends satellite precipitation estimates with gauge point observations directly cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 rozante et al 2010 wu et al 2018 however there is a large difference in spatial scale between the two estimates which produces substantial uncertainty zheng and bastiaanssen 2013 particularly on daily or finer timescales where the heterogeneity of precipitation related spatial distributions is further exaggerated indirect merging which blends satellite precipitation estimates and gridded precipitation data interpolated from gauge observations nie et al 2015 xie and xiong 2011 yang et al 2017 can effectively avoid the disadvantages of direct merging however indirect merging is based on an implied premise i e dense gauge observations when faced with high spatial resolution satellite precipitation data indirect merging loses its power because the actual density of the gauge observations is often unable to meet the requirements of generating reliable gridded precipitation data with high spatial resolution following interpolation the main aim of this research is to produce accurate daily precipitation data with high resolution over a large area by developing a downscaling merging method the implementation of this method includes two steps first an integrated temporal upscaling spatial downscaling temporal downscaling strategy was proposed to spatially downscale trmm 3b42 daily precipitation products second accurate daily precipitation data with high resolution were achieved by merging the downscaled results with gauge observations a case study is presented for henan province in central china by using two years of trmm daily precipitation data to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method 2 methodology to achieve high quality and high resolution daily precipitation data over a large area a two step method is designed first trmm 3b42 daily precipitation data were downscaled to obtain high spatial resolution daily precipitation estimates second the accuracy of the estimates was enhanced through integrating with gauge observations in a multivariate geostatistical framework 2 1 an integrated strategy for spatially downscaling trmm 3b42 in view of the lack of strong interaction between daily precipitation and lef we did not spatially downscale the trmm 3b42 daily precipitation data directly instead we developed an indirect method consisting of three steps i e temporal upscaling spatial downscaling and temporal downscaling first the original trmm daily precipitation and local environmental variables were temporally upscaled to a coarser timescale where the precipitation variation could be well explained by the environmental variables preliminary analysis showed that on seasonal timescale trmm precipitation was significantly correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi digital elevation model dem latitude and longitude and its variation could be well explained thus these four factors were selected as auxiliary variables specifically the trmm daily precipitation was temporally accumulated into the trmm seasonal precipitation seasonaltrmm datasets and the monthly ndvi was temporally averaged into the seasonal ndvi seasonalndvi datasets next a spatial downscaling model was constructed for the accumulated trmm seasonal precipitation data accurate exploration of the interaction between seasonal precipitation and lef is critical which determines the quality of the downscaling model and eventually affects the accuracy of the downscaled results here we assumed that the afore mentioned relationship is spatially variable and therefore constructed a spatial downscaling model by developing a method presented in our previous study chen et al 2014 as follows 1 seasonaltrmm 0 25 u s α 0 0 25 u s β i 0 25 u s lef i 0 25 u s ε 0 25 u s i 1 2 4 where lef i 0 25 u s with i 1 2 3 and 4 represents seasonalndvi dem latitude and longitude respectively at spatial location u in season s spring summer autumn or winter α 0 0 25 u s stands for the intercept β i 0 25 u s is the corresponding coefficient of lef i 0 25 u s ε u s is the model residual and a superscripts of 0 25 represents a spatial resolution of 0 25 geographically weighted regression gwr brunsdon et al 1998 a spatial regression method was employed to investigate spatially varying relationships svr between seasonal precipitation and lef at a 0 25 spatial scale and generate 0 25 model parameters subsequently we spatially interpolated these estimated parameters from 0 25 to 0 01 by using spline function the seasonal precipitation data with high spatial resolution were estimated by 2 seasonaltrmm 0 01 u s α 0 0 01 u s β i 0 01 u s lef i 0 01 u s ε 0 01 u s i 1 2 4 finally we temporally downscaled the derived high spatial resolution trmm seasonal precipitation data into high spatial resolution daily precipitation estimates by using the temporal variation of the original trmm daily precipitation the assumption was made here that the ratio of daily precipitation to seasonal precipitation remains the same before and after spatial downscaling which is similar to the process of generating trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2007 concretely the ratio of trmm precipitation of the j th day to the seasonal accumulation rtrmm j 0 25 is roughly equal to that of the downscaled trmm precipitation of the j th day to seasonaltrmm0 01 the rtrmm j 0 25 is defined as follows 3 rtrmm j 0 25 u s dailytrmm j 0 25 u s seasonaltrmm 0 25 u s after interpolating rtrmm j 0 25 from 0 25 to 0 01 i e rtrmm j 0 01 by using a simple spline method the downscaled trmm precipitation on the j th day was obtained by 4 dailytrmm j 0 01 u s seasonaltrmm 0 01 u s rtrmm j 0 01 u s 2 2 merging downscaled daily precipitation estimates and daily gauge observations a multivariate geostatistical method known as kriging with external drift ked goovaerts 1997 was employed to integrate the downscaled daily precipitation estimates and daily gauge observations as follows 5 z u m u α 1 n u λ α u z u α m u α where u represents the location being predicted uα is the location of rain gauge m u a u b u dailytrmm0 01 u is the estimated mean at location being predicted u z u is the gauge observation at that location a u and b u are implicitly estimated by the kriging system within each search neighborhood and λα u are the weights estimated by solving the following equation 6 β 1 n u λ β u γ u α u β μ 0 u μ 1 u dailytrmm 0 01 u α γ u α u β 1 n u λ β u 1 β 1 n u λ β u dailytrmm 0 01 u β dailytrmm 0 01 u in theory γ h should be inferred from the residuals z u m u however this is not straightforward because m u is a priori unknown we solve this issue by using an approximate method berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 that uses only z u to calculate the experimental semivariogram despite this our study still faced two problems one was the sparse gauge observations approximately one gauge per 1300 km2 a series of studies have pointed out that the semivariogram models derived from sparse samples cannot accurately estimate the spatial structure and dependence of regionalized variables chang et al 1998 mcbratney et al 1981 sun et al 2012 therefore it is difficult to accurately measure the spatial structure of daily precipitation using so few observations the other challenge was that building a semivariogram model for daily precipitation was a very time consuming task especially for days when the experimental semivariogram was disorganized due to the strong dynamics of daily precipitation unlike other studies goovaerts 2000 hudson and wackernagel 1994 the auxiliary variable downscaled daily precipitation used in our work is also the estimate of the primary variable daily precipitation many studies have reported that satellite derived precipitation data can effectively capture the spatial distribution of precipitation chen et al 2013 tang et al 2016 it should also be noted that a sufficient number of samples is able to exactly estimate the semivariogram structure of regionalized variable in this context we assumed that downscaled daily precipitation estimates can provide a spatial variogram structure for daily precipitation although these estimates have some deviation from actual precipitation thus inferring the semivariogram model of daily precipitation from the downscaled daily precipitation estimates can avoid the adverse effects of the shortage of gauge observations moreover to avert the afore mentioned second problem and considering the temporal variation of precipitation types in the study area we calculated the average of the standardized experimental semivariograms of daily precipitation in one month to represent the spatial structure of daily precipitation in that month which is similar to that presented by paschalis et al 2013 thus it is only necessary to construct 12 experimental semivariogram models for daily precipitation in one year the average experimental semivariogram for daily precipitation in each month is calculated by 7 γ h 1 m d 1 m 1 2 n h d var d w 1 n h d dailytrmm 0 01 u w d dailytrmm 0

location uw and n h d represents the number of pairs of data locations a vector h apart on the d th day subsequently a theoretical semivariogram model was fitted to the derived average experimental semivariogram preliminary analysis revealed that the spherical model could fit the average experimental semivariogram better than others therefore we selected this model to construct the theoretical semivariogram model 8 γ h c 0 c 1 3 h 2 a 1 2 h a 3 if h a c 0 c 1 o t h e r w i s e here a is the range and c 0 and c 1 are the nugget effect and sill respectively 2 3 validation cross validation was

gauge observation and e is daily precipitation estimate in addition the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were selected to assess the ability of daily precipitation estimates to detect a precipitation event pod denotes the ratio of correct identification by daily precipitation estimates over the number of precipitation events from gauge observations

henan province is located between 31 23 36 22 n and 110 21 116 39 e with an area of 167 000 km2 as shown in fig 1 it has a diverse landscape with mountains in the west and plains in the east with elevation ranging from 23 2 to 2400 m above sea level the xiong er and funiu mountains form a vast network of mountain ranges and plateaus in the west supporting one of the few remaining temperate deciduous forests the yellow river which enters from the northwest traverses central henan henan has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons the precipitation distribution exhibits strong gradients changing with longitude latitude and elevation the higher annual average precipitation occurs in the southeast of the area 1300 mm year and lower values toward the northwest about 400 mm year owing to the influence of the east asian monsoon the summer is hot and humid with most precipitation falling during that season the winter climate is controlled by the siberian high and is therefore cold windy and dry domrös and peng 2012 3 2 data trmm began in 1998 as a joint mission between the us national aeronautics and space administration and the japan aerospace exploration agency and was designed to monitor and study tropical precipitation trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis products which have a spatial resolution of 0 25 and coverage of 50 n 50 s are produced by integrating microwave precipitation estimates and infrared precipitation estimates and rescaling the integrated estimates to the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2007 huffman et al 2010 we used the trmm 3b42 version 7 daily precipitation product for spatial downscaling in this study the ndvi data of henan province were from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface reflectance products mod13a3 which have a monthly temporal resolution and a 1 km spatial resolution to be consistent with the coordinate system of trmm the ndvi data used were first converted into a geographic coordinate system and then resampled to 0 01 and 0 25 data i e trmm0 01 and trmm0 25 respectively the dem data was obtained from version 4 1 shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation data with 90 m spatial resolution which were downloaded from https cgiarcsi community data srtm 90m digital elevation database v4 1 following the preprocessing process for the ndvi data the dem data used also were converted into a geographic coordinate system and resampled to 0 01 and 0 25 data i e dem0 01 and dem0 25 respectively in addition daily gauge observations of the study area were from henan meteorogical service china which were collected from 129 meteorological stations as shown in fig 1 the dataset has not yet been made public and we only obtained observations from january 1 2015 to december 31 2016 all data were subjected to a series of quality controls including the examination of extreme values internal consistency checks and the removal of questionable data yu et al 2007 4 results 4 1 downscaling and merging analysis to verify that there are svr between seasonal precipitation and lef we compared them with uniform relationships ur jia et al 2011 as seen in fig 2 the derived ur exhibit instability over time especially during summer 2016 when the r2 was 0 39 and the rmse reached 145 9 mm in contrast the svr show significant improvement in investigating seasonal precipitation variation as well as a stable performance over time with r2 values more than 0 9 take the analysis for spring 2015 as an example the estimated coefficients and residuals are shown in fig 3 these parameters demonstrate significant spatial variation most of the residuals are between 20 and 20 mm in addition to avoid the overfitting problem of gwr we set bandwidths greater than 0 8 for exploring relationships between seasonal precipitation and lef following the implementation of the procedures described in section 2 1 the downscaled daily precipitation estimates for 2015 2016 were generated according to eq 7 we randomly selected 10 000 grids with values larger than 0 1 mm from the downscaled daily precipitation data as samples to calculate an average experimental semivariogram finally a spherical model for each month was established by fitting the derived average experimental semivariogram fig s1 shows the models for each month of 2015 they reveal significant monthly variation with ranges from 0 31 to 1 51 specifically the models for the summer months june july and august showed the longest ranges 1 2 indicating that summer precipitation has the longest spatial correlation distance by contrast ranges for the winter months december january and february had the shortest ranges 0 6 in addition the ranges for autumn months were slightly longer than those for spring months this is related to the nature of precipitation in the study area most precipitation in the area falls in june july and august and is characterized by large volumes and extensive spatial coverage in contrast a small amount of precipitation falls in the winter months as presented in fig s2 in the supplementary material a similar situation occurred in 2016 taking precipitation on days 27 109 175 and 277 in 2015 as examples their spatial distributions from original trmm 3b42 ori trmm downscaled precipitation estimates down trmm and merged precipitation estimates by ked mr ked are shown in fig 4 generally ori trmm has a mosaic like precipitation distribution because of its coarse resolution compared with ori trmm down trmm preserves the spatial precipitation patterns of the afore mentioned days and also greatly improves their spatial detail after merging with gauge observations daily precipitation from down trmm was noticeably corrected resulting in a large difference between down trmm and mr ked these corrections can be divided into two aspects first the merging adjusted the daily precipitation amounts of down trmm for example this is clear for precipitation on day 175 in 2015 after merging precipitation in the northern and eastern study area increased significantly while precipitation in the southernmost region decreased remarkably the reason behind this is that satellite observations underestimated precipitation in the north and east and overestimated in the furthest south ked took these factors into account when estimating the local mean m u in eq 5 and ultimately greatly corrected satellite based precipitation in these regions second the merging also modified the spatial coverage of daily precipitation from down trmm for example on day 27 in 2015 down trmm showed no precipitation in the southern study area whereas mr ked showed precipitation completely covering that area precipitation in january april july and october 2015 was selected to illustrate the monthly precipitation analysis fig 5 which was produced by accumulating daily precipitation although these monthly precipitation estimates share a similar spatial pattern there are differences between them similar to the daily precipitation analysis the downscaled results middle column show more spatial detail than the original trmm data left column note that the merging only corrected the monthly precipitation amount of down trmm this is because monthly precipitation completely covered the study area 4 2 cross validation assessments were performed on gridded and regional spatial scales as well as on daily and monthly timescales the other two typical merged methods i e geographic difference analysis gda cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 and conditional merging cm sinclair and pegram 2005 were used for comparison hereafter the merged results from gda and cm are abbreviated as mr gda and mr cm respectively furthermore cm used the strategy described by eq 7 to calculate the theoretical semivariogram model of daily precipitation 4 2 1 validation on gridded scale table 1 and fig 6 show the overall and time series of evaluation metrics respectively for the five daily precipitation estimates which were calculated by cross validation for each day during 2015 2016 among these data mr ked exhibited the best performance compared with down trmm the mae and rmse of mr ked decreased by 57 and 42 respectively while the down trmm shows great spatial detail relative to ori trmm fig 4 both datasets had roughly the same evaluation metrics throughout the study period this is because no additional accurate precipitation observations were introduced during the downscaling procedure after merging with gauge observations the three merged results all improved the accuracy of down trmm and greatly removed the mae and rmse this is especially true for mr ked where the biases are stable around zero and the rmses and maes are smaller than the other two merged results during most of the study period fig 6 we also evaluated the performances of the five daily precipitation datasets for different precipitation ranges the results are presented in fig 7 for detecting a rain event the five datasets had similar patterns all datasets detected rainless events well but detection performances worsened with increasing precipitation ori trmm had nearly the same detection performance as down trmm for all precipitation ranges except for the first two ranges 0 mm and 1 5 mm in which down trmm performed worse than ori trmm in detecting rainless events but better in detecting 0 5 mm precipitation events after merging with gauge observations the three merged results significantly improved in performance for the detection of rain events especially mr ked which performed much better than the others in each precipitation range except the last two 40 50 mm and 50 mm regarding the accuracy of precipitation estimates ori trmm overestimated precipitation in the first two precipitation ranges but underestimated in the remaining ranges as the amount of precipitation increased the deviation of ori trmm from gauge observations increased resulting in a corresponding increase in its maes and rmses in contrast with down trmm the evaluation metrics of the three merged results all move toward zero in each precipitation range indicating significant enhancements in accuracy except for the last precipitation range 50 mm mr ked outperformed mr gda and mr cm additionally we investigated the performances of the five daily precipitation datasets spatially by verifying their abilities to capture variation in daily precipitation time series at the gauge locations the results are presented in fig 8 among the five datasets ori trmm had the worst performance with the smallest r and the largest mae and rmse in terms of the four statistical metrics down trmm performed slightly better than ori trmm which means that spatial downscaling could slightly strengthen the ability of satellite precipitation data to capture temporal changes in daily precipitation as expected the three merged results greatly increased rs and reduced maes and rmses relative to down trmm indicating that merging significantly improved the temporal consistency between the daily precipitation estimates and gauge observations however mr gda and mr cm had relatively large biases even greater than ori trmm but their maes and rmses were much smaller than those of ori trmm this is because both merged results consistently overestimated daily precipitation however the magnitude of overestimation was small among the three merged precipitation datasets mr ked gave the best performance with rs larger than 0 88 and maes smaller than 1 mm at most gauge locations to further analyze the impact of rain gauge density on the accuracy of the merged daily precipitation estimates five density scenarios i e 100 80 60 40 and 20 of the gauge observations were defined by random selection fig 9 summarizes the three merged daily precipitation estimates for the five scenarios as the density of rain gauges decreased the accuracy of the three datasets declined but still higher than that of down trmm ked performed better than the other two methods for each gauge density scenarios indicating its effectiveness and stability table 2 and fig 10 depict the overall and time evolution of evaluation metrics respectively for the five monthly precipitation estimates down trmm had roughly the same performance as ori trmm in estimating monthly precipitation and the monthly precipitation estimates from mr ked had the optimal accuracy among the five datasets although all three merged results showed significant increase in accuracy as compared with the monthly precipitation estimates from down trmm reducing mae and rmse by 19 31 and 19 21 respectively the improvements were less than those for a daily timescale in addition the improvements were unstable over time particularly for certain months when no improvements were observed fig 10 there are two reasons for these results first improvements on the daily timescale were offset to some extent when daily data were accumulated into monthly precipitation second the monthly precipitation estimates from ori trmm i e trmm 3b43 are inherently accurate because they were calibrated by the monthly gpcc rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2007 4 2 2 validation on regional scale regional average daily precipitation radp from the five precipitation datasets was also assessed as seen from fig 11 ori trmm overestimated underestimated radp less more than 10 mm these errors offset each other to some extent eventually resulting in a small total bias of 0 17 mm however this did not affect the absolute errors with mae and rmse reaching 1 21 and 2 66 mm respectively for the four statistical metrics no significant difference was observed between down trmm and ori trmm indicating comparable performances in estimating radp after merging with gauge observations there were noticeable improvements the three merged results moved near the 1 1 line and their rmses and maes were reduced more than 80 as compared to down trmm especially for mr ked which had the best agreement with the gauge observations unlike ori trmm and down trmm there was no significant difference between the bias and mae for each merged dataset because they overestimated radp during most of the study period compared with the estimation of radp the five precipitation datasets enhanced the consistency with the gauge observations for measuring regional average monthly precipitation ramp as shown in fig 11 this is particularly true for ori trmm and down trmm both of which raised the r from 0 85 to more than 0 98 this is related to the mutual cancellation of positive and negative errors during the process of accumulating daily data into monthly precipitation as expected ori trmm and down trmm exhibited nearly equivalent performances and the three merged results performed better than down trmm compared with mr ked mr gda and mr cm showed clear overestimation and had larger maes and rmses therefore mr ked performed best in estimating ramp to further assess the performances of the five datasets in measuring radp the number of days bias and rmse for each dataset were investigated for various precipitation ranges as shown in fig 12 except for mr ked all daily precipitation datasets underestimated rainless days which led to small pods table 3 although mr gda and mr cm detected fewer rainless days than down trmm the former datasets had better overall performance csis than the latter because of its large fars mr ked overestimated rainless days relative to the gauge observations resulting in a pod as large as 1 and it had a small far therefore mr ked had the best overall performance in identifying a rainless day with a csi of 0 8 down trmm performed nearly the same as ori trmm in each precipitation range specifically both datasets overestimated underestimated the number of days with radp no more more than 10 mm and their deviations from the gauge observations increased with increasing precipitation within each range all three merged results had better performances than down trmm greatly reducing rmses and shifting biases to zero particularly for mr ked 5 discussion for the construction of a spatial downscaling model for satellite based daily precipitation products the three most important factors are the timescale selection of variables and method for investigating the relationship first selecting the proper timescale is an essential prerequisite for modeling usually there is no strong interaction between daily precipitation and lef although a few studies have performed spatial downscaling directly on satellite based monthly precipitation data tao et al 2018 xu et al 2015 they were limited to certain months such as in the growing months the reason behind this is that a significant relationship between precipitation and lef only exists during those months many studies have also reported that vegetation response to precipitation is up to a 2 or 3 month lag brunsell 2006 ji and peters 2005 wang et al 2003 suggesting that analysis on a seasonal timescale can explain the variation of precipitation our analysis is consistent with these studies accounting for more than 90 of the variation in precipitation for each season of the study period fig 2 second unlike other downscaling studies chen et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 we introduced geographic location latitude and longitude as auxiliary variables as our preliminary analysis suggested that a model s explanatory power for precipitation variation is significantly enhanced by the introduction of geographic location similar cases were found in bryan and adams 2002 and price et al 2000 which also reported a significant relationship between precipitation and geographical location however the characteristics of precipitation in an area determine whether location information should be involved in the downscaling model if there is no significant correlation between precipitation and location the latter should not be used it should be noted that other environmental variables such as land cover or atmospheric variables e g pressure also affect the spatial distribution of precipitation as mentioned earlier the spatial downscaling for coarse satellite precipitation data is based on high resolution lef however there are a small number of reliable lef with a high resolution available in reality in addition the build model itself is spatially variable so it is not necessary to include the categorical variables e g land cover based on these considerations we only selected the four variables for constructing the model in the future efforts should be devoted to consider more useful lef to improve the ability of the downscaling model to explain the variation of precipitation finally it is important to select an appropriate method to accurately explore and describe the relationships between precipitation and lef as shown in figs 2 and 3 the investigated relationships had significant spatial variation and gwr performed better than the classic method immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 this indicates that the assumption of svr is justified similar findings were reported in other studies chen et al 2014 chen et al 2015 xu et al 2015 in the present study gda is roughly equivalent to cm specifically the gda applies the spatial interpolation result from inverse distance weighting idw of the residuals between gauge observations and the collocated downscaled daily precipitation estimates to correct the downscaled result the cm first performs kriging interpolation on the gauge observations and collocated downscaled daily precipitation estimates and then adjusts the downscaled daily precipitation data by subtracting the difference between the two interpolated results however the cm performed better than the gda in merging the gauge observations and downscaled daily precipitation data as shown in tables 1 and 2 this may be related to how the models measure the spatial correlation of daily precipitation idw resorts to the inverse of the distance to each known point when assigning weights thus those weights depend only on the spatial locations of the known points regardless of the data at those points this simplification makes idw easy to execute nevertheless according to the above analysis the accuracy of the downscaled daily precipitation data varies in time and therefore the spatial correlation of the residuals also changes with time this is different from the idw s strategy the cm considers temporal variation in the spatial correlation of precipitation by constructing an average semivariogram model for each month figs s1 and s2 this is more consistent with the actual situation than what idw does note that the two methods showed nearly the same performances when 40 of the gauge observations were involved in merging process fig 9 this result may be explained by the lack of gauge observations previous studies also reported that idw had the same performance as kriging when observations were extremely sparse hengl 2007 li and heap 2011 to avoid the influence of gauge density on the establishment of a semivariogram model both ked and cm utilized the same semivariogram model inferred from satellite based daily precipitation estimates while both methods significantly enhanced the accuracy of downscaled daily precipitation data they still exhibited large differences in terms of the evaluation metrics even for each gauge density scenario fig 9 the reason for this may be associated with substantial uncertainties introduced by the cm during the interpolation of gauge observations given the strong variation in daily precipitation and sparse gauge distribution the interpolated daily precipitation results contained large uncertainties which caused the accuracy of the merged results from cm to depend largely on that of the downscaled daily precipitation data ked which combined gauge observations and downscaled daily precipitation estimates directly within a uniform geostatistical framework effectively avoided this problem this can be seen from the bias analysis for the two merged results it is well known that the best linear unbiased estimation is a key property of the geostatistical method goovaerts 2000 the merged results from ked confirm this notion with biases close to zero for all gauge density scenarios fig 9 park et al 2017 also reported that ked defeated cm in merging satellite based monthly precipitation estimates and gauge observations the proposed method consists of two steps i e downscaling and merging to further test the performance of the proposed downscaling scheme we constructed a series of spatial downscaling models for the generalized trmm seasonal precipitation data cumulative precipitation for any three consecutive months during 2015 2016 the results are shown in fig 13 take the model construction for february 2015 as an example its generalized seasonal precipitation was produced by the accumulation of daily precipitation in december 2014 and january and february 2015 and the corresponding generalized seasonal ndvi was generated by the average of monthly ndvi in december 2014 and january and february 2015 it is clear that the proposed scheme has higher stability and better performance than the ur method with all r2 values larger than 0 9 as mentioned above five density scenarios were designed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed merging strategy the results show that the proposed merging strategy performed better than the other two methods for each gauge density scenarios fig 9 in addition the study area has diverse landforms and various types of precipitation which provides favorable conditions for full evaluation therefore although only two year data were used the proposed downscaling merging method proved to be effective and robust data fusion refers to the process of integrating data from multiple sources to generate more consistent accurate and useful information than that provided by any individual data source wald 1999 accordingly the more the valuable information used the more accurate fused results can be obtained there are 129 rainfall gauges in the study area approximately one gauge per 1300 km2 such density means very sparse relative to a spatial resolution of 0 01 affecting the performance of the proposed method fortunately in the past decade most provinces in china have made considerable efforts toward a denser distribution of weather stations which will have great potential for improving precipitation observations in the future 6 conclusions the purpose of the current study was to develop an integrated downscaling merging method to generate high quality and high resolution daily precipitation estimates over a large area henan province of china was selected as the study area and the presented method s effectiveness was examined using trmm 3b42 daily precipitation data as well as gauge observations for the period 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2016 based on the results we drew the conclusions below 1 the method can efficiently produce accurate daily precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 01 over a large area 2 the temporal upscaling spatial downscaling temporal downscaling strategy can effectively solve common problems of spatially downscaling satellite based daily precipitation data the derived daily precipitation estimates not only preserve the satellite data s spatial pattern but also greatly improve their spatial detail 3 a seasonal timescale is ideal for spatial downscaling analysis and the relationships between seasonal precipitation and lef are spatially heterogeneous 4 it is feasible to infer the experimental semivariogram from downscaled daily precipitation estimates rather than sparse gauge observations mr ked greatly boosted the accuracy of down trmm reducing mae and rmse by 57 and 42 respectively and increasing csi by 0 17 5 ked performed much better than gda and cm in merging downscaled daily precipitation estimates and gauge observations even for the sparsest gauge density scenario 20 of the gauge observations wide use of satellite precipitation products is the ultimate goal for satellite precipitation observations though the presented method exhibits favorable performance in generating high resolution daily precipitation it is still unclear whether the results can meet the requirements of regional scale applications in future studies great efforts should be made to assess their suitability in relevant applications at the local scales such as watershed hydrological simulations credit authorship contribution

5881,due to the strong variation of precipitation in time and space it is necessary to generate accurate precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution this is essential for many applications such as hydrological and meteorological analysis however achieving such data over a large area remains a tremendous challenge in this study we presented a downscaling merging method to solve this problem first an integrated temporal upscaling spatial downscaling temporal downscaling strategy is introduced to spatially downscale satellite based daily precipitation data to a high spatial resolution of 0 01 the downscaled daily precipitation estimates are then merged with gauge observations in a multivariate geostatistical framework to avoid the adverse effects of sparse gauges the semivariogram model of daily precipitation is inferred from the downscaled results the method was applied to the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm daily precipitation product covering central china s henan province for the period 1 january 2015 31 december 2016 the experimental results show that 1 the downscaling strategy can effectively spatially downscale the trmm daily precipitation product maintaining not only the accuracy of the original trmm data but also providing greater spatial detail 2 a seasonal timescale is appropriate for downscaling analysis and 3 the merging scheme greatly enhances the accuracy of downscaled daily precipitation estimates reducing the mean absolute error and root mean square error by 57 and 42 respectively and increasing the critical success index by 0 17 the proposed method provided an efficient solution for producing accurate daily precipitation data with high spatial resolution over a large area keywords trmm spatial downscaling daily precipitation data fusion 1 introduction precipitation is a vital part of the water cycle and plays a critical role in global surface energy exchange and material circulation donohoe 2016 huntington 2006 trenberth et al 2003 precipitation has strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity which is of great importance not only for investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of regional precipitation but also for the analysis and management of hydrological and water related resources zhu et al 2018 ecological environment simulation damiano et al 2018 and dynamic monitoring of droughts and floods maggioni and massari 2018 traditionally the spatial distribution of precipitation has been mapped by interpolating gauge observations however accurate spatial interpolation of fine timescale daily or finer timescales precipitation has long been a problem in the field grimes and pardo igúzquiza 2010 one of the major reasons for this issue is the strong spatial variation of precipitation for example in a precipitation event there can be a pronounced discontinuity between a precipitation area and non precipitation area owing to its own smoothing behavior spatial interpolation cannot accurately identify such discontinuities moreover gauge observations are frequently sparse and unevenly distributed it is generally believed that the spatial resolution of interpolated precipitation results should be consistent with the density of gauge observations to ensure reliable results haylock et al 2008 therefore it is difficult to generate accurate precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution solely by interpolating gauge observations unlike spatial interpolation that generates only one optimal estimate stochastic spatial time precipitation models kyriakidis et al 2004 paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2018 can provide a range of realizations of precipitation fields in a probabilistic simulation framework and is more suitable for risk analysis and design of hydrological system meanwhile they are computationally intensive although weather radar has the capability of capturing the precipitation fields in high space time resolution fabry et al 1994 kim et al 2018 its spatial coverage is limited the fast development of satellite based observation technology over the past few decades has provided an unprecedented opportunity for precipitation observation and a range of global satellite based precipitation products have been released ashouri et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 for satellite observation high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution are contradictory making it impossible to obtain images with high spatiotemporal resolution in view of the cumulative nature of precipitation satellite must observe precipitation frequently resulting in a low spatial resolution of satellite precipitation data e g 0 25 for the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm as a result this spatial resolution is too coarse for applications at the local scale spatial downscaling can effectively solve this problem and is therefore critical for expanding the application scope of satellite precipitation data sorooshian et al 2011 spatial downscaling for coarse satellite precipitation data is based on high resolution local environmental factors lef and uses the significant interrelationship between the factors and precipitation to construct a downscaling model it is critical to accurately explore and describe this relationship which directly determines the effectiveness of a spatial downscaling model and further affects the quality of the downscaled precipitation estimates many methods have been developed in previous studies to spatially downscale satellite precipitation data chen et al 2014 2018 immerzeel et al 2009 joyce and xie 2011 lu et al 2019 ma et al 2017 tao et al 2018 zheng and bastiaanssen 2013 zorzetto and marani 2019 related studies have largely focused on satellite based annual and monthly precipitation data the reason behind this is that on annual and monthly timescales there are strong interactions between precipitation and lef these relationships do not exist on finer timescales e g daily for example vegetation responds significantly to partial rather than all precipitation events and a subtle change in vegetation caused by a light precipitation event may not be monitored by the sensor aboard satellite therefore according to the above principle spatial downscaling cannot be directly applied to satellite precipitation data with fine temporal resolution although a few attempts have been made to spatially downscale high temporal resolution satellite precipitation data fang et al 2013 guan et al 2009 they overemphasized the effect of topographic factors on precipitation distribution resulting in the following limitations 1 the methods are only applicable to mountainous areas and cannot be extended to other low relief areas and 2 in view of the strong variation of precipitation in time and space topographic factors which remain unchanged over a short period cannot significantly affect the spatial distribution of each precipitation event in other words it is impossible to establish an accurate spatial downscaling model for each event based solely on the relationship between the precipitation distribution and topographic factors although spatial downscaling studies have been applied to satellite based annual and monthly precipitation products it is essential to develop spatial downscaling techniques for high temporal resolution satellite precipitation data in future work due to the fact that no additional accurate precipitation observations are introduced during the downscaling procedure the accuracy of downscaled results is affected by the original satellite precipitation data numerous studies have found that the accuracy of satellite precipitation data varies in time and space and the accuracy of such data with high temporal resolution daily or finer timescales is much less than that of satellite based monthly precipitation data chen and li 2016 chen et al 2013 chen and gao 2018 fang et al 2019 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 maggioni et al 2016 sun et al 2018 tang et al 2016 therefore it can be affirmed that the downscaled results of satellite precipitation data with high temporal resolution also have poor accuracy and errors are temporally and spatially variable in recent years several studies have been conducted to boost the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates though merging the satellite based observations with gauge observations chao et al 2018 cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 huffman et al 2007 nie et al 2015 rozante et al 2010 wu et al 2018 xie and xiong 2011 yang et al 2017 these studies can be roughly classified into two categories known as direct and indirect merging direct merging blends satellite precipitation estimates with gauge point observations directly cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 rozante et al 2010 wu et al 2018 however there is a large difference in spatial scale between the two estimates which produces substantial uncertainty zheng and bastiaanssen 2013 particularly on daily or finer timescales where the heterogeneity of precipitation related spatial distributions is further exaggerated indirect merging which blends satellite precipitation estimates and gridded precipitation data interpolated from gauge observations nie et al 2015 xie and xiong 2011 yang et al 2017 can effectively avoid the disadvantages of direct merging however indirect merging is based on an implied premise i e dense gauge observations when faced with high spatial resolution satellite precipitation data indirect merging loses its power because the actual density of the gauge observations is often unable to meet the requirements of generating reliable gridded precipitation data with high spatial resolution following interpolation the main aim of this research is to produce accurate daily precipitation data with high resolution over a large area by developing a downscaling merging method the implementation of this method includes two steps first an integrated temporal upscaling spatial downscaling temporal downscaling strategy was proposed to spatially downscale trmm 3b42 daily precipitation products second accurate daily precipitation data with high resolution were achieved by merging the downscaled results with gauge observations a case study is presented for henan province in central china by using two years of trmm daily precipitation data to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method 2 methodology to achieve high quality and high resolution daily precipitation data over a large area a two step method is designed first trmm 3b42 daily precipitation data were downscaled to obtain high spatial resolution daily precipitation estimates second the accuracy of the estimates was enhanced through integrating with gauge observations in a multivariate geostatistical framework 2 1 an integrated strategy for spatially downscaling trmm 3b42 in view of the lack of strong interaction between daily precipitation and lef we did not spatially downscale the trmm 3b42 daily precipitation data directly instead we developed an indirect method consisting of three steps i e temporal upscaling spatial downscaling and temporal downscaling first the original trmm daily precipitation and local environmental variables were temporally upscaled to a coarser timescale where the precipitation variation could be well explained by the environmental variables preliminary analysis showed that on seasonal timescale trmm precipitation was significantly correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi digital elevation model dem latitude and longitude and its variation could be well explained thus these four factors were selected as auxiliary variables specifically the trmm daily precipitation was temporally accumulated into the trmm seasonal precipitation seasonaltrmm datasets and the monthly ndvi was temporally averaged into the seasonal ndvi seasonalndvi datasets next a spatial downscaling model was constructed for the accumulated trmm seasonal precipitation data accurate exploration of the interaction between seasonal precipitation and lef is critical which determines the quality of the downscaling model and eventually affects the accuracy of the downscaled results here we assumed that the afore mentioned relationship is spatially variable and therefore constructed a spatial downscaling model by developing a method presented in our previous study chen et al 2014 as follows 1 seasonaltrmm 0 25 u s α 0 0 25 u s β i 0 25 u s lef i 0 25 u s ε 0 25 u s i 1 2 4 where lef i 0 25 u s with i 1 2 3 and 4 represents seasonalndvi dem latitude and longitude respectively at spatial location u in season s spring summer autumn or winter α 0 0 25 u s stands for the intercept β i 0 25 u s is the corresponding coefficient of lef i 0 25 u s ε u s is the model residual and a superscripts of 0 25 represents a spatial resolution of 0 25 geographically weighted regression gwr brunsdon et al 1998 a spatial regression method was employed to investigate spatially varying relationships svr between seasonal precipitation and lef at a 0 25 spatial scale and generate 0 25 model parameters subsequently we spatially interpolated these estimated parameters from 0 25 to 0 01 by using spline function the seasonal precipitation data with high spatial resolution were estimated by 2 seasonaltrmm 0 01 u s α 0 0 01 u s β i 0 01 u s lef i 0 01 u s ε 0 01 u s i 1 2 4 finally we temporally downscaled the derived high spatial resolution trmm seasonal precipitation data into high spatial resolution daily precipitation estimates by using the temporal variation of the original trmm daily precipitation the assumption was made here that the ratio of daily precipitation to seasonal precipitation remains the same before and after spatial downscaling which is similar to the process of generating trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2007 concretely the ratio of trmm precipitation of the j th day to the seasonal accumulation rtrmm j 0 25 is roughly equal to that of the downscaled trmm precipitation of the j th day to seasonaltrmm0 01 the rtrmm j 0 25 is defined as follows 3 rtrmm j 0 25 u s dailytrmm j 0 25 u s seasonaltrmm 0 25 u s after interpolating rtrmm j 0 25 from 0 25 to 0 01 i e rtrmm j 0 01 by using a simple spline method the downscaled trmm precipitation on the j th day was obtained by 4 dailytrmm j 0 01 u s seasonaltrmm 0 01 u s rtrmm j 0 01 u s 2 2 merging downscaled daily precipitation estimates and daily gauge observations a multivariate geostatistical method known as kriging with external drift ked goovaerts 1997 was employed to integrate the downscaled daily precipitation estimates and daily gauge observations as follows 5 z u m u α 1 n u λ α u z u α m u α where u represents the location being predicted uα is the location of rain gauge m u a u b u dailytrmm0 01 u is the estimated mean at location being predicted u z u is the gauge observation at that location a u and b u are implicitly estimated by the kriging system within each search neighborhood and λα u are the weights estimated by solving the following equation 6 β 1 n u λ β u γ u α u β μ 0 u μ 1 u dailytrmm 0 01 u α γ u α u β 1 n u λ β u 1 β 1 n u λ β u dailytrmm 0 01 u β dailytrmm 0 01 u in theory γ h should be inferred from the residuals z u m u however this is not straightforward because m u is a priori unknown we solve this issue by using an approximate method berndt and haberlandt 2018 haberlandt 2007 that uses only z u to calculate the experimental semivariogram despite this our study still faced two problems one was the sparse gauge observations approximately one gauge per 1300 km2 a series of studies have pointed out that the semivariogram models derived from sparse samples cannot accurately estimate the spatial structure and dependence of regionalized variables chang et al 1998 mcbratney et al 1981 sun et al 2012 therefore it is difficult to accurately measure the spatial structure of daily precipitation using so few observations the other challenge was that building a semivariogram model for daily precipitation was a very time consuming task especially for days when the experimental semivariogram was disorganized due to the strong dynamics of daily precipitation unlike other studies goovaerts 2000 hudson and wackernagel 1994 the auxiliary variable downscaled daily precipitation used in our work is also the estimate of the primary variable daily precipitation many studies have reported that satellite derived precipitation data can effectively capture the spatial distribution of precipitation chen et al 2013 tang et al 2016 it should also be noted that a sufficient number of samples is able to exactly estimate the semivariogram structure of regionalized variable in this context we assumed that downscaled daily precipitation estimates can provide a spatial variogram structure for daily precipitation although these estimates have some deviation from actual precipitation thus inferring the semivariogram model of daily precipitation from the downscaled daily precipitation estimates can avoid the adverse effects of the shortage of gauge observations moreover to avert the afore mentioned second problem and considering the temporal variation of precipitation types in the study area we calculated the average of the standardized experimental semivariograms of daily precipitation in one month to represent the spatial structure of daily precipitation in that month which is similar to that presented by paschalis et al 2013 thus it is only necessary to construct 12 experimental semivariogram models for daily precipitation in one year the average experimental semivariogram for daily precipitation in each month is calculated by 7 γ h 1 m d 1 m 1 2 n h d var d w 1 n h d dailytrmm 0 01 u w d dailytrmm 0

location uw and n h d represents the number of pairs of data locations a vector h apart on the d th day subsequently a theoretical semivariogram model was fitted to the derived average experimental semivariogram preliminary analysis revealed that the spherical model could fit the average experimental semivariogram better than others therefore we selected this model to construct the theoretical semivariogram model 8 γ h c 0 c 1 3 h 2 a 1 2 h a 3 if h a c 0 c 1 o t h e r w i s e here a is the range and c 0 and c 1 are the nugget effect and sill respectively 2 3 validation cross validation was

precipitation estimates to detect a precipitation event pod denotes the ratio of correct identification by daily precipitation estimates over the number of precipitation events from gauge observations

henan province is located between 31 23 36 22 n and 110 21 116 39 e with an area of 167 000 km2 as shown in fig 1 it has a diverse landscape with mountains in the west and plains in the east with elevation ranging from 23 2 to 2400 m above sea level the xiong er and funiu mountains form a vast network of mountain ranges and plateaus in the west supporting one of the few remaining temperate deciduous forests the yellow river which enters from the northwest traverses central henan henan has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons the precipitation distribution exhibits strong gradients changing with longitude latitude and elevation the higher annual average precipitation occurs in the southeast of the area 1300 mm year and lower values toward the northwest about 400 mm year owing to the influence of the east asian monsoon the summer is hot and humid with most precipitation falling during that season the winter climate is controlled by the siberian high and is therefore cold windy and dry domrös and peng 2012 3 2 data trmm began in 1998 as a joint mission between the us national aeronautics and space administration and the japan aerospace exploration agency and was designed to monitor and study tropical precipitation trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis products which have a spatial resolution of 0 25 and coverage of 50 n 50 s are produced by integrating microwave precipitation estimates and infrared precipitation estimates and rescaling the integrated estimates to the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2007 huffman et al 2010 we used the trmm 3b42 version 7 daily precipitation product for spatial downscaling in this study the ndvi data of henan province were from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface reflectance products mod13a3 which have a monthly temporal resolution and a 1 km spatial resolution to be consistent with the coordinate system of trmm the ndvi data used were first converted into a geographic coordinate system and then resampled to 0 01 and 0 25 data i e trmm0 01 and trmm0 25 respectively the dem data was obtained from version 4 1 shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation data with 90 m spatial resolution which were downloaded from https cgiarcsi community data srtm 90m digital elevation database v4 1 following the preprocessing process for the ndvi data the dem data used also were converted into a geographic coordinate system and resampled to 0 01 and 0 25 data i e dem0 01 and dem0 25 respectively in addition daily gauge observations of the study area were from henan meteorogical service china which were collected from 129 meteorological stations as shown in fig 1 the dataset has not yet been made public and we only obtained observations from january 1 2015 to december 31 2016 all data were subjected to a series of quality controls including the examination of extreme values internal consistency checks and the removal of questionable data yu et al 2007 4 results 4 1 downscaling and merging analysis to verify that there are svr between seasonal precipitation and lef we compared them with uniform relationships ur jia et al 2011 as seen in fig 2 the derived ur exhibit instability over time especially during summer 2016 when the r2 was 0 39 and the rmse reached 145 9 mm in contrast the svr show significant improvement in investigating seasonal precipitation variation as well as a stable performance over time with r2 values more than 0 9 take the analysis for spring 2015 as an example the estimated coefficients and residuals are shown in fig 3 these parameters demonstrate significant spatial variation most of the residuals are between 20 and 20 mm in addition to avoid the overfitting problem of gwr we set bandwidths greater than 0 8 for exploring relationships between seasonal precipitation and lef following the implementation of the procedures described in section 2 1 the downscaled daily precipitation estimates for 2015 2016 were generated according to eq 7 we randomly selected 10 000 grids with values larger than 0 1 mm from the downscaled daily precipitation data as samples to calculate an average experimental semivariogram finally a spherical model for each month was established by fitting the derived average experimental semivariogram fig s1 shows the models for each month of 2015 they reveal significant monthly variation with ranges from 0 31 to 1 51 specifically the models for the summer months june july and august showed the longest ranges 1 2 indicating that summer precipitation has the longest spatial correlation distance by contrast ranges for the winter months december january and february had the shortest ranges 0 6 in addition the ranges for autumn months were slightly longer than those for spring months this is related to the nature of precipitation in the study area most precipitation in the area falls in june july and august and is characterized by large volumes and extensive spatial coverage in contrast a small amount of precipitation falls in the winter months as presented in fig s2 in the supplementary material a similar situation occurred in 2016 taking precipitation on days 27 109 175 and 277 in 2015 as examples their spatial distributions from original trmm 3b42 ori trmm downscaled precipitation estimates down trmm and merged precipitation estimates by ked mr ked are shown in fig 4 generally ori trmm has a mosaic like precipitation distribution because of its coarse resolution compared with ori trmm down trmm preserves the spatial precipitation patterns of the afore mentioned days and also greatly improves their spatial detail after merging with gauge observations daily precipitation from down trmm was noticeably corrected resulting in a large difference between down trmm and mr ked these corrections can be divided into two aspects first the merging adjusted the daily precipitation amounts of down trmm for example this is clear for precipitation on day 175 in 2015 after merging precipitation in the northern and eastern study area increased significantly while precipitation in the southernmost region decreased remarkably the reason behind this is that satellite observations underestimated precipitation in the north and east and overestimated in the furthest south ked took these factors into account when estimating the local mean m u in eq 5 and ultimately greatly corrected satellite based precipitation in these regions second the merging also modified the spatial coverage of daily precipitation from down trmm for example on day 27 in 2015 down trmm showed no precipitation in the southern study area whereas mr ked showed precipitation completely covering that area precipitation in january april july and october 2015 was selected to illustrate the monthly precipitation analysis fig 5 which was produced by accumulating daily precipitation although these monthly precipitation estimates share a similar spatial pattern there are differences between them similar to the daily precipitation analysis the downscaled results middle column show more spatial detail than the original trmm data left column note that the merging only corrected the monthly precipitation amount of down trmm this is because monthly precipitation completely covered the study area 4 2 cross validation assessments were performed on gridded and regional spatial scales as well as on daily and monthly timescales the other two typical merged methods i e geographic difference analysis gda cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 and conditional merging cm sinclair and pegram 2005 were used for comparison hereafter the merged results from gda and cm are abbreviated as mr gda and mr cm respectively furthermore cm used the strategy described by eq 7 to calculate the theoretical semivariogram model of daily precipitation 4 2 1 validation on gridded scale table 1 and fig 6 show the overall and time series of evaluation metrics respectively for the five daily precipitation estimates which were calculated by cross validation for each day during 2015 2016 among these data mr ked exhibited the best performance compared with down trmm the mae and rmse of mr ked decreased by 57 and 42 respectively while the down trmm shows great spatial detail relative to ori trmm fig 4 both datasets had roughly the same evaluation metrics throughout the study period this is because no additional accurate precipitation observations were introduced during the downscaling procedure after merging with gauge observations the three merged results all improved the accuracy of down trmm and greatly removed the mae and rmse this is especially true for mr ked where the biases are stable around zero and the rmses and maes are smaller than the other two merged results during most of the study period fig 6 we also evaluated the performances of the five daily precipitation datasets for different precipitation ranges the results are presented in fig 7 for detecting a rain event the five datasets had similar patterns all datasets detected rainless events well but detection performances worsened with increasing precipitation ori trmm had nearly the same detection performance as down trmm for all precipitation ranges except for the first two ranges 0 mm and 1 5 mm in which down trmm performed worse than ori trmm in detecting rainless events but better in detecting 0 5 mm precipitation events after merging with gauge observations the three merged results significantly improved in performance for the detection of rain events especially mr ked which performed much better than the others in each precipitation range except the last two 40 50 mm and 50 mm regarding the accuracy of precipitation estimates ori trmm overestimated precipitation in the first two precipitation ranges but underestimated in the remaining ranges as the amount of precipitation increased the deviation of ori trmm from gauge observations increased resulting in a corresponding increase in its maes and rmses in contrast with down trmm the evaluation metrics of the three merged results all move toward zero in each precipitation range indicating significant enhancements in accuracy except for the last precipitation range 50 mm mr ked outperformed mr gda and mr cm additionally we investigated the performances of the five daily precipitation datasets spatially by verifying their abilities to capture variation in daily precipitation time series at the gauge locations the results are presented in fig 8 among the five datasets ori trmm had the worst performance with the smallest r and the largest mae and rmse in terms of the four statistical metrics down trmm performed slightly better than ori trmm which means that spatial downscaling could slightly strengthen the ability of satellite precipitation data to capture temporal changes in daily precipitation as expected the three merged results greatly increased rs and reduced maes and rmses relative to down trmm indicating that merging significantly improved the temporal consistency between the daily precipitation estimates and gauge observations however mr gda and mr cm had relatively large biases even greater than ori trmm but their maes and rmses were much smaller than those of ori trmm this is because both merged results consistently overestimated daily precipitation however the magnitude of overestimation was small among the three merged precipitation datasets mr ked gave the best performance with rs larger than 0 88 and maes smaller than 1 mm at most gauge locations to further analyze the impact of rain gauge density on the accuracy of the merged daily precipitation estimates five density scenarios i e 100 80 60 40 and 20 of the gauge observations were defined by random selection fig 9 summarizes the three merged daily precipitation estimates for the five scenarios as the density of rain gauges decreased the accuracy of the three datasets declined but still higher than that of down trmm ked performed better than the other two methods for each gauge density scenarios indicating its effectiveness and stability table 2 and fig 10 depict the overall and time evolution of evaluation metrics respectively for the five monthly precipitation estimates down trmm had roughly the same performance as ori trmm in estimating monthly precipitation and the monthly precipitation estimates from mr ked had the optimal accuracy among the five datasets although all three merged results showed significant increase in accuracy as compared with the monthly precipitation estimates from down trmm reducing mae and rmse by 19 31 and 19 21 respectively the improvements were less than those for a daily timescale in addition the improvements were unstable over time particularly for certain months when no improvements were observed fig 10 there are two reasons for these results first improvements on the daily timescale were offset to some extent when daily data were accumulated into monthly precipitation second the monthly precipitation estimates from ori trmm i e trmm 3b43 are inherently accurate because they were calibrated by the monthly gpcc rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2007 4 2 2 validation on regional scale regional average daily precipitation radp from the five precipitation datasets was also assessed as seen from fig 11 ori trmm overestimated underestimated radp less more than 10 mm these errors offset each other to some extent eventually resulting in a small total bias of 0 17 mm however this did not affect the absolute errors with mae and rmse reaching 1 21 and 2 66 mm respectively for the four statistical metrics no significant difference was observed between down trmm and ori trmm indicating comparable performances in estimating radp after merging with gauge observations there were noticeable improvements the three merged results moved near the 1 1 line and their rmses and maes were reduced more than 80 as compared to down trmm especially for mr ked which had the best agreement with the gauge observations unlike ori trmm and down trmm there was no significant difference between the bias and mae for each merged dataset because they overestimated radp during most of the study period compared with the estimation of radp the five precipitation datasets enhanced the consistency with the gauge observations for measuring regional average monthly precipitation ramp as shown in fig 11 this is particularly true for ori trmm and down trmm both of which raised the r from 0 85 to more than 0 98 this is related to the mutual cancellation of positive and negative errors during the process of accumulating daily data into monthly precipitation as expected ori trmm and down trmm exhibited nearly equivalent performances and the three merged results performed better than down trmm compared with mr ked mr gda and mr cm showed clear overestimation and had larger maes and rmses therefore mr ked performed best in estimating ramp to further assess the performances of the five datasets in measuring radp the number of days bias and rmse for each dataset were investigated for various precipitation ranges as shown in fig 12 except for mr ked all daily precipitation datasets underestimated rainless days which led to small pods table 3 although mr gda and mr cm detected fewer rainless days than down trmm the former datasets had better overall performance csis than the latter because of its large fars mr ked overestimated rainless days relative to the gauge observations resulting in a pod as large as 1 and it had a small far therefore mr ked had the best overall performance in identifying a rainless day with a csi of 0 8 down trmm performed nearly the same as ori trmm in each precipitation range specifically both datasets overestimated underestimated the number of days with radp no more more than 10 mm and their deviations from the gauge observations increased with increasing precipitation within each range all three merged results had better performances than down trmm greatly reducing rmses and shifting biases to zero particularly for mr ked 5 discussion for the construction of a spatial downscaling model for satellite based daily precipitation products the three most important factors are the timescale selection of variables and method for investigating the relationship first selecting the proper timescale is an essential prerequisite for modeling usually there is no strong interaction between daily precipitation and lef although a few studies have performed spatial downscaling directly on satellite based monthly precipitation data tao et al 2018 xu et al 2015 they were limited to certain months such as in the growing months the reason behind this is that a significant relationship between precipitation and lef only exists during those months many studies have also reported that vegetation response to precipitation is up to a 2 or 3 month lag brunsell 2006 ji and peters 2005 wang et al 2003 suggesting that analysis on a seasonal timescale can explain the variation of precipitation our analysis is consistent with these studies accounting for more than 90 of the variation in precipitation for each season of the study period fig 2 second unlike other downscaling studies chen et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 we introduced geographic location latitude and longitude as auxiliary variables as our preliminary analysis suggested that a model s explanatory power for precipitation variation is significantly enhanced by the introduction of geographic location similar cases were found in bryan and adams 2002 and price et al 2000 which also reported a significant relationship between precipitation and geographical location however the characteristics of precipitation in an area determine whether location information should be involved in the downscaling model if there is no significant correlation between precipitation and location the latter should not be used it should be noted that other environmental variables such as land cover or atmospheric variables e g pressure also affect the spatial distribution of precipitation as mentioned earlier the spatial downscaling for coarse satellite precipitation data is based on high resolution lef however there are a small number of reliable lef with a high resolution available in reality in addition the build model itself is spatially variable so it is not necessary to include the categorical variables e g land cover based on these considerations we only selected the four variables for constructing the model in the future efforts should be devoted to consider more useful lef to improve the ability of the downscaling model to explain the variation of precipitation finally it is important to select an appropriate method to accurately explore and describe the relationships between precipitation and lef as shown in figs 2 and 3 the investigated relationships had significant spatial variation and gwr performed better than the classic method immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 this indicates that the assumption of svr is justified similar findings were reported in other studies chen et al 2014 chen et al 2015 xu et al 2015 in the present study gda is roughly equivalent to cm specifically the gda applies the spatial interpolation result from inverse distance weighting idw of the residuals between gauge observations and the collocated downscaled daily precipitation estimates to correct the downscaled result the cm first performs kriging interpolation on the gauge observations and collocated downscaled daily precipitation estimates and then adjusts the downscaled daily precipitation data by subtracting the difference between the two interpolated results however the cm performed better than the gda in merging the gauge observations and downscaled daily precipitation data as shown in tables 1 and 2 this may be related to how the models measure the spatial correlation of daily precipitation idw resorts to the inverse of the distance to each known point when assigning weights thus those weights depend only on the spatial locations of the known points regardless of the data at those points this simplification makes idw easy to execute nevertheless according to the above analysis the accuracy of the downscaled daily precipitation data varies in time and therefore the spatial correlation of the residuals also changes with time this is different from the idw s strategy the cm considers temporal variation in the spatial correlation of precipitation by constructing an average semivariogram model for each month figs s1 and s2 this is more consistent with the actual situation than what idw does note that the two methods showed nearly the same performances when 40 of the gauge observations were involved in merging process fig 9 this result may be explained by the lack of gauge observations previous studies also reported that idw had the same performance as kriging when observations were extremely sparse hengl 2007 li and heap 2011 to avoid the influence of gauge density on the establishment of a semivariogram model both ked and cm utilized the same semivariogram model inferred from satellite based daily precipitation estimates while both methods significantly enhanced the accuracy of downscaled daily precipitation data they still exhibited large differences in terms of the evaluation metrics even for each gauge density scenario fig 9 the reason for this may be associated with substantial uncertainties introduced by the cm during the interpolation of gauge observations given the strong variation in daily precipitation and sparse gauge distribution the interpolated daily precipitation results contained large uncertainties which caused the accuracy of the merged results from cm to depend largely on that of the downscaled daily precipitation data ked which combined gauge observations and downscaled daily precipitation estimates directly within a uniform geostatistical framework effectively avoided this problem this can be seen from the bias analysis for the two merged results it is well known that the best linear unbiased estimation is a key property of the geostatistical method goovaerts 2000 the merged results from ked confirm this notion with biases close to zero for all gauge density scenarios fig 9 park et al 2017 also reported that ked defeated cm in merging satellite based monthly precipitation estimates and gauge observations the proposed method consists of two steps i e downscaling and merging to further test the performance of the proposed downscaling scheme we constructed a series of spatial downscaling models for the generalized trmm seasonal precipitation data cumulative precipitation for any three consecutive months during 2015 2016 the results are shown in fig 13 take the model construction for february 2015 as an example its generalized seasonal precipitation was produced by the accumulation of daily precipitation in december 2014 and january and february 2015 and the corresponding generalized seasonal ndvi was generated by the average of monthly ndvi in december 2014 and january and february 2015 it is clear that the proposed scheme has higher stability and better performance than the ur method with all r2 values larger than 0 9 as mentioned above five density scenarios were designed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed merging strategy the results show that the proposed merging strategy performed better than the other two methods for each gauge density scenarios fig 9 in addition the study area has diverse landforms and various types of precipitation which provides favorable conditions for full evaluation therefore although only two year data were used the proposed downscaling merging method proved to be effective and robust data fusion refers to the process of integrating data from multiple sources to generate more consistent accurate and useful information than that provided by any individual data source wald 1999 accordingly the more the valuable information used the more accurate fused results can be obtained there are 129 rainfall gauges in the study area approximately one gauge per 1300 km2 such density means very sparse relative to a spatial resolution of 0 01 affecting the performance of the proposed method fortunately in the past decade most provinces in china have made considerable efforts toward a denser distribution of weather stations which will have great potential for improving precipitation observations in the future 6 conclusions the purpose of the current study was to develop an integrated downscaling merging method to generate high quality and high resolution daily precipitation estimates over a large area henan province of china was selected as the study area and the presented method s effectiveness was examined using trmm 3b42 daily precipitation data as well as gauge observations for the period 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2016 based on the results we drew the conclusions below 1 the method can efficiently produce accurate daily precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 01 over a large area 2 the temporal upscaling spatial downscaling temporal downscaling strategy can effectively solve common problems of spatially downscaling satellite based daily precipitation data the derived daily precipitation estimates not only preserve the satellite data s spatial pattern but also greatly improve their spatial detail 3 a seasonal timescale is ideal for spatial downscaling analysis and the relationships between seasonal precipitation and lef are spatially heterogeneous 4 it is feasible to infer the experimental semivariogram from downscaled daily precipitation estimates rather than sparse gauge observations mr ked greatly boosted the accuracy of down trmm reducing mae and rmse by 57 and 42 respectively and increasing csi by 0 17 5 ked performed much better than gda and cm in merging downscaled daily precipitation estimates and gauge observations even for the sparsest gauge density scenario 20 of the gauge observations wide use of satellite precipitation products is the ultimate goal for satellite precipitation observations though the presented method exhibits favorable performance in generating high resolution daily precipitation it is still unclear whether the results can meet the requirements of regional scale applications in future studies great efforts should be made to assess their suitability in relevant applications at the local scales such as watershed hydrological simulations credit authorship contribution

5882,rock dip angle plays a significant role in surface hydraulic characteristics and leads to different spatial distribution of water and soil loss in karst trough valleys in this study the rock dip angle effect on the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate on dip anti dip slopes was explored via rainfall simulations and a steel experimental flume the rainfall intensities ranged from 30 to 90 mm h 1 and the rock dip angles varied from 10 to 60 the results revealed that i surface runoff on the dip slope was higher than that on the anti dip slope whereas underground runoff presented opposite results the 30 rock dip angle presented the critical flow velocity for the anti dip slope and the flow velocity reduced as the rock dip angle of the dip slope increased ii laminar water flow occurred on the dip anti dip slope re was 500 in all cases for the anti dip slope the re value reduced by 3 53 89 79 the fr value reduced by 34 13 73 04 and the f value increased by 61 07 93 78 compared with that of the dip slope iii a linear function model can describe the relationship between the soil detachment rate and hydrodynamic parameters τ w and e it was found that w was the best of the hydrodynamic parameters to describe the soil detachment rate these results could provide valuable information for establishing a national scale empirical soil erosion model for karst trough valley keywords karst trough valley dip anti dip slopes rock strata dip hydraulic characteristics rainfall simulation 1 introduction karst rocky desertification is a major type of land desertification and an ecosystem with serious degradation globally gutiérrcz et al 2008 febles gonzález et al 2012 the area of karst regions reaches 22 million square kilometres and covers approximately 12 of the global land area liu 2009 in addition the karst region in southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst regions in the world and it covers an area of 540 000 km2 and occupies approximately 5 2 of china s territory fan et al 2011 under the influence of tectonism and long term karst processes a karst slope surface is characterized by rocky surface landscape with desertification and the underground layer contains a complex hydrological system gao et al 2010 peng et al 2018 in addition the main karst regions can be classified into the following topographic types trough valley platform high or low mountains peak clusters and hills the karst trough valley is one of the most important landscapes and tourist destinations in chongqing province china the karst trough valley not only has a special surface underground double geological structure but also has a typical rock strata dip i e dip anti dip slope the bedrock in the karst trough valley is largely composed of crystalline units and metasedimentary rocks longitudinal flow movement is the main water flow direction in the karst trough valley and it extends along a concave surface that forms a u fault plane the special u fault plane results in two typical rock strata dips i e dip slope the dominant joint plane of the stratified rock slope has the same direction as the slant of the slope and anti dip slope the stratified rock slope is opposite to the slant of the slope the monoclinal tilt of the bedrock controls the spatial distribution of rainfall water on the slope as a result the runoff is mainly lost along the surface on the dip slope while for the anti dip slope the runoff mainly leaks into the underground river through pore fissures and cracks wang et al 2004 thus the large scale bedrock in the soil has caused substantial changes in the water circulation and shedding patterns in the overland flow which results in more or less agitation in the flow field of the karst trough valley the competitive relationship between vortex generation and dissipation can reveal the effect of monoclinal tilt of the bedrock on the turbulence or laminarity of the flow the umbrella effect of the droplet impacts can create a wake like region around the obstacles in addition the rock dip angle side slope inclination angle rock layer inclination and tendency relations all have important effects on water and soil loss schwab et al 2009 for example whipple 2004 reported that the bedrock channel width is closely linked to lateral bank erosion that roughens the channels by quarrying out large boulders fábio et al 2015 concluded that soil erosion on the dip slope mainly proceeds to landslides for the bedding the underlying bedrock was parallel with the topographic slope while the anti dip slope of the valley had deeply dissected bedrock by bordering channels and he also found that the orientation of the bedrock can break the erosional budget in addition the previous studies have focused on the effect of the bedrock on soil erosion jomaa et al 2012 and some findings have also considered the influence of bedrock effect on quantitative flow characteristics nearing et al 1999 however research on the effects of rock strata dip on soil detachment and hydrodynamics is rare particularly in karst trough valleys the karst trough valley has abundant bedrock in soil which causes serious water and soil loss land resources shortages environmental degradation and human conflict in the yangtze river therefore the study of the influence of rock strata dip on the soil erosion process has important practical significance in karst trough valleys furthermore research on the characteristics of water hydrodynamics is helpful for studying the mechanism of soil erosion in such areas it is well known that karst trough valleys have a unique double layer geologic structure that leads to surface erosion and underground leakage dai et al 2017a peng et al 2018 some scholars have researched the characteristics of surface erosion and underground leakage in karst regions for example gillieson et al 1996 developed surface loss and underground leakage models in mexico which can be used to predict the amount of water and soil loss in high risk regions dai et al 2017b performed the indoor rainfall simulations to explore the effects of underground pore fissure degrees and bedrock bareness rates on surface erosion and underground leakage and found that the underground pore fissures and bedrock bareness rate were the predominant factors leading to the spatial distribution of water and soil loss in karst regions the above research mainly discussed and analysed the process and mechanisms underlying surface and underground soil erosion in karst regions and achieved certain results however few studies have compared the water dynamic parameters via a soil erosion prediction model and the methods and techniques for researching surface water hydrological systems are still at the exploratory stage in karst regions especially in karst trough valley more importantly the effect of rock strata dip on surface loss and underground leakage in karst trough valleys is still unclear the surface hydrogeologies on dip and anti dip slopes are very different therefore it is important to understand the strata dip mechanisms that affect the surface water hydrological system and underground leakage in karst trough valleys soil detachment plays an important role in the soil erosion model soil detachment can be predicted by hydrodynamic parameters in soil erosion models generally the control variables of soil detachment are flow depth flow velocity and hydraulic roughness for instance bunte and poesen 1994 found that the hydraulic roughness and the transport capacity could be influenced by rock fragments this finding is partly attributed to small rock fragments being impervious interfaces on the surface slope thereby dividing the water flow into several small threads other studies have assessed whether rock fragment cover can be used in the prediction model for soil erosion other scholars concluded that flow velocity was dependent on the rock fragment cover which can increase the hydraulic friction and decrease the sediment yield in the weep model nearing et al 1989 the bedrocks seem to form a discontinuous impermeable area that reduces runoff and sediment loss during rainstorms large areas of exposed bedrock have a significant effect on surface erosion in karst regions dai et al 2017a peng et al 2018 karst rocky desertification results in more serious soil erosion and ecological fragility which restricts the sustainable development of the economy and is dangerous to the survival of mankind meanwhile rock strata dip plays an important role in the spatial distribution of the runoff and sediment yield and variation in the rock strata dip has a great influence on surface loss and underground leakage therefore the major points of this study include identifying the factors that determine the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate and revealing the mechanisms that determine the effects on hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate in karst trough valleys under different rock dip angles of dip anti dip slopes in this study the double layer structure of the micro geomorphology was simulated by a new self made steel flume on a dip anti dip slope and the influence of the rainfall intensity rock strata dip and rock dip angle on the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate in the karst trough valley were investigated specifically this study aims to 1 reveal the mechanisms by which changes in rock dip angle influence the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate on dip anti dip slopes and 2 determine whether the soil detachment rate exhibit significant relationships with the hydrodynamic parameters by performing variance analysis this study provides reference data for researching the mechanisms of rock strata dip for water and soil conservation and the control and prevention of surface slope erosion in the karst trough valley 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and site description the experimental soils were collected from a typical karst trough valley 28 49 38 n 108 28 46 e at youyang county chongqing province china fig 1 the longtan karst valley is located at the southeast

longtan valley has the same inclination and opposite slope direction resulting in two typical rock strata dips i e dip slope located on the west side of the valley and anti dip slope located on the south side of the valley the rock strata in this study area are almost entirely constituted by limestone shale sand shale stone etc and the outcrops are mainly carbonate limestone there are considerable proportions of carbonate rocks with sizes 35 cm in the soils the test carbonate rocks with sizes of 36 53 cm were collected from the cultivated land on dip anti dip slope of karst trough valley the location and slope of karst trough valley were measured by a gps and gradiometer meanwhile the elevation slope gradient latitude bedrock and vegetation were recorded with a compass and tape measure table 1 2 2 experimental designs all soils and carbonate rocks used for the rainfall experiments were collected from the karst valley area based on the investigation of 20 typical karst valleys in chongqing province china a according to the field measurement of the outcrops size in cultivated land of the longtan karst trough valley in chongqing carbonate rocks with heights of 36 53 cm were randomly arranged in the flume experiment to simulate bare bedrock fig 2 the bare bedrock ratio is the area ratio of the exposed bedrock to the horizontally projected area of the slope which was set at 15 potential rocky desertification with 11 pieces of limestone in the rainfall simulation dai et al 2017b b the karst trough valley has two typical rock strata dips i e dip and anti dip slopes the dip anti dip slopes were simulated by adjusting the monoclinal tilt of the bedrock in the steel flume based on the field survey the rock dip angles on dip anti dip slopes mainly range from 8 to 65 the rock dip angles of the dip anti dip were fixed at 10 30 and 60 which can be classified into the 3 main types i e flat dip angle 10 gentle dip angle 30 and median dip angle 60 liu 2009 c the underground pore fissure is simulated by moving two removable plates with drainage holes at the bottom of the steel flume the underground pore fissure degree was set as 1 to represent the light field underground pore fissure peng et al 2016 d based on the characteristics of erosive precipitation in the karst trough valley of chongqing province the rainfall intensities were fixed at 30 60 and 90 mm h which can be divided into 3 main types i e light rainfall intensity 30 mm h moderate rainfall intensity 60 mm h and extreme rainfall intensity 90 mm h e the slope was set to 25 according to the standard critical steep slope based on the field investigation and literature analysis peng et al 2016 f according to the typical soil thickness in the karst trough valley the soil thickness in this study was set to 30 cm and it was divided into a plough pan 10 cm and a tillage layer 20 cm each flume experiment was segmented into three soil layers and the soil compactness was 453 801 and 1172 kpa from the upper part to the lower part respectively which is similar to field soil compaction to ensure that the initial soil moisture was consistent in each treatment a known amount of water was sprinkled evenly over the soil after packing all the experimental treatments were run three times with 63 experiments performed in total before each rainfall experiment proceeded the test soil in the flume was replaced by fresh soil 2 3 rainfall simulation experiment the rainfall simulation experiment was conducted at a rainfall laboratory in southwest university beibei district china the experimental device included a water supply rainfall simulator a simulated rainfall controlling hall two side sprinkler devices and water pipes and a steel test flume 0 35 m high 5 m long and 1 m wide there were 164 spaced holes 5 cm in these two removable steel plates at the bottom of the steel flume the spaced holes in the plates were made to collect infiltrating water which was equivalent to underground runoff as shown in fig 3 the height of the rainfall simulator device from the ground is 3 m the rainfall intensity can be adjusted from 10 to 150 mm h 1 the raindrop distribution uniformity was above 90 the droplet sizes ranged from 0 125 to 0 5 mm and their kinematic energy ranged from 1 25 to 8 14 j m 2 h 1 which was over 90 natural raindrops the slope of the flume could be adjusted from 0 to 45 the porosity of the drain holes at the bottom of the steel flume could be controlled from 0 to 5 dai et al 2017a b the surface and underground water and soil samples could be collected at the drainage outlets 2 4 experimental processes each rainfall experiment lasted for 60 min when both surface and underground runoff appeared the surface and underground runoff were recorded three times in 5 min intervals during the first 30 min and then collected in 10 min intervals during the last 30 min in each experiment during the rainfall experiment kmno4 was used as a dye tracer to test the water flow velocity a certain amount of dye in a soft plastic bottle was quickly injected into the water flow and the processing time of the dye cloud was tested by a high precision stopwatch for each rainfall experiment the flow velocity measurements were performed in 1 m intervals of 0 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m and 4 5 m where there was no bedrock to block the flow from the top of the flume the flow velocity at each of the two ridges of the bedrock from the top to the bottom of the flume was also measured the mean surface water flow velocity was considered as the average value of 14 measurements fig 4 which were recorded three times in 5 min intervals during the first 30 min and then collected in 10 min intervals during the last 30 min of each experiment for each measurement position of flow velocity the flow depth was tested at the front back and two sides of each bare bedrock with a digital level probe model sx40 a the device precision and the confidence interval of the measurements were 0 01 mm and 95 respectively the runoff and sediment samples were collected at the same time as the flow velocity a light rain of 10 mm h was applied to attain the saturated soil water content the water temperature was measured via a thermometer to test the water kinematic viscosity the water temperature ranged from 10 to 17 c at the end of the test the sediment samples were left for 24 h then the liquid supernatant was emptied and the rest of the wet sediment samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and weighed 2 5 hydraulic characteristics 1 flow

is 0 67 for laminar flow therefore a coefficient k value of 0 67 was used in the measurements 2 flow with w the effect of the bare bedrock on the unit water discharge should be taken into

response of flow hydraulics to different rock dip angles 3 1 1 runoff characteristics the rock dip angle is one of the main driving forces for underground runoff leakage in karst trough valleys to better understand the characteristics of runoff in karst trough valleys the effect of rock dip angle on surface loss and underground leakage are analyzed via experiments fig 5 when the rainfall intensity was 30 mm h runoff on the anti dip slope was mainly underground runoff and the underground runoff coefficient ranged from 52 22 to 66 93 however the surface runoff on the dip slope was higher than that of underground runoff for a rock dip angle of 10 and 30 but not for a rock dip angle of 60 when the rainfall intensity was higher than 60 mm h the surface runoff coefficient on the dip anti dip slopes was higher than the underground runoff coefficient for the dip slope the surface runoff coefficient decreased as the rock dip angle increased and the surface runoff coefficient ranged from 41 75 to 90 26 this finding may be attributed to the fact that the slope direction of the bedding layer presents the same direction as the water flow rate in the karst trough valley which can promote the flow rate and reduce the amount of the rainwater leakage for the anti dip slope the underground runoff coefficient varied with the rock dip angle in the order of 10 60 30 and the underground coefficient ranged from 16 01 to 66 94 this finding is because the direction of the bedrock layer is opposite to that of the water flow thus the intercept effect on rainwater by bedrock is increased the amount of rainwater loss along the rock soil interface is increased the surface runoff is reduced and the water flow is reduced therefore the surface runoff coefficient on the dip slope was much higher than that on the anti dip slope 3 1 2 flow velocity and depth flow velocity has a direct relationship with the soil detachment sediment transport and deposition processes during hydra erosion the curves for the measured flow velocity as a function of rainfall time under different rock dip angles of dip anti dip slopes are shown in fig 6 a the results show that the relationship between the flow velocity and rainfall time can be defined by a power function model under the 90 mm h rainfall intensity r 2 0 691 0 916 p 0 01 the mean flow velocity presented increased fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment when the rainfall time increased from 5 min to 30 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall time increased from 30 min to 60 min all other experiments had similar results regardless of the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity table 2 shows that as the rainfall intensity increased the mean flow velocity increased the flow velocity was higher on the dip slope than the anti dip slope for the dip slope the mean flow velocity occurred in the order 10 30 60 for the anti dip slope the mean flow velocity occurred in the order 30 10 60 and the flow velocity decreased by 17 42 53 42 the value 30 was the critical value for the water flow velocity the correlation analysis showed that the rock dip angles for dip anti dip slopes and rainfall intensity have significant effects table 3 and these two factors have a significant interaction effect on flow velocity table 3 showed that the rainfall intensity is more strongly correlated with the flow depth of the dip slope while the bedding dip has a relatively remarkable correlation with the flow depth of the anti dip slope for the dip slope the flow depth decreased as the rock dip angle increased under the rainfall intensity ranged from 30 to 60 mm h except for the 90 mm h rainfall intensity however for the anti dip slope the flow depth increased by 2 79 266 58 compared to the dip slope in the order of 60 30 10 3 1 3 flow regime the mean re value and fr value showed increased fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment when the rainfall time increased from 5 min to 30 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall time increased to 60 min from 30 min the dip slope had a higher re value and fr value than the anti dip slope all other experiments had similar results regardless of the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity fig 6b and c the correlation between the flow regime re and fr and rock dip angles and rainfall intensity and their interactions had significant effects on the dip anti dip slopes table 3 the variation in re was lower than 500 in all the experimental treatments indicating that the water flow was laminar the dip slope showed a complex fluctuation in which the re value gradually decreased from a dip angle of 10 to a dip angle of 60 and ranged from 19 01 to 147 81 this result indicated that a smaller rock dip angle of the dip slope leads to a larger re value however for the anti dip slope the re gradually increased from a dip angle of 10 to a dip angle of 60 and ranged from 16 13 to 141 68 the re value of anti dip slope was reduced by 3 53 89 79 compared to that of the dip slope fig 6b grant 1997 argued that the fr threshold for supercritical flows and subcritical flows was 1 under the conditions of a 25 slope and 90 mm h rainfall intensity the flow on the dip slope was a subcritical flow table 2 for the dip slope the fr value gradually decreased as the rock dip angle increased and ranged from 0 78 to 1 83 the dip slope is laminar flow for the anti dip slope the fr value gradually increased from an angle of 10 to an angle of 30 and then gradually decreased from an angle of 30 to an angle of 60 which indicated that 30 was the critical rock dip angle of the fr value transition of water flow in addition the fr value of the anti dip slope was reduced by 34 13 73 04 3 1 4 darcy weisbach roughness coefficient the correlation between the darcy weisbach roughness coefficient f and the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity and their interactions have significant effects on anti dip slopes but not dip slopes table 3 as shown in fig 6d the f value decreased fluctuation with increasing rainfall duration the f value mainly decreased when the rainfall duration decreased from 5 min to 20 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall duration increased from 30 min to 60 min fig 6d the f value of the dip slope was much lower than the value of the anti dip slope and the f value of the dip slope was reduced by 61 07 93 78 compared to that of the anti dip slope this result indicated that the disturbance degree of the slope runoff on the anti dip slope was much higher than that on the dip slope 3 2 response of soil detachment to different rock dip angle the curves for the measured soil detachment rate as a function of rainfall duration under different rock dip angle of dip anti dip slope are shown in fig 7 a the mean flow velocity showed decreased fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment when the rainfall time increased from 5 min to 30 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall time increased from 30 min to 60 min the results show that the relationship between the soil detachment rate and rainfall time can be defined by a power function model under the 90 mm h rainfall intensity r 2 0 279 0 818 p 0 05 all other experiments had similar results regardless of the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity fig 7b shows that the mean soil detachment increased as the rainfall intensity increased for a flat dip angle 10 and gentle dip angle 30 the soil detachment of the dip slope was higher than that of the anti dip slope and the soil detachment of anti dip slope was reduced by 10 86 73 57 however for a median dip angle 60 the soil detachment of anti dip slope exceeded that of the dip slope and the soil detachment of anti dip slope increased by 35 33 56 24 for the dip slope the soil detachment decreased as the rock dip angle increased and the soil detachment rate ranged from 0 0029 to 0 020 g m 2 s 1 for the anti dip slope the soil detachment rate varied with the rock dip angle in the order of 10 60 30 and the soil detachment rate ranged from 0 0018 to 0 015 g m 2 s 1 the results indicated that greater rock dip angles corresponded to greater surface soil detachment rates 3 3 comparisons of the soil detachment rate responses to hydrodynamic parameters fig 8 shows the relationships of the soil detachment rate with various hydrodynamic parameters the slope and intercept of soil detachment rate equation are linear with the τ w and e except for the u for the dip slope the critical τ value decreased as the rock dip angle increased the critical τ value was between 0 00152 and 0 000701 pa and the maximum critical value of w and e occurred at the 30 rock dip angle for the anti dip slope the critical value of τ and w varied with the rock dip angle in the order of 30 60 10 and the critical value of e ranged from 0 to 0 000735 moreover u presents a remarkable power function correlation with soil detachment rates for the dip anti dip slopes table 4 shows the response equations of the soil detachment rate to various hydrodynamic parameters including τ w u and e stronger correlations were observed between the soil detachment rate and hydrodynamic parameters for the dip slope the correlation coefficients increased in the order of u τ e w for the anti dip slope the correlation coefficients increased in the order of τ u e w the results indicated that the w is a preferred hydrodynamic parameter for estimating the soil detachment rate on dip anti dip slopes 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rock dip angle on runoff hydraulic characteristics the influence of rock strata dip on the water hydrodynamic parameters of slope runoff in karst trough valleys is primarily based on the following three aspects 1 the rock strata dip could change the soil physical properties and hence cause a change in the soil infiltration capacity which determines the slope runoff status 2 the rock strata dip could change the slope roughness and 3 the rock strata dip has an important influence on reshaping of the slope topography by rainfall abrahams et al 1996 giménez and govers 2001 jomaa et al 2012 for the dip slope the stratified rock slope has the same direction of dominant joint planes as the slope slant which enhances the gathering of surface rainfall runoff the slope inclination of the anti dip slope is opposite to that of the rock strata dip which intercepts the surface rainfall runoff chittenden et al 2014 in addition there is a unique surface underground double layer structure in karst trough valley in which rainwater is redistributed on the slope and most of the rainwater loss occurs along underground pore fissures thereby reducing the surface runoff peng et al 2016 despite the high runoff intensity the flow depth was always low due to erosion by wide laminar flow runoff dispersal soil rock fissures and underground pore fissures at the beginning of the rainfall experiments the raindrops hit the surface and narrow rills appeared increasing the energy consumption and surface roughness leading to increases in the surface runoff and flow velocity fluctuations for all rock dip angles of the dip anti dip slope foster et al 1984 li et al 2017 finally the soil interface gradually reached saturation and the runoff changed from rock soil gap flow to rock soil interface flow the results were similar to those by hairsine and rose 1992a b in a theoretical study and by cheraghi et al 2016 in an experimental and modelling study govers 1992 studied the relationship between flow area and water flow velocity in rills eroding loose material and suggested that narrowed channels can have a rough surface in more resistant materials which reduces the water flow velocity as the rock dip angle of the dip anti dip slopes decreased the impermeable area increased the surface infiltration area decreased and the effect on the increasing water flow velocity by bare bedrock increased these results are similar to those by li et al 2017 who found that the mean velocity tended to decrease with increasing soil gravel content under the condition of runoff scour the bedrock in the karst trough valley easily forms wide and shallow laminar flow the karst trough valley has mainly laminar flow because the re values were lower than 500 in all experimental treatments poesen et al 1999 performed indoor experiments with rock fragment cover in soil and found that the re value increased as the rock fragment cover increased which is similar to our results in our study the re value decreased as the angle increased for the dip slope and the relationship was reversed for the anti dip slope the karst trough valley in our study has mainly a subcritical flow which is different from that of non karst trough valleys in addition the changes in flow depth and flow velocity were complicated which resulted in a decreasing and then increasing trend in the fr value as the rock dip angles of the dip anti dip slope increased with values lower than 1 for most of the experimental conditions the results were slightly different from those of li et al 2017 who found that the variation in mean flow depth and flow velocity resulted in the water flow being in supercritical turbulence with 0 gravel content this result may be due to the special surface underground double layer geologic structure in the karst trough valley and the surface loss and underground leakage which led to a reduction in the surface water flow giménez and govers 2001 the f value is often used to present the retardation of water flow with the extension of rainfall time the raindrops continued to hit the soil surface the allowable infiltration area increased and the effect of preventing rainfall leakage decreased causing volatile decreases in the f value this result may occur because the water depth and rough surface had a certain influence under the conditions of the soil bed structure emmett 1970 zhang et al 2015 in general the runoff hydraulic parameter of karst trough valley is very different than that of non karst trough valley therefore it is of great significance to study the variation in the runoff hydraulic parameter in karst trough valleys 4 2 effect of the rock dip angle on the soil detachment rate and erosion dynamic mechanism the rock dip angle has a remarkable influence on the soil detachment rate in karst trough valley first the rock dip angle is directly related to rainfall raindrops and slope runoff which affect runoff and soil erosion second the surface bedrock soil could change the soil physical properties and then influence the water hydrological process which indirectly affects soil erosion related studies have shown that the influence of bedrock on soil detachment is different due to the different soil erosion intensities and foundations of geomorphology and geology de et al 1996 peng et al 2015 in karst trough valleys the different rock dip angles of the dip anti dip slope may increase the amount of soil erosion on slope and reduce the soil erosion rate in this study the soil detachment rate of the dip slope was higher than that of the anti dip slope the results may be because the rock dip angle was consistent with the impermeable area the surface allowable runoff amount increased and the capacity of water flow increased thus the soil detachment rate at an angle of 10 for the dip slope was larger than that for the other angles for the anti dip slope the underground water leakage increased the intercept effect on rainfall by bedrock and the hard soft contact element between rock and soil increased relatively and the capacity of water flow decreased thereby decreasing the surface soil detachment rate these results were similar to those by wang et al 2012 who suggested that the rock fragment cover hindered soil erosion because raindrops were dissipated by surface rock fragments in addition the rock fragment armour reduced the soil detachment rate by dissipating energy and decreasing surface runoff in the water flow path in this study w was the most suitable hydraulic parameter for predicting the soil detachment rate and had the highest fitting degree for the dip anti dip slope the soil detachment rate increased as the w value increased and the relationship can be well described by linear equations for the dip anti dip slope table 5 table 5 shows that the critical w value is lower than 0 the r 2 value ranged from 0 469 to 0 504 and the nse was between 0 466 and 0 500 the re mre mare r 2 and nse of the observed soil detachment rate indicated that w is relatively good predictor of soil detachment for dip anti dip slopes a comparison of the predicted and observed soil detachment shows that the soil detachment rate can be predicted by linear w models fig 9 these results are similar to that of nearing et al 1999 this outcome may be attributed to the following reasons 1 simulated underground pore fissures at the bottom of the tank were different from field pore fissures field pore fissures are always filled with weathered materials or soils that rarely have complete voids 2 the soil rock interface on dip anti dip slopes is usually filled with plant root systems and rock weathering occurs widely thus litter pore fissures and bedrock have complete voids and interfaces therefore the study objectives and specific issues should be fully considered the effects of plant root systems on the soil erosion in karst trough valleys 5 conclusions laboratory rainfall experiments were conducted to explore the characteristics of hydraulics and soil detachment in response to the dip anti dip slopes simulated the field environment in the karst trough valley surface runoff production was higher on the dip slope than that on the anti dip slope while the opposite trend was true for underground leakage the water flow was always laminar on the dip anti dip slopes irrespective of rainfall intensity thus requiring a greater rainfall intensity to change the flow regime the dip slope showed higher soil detachment rate than that the anti dip slope indicating that the latter is less erodible than the former moreover stream power is the preferred hydrodynamic parameter for estimating the soil detachment rate of dip anti dip slopes our results highlight the distinctive effects of rock dip angle on the hillslope hydrology and soil erosion and can provide a theoretical

30 to 90 mm h 1 and the rock dip angles varied from 10 to 60 the results revealed that i surface runoff on the dip slope was higher than that on the anti dip slope whereas underground runoff presented opposite results the 30 rock dip angle presented the critical flow velocity for the anti dip slope and the flow velocity reduced as the rock dip angle of the dip slope increased ii laminar water flow

compared with that of the dip slope iii a linear function model can describe the relationship between the soil detachment rate and hydrodynamic parameters τ w and e it was found that w was the best of the hydrodynamic parameters to describe the soil detachment rate these results could provide valuable information for establishing a national scale empirical soil erosion model for karst trough valley keywords karst trough valley dip anti dip slopes rock strata dip hydraulic characteristics rainfall simulation 1 introduction karst rocky desertification is a major type of land desertification and an ecosystem with serious degradation globally gutiérrcz et al 2008 febles gonzález et al 2012 the area of karst regions reaches 22 million square kilometres and covers approximately 12 of the global land area liu 2009 in addition the karst region in southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst regions in the world and it covers an area of 540 000 km2 and occupies approximately 5 2 of china s territory fan et al 2011 under the influence of tectonism and long term karst processes a karst slope surface is characterized by rocky surface landscape with desertification and the underground layer contains a complex hydrological system gao et al 2010 peng et al 2018 in addition the main karst regions can be classified into the following topographic types trough valley platform high or low mountains peak clusters and hills the karst trough valley is one of the most important landscapes and tourist destinations in chongqing province china the karst trough valley not only has a special surface underground double geological structure but also has a typical rock strata dip i e dip anti dip slope the bedrock in the karst trough valley is largely composed of crystalline units and metasedimentary rocks longitudinal flow movement is the main water flow direction in the karst trough valley and it extends along a concave surface that forms a u fault plane the special u fault plane results in two typical rock strata dips i e dip slope the dominant joint plane of the stratified rock slope has the same direction as the slant of the slope and anti dip slope the stratified rock slope is opposite to the slant of the slope the monoclinal tilt of the bedrock controls the spatial distribution of rainfall water on the slope as a result the runoff is mainly lost along the surface on the dip slope while for the anti dip slope the runoff mainly leaks into the underground river through pore fissures and cracks wang et al 2004 thus the large scale bedrock in the soil has caused substantial changes in the water circulation and shedding patterns in the overland flow which results in more or less agitation in the flow field of the karst trough valley the competitive relationship between vortex generation and dissipation can reveal the effect of monoclinal tilt of the bedrock on the turbulence or laminarity of the flow the umbrella effect of the droplet impacts can create a wake like region around the obstacles in addition the rock dip angle side slope inclination angle rock layer inclination and tendency relations all have important effects on water and soil loss schwab et al 2009 for example whipple 2004 reported that the bedrock channel width is closely linked to lateral bank erosion that roughens the channels by quarrying out large boulders fábio et al 2015 concluded that soil erosion on the dip slope mainly proceeds to landslides for the bedding the underlying bedrock was parallel with the topographic slope while the anti dip slope of the valley had deeply dissected bedrock by bordering channels and he also found that the orientation of the bedrock can break the erosional budget in addition the previous studies have focused on the effect of the bedrock on soil erosion jomaa et al 2012 and some findings have also considered the influence of bedrock effect on quantitative flow characteristics nearing et al 1999 however research on the effects of rock strata dip on soil detachment and hydrodynamics is rare particularly in karst trough valleys the karst trough valley has abundant bedrock in soil which causes serious water and soil loss land resources shortages environmental degradation and human conflict in the yangtze river therefore the study of the influence of rock strata dip on the soil erosion process has important practical significance in karst trough valleys furthermore research on the characteristics of water hydrodynamics is helpful for studying the mechanism of soil erosion in such areas it is well known that karst trough valleys have a unique double layer geologic structure that leads to surface erosion and underground leakage dai et al 2017a peng et al 2018 some scholars have researched the characteristics of surface erosion and underground leakage in karst regions for example gillieson et al 1996 developed surface loss and underground leakage models in mexico which can be used to predict the amount of water and soil loss in high risk regions dai et al 2017b performed the indoor rainfall simulations to explore the effects of underground pore fissure degrees and bedrock bareness rates on surface erosion and underground leakage and found that the underground pore fissures and bedrock bareness rate were the predominant factors leading to the spatial distribution of water and soil loss in karst regions the above research mainly discussed and analysed the process and mechanisms underlying surface and underground soil erosion in karst regions and achieved certain results however few studies have compared the water dynamic parameters via a soil erosion prediction model and the methods and techniques for researching surface water hydrological systems are still at the exploratory stage in karst regions especially in karst trough valley more importantly the effect of rock strata dip on surface loss and underground leakage in karst trough valleys is still unclear the surface hydrogeologies on dip and anti dip slopes are very different therefore it is important to understand the strata dip mechanisms that affect the surface water hydrological system and underground leakage in karst trough valleys soil detachment plays an important role in the soil erosion model soil detachment can be predicted by hydrodynamic parameters in soil erosion models generally the control variables of soil detachment are flow depth flow velocity and hydraulic roughness for instance bunte and poesen 1994 found that the hydraulic roughness and the transport capacity could be influenced by rock fragments this finding is partly attributed to small rock fragments being impervious interfaces on the surface slope thereby dividing the water flow into several small threads other studies have assessed whether rock fragment cover can be used in the prediction model for soil erosion other scholars concluded that flow velocity was dependent on the rock fragment cover which can increase the hydraulic friction and decrease the sediment yield in the weep model nearing et al 1989 the bedrocks seem to form a discontinuous impermeable area that reduces runoff and sediment loss during rainstorms large areas of exposed bedrock have a significant effect on surface erosion in karst regions dai et al 2017a peng et al 2018 karst rocky desertification results in more serious soil erosion and ecological fragility which restricts the sustainable development of the economy and is dangerous to the survival of mankind meanwhile rock strata dip plays an important role in the spatial distribution of the runoff and sediment yield and variation in the rock strata dip has a great influence on surface loss and underground leakage therefore the major points of this study include identifying the factors that determine the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate and revealing the mechanisms that determine the effects on hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate in karst trough valleys under different rock dip angles of dip anti dip slopes in this study the double layer structure of the micro geomorphology was simulated by a new self made steel flume on a dip anti dip slope and the influence of the rainfall intensity rock strata dip and rock dip angle on the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate in the karst trough valley were investigated specifically this study aims to 1 reveal the mechanisms by which changes in rock dip angle influence the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate on dip anti dip slopes and 2 determine whether the soil detachment rate exhibit significant relationships with the hydrodynamic parameters by performing variance analysis this study provides reference data for researching the mechanisms of rock strata dip for water and soil conservation and the control and prevention of surface slope erosion in the karst trough valley 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and site description the experimental soils were collected from a typical karst trough valley 28 49 38 n 108 28 46 e at youyang county chongqing province china fig 1 the longtan karst valley is located at the southeast

longtan valley has the same inclination and opposite slope direction resulting in two typical rock strata dips i e dip slope located on the west side of the valley and anti dip slope located on the south side of the valley the rock strata in this study area are almost entirely constituted by limestone shale sand shale stone etc and the outcrops are mainly carbonate limestone there are considerable proportions of carbonate rocks with sizes 35 cm in the soils the test carbonate rocks with sizes of 36 53 cm were collected from the cultivated land on dip anti dip slope of karst trough valley the location and slope of karst trough valley were measured by a gps and gradiometer meanwhile the elevation slope gradient latitude bedrock and vegetation were recorded with a compass and tape measure table 1 2 2 experimental designs all soils and carbonate rocks used for the rainfall experiments were collected from the karst valley area based on the investigation of 20 typical karst valleys in chongqing province china a according to the field measurement of the outcrops size in cultivated land of the longtan karst trough valley in chongqing carbonate rocks with heights of 36 53 cm were randomly arranged in the flume experiment to simulate bare bedrock fig 2 the bare bedrock ratio is the area ratio of the exposed bedrock to the horizontally projected area of the slope which was set at 15 potential rocky desertification with 11 pieces of limestone in the rainfall simulation dai et al 2017b b the karst trough valley has two typical rock strata dips i e dip and anti dip slopes the dip anti dip slopes were simulated by adjusting the monoclinal tilt of the bedrock in the steel flume based on the field survey the rock dip angles on dip anti dip slopes mainly range from 8 to 65 the rock dip angles of the dip anti dip were fixed at 10 30 and 60 which can be classified into the 3 main types i e flat dip angle 10 gentle dip angle 30 and median dip angle 60 liu 2009 c the underground pore fissure is simulated by moving two removable plates with drainage holes at the bottom of the steel flume the underground pore fissure degree was set as 1 to represent the light field underground pore fissure peng et al 2016 d based on the characteristics of erosive precipitation in the karst trough valley of chongqing province the rainfall intensities were fixed at 30 60 and 90 mm h which can be divided into 3 main types i e light rainfall intensity 30 mm h moderate rainfall intensity 60 mm h and extreme rainfall intensity 90 mm h e the slope was set to 25 according to the standard critical steep slope based on the field investigation and literature analysis peng et al 2016 f according to the typical soil thickness in the karst trough valley the soil thickness in this study was set to 30 cm and it was divided into a plough pan 10 cm and a tillage layer 20 cm each flume experiment was segmented into three soil layers and the soil compactness was 453 801 and 1172 kpa from the upper part to the lower part respectively which is similar to field soil compaction to ensure that the initial soil moisture was consistent in each treatment a known amount of water was sprinkled evenly over the soil after packing all the experimental treatments were run three times with 63 experiments performed in total before each rainfall experiment proceeded the test soil in the flume was replaced by fresh soil 2 3 rainfall simulation experiment the rainfall simulation experiment was conducted at a rainfall laboratory in southwest university beibei district china the experimental device included a water supply rainfall simulator a simulated rainfall controlling hall two side sprinkler devices and water pipes and a steel test flume 0 35 m high 5 m long and 1 m wide there were 164 spaced holes 5 cm in these two removable steel plates at the bottom of the steel flume the spaced holes in the plates were made to collect infiltrating water which was equivalent to underground runoff as shown in fig 3 the height of the rainfall simulator device from the ground is 3 m the rainfall intensity can be adjusted from 10 to 150 mm h 1 the raindrop distribution uniformity was above 90 the droplet sizes ranged from 0 125 to 0 5 mm and their kinematic energy ranged from 1 25 to 8 14 j m 2 h 1 which was over 90 natural raindrops the slope of the flume could be adjusted from 0 to 45 the porosity of the drain holes at the bottom of the steel flume could be controlled from 0 to 5 dai et al 2017a b the surface and underground water and soil samples could be collected at the drainage outlets 2 4 experimental processes each rainfall experiment lasted for 60 min when both surface and underground runoff appeared the surface and underground runoff were recorded three times in 5 min intervals during the first 30 min and then collected in 10 min intervals during the last 30 min in each experiment during the rainfall experiment kmno4 was used as a dye tracer to test the water flow velocity a certain amount of dye in a soft plastic bottle was quickly injected into the water flow and the processing time of the dye cloud was tested by a high precision stopwatch for each rainfall experiment the flow velocity measurements were performed in 1 m intervals of 0 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m and 4 5 m where there was no bedrock to block the flow from the top of the flume the flow velocity at each of the two ridges of the bedrock from the top to the bottom of the flume was also measured the mean surface water flow velocity was considered as the average value of 14 measurements fig 4 which were recorded three times in 5 min intervals during the first 30 min and then collected in 10 min intervals during the last 30 min of each experiment for each measurement position of flow velocity the flow depth was tested at the front back and two sides of each bare bedrock with a digital level probe model sx40 a the device precision and the confidence interval of the measurements were 0 01 mm and 95 respectively the runoff and sediment samples were collected at the same time as the flow velocity a light rain of 10 mm h was applied to attain the saturated soil water content the water temperature was measured via a thermometer to test the water kinematic viscosity the water temperature ranged from 10 to 17 c at the end of the test the sediment samples were left for 24 h then the liquid supernatant was emptied and the rest of the wet sediment samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and weighed 2 5 hydraulic characteristics 1 flow

is 0 67 for laminar flow therefore a coefficient k value of 0 67 was used in the measurements 2 flow with w the effect of the bare bedrock on the unit water discharge should be taken into

response of flow hydraulics to different rock dip angles 3 1 1 runoff characteristics the rock dip angle is one of the main driving forces for underground runoff leakage in karst trough valleys to better understand the characteristics of runoff in karst trough valleys the effect of rock dip angle on surface loss and underground leakage are analyzed via experiments fig 5 when the rainfall intensity was 30 mm h runoff on the anti dip slope was mainly underground runoff and the underground runoff coefficient ranged from 52 22 to 66 93 however the surface runoff on the dip slope was higher than that of underground runoff for a rock dip angle of 10 and 30 but not for a rock dip angle of 60 when the rainfall intensity was higher than 60 mm h the surface runoff coefficient on the dip anti dip slopes was higher than the underground runoff coefficient for the dip slope the surface runoff coefficient decreased as the rock dip angle increased and the surface runoff coefficient ranged from 41 75 to 90 26 this finding may be attributed to the fact that the slope direction of the bedding layer presents the same direction as the water flow rate in the karst trough valley which can promote the flow rate and reduce the amount of the rainwater leakage for the anti dip slope the underground runoff coefficient varied with the rock dip angle in the order of 10 60 30 and the underground coefficient ranged from 16 01 to 66 94 this finding is because the direction of the bedrock layer is opposite to that of the water flow thus the intercept effect on rainwater by bedrock is increased the amount of rainwater loss along the rock soil interface is increased the surface runoff is reduced and the water flow is reduced therefore the surface runoff coefficient on the dip slope was much higher than that on the anti dip slope 3 1 2 flow velocity and depth flow velocity has a direct relationship with the soil detachment sediment transport and deposition processes during hydra erosion the curves for the measured flow velocity as a function of rainfall time under different rock dip angles of dip anti dip slopes are shown in fig 6 a the results show that the relationship between the flow velocity and rainfall time can be defined by a power function model under the 90 mm h rainfall intensity r 2 0 691 0 916 p 0 01 the mean flow velocity presented increased fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment when the rainfall time increased from 5 min to 30 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall time increased from 30 min to 60 min all other experiments had similar results regardless of the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity table 2 shows that as the rainfall intensity increased the mean flow velocity increased the flow velocity was higher on the dip slope than the anti dip slope for the dip slope the mean flow velocity occurred in the order 10 30 60 for the anti dip slope the mean flow velocity occurred in the order 30 10 60 and the flow velocity decreased by 17 42 53 42 the value 30 was the critical value for the water flow velocity the correlation analysis showed that the rock dip angles for dip anti dip slopes and rainfall intensity have significant effects table 3 and these two factors have a significant interaction effect on flow velocity table 3 showed that the rainfall intensity is more strongly correlated with the flow depth of the dip slope while the bedding dip has a relatively remarkable correlation with the flow depth of the anti dip slope for the dip slope the flow depth decreased as the rock dip angle increased under the rainfall intensity ranged from 30 to 60 mm h except for the 90 mm h rainfall intensity however for the anti dip slope the flow depth increased by 2 79 266 58 compared to the dip slope in the order of 60 30 10 3 1 3 flow regime the mean re value and fr value showed increased fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment when the rainfall time increased from 5 min to 30 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall time increased to 60 min from 30 min the dip slope had a higher re value and fr value than the anti dip slope all other experiments had similar results regardless of the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity fig 6b and c the correlation between the flow regime re and fr and rock dip angles and rainfall intensity and their interactions had significant effects on the dip anti dip slopes table 3 the variation in re was lower than 500 in all the experimental treatments indicating that the water flow was laminar the dip slope showed a complex fluctuation in which the re value gradually decreased from a dip angle of 10 to a dip angle of 60 and ranged from 19 01 to 147 81 this result indicated that a smaller rock dip angle of the dip slope leads to a larger re value however for the anti dip slope the re gradually increased from a dip angle of 10 to a dip angle of 60 and ranged from 16 13 to 141 68 the re value of anti dip slope was reduced by 3 53 89 79 compared to that of the dip slope fig 6b grant 1997 argued that the fr threshold for supercritical flows and subcritical flows was 1 under the conditions of a 25 slope and 90 mm h rainfall intensity the flow on the dip slope was a subcritical flow table 2 for the dip slope the fr value gradually decreased as the rock dip angle increased and ranged from 0 78 to 1 83 the dip slope is laminar flow for the anti dip slope the fr value gradually increased from an angle of 10 to an angle of 30 and then gradually decreased from an angle of 30 to an angle of 60 which indicated that 30 was the critical rock dip angle of the fr value transition of water flow in addition the fr value of the anti dip slope was reduced by 34 13 73 04 3 1 4 darcy weisbach roughness coefficient the correlation between the darcy weisbach roughness coefficient f and the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity and their interactions have significant effects on anti dip slopes but not dip slopes table 3 as shown in fig 6d the f value decreased fluctuation with increasing rainfall duration the f value mainly decreased when the rainfall duration decreased from 5 min to 20 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall duration increased from 30 min to 60 min fig 6d the f value of the dip slope was much lower than the value of the anti dip slope and the f value of the dip slope was reduced by 61 07 93 78 compared to that of the anti dip slope this result indicated that the disturbance degree of the slope runoff on the anti dip slope was much higher than that on the dip slope 3 2 response of soil detachment to different rock dip angle the curves for the measured soil detachment rate as a function of rainfall duration under different rock dip angle of dip anti dip slope are shown in fig 7 a the mean flow velocity showed decreased fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment when the rainfall time increased from 5 min to 30 min and then tended to stabilize when the rainfall time increased from 30 min to 60 min the results show that the relationship between the soil detachment rate and rainfall time can be defined by a power function model under the 90 mm h rainfall intensity r 2 0 279 0 818 p 0 05 all other experiments had similar results regardless of the rock dip angle and rainfall intensity fig 7b shows that the mean soil detachment increased as the rainfall intensity increased for a flat dip angle 10 and gentle dip angle 30 the soil detachment of the dip slope was higher than that of the anti dip slope and the soil detachment of anti dip slope was reduced by 10 86 73 57 however for a median dip angle 60 the soil detachment of anti dip slope exceeded that of the dip slope and the soil detachment of anti dip slope increased by 35 33 56 24 for the dip slope the soil detachment decreased as the rock dip angle increased and the soil detachment rate ranged from 0 0029 to 0 020 g m 2 s 1 for the anti dip slope the soil detachment rate varied with the rock dip angle in the order of 10 60 30 and the soil detachment rate ranged from 0 0018 to 0 015 g m 2 s 1 the results indicated that greater rock dip angles corresponded to greater surface soil detachment rates 3 3 comparisons of the soil detachment rate responses to hydrodynamic parameters fig 8 shows the relationships of the soil detachment rate with various hydrodynamic parameters the slope and intercept of soil detachment rate equation are linear with the τ w and e except for the u for the dip slope the critical τ value decreased as the rock dip angle increased the critical τ value was between 0 00152 and 0 000701 pa and the maximum critical value of w and e occurred at the 30 rock dip angle for the anti dip slope the critical value of τ and w varied with the rock dip angle in the order of 30 60 10 and the critical value of e ranged from 0 to 0 000735 moreover u presents a remarkable power function correlation with soil detachment rates for the dip anti dip slopes table 4 shows the response equations of the soil detachment rate to various hydrodynamic parameters including τ w u and e stronger correlations were observed between the soil detachment rate and hydrodynamic parameters for the dip slope the correlation coefficients increased in the order of u τ e w for the anti dip slope the correlation coefficients increased in the order of τ u e w the results indicated that the w is a preferred hydrodynamic parameter for estimating the soil detachment rate on dip anti dip slopes 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rock dip angle on runoff hydraulic characteristics the influence of rock strata dip on the water hydrodynamic parameters of slope runoff in karst trough valleys is primarily based on the following three aspects 1 the rock strata dip could change the soil physical properties and hence cause a change in the soil infiltration capacity which determines the slope runoff status 2 the rock strata dip could change the slope roughness and 3 the rock strata dip has an important influence on reshaping of the slope topography by rainfall abrahams et al 1996 giménez and govers 2001 jomaa et al 2012 for the dip slope the stratified rock slope has the same direction of dominant joint planes as the slope slant which enhances the gathering of surface rainfall runoff the slope inclination of the anti dip slope is opposite to that of the rock strata dip which intercepts the surface rainfall runoff chittenden et al 2014 in addition there is a unique surface underground double layer structure in karst trough valley in which rainwater is redistributed on the slope and most of the rainwater loss occurs along underground pore fissures thereby reducing the surface runoff peng et al 2016 despite the high runoff intensity the flow depth was always low due to erosion by wide laminar flow runoff dispersal soil rock fissures and underground pore fissures at the beginning of the rainfall experiments the raindrops hit the surface and narrow rills appeared increasing the energy consumption and surface roughness leading to increases in the surface runoff and flow velocity fluctuations for all rock dip angles of the dip anti dip slope foster et al 1984 li et al 2017 finally the soil interface gradually reached saturation and the runoff changed from rock soil gap flow to rock soil interface flow the results were similar to those by hairsine and rose 1992a b in a theoretical study and by cheraghi et al 2016 in an experimental and modelling study govers 1992 studied the relationship between flow area and water flow velocity in rills eroding loose material and suggested that narrowed channels can have a rough surface in more resistant materials which reduces the water flow velocity as the rock dip angle of the dip anti dip slopes decreased the impermeable area increased the surface infiltration area decreased and the effect on the increasing water flow velocity by bare bedrock increased these results are similar to those by li et al 2017 who found that the mean velocity tended to decrease with increasing soil gravel content under the condition of runoff scour the bedrock in the karst trough valley easily forms wide and shallow laminar flow the karst trough valley has mainly laminar flow because the re values were lower than 500 in all experimental treatments poesen et al 1999 performed indoor experiments with rock fragment cover in soil and found that the re value increased as the rock fragment cover increased which is similar to our results in our study the re value decreased as the angle increased for the dip slope and the relationship was reversed for the anti dip slope the karst trough valley in our study has mainly a subcritical flow which is different from that of non karst trough valleys in addition the changes in flow depth and flow velocity were complicated which resulted in a decreasing and then increasing trend in the fr value as the rock dip angles of the dip anti dip slope increased with values lower than 1 for most of the experimental conditions the results were slightly different from those of li et al 2017 who found that the variation in mean flow depth and flow velocity resulted in the water flow being in supercritical turbulence with 0 gravel content this result may be due to the special surface underground double layer geologic structure in the karst trough valley and the surface loss and underground leakage which led to a reduction in the surface water flow giménez and govers 2001 the f value is often used to present the retardation of water flow with the extension of rainfall time the raindrops continued to hit the soil surface the allowable infiltration area increased and the effect of preventing rainfall leakage decreased causing volatile decreases in the f value this result may occur because the water depth and rough surface had a certain influence under the conditions of the soil bed structure emmett 1970 zhang et al 2015 in general the runoff hydraulic parameter of karst trough valley is very different than that of non karst trough valley therefore it is of great significance to study the variation in the runoff hydraulic parameter in karst trough valleys 4 2 effect of the rock dip angle on the soil detachment rate and erosion dynamic mechanism the rock dip angle has a remarkable influence on the soil detachment rate in karst trough valley first the rock dip angle is directly related to rainfall raindrops and slope runoff which affect runoff and soil erosion second the surface bedrock soil could change the soil physical properties and then influence the water hydrological process which indirectly affects soil erosion related studies have shown that the influence of bedrock on soil detachment is different due to the different soil erosion intensities and foundations of geomorphology and geology de et al 1996 peng et al 2015 in karst trough valleys the different rock dip angles of the dip anti dip slope may increase the amount of soil erosion on slope and reduce the soil erosion rate in this study the soil detachment rate of the dip slope was higher than that of the anti dip slope the results may be because the rock dip angle was consistent with the impermeable area the surface allowable runoff amount increased and the capacity of water flow increased thus the soil detachment rate at an angle of 10 for the dip slope was larger than that for the other angles for the anti dip slope the underground water leakage increased the intercept effect on rainfall by bedrock and the hard soft contact element between rock and soil increased relatively and the capacity of water flow decreased thereby decreasing the surface soil detachment rate these results were similar to those by wang et al 2012 who suggested that the rock fragment cover hindered soil erosion because raindrops were dissipated by surface rock fragments in addition the rock fragment armour reduced the soil detachment rate by dissipating energy and decreasing surface runoff in the water flow path in this study w was the most suitable hydraulic parameter for predicting the soil detachment rate and had the highest fitting degree for the dip anti dip slope the soil detachment rate increased as the w value increased and the relationship can be well described by linear equations for the dip anti dip slope table 5 table 5 shows that the critical w value is lower than 0 the r 2 value ranged from 0 469 to 0 504 and the nse was between 0 466 and 0 500 the re mre mare r 2 and nse of the observed soil detachment rate indicated that w is relatively good predictor of soil detachment for dip anti dip slopes a comparison of the predicted and observed soil detachment shows that the soil detachment rate can be predicted by linear w models fig 9 these results are similar to that of nearing et al 1999 this outcome may be attributed to the following reasons 1 simulated underground pore fissures at the bottom of the tank were different from field pore fissures field pore fissures are always filled with weathered materials or soils that rarely have complete voids 2 the soil rock interface on dip anti dip slopes is usually filled with plant root systems and rock weathering occurs widely thus litter pore fissures and bedrock have complete voids and interfaces therefore the study objectives and specific issues should be fully considered the effects of plant root systems on the soil erosion in karst trough valleys 5 conclusions laboratory rainfall experiments were conducted to explore the characteristics of hydraulics and soil detachment in response to the dip anti dip slopes simulated the field environment in the karst trough valley surface runoff production was higher on the dip slope than that on the anti dip slope while the opposite trend was true for underground leakage the water flow was always laminar on the dip anti dip slopes irrespective of rainfall intensity thus requiring a greater rainfall intensity to change the flow regime the dip slope showed higher soil detachment rate than that the anti dip slope indicating that the latter is less erodible than the former moreover stream power is the preferred hydrodynamic parameter for estimating the soil detachment rate of dip anti dip slopes our results highlight the distinctive effects of rock dip angle on the hillslope hydrology and soil erosion and can provide a theoretical

5883,water use efficiency wue is a key characteristic of ecosystem function and reflects the trade off relationship between carbon gain and water loss the coupled relationship between carbon and water is complex for ecosystems especially along elevation gradient a foliage stable carbon isotope method and the avim2 model were used to study the temporal and elevational pattern of carbon gain water loss and wue in subalpine dark coniferous forests abies fabri the results showed that monthly wue in wet season was larger than in dry season the diverse response curves between carbon gain water loss and meteorological factors such as monthly precipitation air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn determined the monthly variation of wue both the carbon gain gross primary production gpp net primary production npp and water loss evapotranspiration et transpiration et decreased as elevation increased the carbon gain exhibited moderately decreasing rate compared with that of water loss along the elevation gradient plant wue gpp et or npp et exhibited an increasing trend along the elevation gradient comparing with ecosystem wue gpp et or npp et only increased from 2800 to 3500 m a s l and slightly decreased as elevation continue increasing to 3700 m a s l the ratio of canopy interception to et determined the varied elevational pattern of wue between plant and ecosystem scale air temperature contributed 79 27 and 68 66 for elevational pattern of gpp and transpiration et respectively while ta and ci ca ratio of intercellular and air co2 concentration contributed 50 67 and 47 67 to the variation of gpp et along elevation gradient respectively the canopy height and canopy coverage were significantly negative with wue along the elevation gradient the asynchronous response of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic and physiological variables determined the temporal and elevational patterns of ecosystem wue 1 introduction the carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems are key ecological processes that are tightly coupled via the ecosystem water use efficiency wue the mass ratio of co2 assimilated during photosynthesis to evaporated or transpired h2o alice et al 2011 beer et al 2009 keenan et al 2013 lin et al 2018 yu et al 2008 the carbon and water cycles are very complex on the ecosystem scale especially along elevation gradient these cycles are influenced by climatic variables goulden et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 and plant physiology hultine and marshall 2000 li et al 2009a wue varied in different temporal scale under climate change while the temporal and elevational variations in ecosystem wue are largely unexplained reichstein et al 2014 knowledge of wue along elevation gradient is critical to understand the potential responses of ecosystem to climate change stable carbon isotope composition of leaf tissue was related to ci ca ratio of intercellular and air co2 concentration and can be used to calculate the water use efficiency farquhar et al 1982 over the past several decades foliage δ13c has been widely used as an indicator of intrinsic wue on different scales such as leaf plant and ecosystem scale bonal et al 2000 lauteri et al 2004 ponton et al 2006 maxwell et al 2018 most studies have demonstrated that elevation increase will improve foliage δ13c in the subalpine zone hultine and marshall 2000 li et al 2009a the variation of the δ13c in bulk leaf tissue along elevation gradient has been demonstrated in southwestern china li et al 2009a b luo et al 2005 wue was controlled by meteorological variables such as air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation and physiological factors such as canopy conductance and nutrient content along elevation gradient hultine and marshall 2000 li cy et al 2009 goulden et al 2012 liu et al 2017 recent studies found the responses of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic variables and canopy conductance varied in different seasons keenan et al 2013 li et al 2015 yu et al 2008 however the elevational and seasonal patterns of carbon gain and water loss are poorly understood in mountainous region because carbon gain and water loss can t be separated based on foliage δ13c method eddy covariance can observe carbon gain and water loss but it s too expensive to apply along elevation gradient there is still a challenge in demonstrating the temporal and elevation pattern of wue based solely on stable carbon isotope or eddy covariance method both the carbon gain and water loss consist of distinct components the definitions and meanings of wue expressed by different components of carbon gain and water loss were different hu et al 2010 yu et al 2008 or were only weakly correlated ito and inatomi 2012 therefore different definitions of wue cannot be compared directly in order to fully understand the wue for forest ecosystem along elevation gradient wue defined with transpiration or evapotranspiration should be calculated separately both transpiration and canopy interception can account for a large proportion of evapotranspiration lin et al 2011 xu et al 2018 the factors which control the different evapotranspiration components were also different if different definitions of wue varied with similar or discrepancy trend along elevation gradient is still unclear abies is the dominant coniferous species in northern hemisphere wang et al 2014 most abies distributes over a broad vertical range in mountainous region and southwestern china lu and cheng 2009 the mountain area of southwestern china is the source region of 6 main rivers and the second largest forest district in china sun 2005 wang et al 2011 thus played an important role in water resource and carbon sequestration the subalpine coniferous forest is highly sensitive to climate change tsuyama et al 2015 therefore the trade off relationship between carbon gain and water loss along elevation gradient can indicate the potential response of trees to climate change however the temporal and elevational patterns of wue in subalpine forests are still not fully characterized despite obvious practical importance to address these questions both atmospheric vegetation interaction model avim2 and foliage stable carbon isotope methods are adopted to simulate and elucidate the carbon gain water loss and their components the objectives of our study were 1 to indicate the coupled relationships between the carbon cycle and water cycle along elevation gradient 2 to investigate the factors that control the variation of wue in both temporal and elevation pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at hailuogou valley in mt gongga 29 20 30 20 n 101 30 102 15 e where is

carbon gain and water loss were simulated using the avim2 model that was developed for simulating seasonal and inter annual variations in biophysical and biogeochemical processes at the land surface the avim2 model includes physical process module phy physiological plant growth module plt and soil carbon nitrogen dynamics module som fig 2 phy is a typical soil vegetation atmosphere transfer

radiation transfer the sensible and latent heat fluxes between the air canopy and soil the interception of rainfall and drainage runoff and infiltration transpiration from the canopy and evaporation

to october 2011 foliage samples of abies fabri were collected between 2800 m and 3700 m at 100 m intervals along the elevation gradient of hailuogou valley table 1 at each elevation we set four 50 m 50 m sampling quadrats 4 to 5 trees in each quadrat were selected for sampling the foliage with different ages was mixed together to one sample for each quadrat to avoid the influence of near ground co2 on foliage δ13c only the foliage above ground more than 10 m were selected foliage samples were collected once in each midmonth from may to october all the foliage samples were dried in a forced draft oven at 65 c for 48 h then ground into fine powder and stored at 4 c until analysis the samples of foliage carbon isotope were measured using an elemental analyzer flash ea1112 ht interfaced to

the coordinates wilczak et al 2001 the wpl method was used to adjust density changes resulting from fluctuations in heat and water vapor webb et al 1980 the friction velocity threshold was empirically set as 0 2 m s 1 to filter nighttime fluxes spurious data were removed from the dataset if the instrument performance was abnormal or rainfall events occurred the missing data accounted for approximately 35 of the total data between may and october to compare the simulated carbon and water fluxes the missing or rejected daily data were not interpolated the data between november and next april was also removed as the influence of ice or snow cover on sensors the energy balance closure was evaluated using linear regression coefficients between the 30 minute estimates of dependent flux variables le h against the independently derived available energy rn g s from may to october in 2009 wilson et al 2002 the closure of the energy balance was acceptable the slope of le h vs rn g s was

gpp of avim2 model the simulated et was also validated with the observation by eddy covariance the avim2 can simulate the daily variation of the et in the wet season or in the dry season r2 0 7982 rmse 0 0198 d 0 9309 fig 4 the components of the et were also validated with the in situ observations in hailuoguo valley the eint et and es were observed from april to october in 2009 lin et al 2011 sun et al 2013 the simulated eint of 402 8 mm by avim2 model was comparable to the observation of 460 7 mm sun et al 2013 the simulated et by avim2 model was 139 2 mm which is almost the same as the observed value of 139 8 mm lin et al 2011 the simulated es by avim2 model from the ground was 56 3 mm which was higher than the observed value of 44 2 mm lin et al 2011 the modeled wue gpp et was validated by comparing the simulated value to that derived from foliage δ13c eq 3 the results demonstrated that wue gpp et simulated by the avim2 was reasonable with the wue calculated by foliage δ13c fig 5 a and b the analysis of r squared r2 and p value indicated that the simulated value had good accuracy therefore the avim2 model can be used to study the coupled relationship between carbon gain and water loss in our study area 2 8 data analysis a one way anova with fisher s lsd test was performed to test the variance in the gpp npp et and wue of different months the relationships between the et et gpp and climatic variables were fitted with linear or non linear equations using sigmaplot 12 3 all analyses were conducted with spss 13 0 statistically significant difference was set as 0 05 the relative contribution analysis was conducted by r software version 3 4 2 the correlations between original predictors at ci ca p and new orthogonal variables gpp et wue were calculated first regression coefficients of y on orthogonal variables were produced then the ratio of coefficients square was the relative contribution of each variable 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of meteorological factors to reveal the relationship between wue and climatic factors the variation patterns of the monthly precipitation air temperature vpd and net radiation rn were investigated the annual precipitation was 1896 1606 2022 and 1469 mm from 2008 to 2011 at an elevation of 3000 m a s l fig 6 a the annual mean air temperature was 4 7 5 3 5 4 and 4 6 c from 2008 to 2011 and the highest monthly mean air temperature was in july while the coldest monthly mean air temperature was in december january or february fig 6b compared with the air temperature the vpd had a similar trend fig 6c in contrast to the air temperature the maximum value of monthly rn was not in july fig 6d large amount of rainfall and cloudy weather possibly contributed to the seasonal variation of rn 3 2 seasonal and elevational variations of gpp and npp the monthly variations of gpp and npp at 3000 m a s l from 2008 to 2011 were simulated using the avim2 model over the 4 years both gpp and npp showed seasonal variations the peak values of gpp and npp were in july while the least values were in january or february fig 7 annual gpp was 21 17 21 17 21 90 and 22 63 t c ha 1 a 1 from 2008 to 2011 respectively while annual npp was 12 78 12 78 13 14 and 13 87 t c ha 2 a 1 from 2008 to 2011 respectively the mean monthly variations of gpp and npp for abies fabri at 3000 m a s l were also modeled using the avim2 during the dormancy period from november to next april the gpp and npp were lower compared with the wet season but plant photosynthesis and respiration continued even in the coldest month air temperature 5 c the annual gpp and npp were 21 1 and 12 3 t ha 1 a 1 at 3000 m a s l respectively both the gpp and npp decreased as the elevation increases the lapse rate was 0 09 and 0 03 g m 2 s 1 100 m for the gpp and npp respectively both the gpp and npp showed peak values at 3000 m a s l fig 8 the temperature decreased as the elevation increases the precipitation increased from 2800 m a s l to 3500 m a s l but decreased as the elevation increased further the variation of gpp and npp was more in accordance with temperature along elevation gradient 3 3 seasonal and elevational variation of et and its components et consists of canopy interception transpiration and evaporation from the ground the mean annual amounts of eint et and es at 3000 m a s l were 367 1 247 7 and 91 5 mm respectively the ratio of annual eint to et was 51 3 the ratio of et to et increased from 18 7 in january to a maximum value of 43 5 in june in contrast to the gpp and npp neither the et nor the et peaked in july fig 7 the annual et was 628 640 587 and 706 mm from 2008 to 2011 the annual et was 187 200 195 and 248 mm from 2008 to 2011 the annual et decreased as the elevation increased and the annual et decreased sharply fig 9 the ratio of et to et decreased from 48 9 at 2800 m a s l to 26 3 at 3700 m a s l different from other components of evapotranspiration eint increased along elevation gradient more water lost through canopy evaporation from low elevation to high elevation because the precipitation increased with elevation 3 4 seasonal and elevational pattern of wue gpp et gpp et npp et and npp et was 4 01 0 21 12 35 0 71 2 31 0 12 and 7 10 0 38 mg c g h2o in wet season respectively gpp et gpp et npp et and npp et was 2 59 0 32 8 55 1 24 1 74 0 19 and 5 71 0 90 mg c g h2o in dry season respectively wue with different definitions was significantly larger in the wet season than that in the dry season fig 10 a and b gpp et gpp et npp et and npp et had generally similar seasonal pattern however the maximum values of gpp et and npp et occurred in different months which indicated that wue with different definitions were different from each other both gpp et and npp et increased significantly as the elevation increasing fig 11 a gpp et and npp et increased at the rate of 0 72 and 0 49 mg c g h2o 100 m respectively the gpp et and npp et increased from 2800 to 3500 m a s l then slightly decreased from 3600 to 3700 m a s l fig 11b gpp et and npp et increased at the rate of 0 06 and 0 05 mg c g h2o 100 m respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the definition of water use efficiency the different definitions of wue in this study address varied influence of ecosystem respiration and evaporation canopy interception and evaporation from ground on temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem wue wue is usually defined as the ratio of net or gross co2 assimilation to water loss via transpiration in canopy scale while the ratio of plant co2 assimilation to total water loss by et at ecosystem scale gpp et and npp et were weakly correlated on the spatial scale ito and inatomi 2012 this discrepancy makes it too difficult to compare wue of the same species derived from different water loss and carbon gain components niu et al 2011 the different definition of wue can improve the understanding the coupled relationship between carbon gain and water loss in from leaf to ecosystem scale in this study canopy and ecosystem scale showed heterogeneous pattern of wue in temporal and elevational scale figs 10 and 11 the different definition of wue in one study also provided the opportunity to compare the results in distinct region ponton et al 2006 found that the values of gpp et were 1 7 0 5 3 6 1 5 and 5 4 1 6 mg c g h2o in grasslands aspen and douglas fir forests respectively wue expressed by gpp et was 2 5 3 1 mg c g h2o for abies fabri along the elevation gradient from 2800 m to 3700 m in mt gongga the value of gpp et in this study were in the range of other studies law et al 2002 ponton et al 2006 yu et al 2008 beer et al 2009 the annual values of gpp et and npp et were 7 1 and 1 8 mg c g h2o for abies fabri at 3000 m in mt gongga comparing to the values of gpp et and npp et were 8 0 and 0 92 mg c g h2o at global scale respectively ito and inatomi 2012 the results demonstrated that the different definitions of wue in mt gongga were comparable with global studies 4 2 seasonal patterns of water use efficiency the variations in wue among different season indicated that the coupled relationship between the carbon gain and water loss was influenced by climatic variables yu et al 2008 seasonal variations of wue reflect short term scale of the trade off relationship between carbon gain and water loss there was a significant correlation between the carbon gain and water loss while the r2 between the gpp npp and et was larger than that of the gpp npp and et fig 12 a and b canopy interception accounted for 51 3 of the total et at 3000 m and the contribution was even higher with elevation increasing fig 9 therefore canopy interception reduced the physiological coupled relationship between the carbon gain and water loss for ecosystem scale the carbon gain increased sharply as the water loss increased when the monthly et was less than 10 mm or the et was less than 20 mm the patterns of the variations in carbon gain and water loss were relatively constant throughout the wet season the response of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic variables was different in various forest ecosystems keenan et al 2013 medlyn and de kauwe 2013 lin et al 2018 understanding the effects of climatic variables on forest ecosystem productivity wue is a useful indicator for the prediction of changes in the carbon gain and water loss due to climate change law et al 2002 in this study the responsive characteristics of gpp et and et to monthly precipitation temperature vpd and rn were analyzed at an elevation of 3000 m the et et and gpp responded to climatic variables differently the relationships between et et gpp and monthly precipitation and vpd were fitted with quadratic functions fig 13 a and c however there were different relationships between et et gpp temperature and rn fig 13b and d temperature vs gpp rn vs et and rn vs et were all fitted with linear functions et and et decreased when p 180 mm while gpp decreased when the monthly average rn 1700 mj m 2d 1 the asynchronous responses of et et and gpp to changing climatic variables determined the relationship between the carbon gain and water loss therefore wue with different definitions varied during the month the increasing rate of the et and et were much larger than those of the gpp and npp in the wet season although et et and gpp were fitted using the same mathematical form for monthly precipitation and vpd the extent to which these variations were due to climatic factors was different 4 3 elevation gradient of water use efficiency an elevation gradient is not a phenomenological driving variable however it is the combination of multiple factors such as precipitation temperature nutrients and plant physiology although the variation of abies foliage δ13c generally showed an increasing trend fig 14 a there was no significant relationship between elevation and foliage δ13c among different regions fig 14b the variation in precipitation had no significant influence on wue of abies fabri along an elevation gradient in the mt gongga fig 15 a which agreed with previous results li et al 2009 luo et al 2011 a study in the hawaiian metrosideros found that the δ13c value of bulk leaf tissue increased as the elevation increased in the eastern humid region while the same trend did not exist in the western arid region vitousek et al 1990 van de water et al 2002 found that water was not the main influencing factor for wue in the wet region because both the rainfall and soil moisture were not strictly determined factors for tree growth the annual rainfall was more than 1600 mm between 2800 m and 3700 m on the subalpine mt gongga therefore we concluded that the variation in the wue along the elevation gradient was not determined by precipitation there was a significant negative relationship between the air temperature and wue derived from the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue fig 15b which also indicated that the intrinsic wue increased as the air temperature decreased along the elevation gradient the curves of gpp and et vs ta were different fig 15b temperature is an important climatic variable in mountainous terrain the leaf morphology change to adapt to low temperature environments while the diffusion resistance to co2 also increases taylor and sexton 1972 as the diffusivity decreased under low air temperature conditions the stomatal conductance also decreased panek and warning 1995 the water potential of leaves increased under low air temperature condition which restrict the plant transpiration cochard et al 2000 therefore the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue increased along elevation gradient the gpp et and npp et derived from avim2 model also increased along the elevation gradient despite both carbon gain and water loss decreased both temperature and precipitation affected the tree morphology and physiology in montane forests and further determined the carbon water relations peng et al 2012 maxwell et al 2018 while the extreme point of maximum carbon gain also indicated that the optimum climate of abies fabri influenced the variation of morphology fig 8 the harsh climate and barren soil limited the canopy height and canopy coverage in high elevation in this study both canopy height r2 0 52 p 0 01 and coverage r2 0 44 p 0 01 were significantly negative correlated with wue along elevation gradient the results demonstrated that both climate and tree morphology contributed to the variation of wue along elevation gradient while the variation of wue with age related canopy height showed different trend under the homogeneous environmental conditions köstner et al 2002 irvine et al 2004 he et al 2008 the main reason was that the different response of carbon gain and water loss to both climatic variables and tree height irvine et al 2004 tang et al 2017 this study suggested that the effect of canopy height on wue along elevation gradient was different from that age related morphology stable carbon isotope composition of leaf tissue was related to ci ca farquhar et al 1989 the stomatal conductance was influenced by both climatic variables and physiological function liu et al 2017 in this study both the value of ci ca and ci decreased as the elevation increased table 1 therefore both the transpiration and carbon gain decreased along the elevation gradient figs 8 and 9 however the effects of stomatal control on the carbon gain and water loss were different keenan et al 2013 lin et al 2018 the carbon gain is more sensitive to variations in conductance than water loss li se et al 2015 annual ta was the primary factor for the variation of gpp and et while both ta and ci ca control gpp et along elevation gradient fig 16 therefore gpp et and npp et showed significant increases from low elevations to high elevations while the canopy interception increased along the elevation gradient gpp et and npp et only showed moderately increasing trends along the elevation gradient fig 11 the forest distributed along elevation gradient also change the leaf nitrogen content and specific leaf area to adapt the environmental conditions nitrogen is the main component of the photosynthetic enzyme and is also one of the main factors that determine the photosynthetic capacity of a leaf an increase in the leaf nitrogen content can augment the content of leaf chlorophyll and carboxylase therefore influence the stomatal density and leaf thickness many studies have shown that the leaf nitrogen content of alpine plants increases as the elevation increases friend et al 1989 körner 1989 li et al 2009 in the subalpine mountains more nitrogen is distributed to the leaf thereby offsetting the decrease in photosynthetic rate caused by low light and low nitrogen use efficiency specific leaf area is one of the most important indicators of leaf traits hultine and marshall 2000 found that a negative relationship existed between the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue of coniferous forest and the specific leaf area along an elevation gradient in the northern rocky mountains li et al 2008 demonstrated that the specific leaf area of a dark coniferous forest decreased as the elevation increased however there was a positive relationship between the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue and the specific leaf area for quercus aquifolioides in subalpine area of western sichuan province li et al 2009 there was also a negative relationship between the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue and the specific leaf area during the seasonal variation of abies fabri at 3000 m in mt gongga luo et al 2011 however the tree line of abies fabri keep on increasing under global warming the plant physiology also changing to adapt varied environmental conditions therefore the wue variation along elevation gradient can be an indicator of forest response to climate change which helps us to manage forest more efficient in mountainous area 5 conclusion the carbon gain water loss and wue exhibit temporal and elevational variation but the controlling factors for wue in subalpine coniferous forest remain unclear only foliage stable carbon isotope or eddy covariance method is still challenging because the limitation of partitioning wue to carbon gain and water loss or high cost based on experimental data and modeled data we analyzed the temporal and elevational variations of the carbon gain water loss and wue and discussed the factors that control the carbon gain water loss and wue in a subalpine coniferous forest wue was defined using different carbon gain and water loss components on the seasonal scale the carbon gain and water loss had different response curves with the precipitation air temperature vpd and rn indicating that a variety of climatic variables drove the photosynthesis and et in different ways and at different rates on the elevation scale the carbon gain et and et decreased as the elevation increased the gpp et and npp et increased significantly as the elevation increased while the gpp et and npp et increased from 2800 to 3500 m and then slightly decreased canopy interception played an important role in the variation of plant and ecosystem wue along the elevation gradient air temperature was the main controlling factor for elevational variation of gpp and et respectively while both air temperature and ci ca contributed to the wue gpp et along elevation gradient tree morphology such as canopy height and canopy coverage also contributed to the variation of wue along elevation gradient the response of the carbon gain and water loss to environmental and physiological changes on the temporal and elevational scale is complex which is also a great challenge for water resource management and forest management how the carbon gain water loss and wue for the subalpine mountainous forest ecosystem varies with changes in the global climate still remain to be investigated improved understanding of temporal and elevational behavior of carbon and water vapour exchanges in relation to environmental conditions will enhance our ability to predict the effects of climate change on mountainous ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement sun xiangyang data curation writing

5883,water use efficiency wue is a key characteristic of ecosystem function and reflects the trade off relationship between carbon gain and water loss the coupled relationship between carbon and water is complex for ecosystems especially along elevation gradient a foliage stable carbon isotope method and the avim2 model were used to study the temporal and elevational pattern of carbon gain water loss and wue in subalpine dark coniferous forests abies fabri the results showed that monthly wue in wet season was larger than in dry season the diverse response curves between carbon gain water loss and meteorological factors such as monthly precipitation air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn determined the monthly variation of wue both the carbon gain gross primary production gpp net primary production npp and water loss evapotranspiration et transpiration et decreased as elevation increased the carbon gain exhibited moderately decreasing rate compared with that of water loss along the elevation gradient plant wue gpp et or npp et exhibited an increasing trend along the elevation gradient comparing with ecosystem wue gpp et or npp et only increased from 2800 to 3500 m a s l and slightly decreased as elevation continue increasing to 3700 m a s l the ratio of canopy interception to et determined the varied elevational pattern of wue between plant and ecosystem scale air temperature contributed 79 27 and 68 66 for elevational pattern of gpp and transpiration et respectively while ta and ci ca ratio of intercellular and air co2 concentration contributed 50 67 and 47 67 to the variation of gpp et along elevation gradient respectively the canopy height and canopy coverage were significantly negative with wue along the elevation gradient the asynchronous response of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic and physiological variables determined the temporal and elevational patterns of ecosystem wue 1 introduction the carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems are key ecological processes that are tightly coupled via the ecosystem water use efficiency wue the mass ratio of co2 assimilated during photosynthesis to evaporated or transpired h2o alice et al 2011 beer et al 2009 keenan et al 2013 lin et al 2018 yu et al 2008 the carbon and water cycles are very complex on the ecosystem scale especially along elevation gradient these cycles are influenced by climatic variables goulden et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 and plant physiology hultine and marshall 2000 li et al 2009a wue varied in different temporal scale under climate change while the temporal and elevational variations in ecosystem wue are largely unexplained reichstein et al 2014 knowledge of wue along elevation gradient is critical to understand the potential responses of ecosystem to climate change stable carbon isotope composition of leaf tissue was related to ci ca ratio of intercellular and air co2 concentration and can be used to calculate the water use efficiency farquhar et al 1982 over the past several decades foliage δ13c has been widely used as an indicator of intrinsic wue on different scales such as leaf plant and ecosystem scale bonal et al 2000 lauteri et al 2004 ponton et al 2006 maxwell et al 2018 most studies have demonstrated that elevation increase will improve foliage δ13c in the subalpine zone hultine and marshall 2000 li et al 2009a the variation of the δ13c in bulk leaf tissue along elevation gradient has been demonstrated in southwestern china li et al 2009a b luo et al 2005 wue was controlled by meteorological variables such as air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation and physiological factors such as canopy conductance and nutrient content along elevation gradient hultine and marshall 2000 li cy et al 2009 goulden et al 2012 liu et al 2017 recent studies found the responses of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic variables and canopy conductance varied in different seasons keenan et al 2013 li et al 2015 yu et al 2008 however the elevational and seasonal patterns of carbon gain and water loss are poorly understood in mountainous region because carbon gain and water loss can t be separated based on foliage δ13c method eddy covariance can observe carbon gain and water loss but it s too expensive to apply along elevation gradient there is still a challenge in demonstrating the temporal and elevation pattern of wue based solely on stable carbon isotope or eddy covariance method both the carbon gain and water loss consist of distinct components the definitions and meanings of wue expressed by different components of carbon gain and water loss were different hu et al 2010 yu et al 2008 or were only weakly correlated ito and inatomi 2012 therefore different definitions of wue cannot be compared directly in order to fully understand the wue for forest ecosystem along elevation gradient wue defined with transpiration or evapotranspiration should be calculated separately both transpiration and canopy interception can account for a large proportion of evapotranspiration lin et al 2011 xu et al 2018 the factors which control the different evapotranspiration components were also different if different definitions of wue varied with similar or discrepancy trend along elevation gradient is still unclear abies is the dominant coniferous species in northern hemisphere wang et al 2014 most abies distributes over a broad vertical range in mountainous region and southwestern china lu and cheng 2009 the mountain area of southwestern china is the source region of 6 main rivers and the second largest forest district in china sun 2005 wang et al 2011 thus played an important role in water resource and carbon sequestration the subalpine coniferous forest is highly sensitive to climate change tsuyama et al 2015 therefore the trade off relationship between carbon gain and water loss along elevation gradient can indicate the potential response of trees to climate change however the temporal and elevational patterns of wue in subalpine forests are still not fully characterized despite obvious practical importance to address these questions both atmospheric vegetation interaction model avim2 and foliage stable carbon isotope methods are adopted to simulate and elucidate the carbon gain water loss and their components the objectives of our study were 1 to indicate the coupled relationships between the carbon cycle and water cycle along elevation gradient 2 to investigate the factors that control the variation of wue in both temporal and elevation pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at hailuogou valley in mt gongga 29 20 30 20 n 101 30 102 15 e where is located in the transitional area between the eastern monsoon subtropics of china and the frigid region of the tibetan plateau mt gongga is the summit of the hengduan mountains abies fabri is the dominant tree species in study area on the eastern slope of the mt gongga between 2800 and 3700 m a s l the subalpine treeline the dark coniferous forest is the zonal vegetation of the cold temperate

carbon gain and water loss were simulated using the avim2 model that was developed for simulating seasonal and inter annual variations in biophysical and biogeochemical processes at the land surface the avim2 model includes physical process module phy physiological plant growth module plt and soil carbon nitrogen dynamics module som fig 2 phy is a typical soil vegetation atmosphere transfer

radiation transfer the sensible and latent heat fluxes between the air canopy and soil the interception of rainfall and drainage runoff and infiltration transpiration from the canopy and evaporation

to october 2011 foliage samples of abies fabri were collected between 2800 m and 3700 m at 100 m intervals along the elevation gradient of hailuogou valley table 1 at each elevation we set four 50 m 50 m sampling quadrats 4 to 5 trees in each quadrat were selected for sampling the foliage with different ages was mixed together to one sample for each quadrat to avoid the influence of near ground co2 on foliage δ13c only the foliage above ground more than 10 m were selected foliage samples were collected once in each midmonth from may to october all the foliage samples were dried in a forced draft oven at 65 c for 48 h then ground into fine powder and stored at 4 c until analysis the samples of foliage carbon isotope were measured using an elemental analyzer flash ea1112 ht interfaced to

set as 0 2 m s 1 to filter nighttime fluxes spurious data were removed from the dataset if the instrument performance was abnormal or rainfall events occurred the missing data accounted for approximately 35 of the total data between may and october to compare the simulated carbon and water fluxes the missing or rejected daily data were not interpolated the data between november and next april was also removed as the influence of ice or snow cover on sensors the energy balance closure was evaluated using linear regression coefficients between the 30 minute estimates of dependent flux variables le h against the independently derived available energy rn g s from may to october in 2009 wilson et al 2002 the closure of the energy balance was acceptable the slope of le h vs rn g s was 0 71 lin et al 2011 2 5 calculation of wue the amount of carbon gained per unit of water loss is named wue mg c g h2o wue has different definitions depending on temporal or spatial scales steduto and albrizio 2005 different definitions of wue refer to different ecological processes and possible different influencing factors in this study wue was calculated using the following equations 4 w u e g p p e t 5 w u e n p p e t wue calculated using eq 4 and eq 5 are controlled by both the physiological process of transpiration and the physical process of evaporation from the soil surface and the canopy the wue calculated using eq 4 and eq 5 was ecosystem wue 6 w u e g p p e t 7 w u e n p p e t wue calculated using eqs 6 and 7 reflect the water use ability of the plant community the wue calculated using eqs 6 and 7 was plant wue 2 6 indices of model performance three indices were used to evaluate the agreement between simulations and observations including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and agreement index d 8 r m s e i 1 n x i obs i 2 n 9 d 1 i 1 n x i obs i 2 i 1 n x i x obs i obs 2 where x is simulated results of avim2 model obs is the

bias in the simulated results the smaller the value of rmse the better the agreement between the simulation and observation 2 7 data and validation of avim2 model for the elevation gradient the hourly meteorological data january to december 2011 was used as model inputs include the hourly mean air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind velocity and radiation recorded at elevation of 2200 3000 3500 and 4200 m a s l by auto meteorological observation system amos in hailuogou valley our study was carried out along the hailuogou valley linear interpolation method was used to interpolate the air temperature and precipitation along the elevation gradient of every 100 m interval from 2800 to 3700 m a s l based on the digital elevation model dem and four amoss the lapse rate of meteorological variables was calibrated by monthly scale based on the four amoss for the temporal scale the hourly meteorological data 2008 2011 was used as model inputs at 3000 m a s l local variables used in avim2 were all measured along the elevation gradient for each 100 m interval the soil texture data such as sand silt and clay percentage content was sampled in the same site where foliage samples taken and then analyzed in lab coordinate slope aspect and elevation data were all from the portable gps forest type coverage and canopy height were all investigated in the same site where foliage was sampled air co2 concentration was observed by li cor 8150 li cor inc usa the avim2 has been validated for many plant functional types in china such as forest crops steppe and desert grassland lu and ji 2006 huang et al 2007 the modeled results showed good accordance with measured or remote sensing results in both site and regional scale the simulated daily gpp was also compared with that observed by eddy covariance and the results showed that the avim2 can capture the variance of gpp r2 0 4994 rmse 1 6513 d 0 7653 fig 3 measured annual gpp of 22 7 t ha 1 a 1 cheng and luo 2003 compared to the simulated value of 21 1 t ha 1 a 1 by avim2 model the simulated gpp of abies fabri based on forest dndc model was 21 95 t ha 1 a 1 lu 2009 which was also comparable to simulated gpp of avim2 model the simulated et was also validated with the observation by eddy covariance the avim2 can simulate the daily variation of the et in the wet season or in the dry season r2 0 7982 rmse 0 0198 d 0 9309 fig 4 the components of the et were also validated with the in situ observations in hailuoguo valley the eint et and es were observed from april to october in 2009 lin et al 2011 sun et al 2013 the simulated eint of 402 8 mm by avim2 model was comparable to the observation of 460 7 mm sun et al 2013 the simulated et by avim2 model was 139 2 mm which is almost the same as the observed value of 139 8 mm lin et al 2011 the simulated es by avim2 model from the ground was 56 3 mm which was higher than the observed value of 44 2 mm lin et al 2011 the modeled wue gpp et was validated by comparing the simulated value to that derived from foliage δ13c eq 3 the results demonstrated that wue gpp et simulated by the avim2 was reasonable with the wue calculated by foliage δ13c fig 5 a and b the analysis of r squared r2 and p value indicated that the simulated value had good accuracy therefore the avim2 model can be used to study the coupled relationship between carbon gain and water loss in our study area 2 8 data analysis a one way anova with fisher s lsd test was performed to test the variance in the gpp npp et and wue of different months the relationships between the et et gpp and climatic variables were fitted with linear or non linear equations using sigmaplot 12 3 all analyses were conducted with spss 13 0 statistically significant difference was set as 0 05 the relative contribution analysis was conducted by r software version 3 4 2 the correlations between original predictors at ci ca p and new orthogonal variables gpp et wue were calculated first regression coefficients of y on orthogonal variables were produced then the ratio of coefficients square was the relative contribution of each variable 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of meteorological factors to reveal the relationship between wue and climatic factors the variation patterns of the monthly precipitation air temperature vpd and net radiation rn were investigated the annual precipitation was 1896 1606 2022 and 1469 mm from 2008 to 2011 at an elevation of 3000 m a s l fig 6 a the annual mean air temperature was 4 7 5 3 5 4 and 4 6 c from 2008 to 2011 and the highest monthly mean air temperature was in july while the coldest monthly mean air temperature was in december january or february fig 6b compared with the air temperature the vpd had a similar trend fig 6c in contrast to the air temperature the maximum value of monthly rn was not in july fig 6d large amount of rainfall and cloudy weather possibly contributed to the seasonal variation of rn 3 2 seasonal and elevational variations of gpp and npp the monthly variations of gpp and npp at 3000 m a s l from 2008 to 2011 were simulated using the avim2 model over the 4 years both gpp and npp showed seasonal variations the peak values of gpp and npp were in july while the least values were in january or february fig 7 annual gpp was 21 17 21 17 21 90 and 22 63 t c ha 1 a 1 from 2008 to 2011 respectively while annual npp was 12 78 12 78 13 14 and 13 87 t c ha 2 a 1 from 2008 to 2011 respectively the mean monthly variations of gpp and npp for abies fabri at 3000 m a s l were also modeled using the avim2 during the dormancy period from november to next april the gpp and npp were lower compared with the wet season but plant photosynthesis and respiration continued even in the coldest month air temperature 5 c the annual gpp and npp were 21 1 and 12 3 t ha 1 a 1 at 3000 m a s l respectively both the gpp and npp decreased as the elevation increases the lapse rate was 0 09 and 0 03 g m 2 s 1 100 m for the gpp and npp respectively both the gpp and npp showed peak values at 3000 m a s l fig 8 the temperature decreased as the elevation increases the precipitation increased from 2800 m a s l to 3500 m a s l but decreased as the elevation increased further the variation of gpp and npp was more in accordance with temperature along elevation gradient 3 3 seasonal and elevational variation of et and its components et consists of canopy interception transpiration and evaporation from the ground the mean annual amounts of eint et and es at 3000 m a s l were 367 1 247 7 and 91 5 mm respectively the ratio of annual eint to et was 51 3 the ratio of et to et increased from 18 7 in january to a maximum value of 43 5 in june in contrast to the gpp and npp neither the et nor the et peaked in july fig 7 the annual et was 628 640 587 and 706 mm from 2008 to 2011 the annual et was 187 200 195 and 248 mm from 2008 to 2011 the annual et decreased as the elevation increased and the annual et decreased sharply fig 9 the ratio of et to et decreased from 48 9 at 2800 m a s l to 26 3 at 3700 m a s l different from other components of evapotranspiration eint increased along elevation gradient more water lost through canopy evaporation from low elevation to high elevation because the precipitation increased with elevation 3 4 seasonal and elevational pattern of wue gpp et gpp et npp et and npp et was 4 01 0 21 12 35 0 71 2 31 0 12 and 7 10 0 38 mg c g h2o in wet season respectively gpp et gpp et npp et and npp et was 2 59 0 32 8 55 1 24 1 74 0 19 and 5 71 0 90 mg c g h2o in dry season respectively wue with different definitions was significantly larger in the wet season than that in the dry season fig 10 a and b gpp et gpp et npp et and npp et had generally similar seasonal pattern however the maximum values of gpp et and npp et occurred in different months which indicated that wue with different definitions were different from each other both gpp et and npp et increased significantly as the elevation increasing fig 11 a gpp et and npp et increased at the rate of 0 72 and 0 49 mg c g h2o 100 m respectively the gpp et and npp et increased from 2800 to 3500 m a s l then slightly decreased from 3600 to 3700 m a s l fig 11b gpp et and npp et increased at the rate of 0 06 and 0 05 mg c g h2o 100 m respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the definition of water use efficiency the different definitions of wue in this study address varied influence of ecosystem respiration and evaporation canopy interception and evaporation from ground on temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem wue wue is usually defined as the ratio of net or gross co2 assimilation to water loss via transpiration in canopy scale while the ratio of plant co2 assimilation to total water loss by et at ecosystem scale gpp et and npp et were weakly correlated on the spatial scale ito and inatomi 2012 this discrepancy makes it too difficult to compare wue of the same species derived from different water loss and carbon gain components niu et al 2011 the different definition of wue can improve the understanding the coupled relationship between carbon gain and water loss in from leaf to ecosystem scale in this study canopy and ecosystem scale showed heterogeneous pattern of wue in temporal and elevational scale figs 10 and 11 the different definition of wue in one study also provided the opportunity to compare the results in distinct region ponton et al 2006 found that the values of gpp et were 1 7 0 5 3 6 1 5 and 5 4 1 6 mg c g h2o in grasslands aspen and douglas fir forests respectively wue expressed by gpp et was 2 5 3 1 mg c g h2o for abies fabri along the elevation gradient from 2800 m to 3700 m in mt gongga the value of gpp et in this study were in the range of other studies law et al 2002 ponton et al 2006 yu et al 2008 beer et al 2009 the annual values of gpp et and npp et were 7 1 and 1 8 mg c g h2o for abies fabri at 3000 m in mt gongga comparing to the values of gpp et and npp et were 8 0 and 0 92 mg c g h2o at global scale respectively ito and inatomi 2012 the results demonstrated that the different definitions of wue in mt gongga were comparable with global studies 4 2 seasonal patterns of water use efficiency the variations in wue among different season indicated that the coupled relationship between the carbon gain and water loss was influenced by climatic variables yu et al 2008 seasonal variations of wue reflect short term scale of the trade off relationship between carbon gain and water loss there was a significant correlation between the carbon gain and water loss while the r2 between the gpp npp and et was larger than that of the gpp npp and et fig 12 a and b canopy interception accounted for 51 3 of the total et at 3000 m and the contribution was even higher with elevation increasing fig 9 therefore canopy interception reduced the physiological coupled relationship between the carbon gain and water loss for ecosystem scale the carbon gain increased sharply as the water loss increased when the monthly et was less than 10 mm or the et was less than 20 mm the patterns of the variations in carbon gain and water loss were relatively constant throughout the wet season the response of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic variables was different in various forest ecosystems keenan et al 2013 medlyn and de kauwe 2013 lin et al 2018 understanding the effects of climatic variables on forest ecosystem productivity wue is a useful indicator for the prediction of changes in the carbon gain and water loss due to climate change law et al 2002 in this study the responsive characteristics of gpp et and et to monthly precipitation temperature vpd and rn were analyzed at an elevation of 3000 m the et et and gpp responded to climatic variables differently the relationships between et et gpp and monthly precipitation and vpd were fitted with quadratic functions fig 13 a and c however there were different relationships between et et gpp temperature and rn fig 13b and d temperature vs gpp rn vs et and rn vs et were all fitted with linear functions et and et decreased when p 180 mm while gpp decreased when the monthly average rn 1700 mj m 2d 1 the asynchronous responses of et et and gpp to changing climatic variables determined the relationship between the carbon gain and water loss therefore wue with different definitions varied during the month the increasing rate of the et and et were much larger than those of the gpp and npp in the wet season although et et and gpp were fitted using the same mathematical form for monthly precipitation and vpd the extent to which these variations were due to climatic factors was different 4 3 elevation gradient of water use efficiency an elevation gradient is not a phenomenological driving variable however it is the combination of multiple factors such as precipitation temperature nutrients and plant physiology although the variation of abies foliage δ13c generally showed an increasing trend fig 14 a there was no significant relationship between elevation and foliage δ13c among different regions fig 14b the variation in precipitation had no significant influence on wue of abies fabri along an elevation gradient in the mt gongga fig 15 a which agreed with previous results li et al 2009 luo et al 2011 a study in the hawaiian metrosideros found that the δ13c value of bulk leaf tissue increased as the elevation increased in the eastern humid region while the same trend did not exist in the western arid region vitousek et al 1990 van de water et al 2002 found that water was not the main influencing factor for wue in the wet region because both the rainfall and soil moisture were not strictly determined factors for tree growth the annual rainfall was more than 1600 mm between 2800 m and 3700 m on the subalpine mt gongga therefore we concluded that the variation in the wue along the elevation gradient was not determined by precipitation there was a significant negative relationship between the air temperature and wue derived from the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue fig 15b which also indicated that the intrinsic wue increased as the air temperature decreased along the elevation gradient the curves of gpp and et vs ta were different fig 15b temperature is an important climatic variable in mountainous terrain the leaf morphology change to adapt to low temperature environments while the diffusion resistance to co2 also increases taylor and sexton 1972 as the diffusivity decreased under low air temperature conditions the stomatal conductance also decreased panek and warning 1995 the water potential of leaves increased under low air temperature condition which restrict the plant transpiration cochard et al 2000 therefore the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue increased along elevation gradient the gpp et and npp et derived from avim2 model also increased along the elevation gradient despite both carbon gain and water loss decreased both temperature and precipitation affected the tree morphology and physiology in montane forests and further determined the carbon water relations peng et al 2012 maxwell et al 2018 while the extreme point of maximum carbon gain also indicated that the optimum climate of abies fabri influenced the variation of morphology fig 8 the harsh climate and barren soil limited the canopy height and canopy coverage in high elevation in this study both canopy height r2 0 52 p 0 01 and coverage r2 0 44 p 0 01 were significantly negative correlated with wue along elevation gradient the results demonstrated that both climate and tree morphology contributed to the variation of wue along elevation gradient while the variation of wue with age related canopy height showed different trend under the homogeneous environmental conditions köstner et al 2002 irvine et al 2004 he et al 2008 the main reason was that the different response of carbon gain and water loss to both climatic variables and tree height irvine et al 2004 tang et al 2017 this study suggested that the effect of canopy height on wue along elevation gradient was different from that age related morphology stable carbon isotope composition of leaf tissue was related to ci ca farquhar et al 1989 the stomatal conductance was influenced by both climatic variables and physiological function liu et al 2017 in this study both the value of ci ca and ci decreased as the elevation increased table 1 therefore both the transpiration and carbon gain decreased along the elevation gradient figs 8 and 9 however the effects of stomatal control on the carbon gain and water loss were different keenan et al 2013 lin et al 2018 the carbon gain is more sensitive to variations in conductance than water loss li se et al 2015 annual ta was the primary factor for the variation of gpp and et while both ta and ci ca control gpp et along elevation gradient fig 16 therefore gpp et and npp et showed significant increases from low elevations to high elevations while the canopy interception increased along the elevation gradient gpp et and npp et only showed moderately increasing trends along the elevation gradient fig 11 the forest distributed along elevation gradient also change the leaf nitrogen content and specific leaf area to adapt the environmental conditions nitrogen is the main component of the photosynthetic enzyme and is also one of the main factors that determine the photosynthetic capacity of a leaf an increase in the leaf nitrogen content can augment the content of leaf chlorophyll and carboxylase therefore influence the stomatal density and leaf thickness many studies have shown that the leaf nitrogen content of alpine plants increases as the elevation increases friend et al 1989 körner 1989 li et al 2009 in the subalpine mountains more nitrogen is distributed to the leaf thereby offsetting the decrease in photosynthetic rate caused by low light and low nitrogen use efficiency specific leaf area is one of the most important indicators of leaf traits hultine and marshall 2000 found that a negative relationship existed between the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue of coniferous forest and the specific leaf area along an elevation gradient in the northern rocky mountains li et al 2008 demonstrated that the specific leaf area of a dark coniferous forest decreased as the elevation increased however there was a positive relationship between the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue and the specific leaf area for quercus aquifolioides in subalpine area of western sichuan province li et al 2009 there was also a negative relationship between the δ13c of bulk leaf tissue and the specific leaf area during the seasonal variation of abies fabri at 3000 m in mt gongga luo et al 2011 however the tree line of abies fabri keep on increasing under global warming the plant physiology also changing to adapt varied environmental conditions therefore the wue variation along elevation gradient can be an indicator of forest response to climate change which helps us to manage forest more efficient in mountainous area 5 conclusion the carbon gain water loss and wue exhibit temporal and elevational variation but the controlling factors for wue in subalpine coniferous forest remain unclear only foliage stable carbon isotope or eddy covariance method is still challenging because the limitation of partitioning wue to carbon gain and water loss or high cost based on experimental data and modeled data we analyzed the temporal and elevational variations of the carbon gain water loss and wue and discussed the factors that control the carbon gain water loss and wue in a subalpine coniferous forest wue was defined using different carbon gain and water loss components on the seasonal scale the carbon gain and water loss had different response curves with the precipitation air temperature vpd and rn indicating that a variety of climatic variables drove the photosynthesis and et in different ways and at different rates on the elevation scale the carbon gain et and et decreased as the elevation increased the gpp et and npp et increased significantly as the elevation increased while the gpp et and npp et increased from 2800 to 3500 m and then slightly decreased canopy interception played an important role in the variation of plant and ecosystem wue along the elevation gradient air temperature was the main controlling factor for elevational variation of gpp and et respectively while both air temperature and ci ca contributed to the wue gpp et along elevation gradient tree morphology such as canopy height and canopy coverage also contributed to the variation of wue along elevation gradient the response of the carbon gain and water loss to environmental and physiological changes on the temporal and elevational scale is complex which is also a great challenge for water resource management and forest management how the carbon gain water loss and wue for the subalpine mountainous forest ecosystem varies with changes in the global climate still remain to be investigated improved understanding of temporal and elevational behavior of carbon and water vapour exchanges in relation to environmental conditions will enhance our ability to predict the effects of climate change on mountainous ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement sun xiangyang data curation writing

5884,a major water governance concern is how to coordinate the complex relationships of the water food and energy sectors and the resulting economic social and environmental consequences focusing on the challenges in one sector e g water shortage in the water sector and making decisions without considering other sectors will not solve these problems rather it will create a new problem the decline of food production in the food sectors the nexus approach is a novel method to represent the interrelated challenges of the water food and energy sectors by considering the sectors policies to achieve sustainable development the present study analyzes the social network of nexus actors in the yazd ardakan aquifer yazd province iran for this purpose 54 partners in the nexus network were first identified in various public private semi private and non governmental organizations three types of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were analyzed among the actors the actor network was then assessed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors then a coherence analysis was performed by the density index at the entire network level and the power analysis was carried out using in degree out degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality indices at the individual actor level social network analysis criteria were then incorporated with the multi criteria decision making model electre i to select the key and powerful actors in the nexus network next the powerful actors were identified and introduced with respect to 15 criteria employed in the social network analysis according to the results the power structure in the nexus network of the research area is not at equilibrium most of the power lies with the public sector the water food and energy sectors act alone and they do not exploit their maximum organizational capacities to establish relationships with one another keywords actors power multi criteria decision making social network analysis water food energy nexus water governance 1 introduction nowadays besides technical solutions the social science perspective of the hydrology can improve water resources management the framework of this study is exemplified by analyzing the water food energy wfe network of the yazd ardakan aquifer the framework offers a method to analyze the connections of groundwater governance actors in the wfe nexus network and select the influential actors of groundwater governance this analysis and selection approach relates to the comprehensive interdisciplinary analysis of hydrological problems and the policy issue of water resources management 1 1 water resources issues it is generally believed that the current water crises have mainly resulted from inappropriate water governance folke et al 2005 pahl wostl 2009 especially in arid region yatsuka and shivakoti 2013 al zubari 2012 braune and adams 2013 and its largely related to its non participatory and top down approach in decision making processes many experts acknowledge that water governance should not be confined to government and other actors should also be involved so that their active and constructive presence can contribute to solving water resource issues fliervoet et al 2016 in other words the participation of local stakeholders in the management and utilization of water resources will lead to the optimal use and conservation of water resources banihabib and ghafoori 2016 moreover the water food and energy sectors affect water demand which is on the rise due to population and economic growth and urbanization expansion hoff 2011 a mere focus on the challenges of the water sector and decision making without considering other sectors i e food and energy will not solve the problem but it will create a new problem in the other sectors hoff 2011 halbe et al 2015 in order to solve problems in the water sector according to the relationship of the three sectors of water food and energy it is important to find a point of equilibrium of interest in the nexus network instead of attempting to maximize benefits this will be achieved by considering stakeholders interests ideas and suggestions in the nexus management thus it is important to identify the influential actors of the nexus because information exchange brings different ideas together and helps stakeholders identify collaborative solutions to improve water governance the nexus approach is a new method to represent the interconnected challenges of the wfe sectors considering the policies related to each sector with the purpose of achieving sustainable development stein et al 2011 2014 this approach is based on inter sectoral relationships to prevent the transmission of problems from one sector to another halbe et al 2015 the wfe nexus approach can improve the security of resources reduce inter sectoral conflicts and raise interests by increasing resource efficiency and political cohesion to achieve sustainable development this requires that stakeholders engage in dialogue and compromise on the conflicting goals to foster cooperation and settle conflicts the innate complexity of the wfe nexus approach and the mutual dependencies among this resources turn a participatory activity into a necessary part of the nexus approach johnson and karlberg 2017 a new feature of the nexus approach is that different sectors water food and energy are equally important and that there are numerous actors and stakeholders in each sector so that their goals and interests must be considered in decision making relying on the participation of all actors the nexus approach considers the policies of various sectors in decision making stein et al 2014 in the wfe sectors each actor has its own capabilities and capacities that dictate its roles kuzdas et al 2015 the role and position analysis of actors in a nexus network is the starting point for participatory governance success in participatory governance depends on identifying the actors and the analysis of their social processes crona and hubacek 2010 marín and berkes 2010 in other words without sufficient understanding of the actors and their interplay participatory governance will yield negative results grimble and wellard 1997 1 2 water food energy nexus and its actors a framework is necessary to analyze the actor network to improve inter sectoral cooperation the social network analysis sna is a tool proposed to analyze the relationships of actors and determine the key and effective actors moreover sna is more important when numerous actors want to manage natural resources more effectively bodin and crona 2009 in other words sna can determine which actor has greater power for direct decision making and affect policymaking mills et al 2014 weiss et al 2012 it provides a classification based on their positions within a network prell et al 2009 therefore sna has been employed in extensive studies to analyze actor networks for instance ding and liu 2011 studied the structure of a multi organizational network and the social relationships of actors in public projects in china based on social networks they investigated the general features of the network and individual actors affecting the strategies and finally analyzed the effects of stakeholders on the progress of the project according to the results sna led to a better understanding of the network by measuring the connections of various actors within the network sna was employed by stein et al 2011 to analyze the participatory social network among actors of water governance in mkindo watershed in tanzania they analyzed the effects of the social networks on the capacity of water governance in the watershed the results showed that social networks facilitated water resource management and made it more effective studies have also indicated that sna could be adopted in the analysis of the roles and positions of actors as for agricultural networks hauck et al 2016 employed sna to identify the stakeholders in bio farming management and decision making related to land use at the regional and local levels they demonstrated that sna provided policymakers in the agricultural sector with valuable information on the activities of organizations regarding natural resource management prell et al 2009 employed sna to identify the key and marginal stakeholders in england and showed that sna would prevent tensions and would lead to taking the interests of all stakeholders into consideration when there are a large number of actors participatory activity is affected by their relationships and the power balance in the network paletto et al 2016 considering the importance of nexus management in reducing tensions water governance practitioners have shown interest in the study of nexus actor networks in which the relationships of actors in the wfe sectors are regarded as an interconnected and integrated network therefore a wfe nexus network was analyzed and addressed in this study as a single network by addressing actors in the three sectors and their connections the actors in a social network have a clear goal to influence others so that they can achieve their goals the analysis of the power of actors provides a better understanding of their roles and influences in decision making processes and guarantees transparency and justice paletto et al 2012 2015 extensive research has focused on the power of actors in social networks for example kuzdas et al 2015 employed sna to analyze a water governance network in costa rica based on the type of social relationships among the actors in four sectors water supply delivery use and sewerage they studied several organizations and relationships network density and the centrality of each actor the findings led to the selection of the key actors in the four sectors for the participatory process in another study bojovic et al 2017 analyzed the relationships of the actors in a sector responsible for adaptation to climate change and for risk mitigation they used sna to investigate how the actors in the network interconnected with one another and the geometrical position of them they also analyzed the power levels of the actors by using centrality indices 1 3 previous studies on the methodology previous studies have only dealt with the analytical determination of the power levels of actors using power criteria in social networks however it is essential for policymakers to have actors ranked in terms of power in fact when actors are ranked in terms of their influence on water governance network weak and powerful actors are identified afterward the weak actors can be empowered by increasing their relationships with other actors thus they can contribute to the decision making process which will in turn improve the policymaking process of water governance consequently after the power structure is analyzed by sna and a large number of the sna criteria required to investigate the power structure and also a large number of actors in the wfe sectors are considered it is necessary to use a multi criteria decision making mcdm model to select the powerful actors various studies have exploited mcdm models for issues pertaining to water resources including planning water resources strategically in arid regions banihabib et al 2016 chitsaz and azarnivand 2017 sheikhipour et al 2018 providing sustainable development solutions to stabilize shrinking lakes banihabib et al 2015 zarghami 2011 and planning agricultural water demand banihabib and shabestari 2017a b orojloo et al 2018 however no mcdm models have yet been employed to select powerful actors in a nexus network we know that there are a large number of mcdm methods so it was necessary to pick a suitable one for selecting powerful actors in the present study three mcdm methods including saw topsis and electre 1 were chosen and the most efficient methods were evaluated by the ai index proposed by li 2007 the comparison of mcdm methods in water resources management has been subject to extensive research for instance chitsaz and banihabib 2015 compared mcdm models to prioritize flood risk management options in the gorganrood river and found the electre model a more suitable option compared to the others in another study banihabib et al 2017a b compared the saw and ahp compensatory mcdm methods with the non compensatory electre method to select strategies for coping with water scarcity to achieve sustainable development in shahrood the results revealed that the electre method was less sensitive to weight changes according to the previous studies and the calculated ai index the electre i model of mcdm was employed here to select the powerful actors in the wfe nexus the sna was employed in the present study to analyze the nexus actor network in the yazd ardakan aquifer central iran this analysis was performed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors at the entire network level network coherence was investigated to answer the question as to whether decision making was participatory in the wfe sectors at the level of individual actors it was intended to analyze and rank the power levels of actors the methodology of this study is based on identifying the influential actors and ranking them in terms of their power in order to involve them in decision making and policymaking of groundwater resources to improve groundwater governance megdal et al 2017 oecd 2011 chilton and smidt 2014 because groundwater governance is a framework in which groundwater resources are managed so if we improve water governance water management will be improved in addition the actors participation is a key component of good governance oecd 2011 in a participatory process it should also be studied which stakeholders should be involved in the governance process thus this study aimed to identify powerful actors in the nexus network as the first step in participatory governance identifying power circles in a nexus network provides planners with valuable information for coordinating and mobilizing the network by taking into account the status of the leaders and the stage of the participatory process moreover power analysis in a network and identification of the leadership situation in a system can enable researchers to empower weaker actors to increase their cooperation and collaboration for promoting network objectives in general this is the first time when the degree of coherence and power relationships in nexus actor networks is analyzed and regarded as a connected and integrated network the sna criteria were entered into the electre i mcdm model to integrate these two models in order to select the powerful actors in the wfe nexus the contributions of this study are 1 proposing a framework to analyze the relationships of groundwater governance actors in the water food energy wfe nexus network as a connected and integrated network and 2 proposing a method for selecting the powerful actors among groundwater governance actors in the wfe nexus 2 material and methodology one of the most important requirements for designing a nexus management system is to analyze the roles and positions of the individual actors of the wfe sectors sna was employed in this study to analyze the structure of a nexus actor network fig 1 shows the flowchart of the research steps accordingly the first step in conducting network analysis research was to determine the ecological and network boundaries in this study the yazd ardakan area was considered as the ecological boundary and the organizations related to the nexus management in the three sectors of water food energy constituted the network boundary after the actors were identified three types of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration formed the basis of the analysis the nexus actor network analysis was performed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors appropriate criteria were selected for the network analysis and the quantitative indices were determined for the evaluation of the criteria the collected data were analyzed by using ucinet 6 a widely used software package in social network data analysis moreover netdraw borgatti et al 2018 was employed to represent the geometrical position of the network and to draw the diagrams the criteria for analyzing power in the social network were integrated with the electre i model to select the powerful actors in the nexus network regarding the significance of the participation of the wfe actors in water governance the method of this study proposes an approach to analyzing the actors connection and selecting powerful actors which can lead to better participatory water governance in other words the proposed integration of sna and electre i offers an approach to simplifying the selection of effective wfe actors in participatory water governance 2 1 study area the yazd ardakan aquifer the research site of the study is a place whose the main stakeholders are in contact with each other the social network of the actors was formed as the starting point to analyze the network fig 2 displays the study area which is in siahkooh watershed nearly in the central part of iran lying between the longitudes 53 25 55 00 e and latitudes 31 56 32 45 n the total area of the basin is about 11 573 km2 5441 km2 of which is underlain by the aquifer and the rest is mountainous the average elevation of the study area is about 1565 m above sea level the yazd ardakan area is located within a desert so it has very little rainfall and is deprived of permanent rivers except for flood events due to the limited surface water resources nearly all the water that is used for drinking agriculture and industries is extracted from the groundwater resources recent decades have witnessed a growing pressure on groundwater resources emanating from the dry climate consecutive droughts population growth competition between the industrial and agricultural sectors for water consumption and mismanagement the long term hydrograph of the yazd ardakan aquifer 1974 2016 shows that the water table has declined at a rate of 0 43 m per year iran water resource management company 2016 given the continued drawdown in the groundwater level despite the bans on the utilization of the groundwater in the plain on the one hand and the pressure on the groundwater resources as the only source of water providing the required water on the other hand it is essential to use a participatory approach in the wfe nexus to manage the current water crisis in the study area 2 2 identification of the actor network this step addresses the relationships among stakeholders in each sector of the wfe nexus this is very important because the involvement of all actors is a vital step to ensure that interests experiences and information of all the stakeholders are taken into account in the nexus management in fact the actors are the main source of information for analyzing the wfe nexus fig a1 in supplementary information file depicts the conceptual social network model of the actors in the nexus of wfe sectors in the aquifer the initial list of the related influential and influenced actors in the three wfe sectors of the yazd ardakan plain was prepared from the various public and private organizations ngos academic communities and research institutes through identifying the organizations involved in the three sectors by interviewing the individuals in charge at these agencies 2 3 types of relationships among actors after an initial list of the actors was prepared a questionnaire was developed with respect to the types of interactions among the organizations identified in the list and visits were made to relevant organizations to hold 45 minute interviews with the representatives of each organization the interviewees were asked to specify the types and frequency annual seasonal monthly or weekly of interactions they had with each listed organization including knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration the data on the interaction frequency were classified on a time spectrum annual seasonal monthly and weekly in the order of low medium high and very high intensity interactions the qualitative data on interaction frequency were quantified and ranked from 1 to 4 based on a spectrum ranging from low to very high moreover the three interaction matrices of knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were generated 2 4 analysis of the nexus network by sna sna provides a tool to investigate the relationships of actors it consists of a set of nodes actors and ties relationships between actors sometimes the relationships in networks are represented by undirected ties these ties merely indicate whether there is a relationship between two nodes in directed networks relationships between nodes are represented by ties exiting from one node and pointing to another node ding and liu 2011 directed ties in a network indicate information flow from one actor to another when two actors select each other they share a directed relationship that is called a bilateral or mutual relationship fig a2 in supplementary information file shows an example of directed and undirected graphs in the present research the relationships of actors were considered bilateral because the studied interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were reciprocal the two criteria of power and coherence were integrated to describe the actor network and how they were interconnected 2 5 degree of coherence in the nexus network at the level of the entire network since the structural patterns of the relationships in the social networks have a significant impact on the performance of the actors in the sectors it is important to determine which wfe sector is more strongly connected to the other two sectors and how coherent the nexus network is the coherence criterion represents the level of integration in the nexus network or shows which sector acts alone without paying attention to others in fact coherence is related to relationships that bring the actors of a group together the stronger the interconnections between the nexus networks are the higher the governance efficiency in the wfe sectors will be scholz et al 2008 analysis of the coherence criterion at the network level answers the question as to whether the nexus network in the study area works in the form of separate sectors or whether all the sectors take advantage of their entire organizational capacities to promote the goals density is a measure of a general group s cohesion stein et al 2011 so the density of a network provides a measure of its connectivity and more connectivity shows more cohesion at the network level the density index is employed to study the network coherence the density index is defined in eq 1 1 γ n r n p where γ represents density nr is the number of relationships that exist among the actors and np denotes the number of possible relationships the closer this index gets to 1 the more connected the network is and hence the greater its effectiveness will be the nearer the index gets to 0 the less connected the actors are and hence the sectors work in isolation higher density in the network signifies higher coherence in it because higher coherence increases confidence and facilitates the sharing of information and resources it also improves collaboration and cooperation among the actors higher network densities enhance links improve network coherence and access of individuals to each other and their coordination and promote the possibility of social control to explore the interaction between the food and water network compared to the interactions among themselves the concept of homophily was surveyed homophily refers to a situation where similar actors are attracted to one another and thus choose to interact with each other actors who are similar to one another are better able to communicate with each other but a successful system requires different views and ideas we used the e i external internal index to measure homophily among the groups ogada et al 2017 the e i index is important in calculating the relationship between members of a given group and the amount of interaction that one has with stakeholders external and internal to one s group a score of 1 0 for the e i index means that a stakeholder interacts only with members of its own group thus indicating homophilous relationships on the other hand an index of 1 0 shows that a stakeholder interacts with others external to one s own group which translates to heterophilous ties ogada et al 2017 for a deeper understanding of nexus networks the global clustering coefficient was calculated for the nexus network at three levels of interaction knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration the clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together the clustering coefficient of an actor is the density of its open neighborhood the overall clustering coefficient is the mean of the clustering coefficients of all actors 2 6 the power of nexus actors when the number of actors increases in a decision making process participatory activity is affected by the relationships of actors and the power balance in the network the power that an actor has in the wfe sector can play a decisive role in promoting the policies and plans of the related sector in fact power is one of the main components of social structures that can be defined based on the situation status and connections of an individual inside the network in a network an actor with greater power is more likely to influence the other actors in an attempt to receive a greater share of funds and have greater access to information and opportunities therefore a more powerful actor can influence the priority of selecting the desired option in a decision making process consequently at the level of individual actors the analysis of the power criterion provides researchers policymakers and planners with valuable information to select the key actors to establish participatory management systems in the nexus sectors many studies have revealed a positive relationship between centrality in network and power brass 1984 krackhardt 1990 since higher centrality implies more power ding and liu 2011 centrality indices are a proper tool to represent the power position of actors hansen et al 2010 in this study the centrality indices of degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector were employed to analyze power at the level of individual actors the degree centrality index is defined as the number of actors that are directly connected to one actor in fact the actor who has a higher degree centrality can assume the leadership role degree centrality of actor k represented by cd pk is calculated by eq 2 as shown below 2 c d p k i 1 n a p i p k where n is the number of actors in the network and α pi pk is 1 if the two actors pi and pk are connected and otherwise it is 0 this centrality has one type in undirected graphs and two types in directed graphs in degree centrality and out degree centrality hanneman 2001 since the connections among actors in the present research are considered bilateral the degree centrality is divided into in degree centrality and out degree centrality the in degree centrality refers to the number of incoming connections from other actors and the out degree centrality is the number of outgoing connections from an actor a high in degree centrality indicates the popularity of the node and a high out degree centrality implies the greater influence and effectiveness of the actor uddin et al 2017 betweenness centrality quantifies how many times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between the two other nodes using this index one can identify the organizations that can play the role of a connector between separate sectors the betweenness index for actor k cb pk is calculated by eq 3 3 c b p k i j n g ij p k g ij i j k where gij is the shortest path connecting pi and pj and gij pk denotes the shortest path connecting pi and pj that passes through pk that node has the highest betweenness centrality that lies between many other pairs of nodes the paths between which pass through it hanneman 2001 closeness centrality indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the network closeness determines the actors that have the shortest path to be connected with all of the other actors eigenvector centrality is considered one of the centrality indices it draws on the idea that the centrality of a specific actor cannot be estimated in isolation from the centrality of other actors connected to it the actor that possesses the highest eigenvector centrality has many central neighbors brandes 2005 in other words from the perspective of eigenvector centrality a central actor is one who is connected to other actors with high centrality levels therefore eigenvector centrality is the sum of connections between one actor and other actors and it is determined by the centrality of the other actors eigenvector centrality thus provides a broader understanding of the network it is not easy to analyze the power of actors in a social network borgatti 2003 each of these five centrality indices in degree and out degree centrality betweenness centrality closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality is unique and indicates a single part of the power degree centrality in degree and out degree is a suitable index for representing the abilities of an actor in establishing direct connections with other actors in the network betweenness centrality shows the ability to connect separate groups to each other and control information flow resources and actors inside the network actors with the highest closeness centrality are the most accessible nodes in the network eigenvector centrality well demonstrates the connection that exists between one actor and the powerful actors in a network the actor who is in any of these positions is capable of acting the overall network flow and in a way possesses a part of the power 2 7 ranking the power of the actors in the nexus network since there are five centrality criteria in degree centrality out degree centrality betweenness centrality closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality at three interaction levels knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration we were faced with a large number of criteria and actors in the network power analysis for selecting powerful actors thus at this stage an mcdm model was employed to select the key actors it was essential to employ a correct mcdm technique to rank the power of the actors the three methods of saw topsis and electre i were applied and the most efficient ranking method was selected using the ai index according to what proposed by li 2007 according to the computed ai index electre i was selected supplementary information file table a1 the electre i method is a version of the electre method with the difference being that the latter uses a non compensatory mcdm concept in decision making this means that exchanges between criteria are not permitted so that a weakness in one criterion is not offset by the strength of another criterion pourjavad and shirouyezad 2011 rogers et al 2000 roy 1968 1991 the electre method has its own advantages and disadvantages its major advantage is that it takes into account uncertainty and vagueness velasquez and hester 2013 the interviewees in each of the water food and energy sectors may not have sufficient knowledge about the interaction with other sectors so epistemic uncertainty uncertainty as a result of the imperfect knowledge of decision makers about the natural system itself may occur when filling out the questionnaire therefore the present study used the electre method due to its capability to address epistemic uncertainty mosadeghi 2013 the disadvantages of employing electre techniques is that outrank causes the strengths and weaknesses of the alternatives not to be directly identified velasquez and hester 2013 in studies to select powerful actors in a nexus network only ranking is important and no matter how much the actors are superior to each other thus this disadvantage would not impact the outcome of this study a decision matrix is first created to select the key actors using the electre i method according to equation 4 roy and vincke 1981 4 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x mn where xij is the performance of the ith option i 1 2 m to the criterion j j 1 2 n in the present research 54 actors were identified in the nexus sector as options and the criteria included in degree centrality out degree centrality betweenness centrality closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality at three levels of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration after the decision matrix was determined and non dimensionalized weights were assigned to the social network criteria using the entropy method based on this method introduced by shannon and weaver in 1947 entropy expresses the degree of uncertainty in a continuous probability distribution the main idea in this method is that a criterion becomes more important when its values are more dispersed after weight assignment to the criteria a weighted normalized decision matrix was created and the criteria set j 1 2 m was divided into a concordant and a discordant subset for each pair of options k and e k e 1 2 m k e following the formation of the concordant and discordant subsets the concordance matrix and the discordance matrix were created a concordance matrix is a square matrix whose dimension is the number of options and each of its elements is called an index of concordance between two options the value of this index was obtained by summing up the weights of the criteria that existed in the concordant subsets a discordance matrix is also a square matrix whose dimension is the number of options and each of its elements is called an index of discordance between two options at the next step the concordance threshold c was calculated by averaging the concordance criteria and the discordance threshold d was calculated by averaging the discordant criteria after the concordance dominance matrix f and the discordance dominance matrices g were calculated the final dominance matrix h was obtained through multiplying each element in the concordance dominance matrix f by the discordance dominance matrix g roy 1991 the final dominance matrix h expresses the partial preferences of the options 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of nexus actors fifty four actors were identified in the wfe nexus network in the studied area they were divided into four active groups in the water sector the food sector the energy sector and all the three sectors accordingly there were 15 actors in the food sector 9 in the energy sector 13 in the water sector and 17 actors that acted in all three sectors table a2 in supplementary information file shows these actors and their areas of activities 3 2 degree of coherence of the nexus network table 1 presents the density of the entire nexus network and also the separate network for each of the water energy and food sectors according to table 1 the densities of the water network in the sections of collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer are 99 70 34 and 2 11 percent respectively this indicates that the water network is more coherent in the collaboration section than in the other two sections the densities of the food network in the collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer sections are 100 67 19 and 2 83 percent respectively the densities of the energy sector in the sections of collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer are 100 79 29 and 2 22 percent respectively regarding the water sector the density of the collaboration section is higher than the other two sections in fact the actors have utilized almost all of their organizational capacities to establish relationships in the collaboration section although a positive effect of density has been observed on the actor networks and a high coherence will increase confidence and facilitate sharing information and resources and also raise the levels of participation and collaboration among the actors olsson et al 2004 bodin et al 2006 it does not necessarily mean that this impact will steadily increase excessive density in the network will lead to identical knowledge and information among the actors and will hence decrease the capacity to adapt to the changes in conditions moreover the actors will be less inclined to establish relationships with actors outside their own network who have different viewpoints and ideas if the density in their network is high this will reduce creativity and innovation bodin and norberg 2005 knowledge and information exchange and collaboration levels have higher densities than budget transfer in the three sectors of water energy and food in fact capital is in the hands of a limited number of actors in the budget transfer section so that a small number of actors will plan on how to transfer the budget according to bodin and crona 2009 decreases in network density will have a negative effect on the capacity for the participatory process among the sub groups this negative effect will disappear when the actors in the wfe sectors have suitable capacities and are also encouraged to establish relationships with the other actors the e i index of the water food and energy network is 0 452 0 768 and 0 351 respectively this indicates that in the wfe network the actors interact with the members of their own group and the relationships are homophilous kurian et al 2017 stated that the greater the coordination among the wfe sectors was the higher the expected density for the entire network would be however the densities of the wfe sectors at the three interaction levels knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration in the present study were higher than that in the entire nexus network that took into account the relationships among the three sectors and the interconnectedness among the actors in the entire nexus was lower than that in each sector this indicates that each sector in the wfe nexus acts alone in fact despite the interconnections among the wfe sectors the responsible institutions often work in isolation this will result in weak inter sectoral coordination and will lead to unstable security of the resources the clustering coefficient of the nexus network in the sectors of collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer are 1 289 1 239 and 0 319 respectively this indicates that the entire network is more clustered in the collaboration section than in the knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer sections 3 3 power levels of the actors in the nexus network as discussed earlier the centrality indices are employed in the network analysis model to assess the power of the actors the more powerful actors assume power based on their relationship received from or sent to other actors in the network and bring these other actors under their control figs 3 11 present the results of the in degree centrality and out degree centrality for knowledge and information exchange figs 3 5 budget transfer figs 6 8 and collaboration figs 9 11 links among the actors in the nexus network in the yazd ardakan plain in these figures the horizontal axis shows the in degree centrality and the vertical axis depicts the out degree centrality the size of the nodes indicates the betweenness centrality in figs 3 6 and 9 and the eigenvector centrality in figs 4 7 and 10 and the closeness centrality in figs 5 8 and 11 the type of nodes represents the area of activity of the actors in each of the water energy food nexus sectors drawing on these graphs we can say that the highest in degree centrality among the actors in the nexus network belongs to yazd agriculture jahad organization with an in degree centrality value of 86 in the knowledge and information exchange network yazd agricultural and natural resources research and education center and national salinity research center with an in degree centrality value of 6 in the budget transfer network and yazd provincial government with an in degree centrality value of 102 in the collaboration network an actor with a high in degree centrality is usually an actor with greater popularity than others who are approved by them moreover the highest out degree centrality in the three networks of knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration belongs to yazd provincial government with an out degree centrality of 79 ministry of agriculture jahad with an out degree centrality of 10 and yazd agriculture jahad organization with an out degree centrality of 111 respectively an actor with a high out degree centrality is usually a person that has greater influence and effectiveness than the others as shown in figs 6 8 the in degree and out degree centrality of a large number of actors are zero in the budget transfer section this means that the financial capital of the nexus network is not uniformly distributed across it and the financial budget is controlled by only a small number of actors these actors who are also from the public sector and at the national level make decisions on how to allocate financial capital among other public sector actors in the regional sector figs 3 6 and 9 present the results of betweenness centrality for the knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration links based on these figures we can say that yazd provincial government with a betweenness centrality of 367 8 and 341 3 in the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration networks respectively and iran water resource management company and yazd agriculture jahad organization with a betweenness centrality of 4 in the budget transfer sector have the highest betweenness centrality among the actors in the nexus network betweenness centrality shows the high controlling power of an organization in the nexus network that lies along the paths connecting other organizations in fact these actors play the role of connecting links between the three nexus sectors and have greater control over the resources inside the network therefore the information exchange budget transfer and collaboration processes in the network are greatly dependent on these actors the results related to the eigenvector centrality in the nexus network of the yazd ardakan plain for the three types of interaction knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration are presented in figs 4 7 and 10 yazd provincial government with an eigenvector centrality of 0 298 and 0 264 in the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration networks respectively and the ministry of agriculture jahad with an eigenvector centrality of 0 573 in the budget transfer network exhibited the highest eigenvector centrality in the nexus network therefore these actors have more connections with other actors who themselves possess high centrality levels figs 5 8 and 11 display the results of closeness centrality for the knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration links it is evident that yazd provincial government with a closeness centrality of 43 8 and 43 6 in the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration networks respectively and national salinity research center with a closeness centrality of 3 5 in the budget transfer sector have the highest betweenness centrality among the actors in the nexus network fig 12 depicts the model showing the geometric positions of the actors based on the in degree and out degree betweenness and eigenvector centrality for the knowledge and information interaction to understand the power levels in the nexus network more rapidly and more accurately in this figure the size of each node indicates the centrality of each actor accordingly the actors in the public sector at the regional level have higher centrality than the others organizations that are farther away from the network center have less power and influence and are the so called peripheral organizations in the network in the nexus network of yazd aquifer many of the ngos in the three sectors of water energy and food can be categorized among peripheral organizations 3 4 determination of the power of nexus actors regarding the sna of the actors in the nexus network the actors were ranked for each of the five centrality criteria at the three levels knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration interactions since each centrality criterion is unique and represents a part of the power of the actors in the network there are 15 criteria at three levels for selecting powerful actors therefore it is necessary to use an mcdm method to combine the criteria considering the ai index the electre i model was employed to rank the actors in the power network and to select the key actors criteria weights were calculated using the entropy method table 2 according to table 2 the betweenness centrality criteria at all three levels of knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration interactions received higher weights than the other three centrality criteria furthermore the weights assigned to centrality criteria in the budget transfer section were higher than that of the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration sections after the criteria were assigned with weights the decision matrix was created when the weighted normalized decision matrix was formed the set of criteria was divided into a concordant and a discordant subset the concordance and disconcordance matrices were then created the calculated concordance threshold and discordance threshold were 0 6736 and 0 5989 respectively taking the thresholds into consideration the concordance dominance matrix and the discordance dominance matrix were formed finally the final dominance matrix was obtained by multiplying the elements of the concordance dominance matrix by the discordance dominance matrix table a3 in the supplementary information file presents the ranking of the key actors based on the power criterion accordingly the 10 top actors based on power were yazd agriculture jahad organization yazd regional water company yazd regional electric company yazd county agriculture jahad management iran water resource management company yazd agricultural and natural resources research and education center department of natural resources and watershed management of yazd national salinity research center national water and wastewater engineering company and tavanir respectively regarding power determining which actors are in the position of power and how they will use their position of power will influence the participatory governance results if these actors are unwilling to participate the participatory process may come to an end the research findings show that the most powerful actors in the nexus system come from the public sector these actors serve as the connecting bridge in relation to the other stakeholders this shows the decisive role the government plays in managing a nexus network in fact the public sector will play a major role in making decisions and shaping ideas the considerable power of government organizations in nexus networks is suggestive of a top down approach to governance in which decisions are made behind closed doors and without the participation of the stakeholders applying a top down management approach by using concentrated government power leads to a one sided look at each of the water energy food sectors the participation of stakeholders has an important role in developing and implementing effective solutions for water challenges moreover respect for the priorities of the main stakeholders as compared to following theoretical and general ideals of organizations will result in better performance therefore the use of a bottom up approach in governance and the involvement of the stakeholders in the policymaking process will pave the way for the sustainable development of water governance we must move toward improving efficiency and downsizing the government so that the public sector can move away from the position of a decision maker to the position of a facilitator and connector of other stakeholders since most powerful actors in the present research were from the public sector the nexus network was very vulnerable to the exclusion of these powerful actors the government fliervoet et al 2016 in fact the focus on connections was based on the government if the government was omitted connections among the other actors in the network would diminish this would have a great impact on changing ideas and priorities moreover ngos which play the role of facilitators between the government and farmers received a low score in the research nexus network therefore their empowerment by increasing their relationship with other actors is necessary so that they can perform better in the participatory process of the nexus network the result of the study revealed that the proposed framework could be used to analyze the network of water food energy nexus at two levels of entire network and individual actors and select powerful and influential actors of water governance in the wfe nexus network in regions with arid climate and the same conditions as the yazd ardakan aquifer this enhances states to robust stakeholders actors participating in water governance enhancing the participation of stakeholders actors in water governance can lead to better water management in arid regions participation of actors in the decision making process creates a space in which the main causes of crisis can be identified and various ideas and suggestions can be considered to address the crisis moreover involving diverse stakeholders can increase public support reduce opposition and improve implementation of government policy fliervoet et al 2016 johnson and karlberg 2017 when actors are identified and ranked in terms of their influence new decisions will be made based on the engagement of the ranked actors and the weak actors will be empowered by improving their relationship with other actors and will contribute to decision making processes beside powerful actors and this will improve the policymaking process of water governance for example if the government proposes cultivation of low water crop to manage the water use in the agricultural sector the farmer may not easily abandon its previous cropping however if the influential and influenced actors in various sectors including farmers are identified and their opinions are regarded in decision making processes native plant species will be suggested and it will be consistent with the indigenous knowledge of people so it will be more likely to be welcomed among stakeholders 4 conclusion population and economic growth have increased demands for water food and energy resources the sustainable management of these resources will be made possible by considering the relationships among the three sectors the nexus approach will improve the security of resources bolster interests and alleviate conflicts in the three sectors by striking a balance between their goals interests and requirements this approach with the participation of the actors can consider the policies of various sectors in decision making this study used social network analysis to analyze the structure of actor networks in the wfe nexus three types of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were studied to analyze the actor networks the yazd ardakan plain was the ecological boundary and the active actors in the three sectors forming the network boundary as the contribution of the present study the multi criteria decision making method was proposed for the first time to determine the power rankings of social network analysis in the nexus network power evaluation in social networks was performed by using the in degree out degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality and the scores for every actor in each of the mentioned criteria were different from those of the other actors moreover the actors in each of the water food and energy sectors had various interactions transfer of knowledge capital collaboration etc with one another when the number of interactions taking place among actors is increased the criteria is also increased based on the type of interaction therefore it is possible to perform a more accurate analysis to select the powerful actors in the wfe nexus by combining the criteria indicating power with the social network analysis through a multi criteria decision making method the efficiency of this method will become apparent when we manage resources using the nexus approach in a nexus process the type of policies and their implementation is not dictated by one actor or by one sector rather all sectors have effective roles to play in the project strategy to prevent the transfer of problems from one sector to another the use of sna in combination with the electre i model can reduce the complexity of selecting key actors in water governance furthermore it can be used as a comprehensive and quantitative method to identify and select the powerful actors of water governance in the wfe nexus network since the increased collaboration and coordination among actors would be made possible by empowering weak actors with the help of the powerful ones the research findings can help managers and planners identify and analyze the power positions of the actors in the nexus network to implement participatory governance moreover ranking and analyzing the power of the actors in each of the water food and energy sectors can enable managers to define the general policies with the collaboration of the main stakeholders in each of the three sectors of the nexus and to steer the system towards collaboration and coordination with the help of power circles with a broader insight into the interests of the involved sectors in order to improve efficiency and decisions in the water sector its recommended the policies should steer it towards balance communications across the water governance network and government powerful actors should shift from the position of a decision maker to the position of a facilitator and connector of other stakeholders moreover the identified weak actors in terms of power should be empowered by improving their relationship with powerful actors and should be involved in the decision making process credit authorship contribution

5884,a major water governance concern is how to coordinate the complex relationships of the water food and energy sectors and the resulting economic social and environmental consequences focusing on the challenges in one sector e g water shortage in the water sector and making decisions without considering other sectors will not solve these problems rather it will create a new problem the decline of food production in the food sectors the nexus approach is a novel method to represent the interrelated challenges of the water food and energy sectors by considering the sectors policies to achieve sustainable development the present study analyzes the social network of nexus actors in the yazd ardakan aquifer yazd province iran for this purpose 54 partners in the nexus network were first identified in various public private semi private and non governmental organizations three types of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were analyzed among the actors the actor network was then assessed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors then a coherence analysis was performed by the density index at the entire network level and the power analysis was carried out using in degree out degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality indices at the individual actor level social network analysis criteria were then incorporated with the multi criteria decision making model electre i to select the key and powerful actors in the nexus network next the powerful actors were identified and introduced with respect to 15 criteria employed in the social network analysis according to the results the power structure in the nexus network of the research area is not at equilibrium most of the power lies with the public sector the water food and energy sectors act alone and they do not exploit their maximum organizational capacities to establish relationships with one another keywords actors power multi criteria decision making social network analysis water food energy nexus water governance 1 introduction nowadays besides technical solutions the social science perspective of the hydrology can improve water resources management the framework of this study is exemplified by analyzing the water food energy wfe network of the yazd ardakan aquifer the framework offers a method to analyze the connections of groundwater governance actors in the wfe nexus network and select the influential actors of groundwater governance this analysis and selection approach relates to the comprehensive interdisciplinary analysis of hydrological problems and the policy issue of water resources management 1 1 water resources issues it is generally believed that the current water crises have mainly resulted from inappropriate water governance folke et al 2005 pahl wostl 2009 especially in arid region yatsuka and shivakoti 2013 al zubari 2012 braune and adams 2013 and its largely related to its non participatory and top down approach in decision making processes many experts acknowledge that water governance should not be confined to government and other actors should also be involved so that their active and constructive presence can contribute to solving water resource issues fliervoet et al 2016 in other words the participation of local stakeholders in the management and utilization of water resources will lead to the optimal use and conservation of water resources banihabib and ghafoori 2016 moreover the water food and energy sectors affect water demand which is on the rise due to population and economic growth and urbanization expansion hoff 2011 a mere focus on the challenges of the water sector and decision making without considering other sectors i e food and energy will not solve the problem but it will create a new problem in the other sectors hoff 2011 halbe et al 2015 in order to solve problems in the water sector according to the relationship of the three sectors of water food and energy it is important to find a point of equilibrium of interest in the nexus network instead of attempting to maximize benefits this will be achieved by considering stakeholders interests ideas and suggestions in the nexus management thus it is important to identify the influential actors of the nexus because information exchange brings different ideas together and helps stakeholders identify collaborative solutions to improve water governance the nexus approach is a new method to represent the interconnected challenges of the wfe sectors considering the policies related to each sector with the purpose of achieving sustainable development stein et al 2011 2014 this approach is based on inter sectoral relationships to prevent the transmission of problems from one sector to another halbe et al 2015 the wfe nexus approach can improve the security of resources reduce inter sectoral conflicts and raise interests by increasing resource efficiency and political cohesion to achieve sustainable development this requires that stakeholders engage in dialogue and compromise on the conflicting goals to foster cooperation and settle conflicts the innate complexity of the wfe nexus approach and the mutual dependencies among this resources turn a participatory activity into a necessary part of the nexus approach johnson and karlberg 2017 a new feature of the nexus approach is that different sectors water food and energy are equally important and that there are numerous actors and stakeholders in each sector so that their goals and interests must be considered in decision making relying on the participation of all actors the nexus approach considers the policies of various sectors in decision making stein et al 2014 in the wfe sectors each actor has its own capabilities and capacities that dictate its roles kuzdas et al 2015 the role and position analysis of actors in a nexus network is the starting point for participatory governance success in participatory governance depends on identifying the actors and the analysis of their social processes crona and hubacek 2010 marín and berkes 2010 in other words without sufficient understanding of the actors and their interplay participatory governance will yield negative results grimble and wellard 1997 1 2 water food energy nexus and its actors a framework is necessary to analyze the actor network to improve inter sectoral cooperation the social network analysis sna is a tool proposed to analyze the relationships of actors and determine the key and effective actors moreover sna is more important when numerous actors want to manage natural resources more effectively bodin and crona 2009 in other words sna can determine which actor has greater power for direct decision making and affect policymaking mills et al 2014 weiss et al 2012 it provides a classification based on their positions within a network prell et al 2009 therefore sna has been employed in extensive studies to analyze actor networks for instance ding and liu 2011 studied the structure of a multi organizational network and the social relationships of actors in public projects in china based on social networks they investigated the general features of the network and individual actors affecting the strategies and finally analyzed the effects of stakeholders on the progress of the project according to the results sna led to a better understanding of the network by measuring the connections of various actors within the network sna was employed by stein et al 2011 to analyze the participatory social network among actors of water governance in mkindo watershed in tanzania they analyzed the effects of the social networks on the capacity of water governance in the watershed the results showed that social networks facilitated water resource management and made it more effective studies have also indicated that sna could be adopted in the analysis of the roles and positions of actors as for agricultural networks hauck et al 2016 employed sna to identify the stakeholders in bio farming management and decision making related to land use at the regional and local levels they demonstrated that sna provided policymakers in the agricultural sector with valuable information on the activities of organizations regarding natural resource management prell et al 2009 employed sna to identify the key and marginal stakeholders in england and showed that sna would prevent tensions and would lead to taking the interests of all stakeholders into consideration when there are a large number of actors participatory activity is affected by their relationships and the power balance in the network paletto et al 2016 considering the importance of nexus management in reducing tensions water governance practitioners have shown interest in the study of nexus actor networks in which the relationships of actors in the wfe sectors are regarded as an interconnected and integrated network therefore a wfe nexus network was analyzed and addressed in this study as a single network by addressing actors in the three sectors and their connections the actors in a social network have a clear goal to influence others so that they can achieve their goals the analysis of the power of actors provides a better understanding of their roles and influences in decision making processes and guarantees transparency and justice paletto et al 2012 2015 extensive research has focused on the power of actors in social networks for example kuzdas et al 2015 employed sna to analyze a water governance network in costa rica based on the type of social relationships among the actors in four sectors water supply delivery use and sewerage they studied several organizations and relationships network density and the centrality of each actor the findings led to the selection of the key actors in the four sectors for the participatory process in another study bojovic et al 2017 analyzed the relationships of the actors in a sector responsible for adaptation to climate change and for risk mitigation they used sna to investigate how the actors in the network interconnected with one another and the geometrical position of them they also analyzed the power levels of the actors by using centrality indices 1 3 previous studies on the methodology previous studies have only dealt with the analytical determination of the power levels of actors using power criteria in social networks however it is essential for policymakers to have actors ranked in terms of power in fact when actors are ranked in terms of their influence on water governance network weak and powerful actors are identified afterward the weak actors can be empowered by increasing their relationships with other actors thus they can contribute to the decision making process which will in turn improve the policymaking process of water governance consequently after the power structure is analyzed by sna and a large number of the sna criteria required to investigate the power structure and also a large number of actors in the wfe sectors are considered it is necessary to use a multi criteria decision making mcdm model to select the powerful actors various studies have exploited mcdm models for issues pertaining to water resources including planning water resources strategically in arid regions banihabib et al 2016 chitsaz and azarnivand 2017 sheikhipour et al 2018 providing sustainable development solutions to stabilize shrinking lakes banihabib et al 2015 zarghami 2011 and planning agricultural water demand banihabib and shabestari 2017a b orojloo et al 2018 however no mcdm models have yet been employed to select powerful actors in a nexus network we know that there are a large number of mcdm methods so it was necessary to pick a suitable one for selecting powerful actors in the present study three mcdm methods including saw topsis and electre 1 were chosen and the most efficient methods were evaluated by the ai index proposed by li 2007 the comparison of mcdm methods in water resources management has been subject to extensive research for instance chitsaz and banihabib 2015 compared mcdm models to prioritize flood risk management options in the gorganrood river and found the electre model a more suitable option compared to the others in another study banihabib et al 2017a b compared the saw and ahp compensatory mcdm methods with the non compensatory electre method to select strategies for coping with water scarcity to achieve sustainable development in shahrood the results revealed that the electre method was less sensitive to weight changes according to the previous studies and the calculated ai index the electre i model of mcdm was employed here to select the powerful actors in the wfe nexus the sna was employed in the present study to analyze the nexus actor network in the yazd ardakan aquifer central iran this analysis was performed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors at the entire network level network coherence was investigated to answer the question as to whether decision making was participatory in the wfe sectors at the level of individual actors it was intended to analyze and rank the power levels of actors the methodology of this study is based on identifying the influential actors and ranking them in terms of their power in order to involve them in decision making and policymaking of groundwater resources to improve groundwater governance megdal et al 2017 oecd 2011 chilton and smidt 2014 because groundwater governance is a framework in which groundwater resources are managed so if we improve water governance water management will be improved in addition the actors participation is a key component of good governance oecd 2011 in a participatory process it should also be studied which stakeholders should be involved in the governance process thus this study aimed to identify powerful actors in the nexus network as the first step in participatory governance identifying power circles in a nexus network provides planners with valuable information for coordinating and mobilizing the network by taking into account the status of the leaders and the stage of the participatory process moreover power analysis in a network and identification of the leadership situation in a system can enable researchers to empower weaker actors to increase their cooperation and collaboration for promoting network objectives in general this is the first time when the degree of coherence and power relationships in nexus actor networks is analyzed and regarded as a connected and integrated network the sna criteria were entered into the electre i mcdm model to integrate these two models in order to select the powerful actors in the wfe nexus the contributions of this study are 1 proposing a framework to analyze the relationships of groundwater governance actors in the water food energy wfe nexus network as a connected and integrated network and 2 proposing a method for selecting the powerful actors among groundwater governance actors in the wfe nexus 2 material and methodology one of the most important requirements for designing a nexus management system is to analyze the roles and positions of the individual actors of the wfe sectors sna was employed in this study to analyze the structure of a nexus actor network fig 1 shows the flowchart of the research steps accordingly the first step in conducting network analysis research was to determine the ecological and network boundaries in this study the yazd ardakan area was considered as the ecological boundary and the organizations related to the nexus management in the three sectors of water food energy constituted the network boundary after the actors were identified three types of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration formed the basis of the analysis the nexus actor network analysis was performed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors appropriate criteria were selected for the network analysis and the quantitative indices were determined for the evaluation of the criteria the collected data were analyzed by using ucinet 6 a widely used software package in social network data analysis moreover netdraw borgatti et al 2018 was employed to represent the geometrical position of the network and to draw the diagrams the criteria for analyzing power in the social network were integrated with the electre i model to select the powerful actors in the nexus network regarding the significance of the participation of the wfe actors in water governance the method of this study proposes an approach to analyzing the actors connection and selecting powerful actors which can lead to better participatory water governance in other words the proposed integration of sna and electre i offers an approach to simplifying the selection of effective wfe actors in participatory water governance 2 1 study area the yazd ardakan aquifer the research site of the study is a place whose the main stakeholders are in contact with each other the social network of the actors was formed as the starting point to analyze the network fig 2 displays the study area which is in siahkooh watershed nearly in the central part of iran lying between the longitudes 53 25 55 00 e and latitudes 31 56 32 45 n the total area of the basin is about 11 573 km2 5441 km2 of which is underlain by the aquifer and the rest is mountainous the average elevation of the study area is about 1565 m above sea level the yazd ardakan area is located within a desert so it has very little rainfall and is deprived of permanent rivers except for flood events due to the limited surface water resources nearly all the water that is used for drinking agriculture and industries is extracted from the groundwater resources recent decades have witnessed a growing pressure on groundwater resources emanating from the dry climate consecutive droughts population growth competition between the industrial and agricultural sectors for water consumption and mismanagement the long term hydrograph of the yazd ardakan aquifer 1974 2016 shows that the water table has declined at a rate of 0 43 m per year iran water resource management company 2016 given the continued drawdown in the groundwater level despite the bans on the utilization of the groundwater in the plain on the one hand and the pressure on the groundwater resources as the only source of water providing the required water on the other hand it is essential to use a participatory approach in the wfe nexus to manage the current water crisis in the study area 2 2 identification of the actor network this step addresses the relationships among stakeholders in each sector of the wfe nexus this is very important because the involvement of all actors is a vital step to ensure that interests experiences and information of all the stakeholders are taken into account in the nexus management in fact the actors are the main source of information for analyzing the wfe nexus fig a1 in supplementary information file depicts the conceptual social network model of the actors in the nexus of wfe sectors in the aquifer the initial list of the related influential and influenced actors in the three wfe sectors of the yazd ardakan plain was prepared from the various public and private organizations ngos academic communities and research institutes through identifying the organizations involved in the three sectors by interviewing the individuals in charge at these agencies 2 3 types of relationships among actors after an initial list of the actors was prepared a questionnaire was developed with respect to the types of interactions among the organizations identified in the list and visits were made to relevant organizations to hold 45 minute interviews with the representatives of each organization the interviewees were asked to specify the types and frequency annual seasonal monthly or weekly of interactions they had with each listed organization including knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration the data on the interaction frequency were classified on a time spectrum annual seasonal monthly and weekly in the order of low medium high and very high intensity interactions the qualitative data on interaction frequency were quantified and ranked from 1 to 4 based on a spectrum ranging from low to very high moreover the three interaction matrices of knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were generated 2 4 analysis of the nexus network by sna sna provides a tool to investigate the relationships of actors it consists of a set of nodes actors and ties relationships between actors sometimes the relationships in networks are represented by undirected ties these ties merely indicate whether there is a relationship between two nodes in directed networks relationships between nodes are represented by ties exiting from one node and pointing to another node ding and liu 2011 directed ties in a network indicate information flow from one actor to another when two actors select each other they share a directed relationship that is called a bilateral or mutual relationship fig a2 in supplementary information file shows an example of directed and undirected graphs in the present research the relationships of actors were considered bilateral because the studied interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were reciprocal the two criteria of power and coherence were integrated to describe the actor network and how they were interconnected 2 5 degree of coherence in the nexus network at the level of the entire network since the structural patterns of the relationships in the social networks have a significant impact on the performance of the actors in the sectors it is important to determine which wfe sector is more strongly connected to the other two sectors and how coherent the nexus network is the coherence criterion represents the level of integration in the nexus network or shows which sector acts alone without paying attention to others in fact coherence is related to relationships that bring the actors of a group together the stronger the interconnections between the nexus networks are the higher the governance efficiency in the wfe sectors will be scholz et al 2008 analysis of the coherence criterion at the network level answers the question as to whether the nexus network in the study area works in the form of separate sectors or whether all the sectors take advantage of their entire organizational capacities to promote the goals density is a measure of a general group s cohesion stein et al 2011 so the density of a network provides a measure of its connectivity and more connectivity shows more cohesion at the network level the density index is employed to study the network coherence the density index is defined in eq 1 1 γ n r n p where γ represents density nr is the number of relationships that exist among the actors and np denotes the number of possible relationships the closer this index gets to 1 the more connected the network is and hence the greater its effectiveness will be the nearer the index gets to 0 the less connected the actors are and hence the sectors work in isolation higher density in the network signifies higher coherence in it because higher coherence increases confidence and facilitates the sharing of information and resources it also improves collaboration and cooperation among the actors higher network densities enhance links improve network coherence and access of individuals to each other and their coordination and promote the possibility of social control to explore the interaction between the food and water network compared to the interactions among themselves the concept of homophily was surveyed homophily refers to a situation where similar actors are attracted to one another and thus choose to interact with each other actors who are similar to one another are better able to communicate with each other but a successful system requires different views and ideas we used the e i external internal index to measure homophily among the groups ogada et al 2017 the e i index is important in calculating the relationship between members of a given group and the amount of interaction that one has with stakeholders external and internal to one s group a score of 1 0 for the e i index means that a stakeholder interacts only with members of its own group thus indicating homophilous relationships on the other hand an index of 1 0 shows that a stakeholder interacts with others external to one s own group which translates to heterophilous ties ogada et al 2017 for a deeper understanding of nexus networks the global clustering coefficient was calculated for the nexus network at three levels of interaction knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration the clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together the clustering coefficient of an actor is the density of its open neighborhood the overall clustering coefficient is the mean of the clustering coefficients of all actors 2 6 the power of nexus actors when the number of actors increases in a decision making process participatory activity is affected by the relationships of actors and the power balance in the network the power that an actor has in the wfe sector can play a decisive role in promoting the policies and plans of the related sector in fact power is one of the main components of social structures that can be defined based on the situation status and connections of an individual inside the network in a network an actor with greater power is more likely to influence the other actors in an attempt to receive a greater share of funds and have greater access to information and opportunities therefore a more powerful actor can influence the priority of selecting the desired option in a decision making process consequently at the level of individual actors the analysis of the power criterion provides researchers policymakers and planners with valuable information to select the key actors to establish participatory management systems in the nexus sectors many studies have revealed a positive relationship between centrality in network and power brass 1984 krackhardt 1990 since higher centrality implies more power ding and liu 2011 centrality indices are a proper tool to represent the power position of actors hansen et al 2010 in this study the centrality indices of degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector were employed to analyze power at the level of individual actors the degree centrality index is defined as the number of actors that are directly connected to one actor in fact the actor who has a higher degree centrality can assume the leadership role degree centrality of actor k represented by cd pk is calculated by eq 2 as shown below 2 c d p k i 1 n a p i p k where n is the number of actors in the network and α pi pk is 1 if the two actors pi and pk are connected and otherwise it is 0 this centrality has one type in undirected graphs and two types in directed graphs in degree centrality and out degree centrality hanneman 2001 since the connections among actors in the present research are considered bilateral the degree centrality is divided into in degree centrality and out degree centrality the in degree centrality refers to the number of incoming connections from other actors and the out degree centrality is the number of outgoing connections from an actor a high in degree centrality indicates the popularity of the node and a high out degree centrality implies the greater influence and effectiveness of the actor uddin et al 2017 betweenness centrality quantifies how many times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between the two other nodes using this index one can identify the organizations that can play the role of a connector between separate sectors the betweenness index for actor k cb pk is calculated by eq 3 3 c b p k i j n g ij p k g ij i j k where gij is the shortest path connecting pi and pj and gij pk denotes the shortest path connecting pi and pj that passes through pk that node has the highest betweenness centrality that lies between many other pairs of nodes the paths between which pass through it hanneman 2001 closeness centrality indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the network closeness determines the actors that have the shortest path to be connected with all of the other actors eigenvector centrality is considered one of the centrality indices it draws on the idea that the centrality of a specific actor cannot be estimated in isolation from the centrality of other actors connected to it the actor that possesses the highest eigenvector centrality has many central neighbors brandes 2005 in other words from the perspective of eigenvector centrality a central actor is one who is connected to other actors with high centrality levels therefore eigenvector centrality is the sum of connections between one actor and other actors and it is determined by the centrality of the other actors eigenvector centrality thus provides a broader understanding of the network it is not easy to analyze the power of actors in a social network borgatti 2003 each of these five centrality indices in degree and out degree centrality betweenness centrality closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality is unique and indicates a single part of the power degree centrality in degree and out degree is a suitable index for representing the abilities of an actor in establishing direct connections with other actors in the network betweenness centrality shows the ability to connect separate groups to each other and control information flow resources and actors inside the network actors with the highest closeness centrality are the most accessible nodes in the network eigenvector centrality well demonstrates the connection that exists between one actor and the powerful actors in a network the actor who is in any of these positions is capable of acting the overall network flow and in a way possesses a part of the power 2 7 ranking the power of the actors in the nexus network since there are five centrality criteria in degree centrality out degree centrality betweenness centrality closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality at three interaction levels knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration we were faced with a large number of criteria and actors in the network power analysis for selecting powerful actors thus at this stage an mcdm model was employed to select the key actors it was essential to employ a correct mcdm technique to rank the power of the actors the three methods of saw topsis and electre i were applied and the most efficient ranking method was selected using the ai index according to what proposed by li 2007 according to the computed ai index electre i was selected supplementary information file table a1 the electre i method is a version of the electre method with the difference being that the latter uses a non compensatory mcdm concept in decision making this means that exchanges between criteria are not permitted so that a weakness in one criterion is not offset by the strength of another criterion pourjavad and shirouyezad 2011 rogers et al 2000 roy 1968 1991 the electre method has its own advantages and disadvantages its major advantage is that it takes into account uncertainty and vagueness velasquez and hester 2013 the interviewees in each of the water food and energy sectors may not have sufficient knowledge about the interaction with other sectors so epistemic uncertainty uncertainty as a result of the imperfect knowledge of decision makers about the natural system itself may occur when filling out the questionnaire therefore the present study used the electre method due to its capability to address epistemic uncertainty mosadeghi 2013 the disadvantages of employing electre techniques is that outrank causes the strengths and weaknesses of the alternatives not to be directly identified velasquez and hester 2013 in studies to select powerful actors in a nexus network only ranking is important and no matter how much the actors are superior to each other thus this disadvantage would not impact the outcome of this study a decision matrix is first created to select the key actors using the electre i method according to equation 4 roy and vincke 1981 4 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x mn where xij is the performance of the ith option i 1 2 m to the criterion j j 1 2 n in the present research 54 actors were identified in the nexus sector as options and the criteria included in degree centrality out degree centrality betweenness centrality closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality at three levels of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration after the decision matrix was determined and non dimensionalized weights were assigned to the social network criteria using the entropy method based on this method introduced by shannon and weaver in 1947 entropy expresses the degree of uncertainty in a continuous probability distribution the main idea in this method is that a criterion becomes more important when its values are more dispersed after weight assignment to the criteria a weighted normalized decision matrix was created and the criteria set j 1 2 m was divided into a concordant and a discordant subset for each pair of options k and e k e 1 2 m k e following the formation of the concordant and discordant subsets the concordance matrix and the discordance matrix were created a concordance matrix is a square matrix whose dimension is the number of options and each of its elements is called an index of concordance between two options the value of this index was obtained by summing up the weights of the criteria that existed in the concordant subsets a discordance matrix is also a square matrix whose dimension is the number of options and each of its elements is called an index of discordance between two options at the next step the concordance threshold c was calculated by averaging the concordance criteria and the discordance threshold d was calculated by averaging the discordant criteria after the concordance dominance matrix f and the discordance dominance matrices g were calculated the final dominance matrix h was obtained through multiplying each element in the concordance dominance matrix f by the discordance dominance matrix g roy 1991 the final dominance matrix h expresses the partial preferences of the options 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of nexus actors fifty four actors were identified in the wfe nexus network in the studied area they were divided into four active groups in the water sector the food sector the energy sector and all the three sectors accordingly there were 15 actors in the food sector 9 in the energy sector 13 in the water sector and 17 actors that acted in all three sectors table a2 in supplementary information file shows these actors and their areas of activities 3 2 degree of coherence of the nexus network table 1 presents the density of the entire nexus network and also the separate network for each of the water energy and food sectors according to table 1 the densities of the water network in the sections of collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer are 99 70 34 and 2 11 percent respectively this indicates that the water network is more coherent in the collaboration section than in the other two sections the densities of the food network in the collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer sections are 100 67 19 and 2 83 percent respectively the densities of the energy sector in the sections of collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer are 100 79 29 and 2 22 percent respectively regarding the water sector the density of the collaboration section is higher than the other two sections in fact the actors have utilized almost all of their organizational capacities to establish relationships in the collaboration section although a positive effect of density has been observed on the actor networks and a high coherence will increase confidence and facilitate sharing information and resources and also raise the levels of participation and collaboration among the actors olsson et al 2004 bodin et al 2006 it does not necessarily mean that this impact will steadily increase excessive density in the network will lead to identical knowledge and information among the actors and will hence decrease the capacity to adapt to the changes in conditions moreover the actors will be less inclined to establish relationships with actors outside their own network who have different viewpoints and ideas if the density in their network is high this will reduce creativity and innovation bodin and norberg 2005 knowledge and information exchange and collaboration levels have higher densities than budget transfer in the three sectors of water energy and food in fact capital is in the hands of a limited number of actors in the budget transfer section so that a small number of actors will plan on how to transfer the budget according to bodin and crona 2009 decreases in network density will have a negative effect on the capacity for the participatory process among the sub groups this negative effect will disappear when the actors in the wfe sectors have suitable capacities and are also encouraged to establish relationships with the other actors the e i index of the water food and energy network is 0 452 0 768 and 0 351 respectively this indicates that in the wfe network the actors interact with the members of their own group and the relationships are homophilous kurian et al 2017 stated that the greater the coordination among the wfe sectors was the higher the expected density for the entire network would be however the densities of the wfe sectors at the three interaction levels knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration in the present study were higher than that in the entire nexus network that took into account the relationships among the three sectors and the interconnectedness among the actors in the entire nexus was lower than that in each sector this indicates that each sector in the wfe nexus acts alone in fact despite the interconnections among the wfe sectors the responsible institutions often work in isolation this will result in weak inter sectoral coordination and will lead to unstable security of the resources the clustering coefficient of the nexus network in the sectors of collaboration knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer are 1 289 1 239 and 0 319 respectively this indicates that the entire network is more clustered in the collaboration section than in the knowledge and information exchange and budget transfer sections 3 3 power levels of the actors in the nexus network as discussed earlier the centrality indices are employed in the network analysis model to assess the power of the actors the more powerful actors assume power based on their relationship received from or sent to other actors in the network and bring these other actors under their control figs 3 11 present the results of the in degree centrality and out degree centrality for knowledge and information exchange figs 3 5 budget transfer figs 6 8 and collaboration figs 9 11 links among the actors in the nexus network in the yazd ardakan plain in these figures the horizontal axis shows the in degree centrality and the vertical axis depicts the out degree centrality the size of the nodes indicates the betweenness centrality in figs 3 6 and 9 and the eigenvector centrality in figs 4 7 and 10 and the closeness centrality in figs 5 8 and 11 the type of nodes represents the area of activity of the actors in each of the water energy food nexus sectors drawing on these graphs we can say that the highest in degree centrality among the actors in the nexus network belongs to yazd agriculture jahad organization with an in degree centrality value of 86 in the knowledge and information exchange network yazd agricultural and natural resources research and education center and national salinity research center with an in degree centrality value of 6 in the budget transfer network and yazd provincial government with an in degree centrality value of 102 in the collaboration network an actor with a high in degree centrality is usually an actor with greater popularity than others who are approved by them moreover the highest out degree centrality in the three networks of knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration belongs to yazd provincial government with an out degree centrality of 79 ministry of agriculture jahad with an out degree centrality of 10 and yazd agriculture jahad organization with an out degree centrality of 111 respectively an actor with a high out degree centrality is usually a person that has greater influence and effectiveness than the others as shown in figs 6 8 the in degree and out degree centrality of a large number of actors are zero in the budget transfer section this means that the financial capital of the nexus network is not uniformly distributed across it and the financial budget is controlled by only a small number of actors these actors who are also from the public sector and at the national level make decisions on how to allocate financial capital among other public sector actors in the regional sector figs 3 6 and 9 present the results of betweenness centrality for the knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration links based on these figures we can say that yazd provincial government with a betweenness centrality of 367 8 and 341 3 in the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration networks respectively and iran water resource management company and yazd agriculture jahad organization with a betweenness centrality of 4 in the budget transfer sector have the highest betweenness centrality among the actors in the nexus network betweenness centrality shows the high controlling power of an organization in the nexus network that lies along the paths connecting other organizations in fact these actors play the role of connecting links between the three nexus sectors and have greater control over the resources inside the network therefore the information exchange budget transfer and collaboration processes in the network are greatly dependent on these actors the results related to the eigenvector centrality in the nexus network of the yazd ardakan plain for the three types of interaction knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration are presented in figs 4 7 and 10 yazd provincial government with an eigenvector centrality of 0 298 and 0 264 in the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration networks respectively and the ministry of agriculture jahad with an eigenvector centrality of 0 573 in the budget transfer network exhibited the highest eigenvector centrality in the nexus network therefore these actors have more connections with other actors who themselves possess high centrality levels figs 5 8 and 11 display the results of closeness centrality for the knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration links it is evident that yazd provincial government with a closeness centrality of 43 8 and 43 6 in the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration networks respectively and national salinity research center with a closeness centrality of 3 5 in the budget transfer sector have the highest betweenness centrality among the actors in the nexus network fig 12 depicts the model showing the geometric positions of the actors based on the in degree and out degree betweenness and eigenvector centrality for the knowledge and information interaction to understand the power levels in the nexus network more rapidly and more accurately in this figure the size of each node indicates the centrality of each actor accordingly the actors in the public sector at the regional level have higher centrality than the others organizations that are farther away from the network center have less power and influence and are the so called peripheral organizations in the network in the nexus network of yazd aquifer many of the ngos in the three sectors of water energy and food can be categorized among peripheral organizations 3 4 determination of the power of nexus actors regarding the sna of the actors in the nexus network the actors were ranked for each of the five centrality criteria at the three levels knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration interactions since each centrality criterion is unique and represents a part of the power of the actors in the network there are 15 criteria at three levels for selecting powerful actors therefore it is necessary to use an mcdm method to combine the criteria considering the ai index the electre i model was employed to rank the actors in the power network and to select the key actors criteria weights were calculated using the entropy method table 2 according to table 2 the betweenness centrality criteria at all three levels of knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration interactions received higher weights than the other three centrality criteria furthermore the weights assigned to centrality criteria in the budget transfer section were higher than that of the knowledge and information exchange and collaboration sections after the criteria were assigned with weights the decision matrix was created when the weighted normalized decision matrix was formed the set of criteria was divided into a concordant and a discordant subset the concordance and disconcordance matrices were then created the calculated concordance threshold and discordance threshold were 0 6736 and 0 5989 respectively taking the thresholds into consideration the concordance dominance matrix and the discordance dominance matrix were formed finally the final dominance matrix was obtained by multiplying the elements of the concordance dominance matrix by the discordance dominance matrix table a3 in the supplementary information file presents the ranking of the key actors based on the power criterion accordingly the 10 top actors based on power were yazd agriculture jahad organization yazd regional water company yazd regional electric company yazd county agriculture jahad management iran water resource management company yazd agricultural and natural resources research and education center department of natural resources and watershed management of yazd national salinity research center national water and wastewater engineering company and tavanir respectively regarding power determining which actors are in the position of power and how they will use their position of power will influence the participatory governance results if these actors are unwilling to participate the participatory process may come to an end the research findings show that the most powerful actors in the nexus system come from the public sector these actors serve as the connecting bridge in relation to the other stakeholders this shows the decisive role the government plays in managing a nexus network in fact the public sector will play a major role in making decisions and shaping ideas the considerable power of government organizations in nexus networks is suggestive of a top down approach to governance in which decisions are made behind closed doors and without the participation of the stakeholders applying a top down management approach by using concentrated government power leads to a one sided look at each of the water energy food sectors the participation of stakeholders has an important role in developing and implementing effective solutions for water challenges moreover respect for the priorities of the main stakeholders as compared to following theoretical and general ideals of organizations will result in better performance therefore the use of a bottom up approach in governance and the involvement of the stakeholders in the policymaking process will pave the way for the sustainable development of water governance we must move toward improving efficiency and downsizing the government so that the public sector can move away from the position of a decision maker to the position of a facilitator and connector of other stakeholders since most powerful actors in the present research were from the public sector the nexus network was very vulnerable to the exclusion of these powerful actors the government fliervoet et al 2016 in fact the focus on connections was based on the government if the government was omitted connections among the other actors in the network would diminish this would have a great impact on changing ideas and priorities moreover ngos which play the role of facilitators between the government and farmers received a low score in the research nexus network therefore their empowerment by increasing their relationship with other actors is necessary so that they can perform better in the participatory process of the nexus network the result of the study revealed that the proposed framework could be used to analyze the network of water food energy nexus at two levels of entire network and individual actors and select powerful and influential actors of water governance in the wfe nexus network in regions with arid climate and the same conditions as the yazd ardakan aquifer this enhances states to robust stakeholders actors participating in water governance enhancing the participation of stakeholders actors in water governance can lead to better water management in arid regions participation of actors in the decision making process creates a space in which the main causes of crisis can be identified and various ideas and suggestions can be considered to address the crisis moreover involving diverse stakeholders can increase public support reduce opposition and improve implementation of government policy fliervoet et al 2016 johnson and karlberg 2017 when actors are identified and ranked in terms of their influence new decisions will be made based on the engagement of the ranked actors and the weak actors will be empowered by improving their relationship with other actors and will contribute to decision making processes beside powerful actors and this will improve the policymaking process of water governance for example if the government proposes cultivation of low water crop to manage the water use in the agricultural sector the farmer may not easily abandon its previous cropping however if the influential and influenced actors in various sectors including farmers are identified and their opinions are regarded in decision making processes native plant species will be suggested and it will be consistent with the indigenous knowledge of people so it will be more likely to be welcomed among stakeholders 4 conclusion population and economic growth have increased demands for water food and energy resources the sustainable management of these resources will be made possible by considering the relationships among the three sectors the nexus approach will improve the security of resources bolster interests and alleviate conflicts in the three sectors by striking a balance between their goals interests and requirements this approach with the participation of the actors can consider the policies of various sectors in decision making this study used social network analysis to analyze the structure of actor networks in the wfe nexus three types of interactions knowledge and information exchange budget transfer and collaboration were studied to analyze the actor networks the yazd ardakan plain was the ecological boundary and the active actors in the three sectors forming the network boundary as the contribution of the present study the multi criteria decision making method was proposed for the first time to determine the power rankings of social network analysis in the nexus network power evaluation in social networks was performed by using the in degree out degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality and the scores for every actor in each of the mentioned criteria were different from those of the other actors moreover the actors in each of the water food and energy sectors had various interactions transfer of knowledge capital collaboration etc with one another when the number of interactions taking place among actors is increased the criteria is also increased based on the type of interaction therefore it is possible to perform a more accurate analysis to select the powerful actors in the wfe nexus by combining the criteria indicating power with the social network analysis through a multi criteria decision making method the efficiency of this method will become apparent when we manage resources using the nexus approach in a nexus process the type of policies and their implementation is not dictated by one actor or by one sector rather all sectors have effective roles to play in the project strategy to prevent the transfer of problems from one sector to another the use of sna in combination with the electre i model can reduce the complexity of selecting key actors in water governance furthermore it can be used as a comprehensive and quantitative method to identify and select the powerful actors of water governance in the wfe nexus network since the increased collaboration and coordination among actors would be made possible by empowering weak actors with the help of the powerful ones the research findings can help managers and planners identify and analyze the power positions of the actors in the nexus network to implement participatory governance moreover ranking and analyzing the power of the actors in each of the water food and energy sectors can enable managers to define the general policies with the collaboration of the main stakeholders in each of the three sectors of the nexus and to steer the system towards collaboration and coordination with the help of power circles with a broader insight into the interests of the involved sectors in order to improve efficiency and decisions in the water sector its recommended the policies should steer it towards balance communications across the water governance network and government powerful actors should shift from the position of a decision maker to the position of a facilitator and connector of other stakeholders moreover the identified weak actors in terms of power should be empowered by improving their relationship with powerful actors and should be involved in the decision making process credit authorship contribution
