22050,cross flow hydrokinetic turbines have been considered a decent choice for riverine applications under the present work performance of hybrid rotor cross flow hydrokinetic has been investigated for different rotor parameters the proposed hybrid rotor is the combination of two conventional turbine rotors savonius and darrieus investigations have been performed by considering flow velocity varying in the range from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s the performance of hybrid rotor was assessed in term of power coefficient c p and torque coefficient c t further comparison of hybrid rotor and single darrieus rotor has been carried out on the basis of their performance flow behaviour across the turbine vicinity is analyzed and discussed with the pressure velocity contours and velocity streamlines it has been found that radius ratio and attachment angle play a crucial role in performance enhancement with reduction in torque fluctuations for the considered range of rotor parameters the maximum power coefficient c pmax and average torque coefficient c tavg were obtained as 0 109 and 0 1276 corresponding to radius ratio of 0 6 at an attachment angle of 90 further power coefficient and torque

ke kinetic energy tsr tip speed ratio 1 introduction hydrokinetic energy can be harnessed from different sources of flowing water having a velocity range varying from 0 5 m s to 2 5 m s depending on the technology approach johnson and pride 2010 this technology converts the kinetic energy of the water into the useful form of energy similar to wind technology the conversion of hydrokinetic energy is constrained as per the betz limit which establishes the maximum performance as 59 3 and can be achieved with ideal operating conditions war 2007 from practical point of view betz limit is unachievable except under higher blockage conditions vennell 2013 hydrokinetic turbines are categorized based on the rotor shaft axis orientation with respect to the water flow direction as i axial flow hydrokinetic turbine ii cross flow hydrokinetic turbine kumar and saini 2016 axial flow hydrokinetic turbines are usually arranged along the water flow direction and shaft orientation requires a larger water depth further axial flow turbines are easily clogged with debris and require one dimensional 1d flow it is suggested by investigators that the axial flow turbines are more suitable to harness the hydrokinetic energy in marine and ocean applications anyi and kirke 2015 2010 the direction of incoming water flow is orthogonal to the shaft of the cross flow turbine the cylindrical shape of these turbine rotors allows stacking in high depth applications and in case of shallow depth a single rotor can be arranged to tap the hydrokinetic power georgescu et al 2008 cross flow turbine has low power coefficient compared to the axial flow turbine however these turbines can make up the power loss in a farm arrangement hall 2012 further vertical axis cross flow hydrokinetic turbines are suitable for riverine systems i e irrigation canals power channel and rivers sood and singal 2019 for a limited water flow rate the vertical axis turbine is a decent choice güney and kaygusuz 2010 vertical axis turbine can be installed either as a single unit or in farm application khan et al 2010 darrieus and savonius are common rotors for vertical axis cross flow hydrokinetic turbines darrieus rotor is an efficient rotor and rotates at higher rpm but suffers the problem of self starting arab et al 2017 batista et al 2015 bhuyan and biswas 2014 rossetti and pavesi 2013 singh et al 2015 torabi mahdi et al 2016 on the other hand the savonius rotor has good starting ability but this rotor suffers the problem of low performance and speed rpm kumar et al 2018 kumar and saini 2015 most of the hydrokinetic potential sites are in remote and hilly areas where operation of turbine is tedius task the self starting and efficiency are the main concern in order to overcome there problem hybrid rotor consisting of darrieus rotor and savonius rotor was designed and investigated saini and saini 2019 2019 the hybrid rotor has moderate efficiency with good self starting characteristics further the installation and operation costs of the hybrid turbine are similar to darrieus and savonius rotor turbine saini and saini 2018 the performance of the hybrid rotor can be enhanced by improving system parameters various system parameters of hybrid rotors are suggested for better efficiency with self starting characteristics these system parameters of hybrid rotors should be designed carefully to reduce the distortion of the flow field in this way a simple darrieus rotor airfoil was modified in a j shape to improve the drag force generation the study reported a significant increase in starting torque of darrieus rotor due to reduction in flow separation vortices zamani et al 2016 the flow behaviour across the hybrid turbine rotor was observed by ghosh et al 2015 and it was reported that the coanda effect or vortices formation migrates downstream of the turbine rotor which results in a better power coefficient further the velocity deficit downstream of the savonius rotor helps the darrieus part of the hybrid rotor to extract more kinetic energy inclusion of a savonius rotor in single darrieus rotor aid to improve the drag force generation and hence the self starting phenomena at low tsr values kyozuka 2008 however during fast rotation of the turbine the savonius rotor tends to retard the rotation of the hybrid rotor gavalda et al 1990 a control mechanism is required to allow the savonius rotor to rotate at lower rpm and progressively cut off the savonius rotation as the rotor attains a prefixed value of tsr the system parameters of the hybrid wind rotor are analyzed by various investigators wakui et al 2005 experimentally evaluated the two different hybrid configurations type a and type b with radius ratio as the system parameter and it was reported that a radius ratio of 0 3 is optimum for the type a rotor beyond this value of the radius ratio the savonius part of the hybrid rotor tends to retard the rotation similarly a radius ratio of 0 38 is found to be optimum for type b rotor configuration fig 1 liang et al 2017 numerically investigated the radius ratio and attachment angle for a two bladed wind hybrid rotor to improve the power coefficient and starting behaviour of the hybrid wind turbine rotor the study revealed that a radius ratio of 0 25 yields the maximum performance of 0 363 at a 0 attachment angle the relative arm length and position of savonius and darrieus play a critical role in the design of the hybrid rotor the effects of relative arm length and attachment angle are studied on a hybrid rotor having three straight blades of darrieus rotor and two semi elliptic savonius rotor sahim et al 2013 it was reported that the turbine rotor with the relative length l h r as 0 36 and 60 angle position β had better performance fig 2 further it was observed that the hybrid rotor yields better performance when the savonius rotor is close to the turbine shaft and the arms of both the rotors are not co axial the modification in the outer fluid flow structure was investigated by sahim et al 2014 and it was reported that placement of a deflector plate upstream of the returning side blade of savonius rotor results in a significant increase in torque and power coefficient of the hybrid rotor most of the aforementioned literature review either focused on the modification in existing darrieus rotor to develop a hybrid rotor or on the system parameters of the hybrid rotor with air as the working fluid wind technology however the behaviour of the hybrid rotor is different in dissimilar working fluids this is due to the fact that a hydrokinetic turbine has a limited bounded flow area working domain while the wind turbine assumes an infinite area daskiran et al 2016 research on the system parameters on hybrid rotor for hydrokinetic turbine is found to be insufficient in order to find the system parameter for better performance power coefficient and self starting ability of hybrid rotor there is a need to investigate the placement parameters of individual rotor in hybrid hydrokinetic turbine further the available literature addresses the various configuration on the hybrid hydrokinetic rotor the hybrid configuration having savonius rotor inside the darrieus rotor has shown better performance and was suggested by various investigators bhuyan and biswas 2014 gavalda et al 1990 saini and saini 2018a 2018b n d hence there is a need to systematically design the size and placement orientation of the savonius rotor inside the darrieus rotor under the present study two dimensionless parameters are selected for the size and relative placement of the rotors the size of the savonius rotor is defined by a dimensionless parameter called radius ratio m while the relative placement orientation of the rotors is represented by an angle between the arm of darrieus and savonius rotor known as attachment angle the attachment angle defines the relative orientation of savonius rotor with respect to darrieus rotor and the orientation of darrieus rotor with respect to savonius rotor the radius ratio m is the ratio of the radius of the savonius rotor r s to the radius of darrieus rotor r d on the other hand the attachment angle for the present study is measured from the reference x y planes fig 3 the radius ratio m is expressed as 1 radius ratio m savonius rotor radius darrieus rotor radius in order to investigate the effects of the radius ratio and the attachment angle on the performance of the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor unsteady numerical simulations were performed therefore the present study is carried out with the objectives i to study the effects of the radius ratio on the performance of the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor ii to study the effects of the attachment angle on the power coefficient c p and the starting characteristics of the turbine rotor and iii to visualize the flow behaviour across the flow domain with velocity and pressure distributions contours the present study was carried out by considering the flow velocity in an open channel varying in the range from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s commercially available software ansys v 18 1 is used to simulate the considered flow domain along with cfx solver the above mentioned objective was met by adopting the methodology given in a flow chart as shown in fig 4 the present investigations on rotor parameters are the extension of the ref saini and saini 2018 to find the best values of radius ratio m and attachment angle ө previously these parameters were investigated for a hybrid rotor having two blades for darrieus and two blades for savonius rotor and by adopting 2d computational domain however the present study incorporates the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine with three blades in darrieus rotor and two blades in savonius rotor in a 3d computational domain firstly radius ratio of the hybrid rotor is varied for a fixed value of attachment angle and the simulations were performed for the considered range of radius ratio by having the best value of radius ratio attachment angle was varied to find the placement orientation of the savonius rotor inside the hybrid rotor or darrieus rotor with respect to the savonius rotor the main objective of this investigation is to find the best values of hybrid rotor system parameters for the whole analysis simulations were carried out at different value of tsr for the considered range of flow velocity 2 system parameters investigated for hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor the present numerical study considered two geometrical system parameters of hybrid cross flow hydrokinetic turbine namely radius ratio m and attachment angle ө which are represented by the schematic shown in fig 3 and the details of the rotor are given in table 1 the blades of the darrieus rotor are of airfoil shaped and having the profile as s 1046 which is found to have better performance among existing category of airfoil family mohamed 2012 the blades of the darrieus rotor are considered in straight shape due to good aerodynamics performance over twisted blades gorle et al 2016 kamoji et al 2009 rossetti and pavesi 2013 singh et al 2015 torabi mahdi et al 2016 three airfoil shaped blades were considered for darrieus part in hybrid rotor mousavi et al 2013 the aspect ratio of the rotor was considered as 0 9 based on earlier studies li et al 2017 zanforlin and deluca 2018 to find the best value of radius ratio and attachment angle various possible combinations of the parameters have opted as shown in fig 5 the cylindrical rotating domain was modelled around the turbine blades to provide the desired angular velocity to rotor it has been reported in literature that the size of rotating domain influence the performance of the turbine which is the function of turbine diameter the dimensions of the rotating domain vary in the range of 1 25d to 2d where d is the turbine rotor diameter balduzzi et al 2016 ghosh et al 2015 kumar and saini 2017a marsh et al 2015 large rotating domain size will increase the requirement computational capacity due to computational constraints the size of the rotating domain is considered as 1 3d balduzzi et al 2016 the stationary or outer domain was modelled to consider the inlet outlet wall and free surface of flowing water in channel the dimensions of the outer domain were considered as 0 7 m width 0 3 m height 4 0 m length based on the rotor and channel dimensions accordingly blockage ratio was maintained as 13 33 for computation analysis the outer surface of the cylindrical rotating domain enclosure was assigned as interface which is interconnected with the inner surface of the rectangular domain to maintain the flow continuity further the whole computational domain stationary as well as rotating shows a similitude of the turbine deployed inside the water flowing channel 3 data reduction the performance of the turbine depends on various parameters viz tip speed ratio tsr coefficient of power c p coefficient of torque c t output power p o froude number f r in order to understand these parameters data reduction analysis has been carried out tip speed ratio tsr is a non dimensional parameter and is the ratio of tangential velocity of the rotor u to the flowing velocity of water v 2 tsr the tangential velocity of the rotor the flow velocity of water u v ω d 2 v where ω is the angular velocity of the turbine rotor and d is the turbine diameter output power is the mechanical power available at the rotor shaft it is the multiplication of the averaged torque produced during one revolution and the angular velocity of the rotor 3 output power p o average torque angular velocity t a v g ω where t a v g is the average torque produced in one revolution coefficient of power c p is the parameter in which the turbine performance was assessed it is the ratio of the turbine output power p o to the theoretical power p th

diameter h is the rotor height under the present study power coefficient signify the power extraction capacity of the rotor under variable operating conditions accordingly the operating condition corresponding to maximum power coefficient c pmax can be obtained coefficient of torque c t is a non dimensional parameter to understand the initial starting as well as the running torque characteristics of the rotor it can be calculated by the expression given as below 5 coefficient of torque c t 4 t a v g ρ v 2 d 2 h the coefficient of torque or torque coefficient c t signify the torque characteristics during turbine rotation for a complete revolution the average torque c tavg decides the power generation by turbine rotor further the fluctuation in torque coefficient assists to analyze the self starting characteristics of rotor which depends on the rotor inertia the power coefficient and torque coefficient can also be co related as power coefficient torque coefficient tsr c p c t t s r froude number fr is generally used to define the flow characteristics in open channel it governs the kinetic energy with respect to potential energy in the two consecutive layers of the flowing fluid to define the hydraulic theory froude number plays a crucial role and in case of open channel flow it is recommended to define the type of flow with froude number therefore for clear representation of boundary conditions in open channel flow froude number is considered under present study it can be expressed by the following expression 6 froude number f r v g a c t w where g is the gravitational acceleration a c is the channel area and t w is the top width of the channel 4 methodology adopted for the present investigations under the present study numerical investigations are carried out to find the general applicability of the study and to determine whether the numerical cfd results are in line with the experimental outcomes it is therefore present study is divided into two categories first is to validate the numerical results with previous experimental results and the second one is to investigate the variation of parameters with the results obtained through numerical analysis 4 1 numerical analysis in order to carry out the numerical analysis ansys v 18 1 was utilized to investigate the designed parameters with cfx as the solver the numerical simulation follows a well defined step by step progress starting from model development to the result analysis 4 1 1 model development and grid generation for numerical investigation 3d computational domain was developed as per the aforementioned system parameters in the design modeller module the computational domain is subdivided into two domains one inner circular domain is provided to simulate the rotation of the turbine and the second domain rectangular is developed to resemble the 3d channel conditions as shown in fig 6 fluid is selected as the material for the considered domains circular and rectangular the complete computational domain is provided with different name selections to select the defined boundary conditions over the computational domain boundary grid or mesh generation of the 3d computational domain is the subsequent step after model development the quality of grid generation decides the accuracy of the results for present numerical simulations an unstructured mesh is created with the mesh module as shown in fig 7 unstructured mesh has wider flexibility for automatic grid generation in order to obtain the refined or output invariable results the mesh of the computational domain was refined at several levels to achieve the grid independent results the limit of mesh elements is known as mesh independence limit mil mil is the optimum limit of the mesh elements with low computational cost time at which no significant changes in output results occur sizes of the elements of inner circular rotating and outer domain rectangular stationary were varied and the number of elements for the domain varied in the range of 10 14 million to 15 92 million at five different levels and coefficient of power c p and torque c t was assessed the details of the mesh are given in table 2 the selected mesh has 14609903 elements with 0 18 numerical uncertainty in power coefficient c p and torque coefficient c t the quality parameters corresponding to selected mesh are under the acceptable level balduzzi et al 2016 kumar and saini 2017a 2017b the fine mesh was provided at the proximity and curvature to capture the flow field and the inflation or boundary layers are provided at the turbine rotor blade surface to enhance the mesh quality for better prediction of flow behaviour at blade wall the quality of mesh at blade surface is usually governed by the velocity profile at the blade surface before complete simulations the velocity profile at the blade wall is unknown therefore the value of y is calculated by considering the flat plate and actual flow parameters conditions as the value of y depends on the wall element size and the incoming flow therefore it is maintained by considering these values and corresponding turbulence model balduzzi et al 2016 ferreira et al 2010 howell et al 2010 maître et al 2013 saini and saini 2018 untaroiu et al 2011 yang and lawn 2011 4 1 2 boundary conditions and turbulence modelling unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations were solved with cfx v 18 1 solver to simulate the present cases boundary conditions are required to apply at different sections of the computational domain as illustrated in fig 8 the applied boundary conditions are given in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 8 that water enters with velocity inlet boundary condition and the corresponding velocity is provided as per the aforementioned velocity range further water exit from the 3d domain with pressure outlet boundary condition and atmospheric pressure was assumed at outlet for all the considered simulated cases lower and both sidewalls of channel were assumed to be stationary walls with wall as the boundary condition the upper surface of channel is considered as the moving wall with wall as the boundary condition and having the velocity calculated from the expression as represented by eq 8 8 v u y δ 1 7 where u is free stream velocity of water y is depth at which velocity is calculated δ is the total depth of the channel and v is velocity of flow at y depth the turbine blade surfaces were provided with the wall no slip wall boundary condition and the interfaces of both the domains were interconnected with a transient rotor stator interface to solve urans equations rng k ε turbulence model has been found to be suitable as it accurately predicts flow having swirl and rotation which were found past to turbine rotor rng model has an additional term for kinetic dissipation rate that improves accuracy this model provides an analytically derived differential formula for effective viscosity that accounts for low reynolds number effects wall treatment near wall regions ansys fluent theory guide release 18 1 2018 yakhot et al 1992 rng k ε turbulence model has also been suggested under previous studies to simulate the flow over rotating blade airfoil and flow in the channel having eddies and circulated flow boundary conditions balduzzi et al 2016 daróczy et al 2015 lee et al 2016 sengupta et al 2016 sharma and sharma 2016 the transport equations for k and ε for turbulence model are given as follow howell et al 2010 roy and saha 2013 sharma and sharma 2016 9 ρ k

and ε and r ε c μ ρ n 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k and the constants c 1 ε 1 42 c 2 ε 1 68 for the given external flow characteristics it is expected that the separation of flow might occur past to the turbine rotor and modelling of separation phenomena is required for the present numerical analysis turbulence model is adopted along with scalable wall function for wall treatment which is a least computationally intensive approach saini and saini 2018 therefore more realistic values of turbulent intensity and eddy viscosity ratio may help to predict the solution to select the appropriate turbulence intensity 3 values of turbulence intensity as 2 5 and 8 were simulated based on the simulation it has been observed that the lower value 2 turbulence intensity is more accurate value for external flow which has also been suggested under earlier studies howell et al 2010 kinsey and dumas 2017 subramanian et al 2017 untaroiu et al 2011 further value of eddy viscosity ratio was considered as 10 kumar and saini 2017b as mentioned earlier the present simulation is an external flow open channel flow therefore a pressure based solver simple is preferred over density based solver which led to the more accurate coupling of pressure velocity equations habtamu and yingxue 2011 kumar et al 2018 kumar and saini 2017a maître et al 2013 mohamed 2012 the stabilized solution was obtained by simulating the transient simulation followed by steady state simulations the rotating domain enclosure was kept as frozen rotor stator during steady simulation while in case of transient unsteady simulations transient rotor stator sliding mesh motion smm approach was used to simulate the rotating behaviour of turbine rotor saini and saini 2018 2019a 2019b further the turbulence numeric was solved with 2nd order finite differencing and high resolution was utilized for advection schemes the residuals for the momentum x y and z and turbulence kinetic energy ke were kept as 1 10 6 and of rms type time step size is the next and most decisive parameter which affects the accuracy of results and computational cost in transient simulations to maintain the accuracy with the least computational cost 10 rotation angle was used to calculate the time step size kumar and saini 2017b thus for a complete rotation rotor needs to complete 36 time steps and for stabilized results 5 rotations of rotor were simulated with 180 time steps in one case time step values corresponding to considered flow velocity and tsr range are given in table 4 5 results and discussions present investigations involve a total of 240 simulations corresponding to considered range of velocity 0 5 m s 2 0 m s and tsr 0 2 1 4 the flow conditions of water visualized under different conditions are represented by pressure and velocity contours in the vicinity of the turbine rotor 5 1 flow visualization flow patterns across the turbine vicinity have been visualized and discussed pressure velocity contours and velocity streamlines have been drawn corresponding to operating conditions having maximum performance c p i e flow velocity and tsr values of 0 5 m s and 0 8 respectively 5 1 1 pressure contours in order to tap the power from the flowing water pressure across the turbine cross section varies based on different values of operating conditions flow velocity and tsr and the shape and position of the rotor this pressure difference yields the torque generation of turbine shaft to develop the power during a complete revolution variations in the pressure are visualized with the pressure contour which is plotted discussed and shown in fig 9 it is observed from pressure contours that turbine blades facing the direct incoming water experience more pressure on the other hand the opposite side of the blade experiences the low pressure zone due to water recirculation vortices eddies formation has also been observed at the 90 azimuth angle position and at the trailing edge of the darrieus blade the maximum and minimum values of pressure have been represented by red and blue colour respectively further the pressure can also be observed through a pressure scale as shown in fig 9 the pressure difference across the turbine blades results in the development of force and hence torque generation for a complete rotation and given operating conditions the maximum and minimum pressure in the computational domain are observed as 208 pa and 810 pa respectively the aforementioned maximum and minimum pressure were observed corresponding to upstream and past to rotor flow domain an attempt has also been made to compare the pressure contour obtained with that of earlier studies kumar and saini 2017 saini and saini 2018 2019 2019 and it has been found that the contours follow the similar pattern 5 1 2 velocity contours and streamlines the rotation of the turbine rotor results in the variation of velocity across the turbine vicinity the variation in velocity gives a pressure variation which results in torque generation fig 10 shows the velocity variation across the turbine vicinity corresponding to a radius ratio value of 0 6 and attachment angle of 90 for an operating condition having water flow velocity of 0 5 m s and tsr value of 0 8 the maximum and minimum values of flow velocity are represented by red and blue colour respectively and a scale has also been provided to visualize the velocity based on the flow contour it is visualized that at the upstream side of rotor the velocity of water equals the velocity provided at the inlet boundary condition 0 5 m s as the water comes in contact with the turbine blades a stagnation point occurs and the total kinetic energy converted into potential energy which increases the pressure on the blade surface water attained a high velocity at the outer edge of returning side blade of savonius rotor at 0 azimuth position similarly a high velocity zone has also been observed at the outer surface of darrieus blade at 90 azimuth position the high velocity zone is observed corresponding to positions where the relative motion between the water and the blades are maximum the relative motion between the blades is maximum when the position of blade is co axial to water flow direction further a wake zone or low velocity zone appears past to turbine rotor which indicates that the rotor reduces the flow velocity and this reduction in flow velocity may help to predict the energy captured by turbine maximum wake zone occurs at an azimuth position of 0 as compared to other azimuth positions it is therefore the maximum energy extraction takes place corresponding to 0 azimuth position which has also been supported by torque coefficient c t versus azimuth angle characteristics curves in order to support the velocity contours velocity streamlines are also plotted in flow domain and across the turbine vicinity as shown in fig 11 velocity streamlines are the tangent lines corresponding to velocity vectors at any instant the colour of lines represents the magnitude of the velocity in the domain it is apparent from the velocity streamlines that high fluid mixing takes places past to turbine rotor the mixing of fluid may result in the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and development of low flow velocity zone wake zone for an array or farm application the intensity of wake zone may help to predict the distance at which the flow regains its original velocity and the measured length is known as wake recovery distance wake recovery distance depends on the type of hydrokinetic turbine and the velocity streamlines may predict the wake recovery distance aghsaee and markfort 2018 boudreau and dumas 2017 guerra and thomson 2019 ouro et al 2019 5 2 performance characteristics performance of the hybrid cross flow hydrokinetic turbine is assessed in term of starting behaviour torque coefficient and power coefficient both power and torque coefficients of turbine are computed using eqs 4 and 5 as mentioned in earlier section for different values of radius ratio as 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 similarly three different values of attachment angle as 60 90 and 120 were considered an attempt has also been made to compare the simulations results of turbine performance with that of single darrieus rotor 5 2 1 validation of simulation results to validate the simulation results attempts have been made to compare the results of the present study with the earlier published experimental results sahim et al 2014 2013 and the comparison results are shown in fig 12 the experimental results obtained by sahim et al 2013 follow slightly different trends due to unlike shape of the savonius rotor and due to difference in the airfoil shape used under present study and experimental study this minor deviation in power coefficient was observed due to difference in the development of drag force as the shape of the blades was different however the trends of the results are on similar lines hybrid hydrokinetic turbine has also been experimentally investigated by sahim et al 2014 the simulation results follow the similer trends and the difference in the results is due to unsymmetricity of the rotors in two different cases the rotor under the present study has 3 darrieus airfoils and 2 savonius blades however the rotor under the compared study has 2 darrieus blades along with 2 savonius blades further the difference in the results can also be accounted due to rotor solidity difference by blade profile and the number of blades 5 2 2 effects on power coefficient cp power coefficient of the turbine is solely dependent on the type of rotor structure under the present study a hybrid rotor constituted of savonius and darrieus rotor was investigated the outer diameter of the hybrid turbine is kept equals to the diameter of the darrieus rotor therefore structure of the turbine was varied by changing the diameter of the savonius turbine this variation in structure was measured with radius ratio generated lift and drag forces depend on the combination of both the rotors and hence the power output in order to increase the radius ratio of hybrid rotor the diameter of savonius rotor was increased by keeping the outer diameter of rotor fixed on increasing the radius from 0 2 to 0 8 hybrid rotor experiences more drag force in comparison to lift force similar observations have been reported in literature saini and saini 2019 2019 sood and singal 2019 therefore tsr of the hybrid rotor is found to be reduced in the operating range due to increment in radius ratio the variation in power coefficient with tsr is shown in fig 13 the output of the rotor was measured by varying the froude number in the steps of 0 29 0 58 0 87 and 1 17 which were computed using eq 6 the performance of the turbine is found to be increased with the increase of radius ratio as shown in fig 14 however beyond a radius ratio of 0 6 the power coefficient of turbine was declined due to retarding behaviour of savonius turbine at high speed the maximum average torque was obtained due to resultant force of lift and drag force at a radius ratio of 0 6 maximum power coefficient c pmax and corresponding tsr for different values of radius ratio and froude number are given in table 5 it can be observed from table 5 that hybrid rotor yields its maximum power coefficient as 0 109 corresponding to a radius ratio of 0 6 and at tsr and froude number value of 0 7 and 0 29 respectively fig 14 shows the variation of power coefficient versus radius ratio for a given value of tsr it is observed that the performance of the turbine decreases with the increase of the froude number this may be due to the fact that as froude number increases reynolds number is increased and therefore more turbulence is experienced which in turn increase the flow separation probability across the turbine rotor vicinity and it results in the low power coefficient one of the system parameter that affects the performance of the hybrid turbine is an attachment angle attachment angle decides the positioning of both the rotors corresponding to each other under present investigation simulation results were obtained for 3 different values 60 90 and 120 of attachment angle for given range of flow velocity and tsr values the variation of power coefficient with tsr is shown in fig 15 for an best value of radius ratio m 0 6 it is observed that attachment angle significantly influence the performance due to positioning of savonius rotor with respect to darrieus rotor further it is visualized from fig 16 that rotor shows the maximum performance corresponding to an attachment angle value of 90 at 90 attachment angle one blade of the savonius rotor is co axial to darrieus rotor blade and another blade is in the middle of other two blades of darrieus rotor the results obtained are found on a similar line with the earlier well published results liang et al 2017 sahim et al 2013 2014 saini and saini 2018 the resultant of lift and drag force developed by darrieus and savonius rotor is increased for attachment angle of 90 and hence better power coefficient compared to other positions 60 and 120 of savonius rotor the maximum power coefficient c pmax corresponding to different tsr values are given in table 6 for different values of attachment angle and froude number in case of attachment angle simulation the hybrid rotor yields the maximum power coefficient as 0 109 corresponding to 90 attachment angle for a given value of tsr as 0 703 and froude number of 0 28 further it has also been observed that at low froude number the effect of attachment angle is more as compared to high froude number fr 0 87 and 1 17 at high froude number turbine rotor experiences more turbulence which diminishes the rotor positioning effects due to water separation at turbine blades 5 2 3 effects on starting torque coefficient initial starting of the turbine is a critical parameter to study which merely depends on the inertia of the turbine rotor and the friction imposed by fluid and system for the conditions considered under the present study inertia and friction calculations are difficult to quantify however the initial starting of the turbine can be co related with the coefficient of torque c t radius ratio m and attachment angle ө influence inertia and hence the initial starting of the turbine effect of variation of coefficient of torque corresponding to the aforementioned parameters is shown in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the variation in the coefficient of torque with azimuth angle for different values of radius ratio and attachment angle are plotted at the given tsr and flow velocity value of 0 8 and 0 5 m s respectively to compare the starting behaviour of a hybrid rotor with the conventional darrieus rotor the variation in coefficient of torque c t with azimuth angle is shown in fig 17 it has also been observed that the hybrid rotor can overcome the self starting problem associated with conventional darrieus rotor by increasing the average torque coefficient c tavg the average torque coefficient of the hybrid rotor increases as the radius ratio increases and attains the maximum value as 0 1276 at a radius ratio value of 0 6 on further increasing the radius ratio the average torque coefficient of the hybrid rotor starts to decline this is due to the fact that the high value of radius ratio increases the negative torque due to the backward drag force produced by the returning side blade of savonius rotor part of hybrid rotor based on the comparison it has been found that the darrieus rotor experiences the negative value of torque in the three ranges of azimuth positions of 0 30 120 150 and 240 280 however in case of hybrid rotor negative torque frequency values were observed corresponding to only one range of azimuth position of 260 280 maximum minimum and average values of torque coefficient and their corresponding azimuth positions are given in table 7 in order to find out the effect of respective positions attachment angle on the starting behaviour of a hybrid turbine simulations have been performed by considering the best value of radius ratio and different values of attachment angles fig 18 shows the variation of coefficient of torque c t with azimuth angle corresponding to different values of attachment angles and best value of radius ratio it is observed that attachment angle has significant effect on the starting behaviour of the hybrid turbine further better average coefficient of torque has been observed at an attachment angle of 90 as compared to other attachment angle values i e 60 and 120 it has also been found that hybrid rotor corresponding to 90 attachment angle shows the low fluctuation in torque coefficient as compared to 60 and 120 attachment angle maximum minimum average values along with their respective azimuth positions are given in table 8 the hybrid rotor is un symmetrical with 3 darrieus airfoils and 2 savonius blades therefore attachment angle has a span of 120 in case of 90 attachment angle one blade of savonius rotor is in between of two consecutive airfoils blades of darrieus rotor and the other blade of savonius rotor is co axial to another airfoil blade of darrieus rotor 6 conclusions in order to overcome the self starting and poor performance of conventional hydrokinetic rotor darrieus and savonius the present study is aimed to novel design of hybrid rotor two rotor parameters viz radius ratio and attachment angle have been selected as the system parameters and the performance of the turbine was assessed in terms of power coefficient and torque coefficient for the considered range of radius ratio 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 and attachment angle 60 90 and 120 flow velocity of water was considered in the range of 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s based on the investigation carried out it is observed that the performance of the hybrid turbine rotor is significantly influenced by the radius ratio and attachment angle the variations in pressure and velocity across the turbine vicinity have been visualized by flow contours and streamlines the conclusions drawn from the present study are as follows 1 performance of turbine increases with the increase of radius ratio and attains maximum power coefficient c pmax as 0 109 at a radius ratio value of 0 6 for a given value of froude number fr and tsr of 0 29 and 0 70 respectively for higher values of radius ratio the performance was found to be reduced due to retarding behaviour of savonius rotor at high speed 2 the relative placement of the individual rotor decides the development of drag and lift force by savonius and darrieus rotor respectively the performance of the turbine having hybrid rotor with three darrieus blades and two savonius blades has been found better corresponds to attachment angle of 90 3 the self starting phenomena have also been analyzed and it is concluded that the hybrid rotor turbine yields its maximum average torque coefficient c tavg as 0 1276 corresponding to 0 6 radius ratio and at an attachment angle of 90 further values of negative torque coefficient frequency are found to be reduced by hybrid rotor as compared to single darrieus rotor 4 wake vortices zone has been observed on the trailing edge of the darrieus blade which is created by fluid recirculation due to turbine rotation the fluid recirculation dissipates the kinetic energy and a low velocity zone is formed in the downstream region of turbine rotor 5 the maximum value of power coefficient c pmax of a hybrid rotor is found as 37 97 higher than the single darrieus rotor the maximum average torque coefficient c tavg is found to be 35 88 higher than the single darrieus rotor based on the above outcomes it is found that the performance power coefficient of the hybrid rotor as well as the self starting capability average torque coefficient has improved although the parameters of the individual rotor have entirely different characteristics however the hybrid rotor has different characteristics from the individual rotor the systematic design of hybrid rotor parameters leads to suitable rotor for hydrokinetic turbine having better power coefficient and starting behaviour the numerical results obtained under the present study will be considered by

22050,cross flow hydrokinetic turbines have been considered a decent choice for riverine applications under the present work performance of hybrid rotor cross flow hydrokinetic has been investigated for different rotor parameters the proposed hybrid rotor is the combination of two conventional turbine rotors savonius and darrieus investigations have been performed by considering flow velocity varying in the range from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s the performance of hybrid rotor was assessed in term of power coefficient c p and torque coefficient c t further comparison of hybrid rotor and single darrieus rotor has been carried out on the basis of their performance flow behaviour across the turbine vicinity is analyzed and discussed with the pressure velocity contours and velocity streamlines it has been found that radius ratio and attachment angle play a crucial role in performance enhancement with reduction in torque fluctuations for the considered range of rotor parameters the maximum power coefficient c pmax and average torque coefficient c tavg were obtained as 0 109 and 0 1276 corresponding to radius ratio of 0 6 at an attachment angle of 90 further power coefficient and torque

ke kinetic energy tsr tip speed ratio 1 introduction hydrokinetic energy can be harnessed from different sources of flowing water having a velocity range varying from 0 5 m s to 2 5 m s depending on the technology approach johnson and pride 2010 this technology converts the kinetic energy of the water into the useful form of energy similar to wind technology the conversion of hydrokinetic energy is constrained as per the betz limit which establishes the maximum performance as 59 3 and can be achieved with ideal operating conditions war 2007 from practical point of view betz limit is unachievable except under higher blockage conditions vennell 2013 hydrokinetic turbines are categorized based on the rotor shaft axis orientation with respect to the water flow direction as i axial flow hydrokinetic turbine ii cross flow hydrokinetic turbine kumar and saini 2016 axial flow hydrokinetic turbines are usually arranged along the water flow direction and shaft orientation requires a larger water depth further axial flow turbines are easily clogged with debris and require one dimensional 1d flow it is suggested by investigators that the axial flow turbines are more suitable to harness the hydrokinetic energy in marine and ocean applications anyi and kirke 2015 2010 the direction of incoming water flow is orthogonal to the shaft of the cross flow turbine the cylindrical shape of these turbine rotors allows stacking in high depth applications and in case of shallow depth a single rotor can be arranged to tap the hydrokinetic power georgescu et al 2008 cross flow turbine has low power coefficient compared to the axial flow turbine however these turbines can make up the power loss in a farm arrangement hall 2012 further vertical axis cross flow hydrokinetic turbines are suitable for riverine systems i e irrigation canals power channel and rivers sood and singal 2019 for a limited water flow rate the vertical axis turbine is a decent choice güney and kaygusuz 2010 vertical axis turbine can be installed either as a single unit or in farm application khan et al 2010 darrieus and savonius are common rotors for vertical axis cross flow hydrokinetic turbines darrieus rotor is an efficient rotor and rotates at higher rpm but suffers the problem of self starting arab et al 2017 batista et al 2015 bhuyan and biswas 2014 rossetti and pavesi 2013 singh et al 2015 torabi mahdi et al 2016 on the other hand the savonius rotor has good starting ability but this rotor suffers the problem of low performance and speed rpm kumar et al 2018 kumar and saini 2015 most of the hydrokinetic potential sites are in remote and hilly areas where operation of turbine is tedius task the self starting and efficiency are the main concern in order to overcome there problem hybrid rotor consisting of darrieus rotor and savonius rotor was designed and investigated saini and saini 2019 2019 the hybrid rotor has moderate efficiency with good self starting characteristics further the installation and operation costs of the hybrid turbine are similar to darrieus and savonius rotor turbine saini and saini 2018 the performance of the hybrid rotor can be enhanced by improving system parameters various system parameters of hybrid rotors are suggested for better efficiency with self starting characteristics these system parameters of hybrid rotors should be designed carefully to reduce the distortion of the flow field in this way a simple darrieus rotor airfoil was modified in a j shape to improve the drag force generation the study reported a significant increase in starting torque of darrieus rotor due to reduction in flow separation vortices zamani et al 2016 the flow behaviour across the hybrid turbine rotor was observed by ghosh et al 2015 and it was reported that the coanda effect or vortices formation migrates downstream of the turbine rotor which results in a better power coefficient further the velocity deficit downstream of the savonius rotor helps the darrieus part of the hybrid rotor to extract more kinetic energy inclusion of a savonius rotor in single darrieus rotor aid to improve the drag force generation and hence the self starting phenomena at low tsr values kyozuka 2008 however during fast rotation of the turbine the savonius rotor tends to retard the rotation of the hybrid rotor gavalda et al 1990 a control mechanism is required to allow the savonius rotor to rotate at lower rpm and progressively cut off the savonius rotation as the rotor attains a prefixed value of tsr the system parameters of the hybrid wind rotor are analyzed by various investigators wakui et al 2005 experimentally evaluated the two different hybrid configurations type a and type b with radius ratio as the system parameter and it was reported that a radius ratio of 0 3 is optimum for the type a rotor beyond this value of the radius ratio the savonius part of the hybrid rotor tends to retard the rotation similarly a radius ratio of 0 38 is found to be optimum for type b rotor configuration fig 1 liang et al 2017 numerically investigated the radius ratio and attachment angle for a two bladed wind hybrid rotor to improve the power coefficient and starting behaviour of the hybrid wind turbine rotor the study revealed that a radius ratio of 0 25 yields the maximum performance of 0 363 at a 0 attachment angle the relative arm length and position of savonius and darrieus play a critical role in the design of the hybrid rotor the effects of relative arm length and attachment angle are studied on a hybrid rotor having three straight blades of darrieus rotor and two semi elliptic savonius rotor sahim et al 2013 it was reported that the turbine rotor with the relative length l h r as 0 36 and 60 angle position β had better performance fig 2 further it was observed that the hybrid rotor yields better performance when the savonius rotor is close to the turbine shaft and the arms of both the rotors are not co axial the modification in the outer fluid flow structure was investigated by sahim et al 2014 and it was reported that placement of a deflector plate upstream of the returning side blade of savonius rotor results in a significant increase in torque and power coefficient of the hybrid rotor most of the aforementioned literature review either focused on the modification in existing darrieus rotor to develop a hybrid rotor or on the system parameters of the hybrid rotor with air as the working fluid wind technology however the behaviour of the hybrid rotor is different in dissimilar working fluids this is due to the fact that a hydrokinetic turbine has a limited bounded flow area working domain while the wind turbine assumes an infinite area daskiran et al 2016 research on the system parameters on hybrid rotor for hydrokinetic turbine is found to be insufficient in order to find the system parameter for better performance power coefficient and self starting ability of hybrid rotor there is a need to investigate the placement parameters of individual rotor in hybrid hydrokinetic turbine further the available literature addresses the various configuration on the hybrid hydrokinetic rotor the hybrid configuration having savonius rotor inside the darrieus rotor has shown better performance and was suggested by various investigators bhuyan and biswas 2014 gavalda et al 1990 saini and saini 2018a 2018b n d hence there is a need to systematically design the size and placement orientation of the savonius rotor inside the darrieus rotor under the present study two dimensionless parameters are selected for the size and relative placement of the rotors the size of the savonius rotor is defined by a dimensionless parameter called radius ratio m while the relative placement orientation of the rotors is represented by an angle between the arm of darrieus and savonius rotor known as attachment angle the attachment angle defines the relative orientation of savonius rotor with respect to darrieus rotor and the orientation of darrieus rotor with respect to savonius rotor the radius ratio m is the ratio of the radius of the savonius rotor r s to the radius of darrieus rotor r d on the other hand the attachment angle for the present study is measured from the reference x y planes fig 3 the radius ratio m is expressed as 1 radius ratio m savonius rotor radius darrieus rotor radius in order to investigate the effects of the radius ratio and the attachment angle on the performance of the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor unsteady numerical simulations were performed therefore the present study is carried out with the objectives i to study the effects of the radius ratio on the performance of the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor ii to study the effects of the attachment angle on the power coefficient c p and the starting characteristics of the turbine rotor and iii to visualize the flow behaviour across the flow domain with velocity and pressure distributions contours the present study was carried out by considering the flow velocity in an open channel varying in the range from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s commercially available software ansys v 18 1 is used to simulate the considered flow domain along with cfx solver the above mentioned objective was met by adopting the methodology given in a flow chart as shown in fig 4 the present investigations on rotor parameters are the extension of the ref saini and saini 2018 to find the best values of radius ratio m and attachment angle ө previously these parameters were investigated for a hybrid rotor having two blades for darrieus and two blades for savonius rotor and by adopting 2d computational domain however the present study incorporates the hybrid hydrokinetic turbine with three blades in darrieus rotor and two blades in savonius rotor in a 3d computational domain firstly radius ratio of the hybrid rotor is varied for a fixed value of attachment angle and the simulations were performed for the considered range of radius ratio by having the best value of radius ratio attachment angle was varied to find the placement orientation of the savonius rotor inside the hybrid rotor or darrieus rotor with respect to the savonius rotor the main objective of this investigation is to find the best values of hybrid rotor system parameters for the whole analysis simulations were carried out at different value of tsr for the considered range of flow velocity 2 system parameters investigated for hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor the present numerical study considered two geometrical system parameters of hybrid cross flow hydrokinetic turbine namely radius ratio m and attachment angle ө which are represented by the schematic shown in fig 3 and the details of the rotor are given in table 1 the blades of the darrieus rotor are of airfoil shaped and having the profile as s 1046 which is found to have better performance among existing category of airfoil family mohamed 2012 the blades of the darrieus rotor are considered in straight shape due to good aerodynamics performance over twisted blades gorle et al 2016 kamoji et al 2009 rossetti and pavesi 2013 singh et al 2015 torabi mahdi et al 2016 three airfoil shaped blades were considered for darrieus part in hybrid rotor mousavi et al 2013 the aspect ratio of the rotor was considered as 0 9 based on earlier studies li et al 2017 zanforlin and deluca 2018 to find the best value of radius ratio and attachment angle various possible combinations of the parameters have opted as shown in fig 5 the cylindrical rotating domain was modelled around the turbine blades to provide the desired angular velocity to rotor it has been reported in literature that the size of rotating domain influence the performance of the turbine which is the function of turbine diameter the dimensions of the rotating domain vary in the range of 1 25d to 2d where d is the turbine rotor diameter balduzzi et al 2016 ghosh et al 2015 kumar and saini 2017a marsh et al 2015 large rotating domain size will increase the requirement computational capacity due to computational constraints the size of the rotating domain is considered as 1 3d balduzzi et al 2016 the stationary or outer domain was modelled to consider the inlet outlet wall and free surface of flowing water in channel the dimensions of the outer domain were considered as 0 7 m width 0 3 m height 4 0 m length based on the rotor and channel dimensions accordingly blockage ratio was maintained as 13 33 for computation analysis the outer surface of the cylindrical rotating domain enclosure was assigned as interface which is interconnected with the inner surface of the rectangular domain to maintain the flow continuity further the whole computational domain stationary as well as rotating shows a similitude of the turbine deployed inside the water flowing channel 3 data reduction the performance of the turbine depends on various parameters viz tip speed ratio tsr coefficient of power c p coefficient of torque c t output power p o froude number f r in order to understand these parameters data reduction analysis has been carried out tip speed ratio tsr is a non dimensional parameter and is the ratio of tangential velocity of the rotor u to the flowing velocity of water v 2 tsr the tangential velocity of the rotor

multiplication of the averaged torque produced during one revolution and the angular velocity of the rotor 3 output power p o average torque angular velocity t a v g ω where t a v g is the average torque produced in one revolution coefficient of power c p is the parameter in which the turbine performance was assessed it is the ratio of the turbine output power p o to the theoretical power p th

corresponding to maximum power coefficient c pmax can be obtained coefficient of torque c t is a non dimensional parameter to understand the initial starting as well as the running torque characteristics of the rotor it can be calculated by the expression given as below 5 coefficient of torque c t 4 t a v g ρ v 2 d 2 h the coefficient of torque or torque coefficient c t signify the torque characteristics during turbine rotation for a complete revolution the average torque c tavg decides the power generation by turbine rotor further the fluctuation in torque coefficient assists to analyze the self starting characteristics of rotor which depends on the rotor inertia the power coefficient and torque coefficient can also be co related as power coefficient torque coefficient tsr c p c t t s r froude number fr is generally used to define the flow characteristics in open channel it governs the kinetic energy with respect to potential energy in the two consecutive layers of the flowing fluid to define the hydraulic theory froude number plays a crucial role and in case of open channel flow it is recommended to define the type of flow with froude number therefore for clear representation of boundary conditions in open channel flow froude number is considered under present study it can be expressed by the following expression 6 froude number f r v g a c t w where g is the gravitational acceleration a c is the channel area and t w is the top width of the channel 4 methodology adopted for the present investigations under the present study numerical investigations are carried out to find the general applicability of the study and to determine whether the numerical cfd results are in line with the experimental outcomes it is therefore present study is divided into two categories first is to validate the numerical results with previous experimental results and the second one is to investigate the variation of parameters with the results obtained through numerical analysis 4 1 numerical analysis in order to carry out the numerical analysis ansys v 18 1 was utilized to investigate the designed parameters with cfx as the solver the numerical simulation follows a well defined step by step progress starting from model development to the result analysis 4 1 1 model development and grid generation for numerical investigation 3d computational domain was developed as per the aforementioned system parameters in the design modeller module the computational domain is subdivided into two domains one inner circular domain is provided to simulate the rotation of the turbine and the second domain rectangular is developed to resemble the 3d channel conditions as shown in fig 6 fluid is selected as the material for the considered domains circular and rectangular the complete computational domain is provided with different name selections to select the defined boundary conditions over the computational domain boundary grid or mesh generation of the 3d computational domain is the subsequent step after model development the quality of grid generation decides the accuracy of the results for present numerical simulations an unstructured mesh is created with the mesh module as shown in fig 7 unstructured mesh has wider flexibility for automatic grid generation in order to obtain the refined or output invariable results the mesh of the computational domain was refined at several levels to achieve the grid independent results the limit of mesh elements is known as mesh independence limit mil mil is the optimum limit of the mesh elements with low computational cost time at which no significant changes in output results occur sizes of the elements of inner circular rotating and outer domain rectangular stationary were varied and the number of elements for the domain varied in the range of 10 14 million to 15 92 million at five different levels and coefficient of power c p and torque c t was assessed the details of the mesh are given in table 2 the selected mesh has 14609903 elements with 0 18 numerical uncertainty in power coefficient c p and torque coefficient c t the quality parameters corresponding to selected mesh are under the acceptable level balduzzi et al 2016 kumar and saini 2017a 2017b the fine mesh was provided at the proximity and curvature to capture the flow field and the inflation or boundary layers are provided at the turbine rotor blade surface to enhance the mesh quality for better prediction of flow behaviour at blade wall the quality of mesh at blade surface is usually governed by the velocity profile at the blade surface before complete simulations the velocity profile at the blade wall is unknown therefore the value of y is calculated by considering the flat plate and actual flow parameters conditions as the value of y depends on the wall element size and the incoming flow therefore it is maintained by considering these values and corresponding turbulence model balduzzi et al 2016 ferreira et al 2010 howell et al 2010 maître et al 2013 saini and saini 2018 untaroiu et al 2011 yang and lawn 2011 4 1 2 boundary conditions and turbulence modelling unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations were solved with cfx v 18 1 solver to simulate the present cases boundary conditions are required to apply at different sections of the computational domain as illustrated in fig 8 the applied boundary conditions are given in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 8 that water enters with velocity inlet boundary condition and the corresponding velocity is provided as per the aforementioned velocity range further water exit from the 3d domain with pressure outlet boundary condition and atmospheric pressure was assumed at outlet for all the considered simulated cases lower and both sidewalls of channel were assumed to be stationary walls with wall as the boundary condition the upper surface of channel is considered as the moving wall with wall as the boundary condition and having the velocity calculated from the expression as represented by eq 8 8 v u y δ 1 7 where u is free stream velocity of water y is depth at which velocity is calculated δ is the total depth of the channel and v is velocity of flow at y depth the turbine blade surfaces were provided with the wall no slip wall boundary condition and the interfaces of both the domains were interconnected with a transient rotor stator interface to solve urans equations rng k ε turbulence model has been found to be suitable as it accurately predicts flow having swirl and rotation which were found past to turbine rotor rng model has an additional term for kinetic dissipation rate that improves accuracy this model provides an analytically derived differential formula for effective viscosity that accounts for low reynolds number effects wall treatment near wall regions ansys fluent theory guide release 18 1 2018 yakhot et al 1992 rng k ε turbulence model has also been suggested under previous studies to simulate the flow over rotating blade airfoil and flow in the channel having eddies and circulated flow boundary conditions balduzzi et al 2016 daróczy et al 2015 lee et al 2016 sengupta et al 2016 sharma and sharma 2016 the transport equations for k and ε for turbulence model are given as follow howell et al 2010 roy and saha 2013 sharma and sharma 2016 9 ρ k

and ε and r ε c μ ρ n 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k and the constants c 1 ε 1 42 c 2 ε 1 68 for the given external flow characteristics it is expected that the separation of flow might occur past to the turbine rotor and modelling of separation phenomena is required for the present numerical analysis turbulence model is adopted along with scalable wall function for wall treatment which is a least computationally intensive approach saini and saini 2018 therefore more realistic values of turbulent intensity and eddy viscosity ratio may help to predict the solution to select the appropriate turbulence intensity 3 values of turbulence intensity as 2 5 and 8 were simulated based on the simulation it has been observed that the lower value 2 turbulence intensity is more accurate value for external flow which has also been suggested under earlier studies howell et al 2010 kinsey and dumas 2017 subramanian et al 2017 untaroiu et al 2011 further value of eddy viscosity ratio was considered as 10 kumar and saini 2017b as mentioned earlier the present simulation is an external flow open channel flow therefore a pressure based solver simple is preferred over density based solver which led to the more accurate coupling of pressure velocity equations habtamu and yingxue 2011 kumar et al 2018 kumar and saini 2017a maître et al 2013 mohamed 2012 the stabilized solution was obtained by simulating the transient simulation followed by steady state simulations the rotating domain enclosure was kept as frozen rotor stator during steady simulation while in case of transient unsteady simulations transient rotor stator sliding mesh motion smm approach was used to simulate the rotating behaviour of turbine rotor saini and saini 2018 2019a 2019b further the turbulence numeric was solved with 2nd order finite differencing and high resolution was utilized for advection schemes the residuals for the momentum x y and z and turbulence kinetic energy ke were kept as 1 10 6 and of rms type time step size is the next and most decisive parameter which affects the accuracy of results and computational cost in transient simulations to maintain the accuracy with the least computational cost 10 rotation angle was used to calculate the time step size kumar and saini 2017b thus for a complete rotation rotor needs to complete 36 time steps and for stabilized results 5 rotations of rotor were simulated with 180 time steps in one case time step values corresponding to considered flow velocity and tsr range are given in table 4 5 results and discussions present investigations involve a total of 240 simulations corresponding to considered range of velocity 0 5 m s 2 0 m s and tsr 0 2 1 4 the flow conditions of water visualized under different conditions are represented by pressure and velocity contours in the vicinity of the turbine rotor 5 1 flow visualization flow patterns across the turbine vicinity have been visualized and discussed pressure velocity contours and velocity streamlines have been drawn corresponding to operating conditions having maximum performance c p i e flow velocity and tsr values of 0 5 m s and 0 8 respectively 5 1 1 pressure contours in order to tap the power from the flowing water pressure across the turbine cross section varies based on different values of operating conditions flow velocity and tsr and the shape and position of the rotor this pressure difference yields the torque generation of turbine shaft to develop the power during a complete revolution variations in the pressure are visualized with the pressure contour which is plotted discussed and shown in fig 9 it is observed from pressure contours that turbine blades facing the direct incoming water experience more pressure on the other hand the opposite side of the blade experiences the low pressure zone due to water recirculation vortices eddies formation has also been observed at the 90 azimuth angle position and at the trailing edge of the darrieus blade the maximum and minimum values of pressure have been represented by red and blue colour respectively further the pressure can also be observed through a pressure scale as shown in fig 9 the pressure difference across the turbine blades results in the development of force and hence torque generation for a complete rotation and given operating conditions the maximum and minimum pressure in the computational domain are observed as 208 pa and 810 pa respectively the aforementioned maximum and minimum pressure were observed corresponding to upstream and past to rotor flow domain an attempt has also been made to compare the pressure contour obtained with that of earlier studies kumar and saini 2017 saini and saini 2018 2019 2019 and it has been found that the contours follow the similar pattern 5 1 2 velocity contours and streamlines the rotation of the turbine rotor results in the variation of velocity across the turbine vicinity the variation in velocity gives a pressure variation which results in torque generation fig 10 shows the velocity variation across the turbine vicinity corresponding to a radius ratio value of 0 6 and attachment angle of 90 for an operating condition having water flow velocity of 0 5 m s and tsr value of 0 8 the maximum and minimum values of flow velocity are represented by red and blue colour respectively and a scale has also been provided to visualize the velocity based on the flow contour it is visualized that at the upstream side of rotor the velocity of water equals the velocity provided at the inlet boundary condition 0 5 m s as the water comes in contact with the turbine blades a stagnation point occurs and the total kinetic energy converted into potential energy which increases the pressure on the blade surface water attained a high velocity at the outer edge of returning side blade of savonius rotor at 0 azimuth position similarly a high velocity zone has also been observed at the outer surface of darrieus blade at 90 azimuth position the high velocity zone is observed corresponding to positions where the relative motion between the water and the blades are maximum the relative motion between the blades is maximum when the position of blade is co axial to water flow direction further a wake zone or low velocity zone appears past to turbine rotor which indicates that the rotor reduces the flow velocity and this reduction in flow velocity may help to predict the energy captured by turbine maximum wake zone occurs at an azimuth position of 0 as compared to other azimuth positions it is therefore the maximum energy extraction takes place corresponding to 0 azimuth position which has also been supported by torque coefficient c t versus azimuth angle characteristics curves in order to support the velocity contours velocity streamlines are also plotted in flow domain and across the turbine vicinity as shown in fig 11 velocity streamlines are the tangent lines corresponding to velocity vectors at any instant the colour of lines represents the magnitude of the velocity in the domain it is apparent from the velocity streamlines that high fluid mixing takes places past to turbine rotor the mixing of fluid may result in the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and development of low flow velocity zone wake zone for an array or farm application the intensity of wake zone may help to predict the distance at which the flow regains its original velocity and the measured length is known as wake recovery distance wake recovery distance depends on the type of hydrokinetic turbine and the velocity streamlines may predict the wake recovery distance aghsaee and markfort 2018 boudreau and dumas 2017 guerra and thomson 2019 ouro et al 2019 5 2 performance characteristics performance of the hybrid cross flow hydrokinetic turbine is assessed in term of starting behaviour torque coefficient and power coefficient both power and torque coefficients of turbine are computed using eqs 4 and 5 as mentioned in earlier section for different values of radius ratio as 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 similarly three different values of attachment angle as 60 90 and 120 were considered an attempt has also been made to compare the simulations results of turbine performance with that of single darrieus rotor 5 2 1 validation of simulation results to validate the simulation results attempts have been made to compare the results of the present study with the earlier published experimental results sahim et al 2014 2013 and the comparison results are shown in fig 12 the experimental results obtained by sahim et al 2013 follow slightly different trends due to unlike shape of the savonius rotor and due to difference in the airfoil shape used under present study and experimental study this minor deviation in power coefficient was observed due to difference in the development of drag force as the shape of the blades was different however the trends of the results are on similar lines hybrid hydrokinetic turbine has also been experimentally investigated by sahim et al 2014 the simulation results follow the similer trends and the difference in the results is due to unsymmetricity of the rotors in two different cases the rotor under the present study has 3 darrieus airfoils and 2 savonius blades however the rotor under the compared study has 2 darrieus blades along with 2 savonius blades further the difference in the results can also be accounted due to rotor solidity difference by blade profile and the number of blades 5 2 2 effects on power coefficient cp power coefficient of the turbine is solely dependent on the type of rotor structure under the present study a hybrid rotor constituted of savonius and darrieus rotor was investigated the outer diameter of the hybrid turbine is kept equals to the diameter of the darrieus rotor therefore structure of the turbine was varied by changing the diameter of the savonius turbine this variation in structure was measured with radius ratio generated lift and drag forces depend on the combination of both the rotors and hence the power output in order to increase the radius ratio of hybrid rotor the diameter of savonius rotor was increased by keeping the outer diameter of rotor fixed on increasing the radius from 0 2 to 0 8 hybrid rotor experiences more drag force in comparison to lift force similar observations have been reported in literature saini and saini 2019 2019 sood and singal 2019 therefore tsr of the hybrid rotor is found to be reduced in the operating range due to increment in radius ratio the variation in power coefficient with tsr is shown in fig 13 the output of the rotor was measured by varying the froude number in the steps of 0 29 0 58 0 87 and 1 17 which were computed using eq 6 the performance of the turbine is found to be increased with the increase of radius ratio as shown in fig 14 however beyond a radius ratio of 0 6 the power coefficient of turbine was declined due to retarding behaviour of savonius turbine at high speed the maximum average torque was obtained due to resultant force of lift and drag force at a radius ratio of 0 6 maximum power coefficient c pmax and corresponding tsr for different values of radius ratio and froude number are given in table 5 it can be observed from table 5 that hybrid rotor yields its maximum power coefficient as 0 109 corresponding to a radius ratio of 0 6 and at tsr and froude number value of 0 7 and 0 29 respectively fig 14 shows the variation of power coefficient versus radius ratio for a given value of tsr it is observed that the performance of the turbine decreases with the increase of the froude number this may be due to the fact that as froude number increases reynolds number is increased and therefore more turbulence is experienced which in turn increase the flow separation probability across the turbine rotor vicinity and it results in the low power coefficient one of the system parameter that affects the performance of the hybrid turbine is an attachment angle attachment angle decides the positioning of both the rotors corresponding to each other under present investigation simulation results were obtained for 3 different values 60 90 and 120 of attachment angle for given range of flow velocity and tsr values the variation of power coefficient with tsr is shown in fig 15 for an best value of radius ratio m 0 6 it is observed that attachment angle significantly influence the performance due to positioning of savonius rotor with respect to darrieus rotor further it is visualized from fig 16 that rotor shows the maximum performance corresponding to an attachment angle value of 90 at 90 attachment angle one blade of the savonius rotor is co axial to darrieus rotor blade and another blade is in the middle of other two blades of darrieus rotor the results obtained are found on a similar line with the earlier well published results liang et al 2017 sahim et al 2013 2014 saini and saini 2018 the resultant of lift and drag force developed by darrieus and savonius rotor is increased for attachment angle of 90 and hence better power coefficient compared to other positions 60 and 120 of savonius rotor the maximum power coefficient c pmax corresponding to different tsr values are given in table 6 for different values of attachment angle and froude number in case of attachment angle simulation the hybrid rotor yields the maximum power coefficient as 0 109 corresponding to 90 attachment angle for a given value of tsr as 0 703 and froude number of 0 28 further it has also been observed that at low froude number the effect of attachment angle is more as compared to high froude number fr 0 87 and 1 17 at high froude number turbine rotor experiences more turbulence which diminishes the rotor positioning effects due to water separation at turbine blades 5 2 3 effects on starting torque coefficient initial starting of the turbine is a critical parameter to study which merely depends on the inertia of the turbine rotor and the friction imposed by fluid and system for the conditions considered under the present study inertia and friction calculations are difficult to quantify however the initial starting of the turbine can be co related with the coefficient of torque c t radius ratio m and attachment angle ө influence inertia and hence the initial starting of the turbine effect of variation of coefficient of torque corresponding to the aforementioned parameters is shown in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the variation in the coefficient of torque with azimuth angle for different values of radius ratio and attachment angle are plotted at the given tsr and flow velocity value of 0 8 and 0 5 m s respectively to compare the starting behaviour of a hybrid rotor with the conventional darrieus rotor the variation in coefficient of torque c t with azimuth angle is shown in fig 17 it has also been observed that the hybrid rotor can overcome the self starting problem associated with conventional darrieus rotor by increasing the average torque coefficient c tavg the average torque coefficient of the hybrid rotor increases as the radius ratio increases and attains the maximum value as 0 1276 at a radius ratio value of 0 6 on further increasing the radius ratio the average torque coefficient of the hybrid rotor starts to decline this is due to the fact that the high value of radius ratio increases the negative torque due to the backward drag force produced by the returning side blade of savonius rotor part of hybrid rotor based on the comparison it has been found that the darrieus rotor experiences the negative value of torque in the three ranges of azimuth positions of 0 30 120 150 and 240 280 however in case of hybrid rotor negative torque frequency values were observed corresponding to only one range of azimuth position of 260 280 maximum minimum and average values of torque coefficient and their corresponding azimuth positions are given in table 7 in order to find out the effect of respective positions attachment angle on the starting behaviour of a hybrid turbine simulations have been performed by considering the best value of radius ratio and different values of attachment angles fig 18 shows the variation of coefficient of torque c t with azimuth angle corresponding to different values of attachment angles and best value of radius ratio it is observed that attachment angle has significant effect on the starting behaviour of the hybrid turbine further better average coefficient of torque has been observed at an attachment angle of 90 as compared to other attachment angle values i e 60 and 120 it has also been found that hybrid rotor corresponding to 90 attachment angle shows the low fluctuation in torque coefficient as compared to 60 and 120 attachment angle maximum minimum average values along with their respective azimuth positions are given in table 8 the hybrid rotor is un symmetrical with 3 darrieus airfoils and 2 savonius blades therefore attachment angle has a span of 120 in case of 90 attachment angle one blade of savonius rotor is in between of two consecutive airfoils blades of darrieus rotor and the other blade of savonius rotor is co axial to another airfoil blade of darrieus rotor 6 conclusions in order to overcome the self starting and poor performance of conventional hydrokinetic rotor darrieus and savonius the present study is aimed to novel design of hybrid rotor two rotor parameters viz radius ratio and attachment angle have been selected as the system parameters and the performance of the turbine was assessed in terms of power coefficient and torque coefficient for the considered range of radius ratio 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 and attachment angle 60 90 and 120 flow velocity of water was considered in the range of 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s based on the investigation carried out it is observed that the performance of the hybrid turbine rotor is significantly influenced by the radius ratio and attachment angle the variations in pressure and velocity across the turbine vicinity have been visualized by flow contours and streamlines the conclusions drawn from the present study are as follows 1 performance of turbine increases with the increase of radius ratio and attains maximum power coefficient c pmax as 0 109 at a radius ratio value of 0 6 for a given value of froude number fr and tsr of 0 29 and 0 70 respectively for higher values of radius ratio the performance was found to be reduced due to retarding behaviour of savonius rotor at high speed 2 the relative placement of the individual rotor decides the development of drag and lift force by savonius and darrieus rotor respectively the performance of the turbine having hybrid rotor with three darrieus blades and two savonius blades has been found better corresponds to attachment angle of 90 3 the self starting phenomena have also been analyzed and it is concluded that the hybrid rotor turbine yields its maximum average torque coefficient c tavg as 0 1276 corresponding to 0 6 radius ratio and at an attachment angle of 90 further values of negative torque coefficient frequency are found to be reduced by hybrid rotor as compared to single darrieus rotor 4 wake vortices zone has been observed on the trailing edge of the darrieus blade which is created by fluid recirculation due to turbine rotation the fluid recirculation dissipates the kinetic energy and a low velocity zone is formed in the downstream region of turbine rotor 5 the maximum value of power coefficient c pmax of a hybrid rotor is found as 37 97 higher than the single darrieus rotor the maximum average torque coefficient c tavg is found to be 35 88 higher than the single darrieus rotor based on the above outcomes it is found that the performance power coefficient of the hybrid rotor as well as the self starting capability average torque coefficient has improved although the parameters of the individual rotor have entirely different characteristics however the hybrid rotor has different characteristics from the individual rotor the systematic design of hybrid rotor parameters leads to suitable rotor for hydrokinetic turbine having better power coefficient and starting behaviour the numerical results obtained under the present study will be considered by

22051,a dynamic analysis model for the drilling riser was established and applied under normal drilling and hang off conditions by distinguishing the boundary condition this model was discretized by the fem and solved by newmark β method the correctness of this model was verified through an experiment results indicate that the lateral displacement distribution and riser stress increase with the current speed and platform drift distance a platform that drifts along the current is conducive to counteract the rotation of the upper joint but promotes the rotation of the bottom joint of the riser a riser that is approximately 2 000 m long under normal drilling condition can withstand the current loads for a 10 year return period the hang off riser should be evacuated after being disconnected from the bottom along with the current as soon as possible in addition the riser that evacuated under soft hang off condition can significantly reduce stress but enlarge the rotation angle of the upper flexible joint graphical abstract image 1 keywords drilling riser deep water finite element method rotation angle limitation safety 1 introduction riser is a pipe that connects the drilling platform and the underwater wellhead it is an indispensable equipment for the exploitation of offshore oil and natural gas resources the riser separates the drilling fluid and the seawater guides the drilling tools circulates the drilling fluid and supports the auxiliary pipelines the riser is very fragile under marine environments but its safety directly affects the safety and efficiency of deep water drilling operations offshore drilling inevitably faces the problem of complex marine environments especially deep water marine environments because marine environment loads such as wind waves currents earthquakes sea ice and tides pose a threat to the structural safety of marine drilling equipment during normal operations during extreme weather such as a typhoon the riser must be disconnected from the blowout preventer bop and suspended with the platform for evacuation because factors such as suspension condition and suspension evacuation speed also affect the safety of the equipment when the riser is excessively deformed or the local stress is excessive accidents such as the separation or breakage of the riser may occur therefore a comprehensive safety check of the riser is significant for the safe and efficient development of offshore petroleum resources scholars conducted many studies on the offshore drilling riser in which methods such as spectral method finite difference method time domain and frequency domain method atadan et al 1997 hong and shah 2018 and finite element method fem patel et al 1984 athisakul and chucheepsakul 2008 liu et al 2013a was applied to analyze the force and deformation characteristics of the riser several studies on the dynamic behavior of offshore drilling riser mao et al 2016 drąg ł 2017 yang et al 2018 suggest that the dynamic characteristics of the offshore drilling riser are mainly affected by factors such as longitudinal stress floating platform movement current speed wall thickness of the riser and buoyancy block diameter commercial analysis software such as orcaflex ansys and abaqus dai et al 2009 pham et al 2016 martins and avila 2019 were applied to analyze the mechanical behavior of marine structure it can often be used as a reference and an example for the verification of numerical models moreover many scholars investigated the stress and deformation of the hang off riser during evacuation and the reentry process after the disconnection dai et al 2009 liu et al 2013b xu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 discussed the sail strategy and hang off window and emphasized that the lateral stress of the deep water drilling riser can be suppressed by optimizing the buoyancy block layout thereby reducing the platform speed and dynamic loads many scholars analyzed the safety of the riser from some specific aspects based on the aforementioned studies liu et al 2014 established a fatigue damage model for the drilling riser by using the rain flow counting method and indicated that the fatigue damage could be controlled effectively by increasing the wall thickness properly wang et al 2015 examined the safety operation window of the riser in installation and found that the maximum equivalent stress was the main influencing factor that limited the installation operation window mao et al 2016 constructed an analysis model for the normal drilling riser conducted an experiment to verify the model and analyzed the influence of configuration current wind and platform drifting on the mechanical behavior of the riser chang et al 2018 proposed a methodology for the failure probability analysis of emergency disconnection ed operations using the bayesian network and considered active measures in the drilling riser system design drilling operation ed test and mitigation of ed failure probability iwona et al 2018 presented a spatial model of the riser by using the segment method and found that the optimized vertical movement of the riser could compensate for the horizontal movement and stabilize the force at the connection of the riser and a wellhead liu et al 2018 established an analysis model for a hard hang off riser considering the heave and horizontal movement of the platform and suggested that the evacuation speed and riser hang off length should be restricted to protect the hang off riser table 1 summarizes the research method work condition and key innovation points for the selected reported studies models that have considered normal drilling and hang off conditions are few and studies that have systemically evaluated riser safety under normal drilling and hang off conditions are rare this study focuses on the dynamic mechanical analysis of a riser in a harsh environment a nonlinear dynamic analysis model for the riser that considers the normal drilling and hang off conditions was established working conditions were categorized according to different boundaries the model was solved by fem in conjunction with newmark β method an experiment was conducted to compare the results to verify the correctness of the analysis model the mechanical behavior and safety of the riser under normal drilling and hang off conditions were analyzed suggestions are presented for the safe operation of risers according to the environmental conditions in the south china sea with focus on riser safety this paper mainly considers the riser strength and the vortex induced vibration viv was neglected 2 analysis model depending on the working environment the condition of deep water drilling riser may be normal drilling or hang off evacuation fig 1 shows the riser under normal drilling condition where the top of the riser is connected to the upper flexible joint and the bottom end is connected to the wellhead by a flexible joint the riser is mainly affected by loads of the marine environment in the horizontal direction and axial tension in the longitudinal direction when the platform needs to be evacuated the riser must be disconnected from the bop firstly the evacuation process is divided into hang off condition and evacuation condition for preferably analyzing the mechanical characteristics of riser during evacuation the riser is considered as under hang off condition when the drilling platform stays in the original place as shown in fig 2 when the platform is evacuated at a certain speed the riser is considered as under the evacuation condition as shown in fig 3 during platform evacuation the current resistance force generated by the riser motion can be regarded as the force generated by the current flow in the opposite direction the hang off condition of the riser is divided into hard hang off and soft hang off according to different connection methods at the top end the soft hang off riser is jointed to the platform by the flexible joint in the same way as normal drilling condition as shown in figs 2a and 3a the telescopic joint and tensioners bear the weight of riser and could absorb the vertical motions of the vessel it is suitable for the situations where the sea surface is greatly undulating or the time is too late to carry out the recycling operation while in hard hang off the tensioner system is released the diverter and upper flex joint are demounted and the top of the riser is directly suspended at the gimbal spider as shown in figs 2b and 3b ambrose et al 2001 brekke et al 2001 mao et al 2019 it is actually the most common riser hang off method during platform evacuation in oil field 2 1 riser model and governing equation the drilling riser can be regarded as a rigid round tube and with its length much larger than its diameter simplified as a concentric circular section continuous beam where the material is presumed homogeneous and isotropic a plane coordinate system the center is set at the top end of the riser the x axis is set as the platform motion direction and the z axis is set as the water depth direction is established the force diagram of the simplified riser beam and the micro body is presented in fig 4 according to the balance of force in lateral direction 1 v f z t d z f n v v z d z m 2 u t 2 d z f d 0 where v is the shearing force of the micro body n f z t is the lateral force under the marine environment n the equivalent force caused by the axial tension force and the damping force can be expressed as 2 f n t 2 u z 2 3 f d c u t d z where t is the tension force of riser n c is the riser damping coefficient the mass of the micro body per unit length m n m include the mass of riser and the inner fluid can be expressed as 4 m ρ r a o a i ρ f a i 5 a o π 4 d o 2 a i π 4 d i 2 where ρ r denotes the material density of riser kg m3 ρ f denotes the density of the inner fluid kg m3 a o is the outer cross sectional area m2 a i is the inner cross sectional area m2 d o is the outer diameter of riser m d i is the inner diameter of riser m according to the mechanics of materials the shear force can be represented as 6 v m z 7 m e i 2 u z 2 where ei is the riser bending stiffness n m 2 taking formula 2 7 into equation 1 then the differential governing equation of riser can be obtained 8 2 z 2 e i z 2 u z t z 2 m 2 u z t t 2 c u z t t t z 2 u z t z 2 f z t the above equations can be applied to normal drilling condition hang off condition and evacuation condition but the axial force under normal drilling condition is different from the hang off condition in consideration of normal drilling condition the two ends of the riser are constrained and the axial force mainly comes from the top tension the self weight and the buoyancy from the fluid 9 t z t top z l m g d z a o p o a i p i where t top is the top tension force of the riser n l is the length of the riser m after the bottom of the riser is disconnected from the bop the lmrp is suspended at the bottom of the riser since the lmrp usually weighs hundreds of tons heavy enough to make the riser deform the influence of the lmrp must be considered in the model therefore under the hang off condition and evacuation condition the axial force of the riser includes its gravity the gravity of lmrp at the bottom and the buoyancy from the fluid 10 t z m lmrp g z l m g d z a o p o a i p i where m lmrp is the mass of lmrp in water kg 2 2 boundary conditions the different working conditions and the different riser hang off conditions are mainly different in the upper and lower boundary conditions as shown in fig 5 a the upper end of the riser is connected to the platform with flexible joint under normal drilling conditions the rotational stiffness of the upper flexible joint is k u and the riser can move with the movement of the platform the lower end of the riser is connected to the bop and the rotation stiffness is k d therefore the boundary conditions of the riser under the normal drilling condition can be expressed as mao et al 2016 11 u 0 t s boat e i 2 u 0 t z 2 k u u 0 t z u l t 0 e i 2 u l t z 2 k d u l t z where s boat is the horizontal displacement of platform motion to its initial location m under the soft hang off condition the upper end of the riser jointed to the platform is in the way same as that of riser under normal drilling condition but the lower end of the riser is completely free as shown in fig 5b therefore the boundary condition of riser under soft hang off condition can be written as 12 u 0 t s boat e i 2 u 0 t z 2 k u u 0 t z u l 0 0 e i 2 u l t z 2 0 when the riser is connected to the platform under a hard hang off condition the top of the riser can be assumed to be fixed to the platform and the bottom is free from any restraint as shown in fig 5c so the boundary condition of riser under hard hang off condition can be written as 13 u 0 t s boat u l 0 0 e i 2 u l t z 2 0 2 3 von mises stress since the von mises stress failure criterion is one of the main design criteria it is used to analyze the safety of the riser the von mises stress can be calculated by api 2001 14 σ von 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 2 3 σ s where σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are the three principal stresses pa σ s is the yield stress of riser material pa 3 calculation of marine environment loads as most parts of the riser are submerged to seawater the main marine environment loads include loads of waves and current as risers are slender cylinders the main marine environment loads can be simulated by the morison equation morison et al 1950 15 f w z t 1 2 c d ρ w d v w d u d t v w d u d t c m ρ w π d 2 4 d v w d t c m ρ w π d 2 4 d v w d t d 2 u d t 2 where c d is the drag force coefficient ρ w is the density of seawater kg m3 d is the riser outer diameter m v w is the horizontal speed of the water m s u is the riser horizontal displacement m d u d t denotes the riser horizontal speed c m is the added mass coefficient c m is the inertia force coefficient which equals to c m 1 since the wave load barely affects the deformation of the riser mao et al 2016 the environmental loads in this model mainly considered the ocean current it is assumed that the current flows in a certain direction the distribution of the current velocity profile can be deduced by the recurrence period of ocean current in a specific sea area for evacuation with riser in hang off condition the desired track of the drilling platform may be different from the direction of the marine environment and the schematic for the desired track of drilling platform is shown in fig 6 4 the solution to the analysis model fem was used to solve the nonlinear riser analysis model the displacement field of the riser can be determined by the hermite interpolation time was divided into finite small periods and the riser dynamic response can be obtained through iterating time thus equation 1 could be solved by using the newmark β method according to hermite interpolation function the movement of one element fig 7 can be represented as warburton 1976 wilson 2003 16 u n q e 17 q e x 1 θ 1 x 2 θ 2 t θ i d u d z i 18 n n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 19 n 1 1 3 ξ

displacement was obtained by solving equation 28 and the speed and acceleration were calculated by taking the displacement into equation 27 the flowchart of the solution process is given in fig 8 5 validity of the analysis model an experiment was conducted to verify the validity of the calculation model fig 9 shows the sketch and photograph of the experimental facilities including the motor track system drilling riser and data acquisition system the motor track system pulled the drilling riser model to move along the horizontal track and a uniform flow was generated by simulating the relative movement between the riser and the water the experimental riser was made of polyvinyl chloride and both ends were connected by spherical joints fig 10 shows that 64 strain gauges attached to the riser in four directions collect the deformation data and their arrangements table 2 shows the main properties of the riser and the basic parameters in the experiment and numerical model the detailed experiment procedures and data processing methods used were in reference with the author s previous related literature mao et al 2015 the maximum experimental deformation of the riser was compared with the result calculated by the numerical model which adopted the parameters of the experiment fig 11 presents the comparative results of deformation between the experiment and the numerical models in which the maximum deformation occurs near the middle part of the riser and the experimental result is in good agreement with the numerical result thereby proving the correctness of our numerical model the slight difference of the results may be attributed to the effect of strain gauges and the electric wire on the experimental riser 6 case study and discussion the dynamic response characteristics of the riser in a deep water well in the south china sea were analyzed tables 3 and 4 show the main properties of the riser system and the configuration of riser string respectively mao et al 2016 abdelbaki et al 2019 table 5 lists the hydrodynamic properties of the south china sea fang et al 1987 mao et al 2016 and fig 12 illustrates the distribution of surface current speed in the south china sea in one to two hundred years fang et al 1987 qi 2015 the calculation time is set to the moment that the deformation and von mises stress reaches the maximum value the yield stress σ s of the riser is 80 ksi 551 6 mpa which is represented by the red bold imaginary line in the stress distribution figures chang et al 2012 the two thirds of yield stress 2 3 σ s is 53 3 ksi 367 7 mpa or is called warning stress which is represented by the yellow bold dash line in the stress distribution figures the platform and riser cannot work safely when the von mises stresses beyond the warning stress and the riser could be destroyed when the von mises stresses beyond the yield stress liu et al 2013b 2018 the rotation angles of the upper and bottom joints are also safety limitations of the riser the rotation angle limitation of the upper joint is 13 5 and the rotation angle limitation of the bottom joint is 9 iso 13624 1 2009 2009 bai et al 2005 6 1 dynamic analysis of riser under normal drilling condition fig 13 exhibits the cloud picture of riser deformation under normal drilling condition the lateral deformation of the riser gradually increases with time and tends to be stable after approximately 80 s the maximum deformation position is located in the middle of the riser the deformation of the riser with the impact of current is evident thereby posing a serious threat to its safety therefore the deformation and von mises stress under loads of current for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods corresponding 1 07 1 37 1 55 1 75 1 89 2 02 and 2 14 m s with consideration of platform drifting were selected to analyze the riser safety under normal drilling condition 6 1 1 deformation and stress distribution of riser under different current loads fig 14 a shows the deformation distribution of the riser under current loads for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods x year return period is abbreviated to x year or x years in the figures the riser is deformed into an arch shape under the action of seawater and the deformation reaches a maximum at 1107 32 m near the middle of the riser a riser that is under a normal drilling condition where two ends are hinged by the flexible joint can be simplified into a simply supported beam fig 5a warburton 1976 han et al 2018 where the loads near the water surface is significantly larger than those at the bottom end fig 12 thereby causing the occurrence of maximum deformation at the middle part of the riser 1099 69m such finding is consistent with the results in existing research liu et al 2013a mao et al 2016 drąg ł 2017 fig 14b presents the distribution of von mises stress to the riser under loads of current for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods the maximum von mises stress appears at 2170 06 m then sharply declines along the water depth because the water surface at 2 170 06 m is the load boundary where no hydraulic force is applied to risers above the water surface mao et al 2016 the sharp changes in the von mises stress near the top position is mainly attributed to the common influence of the huge current load wall thicknesses and the buoyancy module configuration of the riser near the water surface patel et al 1984 liu et al 2013a li et al 2013 the deformation and von mises stress of the riser increases with the current speed the morison equation eq 15 stated that the hydraulic force is in direct proportion to the current speed hence the acceleration in the surface current speed cloud increases the overall loads thereby resulting in the increment in deformation and von mises stress morison et al 1950 in this section the platform and the subsea wellhead are always in constant coordinate position however the platform may drift under the drag of the current and additional power must be applied to fix the platform which will increase energy cost therefore analyzing the influence of the platform drifting distance on the deformation distribution and riser stress is essential 6 1 2 influence of platform drifting on the deformation and stress distribution of the riser the platform drifting distance could be represented by the percentage of seawater depth e g platform drift 1 with seawater depth of 2199 m means that the drifting distance is 21 99 m which may considerably affect riser mechanical behavior mao et al 2016 in this section the drift direction is set to be consistent with the current direction figs 14 17 show the effect of the current speed on the mechanical characters of the riser deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser under loads of current for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods with drifting distance of 1 2 and 3 fig 18 shows the effect of platform drifting distance on the mechanical behavior of the riser deformation distribution and riser stress under loads of current for 1 year with drifting distance of 0 1 2 and 3 the deformation and von mises stress of the riser increase with the drifting distance because the initial shape of the riser becomes inclined after the platform drifts the riser was already in a bent state without fluid effect black bold line in fig 19 when the ocean current acts on the riser the latter bends further based on the initial bending and the bending direction remains the same red line in fig 19 the bending and stress of the riser multiplied the effect of platform drifting and the current is large furthermore the increase in the current speed after the platform drifts cause the riser stress to further intensify and even exceed the yield stress fig 20 shows that the maximum deformation and maximum von mises increase with the drifting distance and surface current speed the maximum displacement position goes upward as the drifting distance increases and this trend becomes evident when the current speed is small fig 21 as the top end drifts with the platform the upper part of the riser will have an initial displacement the upper part easily reaches the maximum value when the riser is deformed in the x direction mao et al 2016 drąg ł 2017 the variations of rotation angles at the top and bottom joint of the normal drilling riser under the action of currents and platform drift are quite different the rotation angle at the top joint increases with the current speed but decreases with the increase in platform drifts fig 22 although the rotation angle at the bottom joint increases with the current speed and platform drifting the increment in the current speed increases the overall deformation of the riser thereby causing the rotation angle at the top and bottom to rise the riser becomes an inclined pipe after the platform drifts along the current speed direction where both joints have already rotated the initial rotation direction of the riser is opposite to the direction caused by the current for the upper joint hence platform drifting can counteract the rotation of the riser top joint caused by the current the rotation direction caused by the platform drifting and current is the same for the bottom joint hence the platform drift promotes the rotation of the riser bottom joint therefore platform drifting significantly increases the deformation of the riser and von mises stress and changes the curve shape of the riser deformation the maximum deformation position of the riser moves up as the drifting distance increases whereas the position where the maximum von mises stress appears is always near the water surface the rotation angle of the riser flexible joint increases with the current speed the rotation angle of the upper flexible joint decreases as the platform drift increases and that of the bottom flexible joint increases with the platform drift 6 1 3 safety analysis of the riser with ocean current and platform drifting figs 14b and 20b show that the von mises stress of the riser without platform drifting is lower than the warning stress value under the loads of current for 1 5 and 10 yearreturn periods but exceeds the yield stress under the load for a 200 year return period fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint reaches the limitation when the current is larger than that at the 50 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint reaches the limitation when the current is larger than that at a 10 year return period therefore the riser without platform drifting can withstand the current loads for 10 years figs 15b and 20b show that the von mises stress of the riser is lower than the warning stress value under loads of current for 1 and 5 year return periods but exceeds the yield stress under the load for 100 year return period when the drifting distance is 1 fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint reaches the limitation when the current reaches the 100 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint exceeds the limitation when the current reaches the 10 year return period therefore the riser with 1 platform drifting can withstand the current loads until the 5 year return period according to figs 16b and 20b the von mises stress of the riser with 2 platform drifting is lower than the warning stress value under loads of current for the 1 year return period but exceeds the yield stress under the load for the 20 year return period fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint does not exceed the limitation under the current that is smaller than that in the 100 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint reaches the limitation when the current is larger than 5 year return period therefore the riser with 2 platform drifting can only withstand the current loads for 1 year according to figs 17b and 20b the von mises stress of the riser with 3 platform drifting exceeds the warning stress value under loads of current even for the 1 year return period fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint does not exceed the limitation under the current that is smaller than that in the 100 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint exceeds the limitation when the current reaches 5 years therefore the riser with 3 platform drifting cannot even withstand the current loads for 1 year a platform without restrain is easy to drift under the act of ocean current and the deformation and stress of the riser increase with the platform drifting distance thereby increasing the riser stress to surpass the maximum allowance stress thus platform drifting must be strictly constrained through dynamic positioning 6 2 dynamic analysis of riser under the hang off condition the platform is fixed by a dynamic positioning system where the platform movement is set as zero under the hang off condition given that the deformation of the riser is serious under the current loads for 1 year analyzing and comparing become inconvenient where the surface current speeds were taken as 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s fig 23 shows the cloud picture of riser deformation with current speed of 0 8 m s under hard and soft hang off conditions the hang off riser gradually deforms with time and stabilized at approximately 80 s where the maximum deformation appears at the bottom end in addition the deformation of the soft hang off riser is significantly more fluctuant than that of the hard hang off riser fig 24 shows the deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser when the current speeds are 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s under the hard hang off condition the riser deformation increases with the water depth and reaches a maximum at the bottom of the riser the von mises stress of the riser increase from its bottom end to the sea surface and reach the maximum at the top end because the riser is fixed to the platform at the upper end where the stress concentration phenomenon occurs mao et al 2019 thereby enabling the stress to reach its maximum at the junction prat given that the current speed decreases in the water depth direction the riser stress gradually decreases dai et al 2009 li et al 2013 wang et al 2015 fig 25 shows the deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser when the current speeds are 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s under soft hang off condition the riser deformation increases with water depth and reaches a maximum at the bottom of the riser the von mises stress of the riser increases from the bottom end to the water surface thereby reaching the maximum near the water surface but rapidly decreases and approaches zero at the top end this phenomenon occurs because the riser under soft hang off condition is connected to the platform with a flexible joint which allows the joint to rotate therefore the riser deforms like an undulating rope and the von mises stress approaches near zero at the top liu et al 2013b the maximum stress occurs at the water surface because of the hydraulic force boundary fig 26 a shows that the maximum deformation and von mises stress of the riser under the hard hang off condition soft hang off condition with the current speeds are 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s when the current speed is 0 4 m s the maximum stress 364 9 mpa of the riser under the hard hang off condition becomes lower than the warning stress value 367 7 mpa when the current speed reaches 0 6 m s von mises stress 628 6 mpa exceeds the yield stress value 551 6 mpa when the current speed is 0 4 m s the maximum von mises stress 329 9 mpa of the riser under soft hang off condition lower than the warning stress value 367 7 mpa when the current speed reaches 0 8 m s von mises stress 766 26 exceeds the yield stress value 551 6 mpa in addition fig 27 a shows that the rotation angle of the upper flexible joint of riser under soft hang off condition exceeds the limitation angle when the current speed reaches 0 6 m s correspondingly the deformation and stress of the riser under hard and soft hang off conditions increase with the current speed the riser deformation under the soft hang off condition is larger than that under the hard hang off condition figs 24a and 25a the maximum von mises stress of the riser under the hard hang off condition is greater than that under the soft hang off condition figs 24b and 25b this finding is consistent with the existing research results chang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 2016 in summary the deformation and von mises stress of the hang off riser increase with the current the most fragile part of the hard hang off riser is located at the junction of the riser and the platform the riser that evacuated under the soft hang off condition can reduce stress significantly but the large rotation angle at the upper flexible joint may affect the affiliated equipment of the platform the hard hang off riser can withstand the current speed of 0 4 m s because of stress limitation whereas the soft hang off riser can withstand 0 6 m s but can only withstand 0 4 m s with the rotation angle limitation according to the stress limitation 6 3 dynamic analysis of riser under evacuation condition the dynamic characteristics of the riser under hang off evacuating condition including hard and soft hang off conditions are discussed and compared in this section during platform evacuation the platform with a hang off riser evacuates along the current direction at the speed of 1 knot 0 5144 m s the surface current for 1 5 10 and 20 year return periods were selected to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the riser the calculation parameters were set to be the same as those under the hang off condition figs 28 and 29 show the deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser under hard and soft hang off conditions with 1 knot platform speed under the loads for 1 5 10 and 20 year return period the distribution of riser deformation and stress during evacuation are similar to those under the hang off condition however the deformation of the riser figs 28a and 29a is first increased rapidly and then slowly from the water surface along with the water depth thus the deformation curve lower than 1000 m is almost vertical the platform evacuation speed is 1 knot 0 5144 m s which is less than the surface velocity of the current in one year the current loads rapidly decrease from the water surface to the deep water until they become close to the platform evacuation speed below 1760 m hence the increase in the riser deformation in the deep water section is small eq 15 wang et al 2015 fig 26b shows the maximum values of deformation and von mises stress under the loads for 1 5 10 and 20 year return periods when the platform is evacuated with a hang off riser with the speed at 1 knot the von mises stress of the riser under hard hang off condition exceeds the yield stress value after the current speed reaches 1 35 m s the riser can withstand the loads for at least one year the von mises stress of the riser under soft hang off condition exceeds the yield stress value and the rotation when the current speed reaches 1 42 m s however fig 27b shows that the rotation angle exceeds the limitation at the current speed of the 5 year return period therefore the riser under soft hang off evacuation condition can withstand the loads at least 1 year in comparison with the platform fixed to the original position the deformation and stress of the riser are reduced when the platform is evacuated along the current direction because the difference between the platform speed and the surface current speed decreases as the platform speed changes from 0 to 1 knot when evacuating along with the current as a result the actual loads of the entire riser are reduced and the displacement and von mises stress are also reduced thereby enabling the riser to withstand high current loads qi 2015 liu et al 2017 therefore instead of keeping the platform fixed evacuating the platform along the current direction is suitable to the riser 6 4 safety discussion and engineering proposals the riser under normal drilling condition and without drift can work safely under loads for a 10 year return period in consideration of stress and rotation safety the riser can withstand the current loads for a 5 year return period when the drifting distance is 1 the riser can only withstand the current loads for a 1 year return period when the drifting case is 2 the riser cannot even withstand the current loads for 1 year when the drifting distance is 3 countermeasures must be taken for restraining platform drift according to the current loads a yellow alarm indicates that the riser system is disconnected when the platform drift distance is greater than 1 of the water depth if the platform drift distance is close to 2 or even more than 3 of the water depth then the riser system must be disconnected kou et al 2015 hang off riser can only resist the current loads of 0 4 m s under hard and soft hang off conditions when the platform is evacuated with a hang off riser with the speed of 1 knot the riser can withstand the loads for at least a 1 year return period under hard and soft hang off conditions the hang off riser should be evacuated after being disconnected from the bottom along with the current as soon as possible furthermore the riser that is evacuated under soft hang off condition can significantly reduce stress but the large rotation angle at the upper flexible joint may affect the affiliated equipment of the platform therefore hard hang off can also be an appropriate way to evacuate the platform and riser 7 conclusion a dynamic analysis model for a riser under normal drilling and hang off conditions was established the effectiveness of this model was verified by a similar experiment the dynamic characteristics of the riser and the drift limitation under the normal drilling condition and the mechanical behavior of hang off riser were analyzed and found that the deformation and von mises stress increases with the ocean current speed the riser deformation reaches a maximum near the middle part and the von mises stress of the riser reaches a maximum near the water surface under normal drilling condition platform drifting significantly increases the deformation and the von mises stress of the riser the maximum deformation of the riser occurs at the upper part when the platform drifting distance increase whereas the maximum von mises stress of the riser always occurs near the water surface the riser with a length of approximately 2000 m can withstand the current loads of the 10 year return period the deformation reaches the maximum at the bottom end whereas the von mises stress reaches the maximum at the upper end under the hard hang off condition and at the water surface under soft hang off condition for hang off riser the soft hang off riser can easily exceed the rotation angle limitation with smaller von mises stress than hard hang off hard and soft hang off risers can resist the current loads at least 0 4 m s when they disconnected from the bottom but not evacuated when the platform is evacuated at 1 knot along the current direction the hard hang off riser can withstand the current loads for at least a 1 year return period subject to the yield stress where the soft hang off riser can withstand the current loads for up to a 1 year return period subject to the rotation angle limitation of the upper joint results can guide the design and protect the riser under different ocean and working conditions several intriguing topics such as stress optimization the dynamic characteristics of the riser during disconnection and the dynamic characteristics and safety analysis of 3 d risers are worth

22051,a dynamic analysis model for the drilling riser was established and applied under normal drilling and hang off conditions by distinguishing the boundary condition this model was discretized by the fem and solved by newmark β method the correctness of this model was verified through an experiment results indicate that the lateral displacement distribution and riser stress increase with the current speed and platform drift distance a platform that drifts along the current is conducive to counteract the rotation of the upper joint but promotes the rotation of the bottom joint of the riser a riser that is approximately 2 000 m long under normal drilling condition can withstand the current loads for a 10 year return period the hang off riser should be evacuated after being disconnected from the bottom along with the current as soon as possible in addition the riser that evacuated under soft hang off condition can significantly reduce stress but enlarge the rotation angle of the upper flexible joint graphical abstract image 1 keywords drilling riser deep water finite element method rotation angle limitation safety 1 introduction riser is a pipe that connects the drilling platform and the underwater wellhead it is an indispensable equipment for the exploitation of offshore oil and natural gas resources the riser separates the drilling fluid and the seawater guides the drilling tools circulates the drilling fluid and supports the auxiliary pipelines the riser is very fragile under marine environments but its safety directly affects the safety and efficiency of deep water drilling operations offshore drilling inevitably faces the problem of complex marine environments especially deep water marine environments because marine environment loads such as wind waves currents earthquakes sea ice and tides pose a threat to the structural safety of marine drilling equipment during normal operations during extreme weather such as a typhoon the riser must be disconnected from the blowout preventer bop and suspended with the platform for evacuation because factors such as suspension condition and suspension evacuation speed also affect the safety of the equipment when the riser is excessively deformed or the local stress is excessive accidents such as the separation or breakage of the riser may occur therefore a comprehensive safety check of the riser is significant for the safe and efficient development of offshore petroleum resources scholars conducted many studies on the offshore drilling riser in which methods such as spectral method finite difference method time domain and frequency domain method atadan et al 1997 hong and shah 2018 and finite element method fem patel et al 1984 athisakul and chucheepsakul 2008 liu et al 2013a was applied to analyze the force and deformation characteristics of the riser several studies on the dynamic behavior of offshore drilling riser mao et al 2016 drąg ł 2017 yang et al 2018 suggest that the dynamic characteristics of the offshore drilling riser are mainly affected by factors such as longitudinal stress floating platform movement current speed wall thickness of the riser and buoyancy block diameter commercial analysis software such as orcaflex ansys and abaqus dai et al 2009 pham et al 2016 martins and avila 2019 were applied to analyze the mechanical behavior of marine structure it can often be used as a reference and an example for the verification of numerical models moreover many scholars investigated the stress and deformation of the hang off riser during evacuation and the reentry process after the disconnection dai et al 2009 liu et al 2013b xu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 discussed the sail strategy and hang off window and emphasized that the lateral stress of the deep water drilling riser can be suppressed by optimizing the buoyancy block layout thereby reducing the platform speed and dynamic loads many scholars analyzed the safety of the riser from some specific aspects based on the aforementioned studies liu et al 2014 established a fatigue damage model for the drilling riser by using the rain flow counting method and indicated that the fatigue damage could be controlled effectively by increasing the wall thickness properly wang et al 2015 examined the safety operation window of the riser in installation and found that the maximum equivalent stress was the main influencing factor that limited the installation operation window mao et al 2016 constructed an analysis model for the normal drilling riser conducted an experiment to verify the model and analyzed the influence of configuration current wind and platform drifting on the mechanical behavior of the riser chang et al 2018 proposed a methodology for the failure probability analysis of emergency disconnection ed operations using the bayesian network and considered active measures in the drilling riser system design drilling operation ed test and mitigation of ed failure probability iwona et al 2018 presented a spatial model of the riser by using the segment method and found that the optimized vertical movement of the riser could compensate for the horizontal movement and stabilize the force at the connection of the riser and a wellhead liu et al 2018 established an analysis model for a hard hang off riser considering the heave and horizontal movement of the platform and suggested that the evacuation speed and riser hang off length should be restricted to protect the hang off riser table 1 summarizes the research method work condition and key innovation points for the selected reported studies models that have considered normal drilling and hang off conditions are few and studies that have systemically evaluated riser safety under normal drilling and hang off conditions are rare this study focuses on the dynamic mechanical analysis of a riser in a harsh environment a nonlinear dynamic analysis model for the riser that considers the normal drilling and hang off conditions was established working conditions were categorized according to different boundaries the model was solved by fem in conjunction with newmark β method an experiment was conducted to compare the results to verify the correctness of the analysis model the mechanical behavior and safety of the riser under normal drilling and hang off conditions were analyzed suggestions are presented for the safe operation of risers according to the environmental conditions in the south china sea with focus on riser safety this paper mainly considers the riser strength and the vortex induced vibration viv was neglected 2 analysis model depending on the working environment the condition of deep water drilling riser may be normal drilling or hang off evacuation fig 1 shows the riser under normal drilling condition where the top of the riser is connected to the upper flexible joint and the bottom end is connected to the wellhead by a flexible joint the riser is mainly affected by loads of the marine environment in the horizontal direction and axial tension in the longitudinal direction when the platform needs to be evacuated the riser must be disconnected from the bop firstly the evacuation process is divided into hang off condition and evacuation condition for preferably analyzing the mechanical characteristics of riser during evacuation the riser is considered as under hang off condition when the drilling platform stays in the original place as shown in fig 2 when the platform is evacuated at a certain speed the riser is considered as under the evacuation condition as shown in fig 3 during platform evacuation the current resistance force generated by the riser motion can be regarded as the force generated by the current flow in the opposite direction the hang off condition of the riser is divided into hard hang off and soft hang off according to different connection methods at the top end the soft hang off riser is jointed to the platform by the flexible joint in the same way as normal drilling condition as shown in figs 2a and 3a the telescopic joint and tensioners bear the weight of riser and could absorb the vertical motions of the vessel it is suitable for the situations where the sea surface is greatly undulating or the time is too late to carry out the recycling operation while in hard hang off the tensioner system is released the diverter and upper flex joint are demounted and the top of the riser is directly suspended at the gimbal spider as shown in figs 2b and 3b ambrose et al 2001 brekke et al 2001 mao et al 2019 it is actually the most common riser hang off method during platform evacuation in oil field 2 1 riser model and governing equation the drilling riser can be regarded as a rigid round tube and with its length much larger than its diameter simplified as a concentric circular section continuous beam where the material is presumed homogeneous and isotropic a plane coordinate system the center is set at the top end of the riser the x axis is set as the platform motion direction and the z axis is set as the water depth direction is established the force diagram of the simplified riser beam and the micro body is presented in fig 4 according to the balance of force in lateral direction 1 v f z t d z f n v v z d z m 2 u t 2 d z f d 0 where v is the shearing force of the micro body n f z t is the lateral force under the marine environment n the equivalent force caused by the axial tension force and the damping force can be expressed as 2 f n t 2 u z 2 3 f d c u t d z where t is the tension force of riser n c is the riser damping coefficient the mass of the micro body per unit length m n m include the mass of riser and the inner fluid can be expressed as 4 m ρ r a o a i ρ f a i 5 a o π 4 d o 2 a i π 4 d i 2 where ρ r denotes the material density of riser kg m3 ρ f denotes the density of the inner fluid kg m3 a o is the outer cross sectional area m2 a i is the inner cross sectional area m2 d o is the outer diameter of riser m d i is the inner diameter of riser m according to the mechanics of materials the shear force can be represented as 6 v m z 7 m e i 2 u z 2 where ei is the riser bending stiffness n m 2 taking formula 2 7 into equation 1 then the differential governing equation of riser can be obtained 8 2 z 2 e i z 2 u z t z 2 m 2 u z t t 2 c u z t t t z 2 u z t z 2 f z t the above equations can be applied to normal drilling condition hang off condition and evacuation condition but the axial force under normal drilling condition is different from the hang off condition in consideration of normal drilling condition the two ends of the riser are constrained and the axial force mainly comes from the top tension the self weight and the buoyancy from the fluid 9 t z t top z l m g d z a o p o a i p i where t top is the top tension force of the riser n l is the length of the riser m after the bottom of the riser is disconnected from the bop the lmrp is suspended at the bottom of the riser since the lmrp usually weighs hundreds of tons heavy enough to make the riser deform the influence of the lmrp must be considered in the model therefore under the hang off condition and evacuation condition the axial force of the riser includes its gravity the gravity of lmrp at the bottom and the buoyancy from the fluid 10 t z m lmrp g z l m g d z a o p o a i p i where m lmrp is the mass of lmrp in water kg 2 2 boundary conditions the different working conditions and the different riser hang off conditions are mainly different in the upper and lower boundary conditions as shown in fig 5 a the upper end of the riser is connected to the platform with flexible joint under normal drilling conditions the rotational stiffness of the upper flexible joint is k u and the riser can move with the movement of the platform the lower end of the riser is connected to the bop and the rotation stiffness is k d therefore the boundary conditions of the riser under the normal drilling condition can be expressed as mao et al 2016 11 u 0 t s boat e i 2 u 0 t z 2 k u u 0 t z u l t 0 e i 2 u l t z 2 k d u l t z where s boat is the horizontal displacement of platform motion to its initial location m under the soft hang off condition the upper end of the riser jointed to the platform is in the way same as that of riser under normal drilling condition but the lower end of the riser is completely free as shown in fig 5b therefore the boundary condition of riser under soft hang off condition can be written as 12 u 0 t s boat e i 2 u 0 t z 2 k u u 0 t z u l 0 0 e i 2 u l t z 2 0 when the riser is connected to the platform under a hard hang off condition the top of the riser can be assumed to be fixed to the platform and the bottom is free from any restraint as shown in fig 5c so the boundary condition of riser under hard hang off condition can be written as 13 u 0 t s boat u l 0 0 e i 2 u l t z 2 0 2 3 von mises stress since the von mises stress failure criterion is one of the main design criteria it is used to analyze the safety of the riser the von mises stress can be calculated by api 2001 14 σ von 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 2 3 σ s where σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are the three principal stresses pa σ s is the yield stress of riser material pa 3 calculation of marine environment loads as most parts of the riser are submerged to seawater the main marine environment loads include loads of waves and current as risers are slender cylinders the main marine environment loads can be simulated by the morison equation morison et al 1950 15 f w z t 1 2 c d ρ w d v w d u d t v w d u d t c m ρ w π d 2 4 d v w d t c m ρ w π d 2 4 d v w d t d 2 u d t 2 where c d is the drag force coefficient ρ w is the density of seawater kg m3 d is the riser outer diameter m v w is the horizontal speed of the water m s u is the riser horizontal displacement m d u d t denotes the riser horizontal speed c m is the added mass coefficient c m is the inertia force coefficient which equals to c m 1 since the wave load barely affects the deformation of the riser mao et al 2016 the environmental loads in this model mainly considered the ocean current it is assumed that the current flows in a certain direction the distribution of the current velocity profile can be deduced by the recurrence period of ocean current in a specific sea area for evacuation with riser in hang off condition the desired track of the drilling platform may be different from the direction of the marine environment and the schematic for the desired track of drilling platform is shown in fig 6 4 the solution to the analysis model fem was used to solve the nonlinear riser analysis model the displacement field of the riser can be determined by the hermite interpolation time was divided into finite small periods and the riser dynamic response can be obtained through iterating time thus equation 1 could be solved by using the newmark β method according to hermite interpolation function the movement of one element fig 7 can be represented as warburton 1976 wilson 2003 16 u n q e 17 q e x 1 θ 1 x 2 θ 2 t θ i d u d z i 18 n n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 19 n 1 1 3 ξ

validity of the analysis model an experiment was conducted to verify the validity of the calculation model fig 9 shows the sketch and photograph of the experimental facilities including the motor track system drilling riser and data acquisition system the motor track system pulled the drilling riser model to move along the horizontal track and a uniform flow was generated by simulating the relative movement between the riser and the water the experimental riser was made of polyvinyl chloride and both ends were connected by spherical joints fig 10 shows that 64 strain gauges attached to the riser in four directions collect the deformation data and their arrangements table 2 shows the main properties of the riser and the basic parameters in the experiment and numerical model the detailed experiment procedures and data processing methods used were in reference with the author s previous related literature mao et al 2015 the maximum experimental deformation of the riser was compared with the result calculated by the numerical model which adopted the parameters of the experiment fig 11 presents the comparative results of deformation between the experiment and the numerical models in which the maximum deformation occurs near the middle part of the riser and the experimental result is in good agreement with the numerical result thereby proving the correctness of our numerical model the slight difference of the results may be attributed to the effect of strain gauges and the electric wire on the experimental riser 6 case study and discussion the dynamic response characteristics of the riser in a deep water well in the south china sea were analyzed tables 3 and 4 show the main properties of the riser system and the configuration of riser string respectively mao et al 2016 abdelbaki et al 2019 table 5 lists the hydrodynamic properties of the south china sea fang et al 1987 mao et al 2016 and fig 12 illustrates the distribution of surface current speed in the south china sea in one to two hundred years fang et al 1987 qi 2015 the calculation time is set to the moment that the deformation and von mises stress reaches the maximum value the yield stress σ s of the riser is 80 ksi 551 6 mpa which is represented by the red bold imaginary line in the stress distribution figures chang et al 2012 the two thirds of yield stress 2 3 σ s is 53 3 ksi 367 7 mpa or is called warning stress which is represented by the yellow bold dash line in the stress distribution figures the platform and riser cannot work safely when the von mises stresses beyond the warning stress and the riser could be destroyed when the von mises stresses beyond the yield stress liu et al 2013b 2018 the rotation angles of the upper and bottom joints are also safety limitations of the riser the rotation angle limitation of the upper joint is 13 5 and the rotation angle limitation of the bottom joint is 9 iso 13624 1 2009 2009 bai et al 2005 6 1 dynamic analysis of riser under normal drilling condition fig 13 exhibits the cloud picture of riser deformation under normal drilling condition the lateral deformation of the riser gradually increases with time and tends to be stable after approximately 80 s the maximum deformation position is located in the middle of the riser the deformation of the riser with the impact of current is evident thereby posing a serious threat to its safety therefore the deformation and von mises stress under loads of current for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods corresponding 1 07 1 37 1 55 1 75 1 89 2 02 and 2 14 m s with consideration of platform drifting were selected to analyze the riser safety under normal drilling condition 6 1 1 deformation and stress distribution of riser under different current loads fig 14 a shows the deformation distribution of the riser under current loads for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods x year return period is abbreviated to x year or x years in the figures the riser is deformed into an arch shape under the action of seawater and the deformation reaches a maximum at 1107 32 m near the middle of the riser a riser that is under a normal drilling condition where two ends are hinged by the flexible joint can be simplified into a simply supported beam fig 5a warburton 1976 han et al 2018 where the loads near the water surface is significantly larger than those at the bottom end fig 12 thereby causing the occurrence of maximum deformation at the middle part of the riser 1099 69m such finding is consistent with the results in existing research liu et al 2013a mao et al 2016 drąg ł 2017 fig 14b presents the distribution of von mises stress to the riser under loads of current for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods the maximum von mises stress appears at 2170 06 m then sharply declines along the water depth because the water surface at 2 170 06 m is the load boundary where no hydraulic force is applied to risers above the water surface mao et al 2016 the sharp changes in the von mises stress near the top position is mainly attributed to the common influence of the huge current load wall thicknesses and the buoyancy module configuration of the riser near the water surface patel et al 1984 liu et al 2013a li et al 2013 the deformation and von mises stress of the riser increases with the current speed the morison equation eq 15 stated that the hydraulic force is in direct proportion to the current speed hence the acceleration in the surface current speed cloud increases the overall loads thereby resulting in the increment in deformation and von mises stress morison et al 1950 in this section the platform and the subsea wellhead are always in constant coordinate position however the platform may drift under the drag of the current and additional power must be applied to fix the platform which will increase energy cost therefore analyzing the influence of the platform drifting distance on the deformation distribution and riser stress is essential 6 1 2 influence of platform drifting on the deformation and stress distribution of the riser the platform drifting distance could be represented by the percentage of seawater depth e g platform drift 1 with seawater depth of 2199 m means that the drifting distance is 21 99 m which may considerably affect riser mechanical behavior mao et al 2016 in this section the drift direction is set to be consistent with the current direction figs 14 17 show the effect of the current speed on the mechanical characters of the riser deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser under loads of current for 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 year return periods with drifting distance of 1 2 and 3 fig 18 shows the effect of platform drifting distance on the mechanical behavior of the riser deformation distribution and riser stress under loads of current for 1 year with drifting distance of 0 1 2 and 3 the deformation and von mises stress of the riser increase with the drifting distance because the initial shape of the riser becomes inclined after the platform drifts the riser was already in a bent state without fluid effect black bold line in fig 19 when the ocean current acts on the riser the latter bends further based on the initial bending and the bending direction remains the same red line in fig 19 the bending and stress of the riser multiplied the effect of platform drifting and the current is large furthermore the increase in the current speed after the platform drifts cause the riser stress to further intensify and even exceed the yield stress fig 20 shows that the maximum deformation and maximum von mises increase with the drifting distance and surface current speed the maximum displacement position goes upward as the drifting distance increases and this trend becomes evident when the current speed is small fig 21 as the top end drifts with the platform the upper part of the riser will have an initial displacement the upper part easily reaches the maximum value when the riser is deformed in the x direction mao et al 2016 drąg ł 2017 the variations of rotation angles at the top and bottom joint of the normal drilling riser under the action of currents and platform drift are quite different the rotation angle at the top joint increases with the current speed but decreases with the increase in platform drifts fig 22 although the rotation angle at the bottom joint increases with the current speed and platform drifting the increment in the current speed increases the overall deformation of the riser thereby causing the rotation angle at the top and bottom to rise the riser becomes an inclined pipe after the platform drifts along the current speed direction where both joints have already rotated the initial rotation direction of the riser is opposite to the direction caused by the current for the upper joint hence platform drifting can counteract the rotation of the riser top joint caused by the current the rotation direction caused by the platform drifting and current is the same for the bottom joint hence the platform drift promotes the rotation of the riser bottom joint therefore platform drifting significantly increases the deformation of the riser and von mises stress and changes the curve shape of the riser deformation the maximum deformation position of the riser moves up as the drifting distance increases whereas the position where the maximum von mises stress appears is always near the water surface the rotation angle of the riser flexible joint increases with the current speed the rotation angle of the upper flexible joint decreases as the platform drift increases and that of the bottom flexible joint increases with the platform drift 6 1 3 safety analysis of the riser with ocean current and platform drifting figs 14b and 20b show that the von mises stress of the riser without platform drifting is lower than the warning stress value under the loads of current for 1 5 and 10 yearreturn periods but exceeds the yield stress under the load for a 200 year return period fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint reaches the limitation when the current is larger than that at the 50 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint reaches the limitation when the current is larger than that at a 10 year return period therefore the riser without platform drifting can withstand the current loads for 10 years figs 15b and 20b show that the von mises stress of the riser is lower than the warning stress value under loads of current for 1 and 5 year return periods but exceeds the yield stress under the load for 100 year return period when the drifting distance is 1 fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint reaches the limitation when the current reaches the 100 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint exceeds the limitation when the current reaches the 10 year return period therefore the riser with 1 platform drifting can withstand the current loads until the 5 year return period according to figs 16b and 20b the von mises stress of the riser with 2 platform drifting is lower than the warning stress value under loads of current for the 1 year return period but exceeds the yield stress under the load for the 20 year return period fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint does not exceed the limitation under the current that is smaller than that in the 100 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint reaches the limitation when the current is larger than 5 year return period therefore the riser with 2 platform drifting can only withstand the current loads for 1 year according to figs 17b and 20b the von mises stress of the riser with 3 platform drifting exceeds the warning stress value under loads of current even for the 1 year return period fig 22 shows that the rotation angle of the upper joint does not exceed the limitation under the current that is smaller than that in the 100 year return period whereas the rotation angle of the bottom joint exceeds the limitation when the current reaches 5 years therefore the riser with 3 platform drifting cannot even withstand the current loads for 1 year a platform without restrain is easy to drift under the act of ocean current and the deformation and stress of the riser increase with the platform drifting distance thereby increasing the riser stress to surpass the maximum allowance stress thus platform drifting must be strictly constrained through dynamic positioning 6 2 dynamic analysis of riser under the hang off condition the platform is fixed by a dynamic positioning system where the platform movement is set as zero under the hang off condition given that the deformation of the riser is serious under the current loads for 1 year analyzing and comparing become inconvenient where the surface current speeds were taken as 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s fig 23 shows the cloud picture of riser deformation with current speed of 0 8 m s under hard and soft hang off conditions the hang off riser gradually deforms with time and stabilized at approximately 80 s where the maximum deformation appears at the bottom end in addition the deformation of the soft hang off riser is significantly more fluctuant than that of the hard hang off riser fig 24 shows the deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser when the current speeds are 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s under the hard hang off condition the riser deformation increases with the water depth and reaches a maximum at the bottom of the riser the von mises stress of the riser increase from its bottom end to the sea surface and reach the maximum at the top end because the riser is fixed to the platform at the upper end where the stress concentration phenomenon occurs mao et al 2019 thereby enabling the stress to reach its maximum at the junction prat given that the current speed decreases in the water depth direction the riser stress gradually decreases dai et al 2009 li et al 2013 wang et al 2015 fig 25 shows the deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser when the current speeds are 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s under soft hang off condition the riser deformation increases with water depth and reaches a maximum at the bottom of the riser the von mises stress of the riser increases from the bottom end to the water surface thereby reaching the maximum near the water surface but rapidly decreases and approaches zero at the top end this phenomenon occurs because the riser under soft hang off condition is connected to the platform with a flexible joint which allows the joint to rotate therefore the riser deforms like an undulating rope and the von mises stress approaches near zero at the top liu et al 2013b the maximum stress occurs at the water surface because of the hydraulic force boundary fig 26 a shows that the maximum deformation and von mises stress of the riser under the hard hang off condition soft hang off condition with the current speeds are 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m s when the current speed is 0 4 m s the maximum stress 364 9 mpa of the riser under the hard hang off condition becomes lower than the warning stress value 367 7 mpa when the current speed reaches 0 6 m s von mises stress 628 6 mpa exceeds the yield stress value 551 6 mpa when the current speed is 0 4 m s the maximum von mises stress 329 9 mpa of the riser under soft hang off condition lower than the warning stress value 367 7 mpa when the current speed reaches 0 8 m s von mises stress 766 26 exceeds the yield stress value 551 6 mpa in addition fig 27 a shows that the rotation angle of the upper flexible joint of riser under soft hang off condition exceeds the limitation angle when the current speed reaches 0 6 m s correspondingly the deformation and stress of the riser under hard and soft hang off conditions increase with the current speed the riser deformation under the soft hang off condition is larger than that under the hard hang off condition figs 24a and 25a the maximum von mises stress of the riser under the hard hang off condition is greater than that under the soft hang off condition figs 24b and 25b this finding is consistent with the existing research results chang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 2016 in summary the deformation and von mises stress of the hang off riser increase with the current the most fragile part of the hard hang off riser is located at the junction of the riser and the platform the riser that evacuated under the soft hang off condition can reduce stress significantly but the large rotation angle at the upper flexible joint may affect the affiliated equipment of the platform the hard hang off riser can withstand the current speed of 0 4 m s because of stress limitation whereas the soft hang off riser can withstand 0 6 m s but can only withstand 0 4 m s with the rotation angle limitation according to the stress limitation 6 3 dynamic analysis of riser under evacuation condition the dynamic characteristics of the riser under hang off evacuating condition including hard and soft hang off conditions are discussed and compared in this section during platform evacuation the platform with a hang off riser evacuates along the current direction at the speed of 1 knot 0 5144 m s the surface current for 1 5 10 and 20 year return periods were selected to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the riser the calculation parameters were set to be the same as those under the hang off condition figs 28 and 29 show the deformation distribution and von mises stress of the riser under hard and soft hang off conditions with 1 knot platform speed under the loads for 1 5 10 and 20 year return period the distribution of riser deformation and stress during evacuation are similar to those under the hang off condition however the deformation of the riser figs 28a and 29a is first increased rapidly and then slowly from the water surface along with the water depth thus the deformation curve lower than 1000 m is almost vertical the platform evacuation speed is 1 knot 0 5144 m s which is less than the surface velocity of the current in one year the current loads rapidly decrease from the water surface to the deep water until they become close to the platform evacuation speed below 1760 m hence the increase in the riser deformation in the deep water section is small eq 15 wang et al 2015 fig 26b shows the maximum values of deformation and von mises stress under the loads for 1 5 10 and 20 year return periods when the platform is evacuated with a hang off riser with the speed at 1 knot the von mises stress of the riser under hard hang off condition exceeds the yield stress value after the current speed reaches 1 35 m s the riser can withstand the loads for at least one year the von mises stress of the riser under soft hang off condition exceeds the yield stress value and the rotation when the current speed reaches 1 42 m s however fig 27b shows that the rotation angle exceeds the limitation at the current speed of the 5 year return period therefore the riser under soft hang off evacuation condition can withstand the loads at least 1 year in comparison with the platform fixed to the original position the deformation and stress of the riser are reduced when the platform is evacuated along the current direction because the difference between the platform speed and the surface current speed decreases as the platform speed changes from 0 to 1 knot when evacuating along with the current as a result the actual loads of the entire riser are reduced and the displacement and von mises stress are also reduced thereby enabling the riser to withstand high current loads qi 2015 liu et al 2017 therefore instead of keeping the platform fixed evacuating the platform along the current direction is suitable to the riser 6 4 safety discussion and engineering proposals the riser under normal drilling condition and without drift can work safely under loads for a 10 year return period in consideration of stress and rotation safety the riser can withstand the current loads for a 5 year return period when the drifting distance is 1 the riser can only withstand the current loads for a 1 year return period when the drifting case is 2 the riser cannot even withstand the current loads for 1 year when the drifting distance is 3 countermeasures must be taken for restraining platform drift according to the current loads a yellow alarm indicates that the riser system is disconnected when the platform drift distance is greater than 1 of the water depth if the platform drift distance is close to 2 or even more than 3 of the water depth then the riser system must be disconnected kou et al 2015 hang off riser can only resist the current loads of 0 4 m s under hard and soft hang off conditions when the platform is evacuated with a hang off riser with the speed of 1 knot the riser can withstand the loads for at least a 1 year return period under hard and soft hang off conditions the hang off riser should be evacuated after being disconnected from the bottom along with the current as soon as possible furthermore the riser that is evacuated under soft hang off condition can significantly reduce stress but the large rotation angle at the upper flexible joint may affect the affiliated equipment of the platform therefore hard hang off can also be an appropriate way to evacuate the platform and riser 7 conclusion a dynamic analysis model for a riser under normal drilling and hang off conditions was established the effectiveness of this model was verified by a similar experiment the dynamic characteristics of the riser and the drift limitation under the normal drilling condition and the mechanical behavior of hang off riser were analyzed and found that the deformation and von mises stress increases with the ocean current speed the riser deformation reaches a maximum near the middle part and the von mises stress of the riser reaches a maximum near the water surface under normal drilling condition platform drifting significantly increases the deformation and the von mises stress of the riser the maximum deformation of the riser occurs at the upper part when the platform drifting distance increase whereas the maximum von mises stress of the riser always occurs near the water surface the riser with a length of approximately 2000 m can withstand the current loads of the 10 year return period the deformation reaches the maximum at the bottom end whereas the von mises stress reaches the maximum at the upper end under the hard hang off condition and at the water surface under soft hang off condition for hang off riser the soft hang off riser can easily exceed the rotation angle limitation with smaller von mises stress than hard hang off hard and soft hang off risers can resist the current loads at least 0 4 m s when they disconnected from the bottom but not evacuated when the platform is evacuated at 1 knot along the current direction the hard hang off riser can withstand the current loads for at least a 1 year return period subject to the yield stress where the soft hang off riser can withstand the current loads for up to a 1 year return period subject to the rotation angle limitation of the upper joint results can guide the design and protect the riser under different ocean and working conditions

china state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai china bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution are investigated for this purpose harmonic excited rolls of the mid section of a kvlcc2 fitted with one bilge keel are simulated by means of a high order fractional step finite volume solver fourier analysis is employed to derive drag and inertia coefficients in morison equation and the corresponding higher harmonic terms from bilge keel load the calculated drag and inertia coefficients as well as positive and negative pressure coefficients are validated with some published numerical and experimental results influence of the roll amplitude and circular frequency height and thickness of the bilge keel and draught is presented in results drag and inertia coefficients is solely determined by kc number effect of draught circular frequency and thickness of bilge keel is minuscule and negligible bilge keel load shows pronounced nonlinearity which reveals the importance of the higher harmonic terms besides drag coefficient and jump of the pressure coefficient satisfy the relationship assumed by ikeda et al 1977a positive pressure coefficient in front of bilge keel is kc dependent at low kc number especially when kc 6 the empirical method underestimates the positive pressure at low kc number and overestimates the negative pressure keywords bilge keel load hull pressure drag and inertia coefficients a high order fractional step finite volume solver fourier analysis 1 introduction bilge keel though simple but able to bring about whopping roll damping becomes the most common facility till now for mitigating roll motions of almost all maritime vessels the damping commonly originates from manifest flow separation from the tip of bilge keel by far no mature numerical prediction tool even computational fluid dynamics cfd method can accurately predict roll damping created by bilge keel this is because of the intricate detached flow and further vortex shedding due to flow separation around bilge keel hence numerical investigation into bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on a rolling ship section is still a challenge and a valuable research issue froude 1872 is one of the earliest researchers who experimentally studied roll damping characteristics of a flat plate oscillating in water at various frequencies relied on experiments he summarized that roll damping is related to the combination of linear and square terms of the rate of roll motion this discovery is known as froude s hypothesis afterwards to date model test empirical and numerical methods have been advancing the studies on prediction of roll damping due to bilge keel keulegan and carpenter 1958 simulated the inertia and drag coefficients of a fixed free plate in sinusoidal currents they found that both drag and inertia coefficients are correlated with a period parameter u a t h which is commonly called keulegan carpenter kc number thereafter where u a is the velocity amplitude of sinusoidal current t is the period and h is the plate height four decades later sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 experimentally investigated fourier averaged drag and inertia coefficients of a wall bounded plate in an oscillating flow for the purpose of the simulation of damping provided by bilge keels they chose the height of wall bounded plate as characteristic length to define kc number and found that the integrated physical coefficients are increased as much as 50 percent in the range of 1 kc 30 relative to the ones for the free plate case thus to accord with the case for free plate twice height of wall bounded plate ought to be considered as characteristic length moreover they found that the presence of wall strongly affects the inertia coefficient when kc 8 in the late of 1970s ikeda et al 1976 1977a 1977b 1978 performed extensive experiments to investigate roll damping and then the empirical method was resulted the empirical method decomposes the roll damping for a ship with zero forward speed into four components which are stemmed from wave radiation skin friction eddy making of a naked hull and the influence of bilge keel respectively furthermore bilge keel component is consisted of the damping due to normal force on bilge keel and hull pressure created by bilge keel later himeno 1981 systematically reviewed the empirical damping formula for each component two bilge keel damping components given by ikeda et al 1976 1977a are narrated respectively in the following two paragraphs for normal force on bilge keel ikeda et al 1976 proposed an empirical formula c d 22 5 k c 2 4 for drag coefficient of bilge keel on the basis of far reaching tests of rolling bluff bodies kc number is defined by k c f π r ϕ a h where twice bilge keel height h is taken as characteristic length r is the distance between roll center and the base of bilge keel f is the empirical velocity modification factor and ϕ a is the roll amplitude then normal force on bilge keel is solved by morison 1950 equation f 0 5 ρ c d h l u t u t where ρ is the water density l is bilge keel length and u t the corrected bilge keel velocity hull pressure distribution induced by bilge keel was given in ikeda et al 1977a by the introduction of pressure coefficient c p and pressure on the hull is solved ultimately by p 0 5 ρ c p u u at front side of bilge keel positive pressure coefficient c p decreases linearly to zero its maximum value is assumed as 1 2 and is independent of kc number since the vortex always sheds along the back side at back side of bilge keel negative pressure is assumed constant in the range of s 2 and then linearly decreases to zero at the distance of s from bilge keel where length of negative pressure region s is empirically expressed as s h 0 4 π f r ϕ a h 2 6 the maximum negative pressure coefficient c p which depends on kc number is obtained by the relationship between the pressure jump over bilge keel and the drag coefficient of bilge keel holding c p c p c d in view of the success of the empirical method on predicting roll damping for conventional ship hulls it has become the ittc recommended numerical estimation on roll damping ittc 2011 however limitations of its prediction accuracy and applicability always get wide regards brown and patel 1985 bassler and reed 2009 katayama et al 2010 yıldız et al 2016 therefore seeking for other approaches on predicting bilge keel load and hull pressure is warranted to account for viscous effect discrete vortex method brown and patel 1985 downie et al 1988 and random vortex method chorin 1973 yeung 2002 were burgeoned they are computationally efficient due to their low cost but this kind of embedded vortex methods always needs the priori value of flow separation point and it limits its application to practice in recent years cfd method is widely employed to predict roll motion for instance zhou et al 2015 lavrov et al 2017 gokce and kinaci 2018 irkal et al 2019 moreover applications of cfd method in simulation of separated flow from bilge keel and in calculation of bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution are also reported kinnas et al 2007 investigated hydrodynamic interaction between the ship hull and bilge keel by means of a finite volume method and they plotted the hull pressure distributions in their work considerable nonlinearity was observed even for small roll amplitudes in the case of forced roll motion then bangun et al 2010 simulated flow fields of a rolling barge fitted with bilge keel by a finite volume method on a moving unstructured grid system later piehl and moctar 2014 followed the work of sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 and simulated flows around a bilge keel and calculated the related bilge keel forces in oscillating current by means of the cfd package openfoam with different turbulent models where bilge keel was tightly located at the bottom of wave tank they found that large eddy simulation les model is much better to represent vortex behaviors compared with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model especially under severe flow conditions afterwards motivated by the experimental investigation of van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 simulated bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on a circular cylinder fitted with one bilge keel under harmonic roll motions by means of a finite volume method based on the cfd package openfoam they found that the empirical method overestimates hull pressure coefficient induced by bilge keel numerical discretization accuracy of the abovementioned cfd methods is normally of second order to capture complex separated flows induced by bilge keel a more precise high order finite volume solver is developed recently refer to the work of xu et al 2005 bai et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 where a fourth order compact scheme and a fourth order runge kutta scheme are applied to discrete the navier stokes equations a second order piecewise linear interface calculation volume of fluid plic vof method captures free surface a ghost cell immersed boundary method gcibm solves moving geometry and a les model simulates turbulence zhang et al 2019a 2019b has applied the solver to the prediction of roll characteristics of the mid section and the bow and stern sections of a kvlcc2 where the verification and validation were carried out lately the solver is developed by a fractional step method along with an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme the present work applies that solver to the simulation of bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on the mid section of a kvlcc2 fitted with one bilge keel since free roll decay motion has defects in concerning optional kc numbers and frequency effect this work studies the characteristics of a ship section under harmonic excited rolls the calculated drag and inertia coefficients of the bilge keel and hull pressure distributions are compared with some published experimental and numerical results influence of roll amplitude and circular frequency height and thickness of bilge keel and draught is explored 2 numerical formulation this section presents the fundamental high order fractional step finite volume solver governing equations refer to zhang et al 2019a are the filtered navier stokes equations by a large eddy simulation for incompressible viscous flows in an inertial reference frame they are given as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν t ν 2 u g f where u u v and p are the filtered velocity and pressure fields ρ and ν are fluid density and kinematic viscosity f is the discrete momentum forcing g g j the gravitational acceleration j the upward vector in y direction x y the coordinate of a cell node and ν t the turbulent viscosity calculated by a standard smagorinsky model 3 ν t c s δ 2 s in which c s is the smagorinsky constant δ the filter width s the magnitude of the resolved strain tensor the treatment of les is given in detail in zhang et al 2018 a plic vof method is applied to capture free surface by introducing a scalar field f which stands for the volume fraction of water in each cell satisfying the conservation 4 d f d t 0 and at each time step after the evaluation of the scale field f fluid density and kinematic viscosity are updated as follows 5 ρ f ρ water 1 f ρ air 6 ν f ν water 1 f ν air a collocated cartesian grid system as fig 1 shows is employed in the present study and f u and p are defined on the cell centers which are expressed by the symbol in fig 1 capital letters in the figure represent cell centers while lowercases are labelled face centers for time integration a fractional step method along with an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme is applied to solve eqs 1 and 2 this treatment replaces the original momentum interpolation method

in this work δ h k u k are the cell size and the corresponding velocity along k direction 3 problem definition in this paper the mid section of a kvlcc2 ship model with a scale ratio of 1 128 77 fitted with one bilge keel rolling harmonically in calm water 22 ϕ ϕ 0 sin 2 π t t is considered where ϕ 0 and t are the roll amplitude and period respectively fig 2 is the diagram of the ship section roll center o is set at a distance of l above the bottom to be consistent with the one in zhang et al 2019 a bilge keel is mounted at the right side with an angle β fig 3 shows the wave tank and model set up two wave probes probe 1 and 2 in the figure are set at a distance a away from ship centerline to monitor wave heights dimensions of the physical quantities in figs 2 and 3 such as breadth b and draught d of the ship section height h and thickness t of the bilge keel water depth h far field boundary length l and so on are summarized in table 1 kc number is defined as 23 k c u 0 t 2 h r ϕ max 2 h 2 π ω r ϕ 0 π h it is based on twice bilge keel height referring to the works of van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 where u 0 is the maximum roll velocity r stands for the radial distance from the base of the bilge keel to roll center as shown in fig 2 and ω is circular frequency of the roll motion cases of the simulations to be carried out are listed in table 2 in this investigation r is specified and holds a constant and kc number can be changed by changing roll amplitude and bilge keel height series a1 and a2 correspond to the investigation of the influence of kc number on the bilge keel loads and hull pressure distributions by varying the roll amplitude and the height of bilge keel respectively the results of these two series will be used to validate the present simulation by the published works of sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 keulegan and carpenter 1958 van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 besides series a3 a4 and a5 investigate the influence of draught circular frequency and bilge keel thickness respectively tables 3 and 4 summarize the corresponding kc numbers for different roll amplitudes when bilge keel height is h 0 01 m and for different bilge keel heights when the amplitude is ϕ 0 0 1 rad respectively 4 formulation of bilge keel load and hull pressure 4 1 drag and inertia coefficients of bilge keel normal force on bilge keel is calculated by the integral of dynamic pressure over bilge keel morison equation is commonly applied to express the force on slender object as an inertia force which is proportional to flow acceleration and a drag force proportional to signed square of flow velocity it yields as below 24 f t ρ c m u t 1 2 ρ c d h u t u t where f t is the time series of normal force on bilge keel represents the reference volume c m is the inertia coefficient and c d the drag coefficient u t and u t are the roll velocity and acceleration at the base of bilge keel ship section rolls in the present simulation rather than flow oscillates as presented in morison 1950 thus minus sign appears in the above equation the reference volume is chosen as π h 2 2 that is half the area of the circle with radius h because the force is only acting on the plate beneath ship bilge this choice of the reference volume is consistent with the ones used by keulegan and carpenter 1958 van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 the roll velocity at the base of bilge keel is solved by 25 u t u 0 cos ω t r ω ϕ 0 cos ω t and the roll acceleration is expressed as 26 u t r ω 2 ϕ 0 sin ω t substituting the roll velocity eq 25 and acceleration eq 26 at the base of bilge keel into eq 24 yields 27 2 f t ρ h u 0 2 π 2 k c c m sin ω t c d cos ω t cos ω t morison equation does not concern the higher harmonic drag and inertia coefficients normal force on bilge keel is commonly considered to be highly nonlinear and higher terms will be necessarily drew into since the normal force behaves in an odd and periodic function only those of odd harmonic terms would appear keulegan and carpenter 1958 ommani et al 2016 and eq 27 would be generally extended as 28 2 f t ρ h u 0 2 π 2 k c c m sin ω t c d cos ω t cos ω t a 3 sin 3 ω t b 3 cos 3 ω t a 5 sin 5 ω t b 5 cos 5 ω t accordingly when time series of the normal force is obtained if we write eq 28 as 29 2 f t ρ h u 0 2 f 1 i sin ω t f 1 d cos ω t f 3 i sin 3 ω t f 3 d cos 3 ω t f 3 i sin 5 ω t f 3 d cos 5 ω t the fourier coefficients can be evaluated by fourier analysis as below 30 f n i 2 t t 2 f t sin n ω t ρ h u 0 2 d t f n d 2 t t 2 f t cos n ω t ρ h u 0 2 d t therefore the drag inertia and higher harmonic coefficients can be deduced from the fourier coefficients as did by van t veer 2015 as follows 31 c m k c π 2 f 1 i c d 3 π 8 f 1 d a 3 f 3 i b 3 f 3 d 1 5 f 1 d a 5 f 5 i b 5 f 5 d 3 105 f 1 d 4 2 hull pressure coefficient pressure coefficient on the ship hull is defined by 32 c p 2 p d ρ u 0 2 2 p d ρ r ω ϕ 0 2 it should be noticed that since pressure p d represents the hydrodynamic pressure on the ship hull it contains only the pressure due to flow separation and wave radiation 5 uncertainty analysis 5 1 verification the case with roll amplitude 0 09 rad of series a1 is chosen for uncertainty analysis which accords to ittc recommended procedure ittc 2008 calculations for the cases with three different cell sizes and three time step sizes are performed the refinement ratio is 2 fig 4 shows the calculated bilge keel loads for all cases and table 5 lists the drag coefficients of the bilge keel and their differences where the differences between the medium and fine solutions and between the coarse and medium solutions are solved by 33 ε 21 c d 2 c d 1 ε 32 c d 3 c d 2 where the subscript 1 represents fine parameter 2 and 3 correspond to medium and coarse parameters changes between the difference of medium fine and coarse medium solutions are as below 34 r mesh size ε 21 ε 32 mesh size 0 1186 1 r time step ε 21 ε 32 time step 0 4312 1 the changes are both less than 1 it turns out the convergence of the solver with time step and mesh size 5 2 validation according to generalized richardson extrapolation one term estimate for error δ r e and order of accuracy p are calculated by 35 δ r e ε 21 2 p 1 p ln ε 32 ε 21 ln 2 the correction factor c is evaluated by 36 c 2 p 1 2 2 1 then the uncertainty u is estimated by 37 u 1 2 1 c δ r e finally the validation uncertainty u v is expressed as 38 u v u mesh size 2 u time step 2 0 0194 2 0 1261 2 0 1276 the comparison error e is the difference of the experimental data and the simulation one as 39 e c d exp c d num 0 2806 where the experimental result is from van t veer 2005 and is obtained in fig 7 since the validation uncertainty u v is less than the comparison error e the validation is achieved at the u v level 6 results and discussions this section presents the results and relevant discussions of bilge keel loads and hull pressure distributions for the cases listed in table 2 6 1 time series of bilge keel load figs 5 and 6 display the time series of normal force on bilge keel for a number of roll amplitudes series a1 and bilge keel heights series a2 respectively significant nonlinearity is observed owing to the complex flow induced by bilge keel it reveals that the higher harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are indispensable to analyze bilge keel load in addition normal force on bilge keel increases by increasing both roll amplitude and bilge keel height since larger roll amplitude or smaller bilge keel height would lead to bigger kc number according to eq 23 it cannot draw the conclusion of ommani et al 2016 that bigger kc number results in larger bilge keel load since fixed radial distance and bilge keel height are considered in their study according to the simulated results it may be modified as that larger roll amplitude or larger bilge keel height result in larger bilge keel load 6 2 drag and inertia coefficients this section displays the drag and inertia coefficients derived from bilge keel loads with the theory given in section 4 1 influence of roll amplitude and circular frequency draught and height and thickness of the bilge keel will be discussed in the following four separate parts 6 2 1 series a1 and a2 influence of kc number table 6 lists the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a1 and a2 nine roll amplitudes are concerned in series a1 and five bilge keel heights are included in series a2 fig 7 shows a comparison of the present results given in table 6 with the ones for a free fixed plate in oscillating currents by keulegan and carpenter 1958 a wall bounded fixed plate in oscillating currents by sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 and a rolling bilge keel fitted to a circular cylinder in initial still water by van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 it is evident from the figure that overall the present results tally well with the above published ones moreover the drag and inertia coefficients depend on kc number whatever mean is adopted either by changing roll amplitude or by changing bilge keel height drag coefficient decreases as the kc number rises by contrast inertia coefficient increases besides a same phenomenon is observed as did by van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 that inertia coefficient emerges a different trend for a wall bounded plate compared to the one for a free plate when kc number is larger than 4 this is due to the preservation of symmetric vortex shedding with the presence of wall in the wall bounded case while the onset of asymmetric vortex shedding in the free plate case 6 2 2 series a3 influence of draught the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a3 are listed in table 7 it concerns two draughts 0 1 m and 0 08 m from the results of series a1 in table 6 a third draught 0 1615 m is involved in the draught dependence study the results are plotted in fig 8 fig 8 demonstrates that with the decrease of draught drag coefficient slightly rises while inertia coefficient falls similar discovery is also observed in van t veer 2015 but he did not give a reason according to zhang et al 2019a bangun et al 2010 a part of the vortices previously shed from the bilge keel move toward and diffuse near the free surface with the roll motion of the ship fig 9 depicts the velocity vector around the right side of the ship section at the instant t 3 t the ship section rolls with an amplitude of 0 17 rad and a period of 1s clearly near the free surface vortex structures appear it may conclude that the interaction between the previous vortex which is now approaching the free surface and the new vortex which is now generated near the bilge keel strengthens the drag coefficient when the draught decreases as is known bilge keel inertia load gets maximum when the ship section moves to its extreme position t n t t 4 or t n t 3 t 4 at that moment the acceleration attains its peak the total water mass reduces with the decrease of draught which probably leads to the reduction of inertia coefficient but overall the influence of draught is minuscule and negligible 6 2 3 series a4 influence of frequency table 8 lists the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a4 it concerns two periods 0 8s and 1 4s from the results of series a1 in table 6 a third period 1s is involved in the frequency dependence study the results are plotted in fig 10 the results indicate that both drag and inertia coefficients are insensitive to the roll period in the range of 0 8s and 1 4s at larger kc number inertia coefficients for the three periods still have some amount of deviation about 5 5 but it is now difficult to explain 6 2 4 series a5 influence of bilge keel thickness table 9 lists the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a5 it concerns two bilge keel thicknesses 0 003 m and 0 004 m from the results of series a1 in table 6 a third bilge keel thickness 0 002 m is involved in the dependence study of bilge keel thickness the results are plotted in fig 11 in general the influence of bilge keel thickness on drag and inertia coefficients is quite small and negligible however as bilge keel thickness falls drag coefficient has a slight increase at lower kc number this is likely because the process of vortex shedding from the thicker bilge keel is a little bit slower when kc number is small besides with the falling of bilge keel thickness inertia coefficient mildly decreases at larger kc number which could be affected by the selection of reference volume of bilge keel 6 3 higher harmonic coefficients the higher harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are discussed in this section figs 12 15 show the comparison of the calculated third and fifth drag and inertia coefficients with the corresponding ones of van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 respectively all five series are concluded it can be seen that the coefficients agree basically with the previous literatures except the third harmonic drag coefficient from these figures one can see that influence of high harmonic terms on bilge keel load against kc number declines fast than the one in the abovementioned paper when kc 5 the present higher harmonic terms basically becomes zero since in this work the mid section of a kvlcc2 is taken as the object ship hull which is much plumper than the cylinder section used in van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 though the ship section marginally influence the results the higher harmonic terms are extremely sensitive this may result in the difference of the higher harmonic terms fig 16 displays the comparison of the calculated three harmonic terms of drag and inertia coefficients absolute values of the first harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are prominently larger than the third ones and the third ones are again larger than the fifth ones that is influence of higher harmonic terms on bilge keel load is gradually diminishing this discovery is also reported in van t veer 2015 and keulegan and carpenter 1958 6 4 radiated wave figs 17 and 18 depict time series of radiated wave elevation at the monitoring positions of wave probe 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 for series a1 and a2 respectively it is evident that roll amplitude has a strong influence on radiated wave and by contrast the effect of bilge keel height is exceptionally tiny since the bilge keel is only fitted to the right side of the ship section radiated wave elevation at the position of wave probe 1 almost remains constant with the change of bilge keel height the different behaviors of radiated wave elevation for series a1 and a2 will lead to distinct hull pressure distribution near free surface even though they have same kc number which will be illuminated in section 6 5 6 5 hull pressure distribution this section explores the characteristics of dynamic pressure distribution on the ship hull variations of the peaks of positive and negative pressure coefficients with kc number at the instants when roll velocity attains maximum t 3 t 0 5 t and t 3 t are given in figs 19 and 20 together with the results of van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 and ikeda et al 1977a series a1 and a2 are concerned considering that the vortices always shed and move towards the back side of bilge keel ikeda et al 1977a assumed that positive pressure coefficient in front of bilge keel is kc independent while negative pressure coefficient in back of bilge keel is kc dependent however the figures show that positive pressure coefficient varies obviously with kc number at low kc number while at high kc number it seems to be consistent with the one of ikeda et al 1977a and kc independent this finding is also reported in ommani et al 2016 furthermore a distinct slope change around kc 6 is observed thus the positive pressure coefficient ought to be kc dependent at low kc number especially when kc 6 besides from the figures empirical method underestimates the positive pressure coefficients at low kc number the negative pressure coefficient in back of bilge keel behaves queerly at low kc number a slope change is striking around kc 2 but it is hard to give a reason here besides it can be observed that empirical method overestimates negative pressure coefficients which is also found in van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 in the majority of cases the present pressure coefficients are in conformity with the ones of the aforementioned literatures table 10 presents the peaks of positive and negative pressure coefficients at the instants t 3 t 0 5 t and t 3 t series a1 and a2 are included the corresponding drag coefficients are also listed in this table the results for all kc numbers commonly satisfy the relationship between drag coefficient and the jump of pressure coefficient over bilge keel c d c p c p proposed by ikeda et al 1977a overall differences between drag coefficient c d and jump of pressure coefficient c p c p are within 10 figs 21 and 22 show distributions of dynamic pressure coefficient over the ship boundary at the instant with maximum roll velocity t 3 t for a selection of roll amplitudes series a1 and bilge keel heights series a2 respectively in the figures the abscissa represents the curve length between the simulated point and the base of bilge keel curve length is positive when the simulated point lies in front of bilge keel while negative at back side and zero denotes the position of bilge keel from figs 21 and 22 the negative pressure at first increases almost linearly over the round ship bilge and then decreases linearly over the large flat bottom to zero this phenomenon is somewhat analogous to the ones of van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 as for the distribution of positive pressure coefficient it drops firstly over the round ship bilge an apparent slop change is observed at the end of round bilge or the beginning of the big flat side the distribution of positive pressure coefficient near free surface in fig 21 is distinctly different from the one in fig 22 as stated in section 6 4 roll amplitude strongly influences the radiated wave while bilge keel height has tiny effect thus in fig 21 positive pressure coefficient near free surface changes visibly with roll amplitude while it remains nearly constant for different bilge keel height in fig 22 7 conclusions this paper investigates the bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on a harmonically rolling ship section the mid section of a kvlcc2 fitted with a bilge keel at one side influence of kc number by changing roll amplitude series a1 and changing bilge keel height series a2 are performed besides three draughts series a3 three periods series a4 and three bilge keel thicknesses series a5 are concerned to explore the effect of draught circular frequency and bilge keel thickness respectively a high order fractional step finite volume solver is applied to solve incompressible viscous flows on a collocated cartesian grid system where a fourth order compact scheme discretizes the convection and diffusion terms a fractional step method along with an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme advances the solutions of the navier stokes equations a les simulates turbulence a plic vof method captures free surface and a gcibm solves moving ship body besides drag and inertia coefficients in morison equation and the corresponding higher harmonic terms are derived in terms of the fourier analysis from bilge keel loads hull pressure distribution is presented by pressure coefficient bilge keel load shows pronounced nonlinearity it indicates the necessity of higher harmonic terms in addition the calculated drag and inertia coefficients are compared with the ones for a free keulegan and carpenter 1958 and a wall bounded sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 fixed plate in oscillating currents and for a rolling bilge keel fitted to a circular cylinder in an still water van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 an exceptionally good agreement are obtained drag and inertia coefficients rely on kc number by whatever mean either varying roll amplitude or varying bilge keel height besides with decreasing draught drag coefficient slightly rises while inertia coefficient falls but in general the influence of draught is minuscule and negligible roll period in the range of 0 8s and 1 4s and bilge keel thickness have little influence on bilge keel load moreover absolute values of the higher harmonic coefficients are always smaller than that of the lower ones it demonstrates that the influence of higher harmonic terms on bilge keel load is diminishing variations of the peaks of positive and negative pressure coefficients with kc number are compared with the ones of van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 and ikeda et al 1977a it is shown that positive pressure coefficient in front of bilge keel is kc dependent at low kc number especially when kc 6 and is underestimated by the empirical method besides empirical method overestimates negative pressure coefficient in back of bilge keel overall drag coefficient and the jump of pressure coefficient over bilge keel essentially satisfies the relationship assumed in ikeda et al 1977a holding c d c p c p as for pressure distribution over ship hull at the instant t n t negative coefficient at first increases linearly over the round ship bilge and then decreases over the flat bottom to zero and positive pressure coefficient drops firstly over the round ship bilge and then a striking slop change is observed at the beginning of vertical flat side i e the end of round bilge moreover due to the effect of radiated wave positive pressure coefficient near free surface changes visibly with roll amplitude credit authorship

fitted with one bilge keel are simulated by means of a high order fractional step finite volume solver fourier analysis is employed to derive drag and inertia coefficients in morison equation and the corresponding higher harmonic terms from bilge keel load the calculated drag and inertia coefficients as well as positive and negative pressure coefficients are validated with some published numerical

determined by kc number effect of draught circular frequency and thickness of bilge keel is minuscule and negligible bilge keel load shows pronounced nonlinearity which reveals the importance of the higher harmonic terms besides drag coefficient and jump of the pressure coefficient satisfy the relationship assumed by ikeda et al 1977a positive pressure coefficient in front of bilge keel is kc dependent at low kc number especially when kc 6 the empirical method underestimates the positive pressure at low kc number and overestimates the negative pressure keywords bilge keel load hull pressure drag and inertia coefficients a high order fractional step finite volume solver fourier analysis 1 introduction bilge keel though simple but able to bring about whopping roll damping becomes the most common facility till now for mitigating roll motions of almost all maritime vessels the damping commonly originates from manifest flow separation from the tip of bilge keel by far no mature numerical prediction tool even computational fluid dynamics cfd method can accurately predict roll damping created by bilge keel this is because of the intricate detached flow and further vortex shedding due to flow separation around bilge keel hence numerical investigation into bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on a rolling ship section is still a challenge and a valuable research issue froude 1872 is one of the earliest researchers who experimentally studied roll damping characteristics of a flat plate oscillating in water at various frequencies relied on experiments he summarized that roll damping is related to the combination of linear and square terms of the rate of roll motion this discovery is known as froude s hypothesis afterwards to date model test empirical and numerical methods have been advancing the studies on prediction of roll damping due to bilge keel keulegan and carpenter 1958 simulated the inertia and drag coefficients of a fixed free plate in sinusoidal currents they found that both drag and inertia coefficients are correlated with a period parameter u a t h which is commonly called keulegan carpenter kc number thereafter where u a is the velocity amplitude of sinusoidal current t is the period and h is the plate height four decades later sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 experimentally investigated fourier averaged drag and inertia coefficients of a wall bounded plate in an oscillating flow for the purpose of the simulation of damping provided by bilge keels they chose the height of wall bounded plate as characteristic length to define kc number and found that the integrated physical coefficients are increased as much as 50 percent in the range of 1 kc 30 relative to the ones for the free plate case thus to accord with the case for free plate twice height of wall bounded plate ought to be considered as characteristic length moreover they found that the presence of wall strongly affects the inertia coefficient when kc 8 in the late of 1970s ikeda et al 1976 1977a 1977b 1978 performed extensive experiments to investigate roll damping and then the empirical method was resulted the empirical method decomposes the roll damping for a ship with zero forward speed into four components which are stemmed from wave radiation skin friction eddy making of a naked hull and the influence of bilge keel respectively furthermore bilge keel component is consisted of the damping due to normal force on bilge keel and hull pressure created by bilge keel later himeno 1981 systematically reviewed the empirical damping formula for each component two bilge keel damping components given by ikeda et al 1976 1977a are narrated respectively in the following two paragraphs for normal force on bilge keel ikeda et al 1976 proposed an empirical formula c d 22 5 k c 2 4 for drag coefficient of bilge keel on the basis of far reaching tests of rolling bluff bodies kc number is defined by k c f π r ϕ a h where twice bilge keel height h is taken as characteristic length r is the distance between roll center and the base of bilge keel f is the empirical velocity modification factor and ϕ a is the roll amplitude then normal force on bilge keel is solved by morison 1950 equation f 0 5 ρ c d h l u t u t where ρ is the water density l is bilge keel length and u t the corrected bilge keel velocity hull pressure distribution induced by bilge keel was given in ikeda et al 1977a by the introduction of pressure coefficient c p and pressure on the hull is solved ultimately by p 0 5 ρ c p u u at front side of bilge keel positive pressure coefficient c p decreases linearly to zero its maximum value is assumed as 1 2 and is independent of kc number since the vortex always sheds along the back side at back side of bilge keel negative pressure is assumed constant in the range of s 2 and then linearly decreases to zero at the distance of s from bilge keel where length of negative pressure region s is empirically expressed as s h 0 4 π f r ϕ a h 2 6 the maximum negative pressure coefficient c p which depends on kc number is obtained by the relationship between the pressure jump over bilge keel and the drag coefficient of bilge keel holding c p c p c d in view of the success of the empirical method on predicting roll damping for conventional ship hulls it has become the ittc recommended numerical estimation on roll damping ittc 2011 however limitations of its prediction accuracy and applicability always get wide regards brown and patel 1985 bassler and reed 2009 katayama et al 2010 yıldız et al 2016 therefore seeking for other approaches on predicting bilge keel load and hull pressure is warranted to account for viscous effect discrete vortex method brown and patel 1985 downie et al 1988 and random vortex method chorin 1973 yeung 2002 were burgeoned they are computationally efficient due to their low cost but this kind of embedded vortex methods always needs the priori value of flow separation point and it limits its application to practice in recent years cfd method is widely employed to predict roll motion for instance zhou et al 2015 lavrov et al 2017 gokce and kinaci 2018 irkal et al 2019 moreover applications of cfd method in simulation of separated flow from bilge keel and in calculation of bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution are also reported kinnas et al 2007 investigated hydrodynamic interaction between the ship hull and bilge keel by means of a finite volume method and they plotted the hull pressure distributions in their work considerable nonlinearity was observed even for small roll amplitudes in the case of forced roll motion then bangun et al 2010 simulated flow fields of a rolling barge fitted with bilge keel by a finite volume method on a moving unstructured grid system later piehl and moctar 2014 followed the work of sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 and simulated flows around a bilge keel and calculated the related bilge keel forces in oscillating current by means of the cfd package openfoam with different turbulent models where bilge keel was tightly located at the bottom of wave tank they found that large eddy simulation les model is much better to represent vortex behaviors compared with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model especially under severe flow conditions afterwards motivated by the experimental investigation of van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 simulated bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on a circular cylinder fitted with one bilge keel under harmonic roll motions by means of a finite volume method based on the cfd package openfoam they found that the empirical method overestimates hull pressure coefficient induced by bilge keel numerical discretization accuracy of the abovementioned cfd methods is normally of second order to capture complex separated flows induced by bilge keel a more precise high order finite volume solver is developed recently refer to the work of xu et al 2005 bai et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 where a fourth order compact scheme and a fourth order runge kutta scheme are applied to discrete the navier stokes equations a second order piecewise linear interface calculation volume of fluid plic vof method captures free surface a ghost cell immersed boundary method gcibm solves moving geometry and a les model simulates turbulence zhang et al 2019a 2019b has applied the solver to the prediction of roll characteristics of the mid section and the bow and stern sections of a kvlcc2 where the verification and validation were carried out lately the solver is developed by a fractional step method along with an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme the present work applies that solver to the simulation of bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on the mid section of a kvlcc2 fitted with one bilge keel since free roll decay motion has defects in concerning optional kc numbers and frequency effect this work studies the characteristics of a ship section under harmonic excited rolls the calculated drag and inertia coefficients of the bilge keel and hull pressure distributions are compared with some published experimental and numerical results influence of roll amplitude and circular frequency height and thickness of bilge keel and draught is explored 2 numerical formulation this section presents the fundamental high order fractional step finite volume solver governing equations refer to zhang et al 2019a are the filtered navier stokes equations by a large eddy simulation for incompressible viscous flows in an inertial reference frame they are given as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν t ν 2 u g f where u u v and p are the filtered velocity and pressure fields ρ and ν are fluid density and kinematic viscosity f is the discrete momentum

2 s in which c s is the smagorinsky constant δ the filter width s the magnitude of the resolved strain tensor the treatment of les is given in detail in zhang et al 2018 a plic vof method is applied to capture free surface by introducing a scalar field f which stands for the volume fraction of water in each cell satisfying the conservation 4 d f d t 0 and at each time step after the evaluation of the scale field f fluid density and kinematic viscosity are updated as follows 5 ρ f ρ water 1 f ρ air 6 ν f ν water 1 f ν air a collocated cartesian grid system as fig 1 shows is employed in the present study and f u and p are defined on the cell centers which are expressed by the symbol in fig 1 capital letters in the figure represent cell centers while lowercases are labelled face centers for time integration a fractional step method along with an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme is applied to solve eqs 1 and 2 this treatment replaces the original momentum interpolation method

velocity fields will be updated in terms of eq 9 and eq 16 after the solution of eq 18 respectively in simulation time step δ t is restricted by two conditions i e the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion 20 δ t c f l δ h k u k and the restriction from turbulent viscosity 21 δ t δ h k 2 6 ν t to be satisfied in the whole computational domain where c f l is courant number which is set as 0 3 in this work δ h k u k are the cell size and the corresponding velocity along k direction 3 problem definition in this paper the mid section of a kvlcc2 ship model with a scale ratio of 1 128 77 fitted with one bilge keel rolling harmonically in calm water 22 ϕ ϕ 0 sin 2 π t t is considered where ϕ 0 and t are the roll amplitude and period respectively fig 2 is the diagram of the ship section roll center o is set at a distance of l above the bottom to be consistent with the one in zhang et al 2019 a bilge keel is mounted at the right side with an angle β fig 3 shows the wave tank and model set up two wave probes probe 1 and 2 in the figure are set at a distance a away from ship centerline to monitor wave heights dimensions of the physical quantities in figs 2 and 3 such as breadth b and draught d of the ship section height h and thickness t of the bilge keel water depth h far field boundary length l and so on are summarized in table 1 kc number is defined as 23 k c u 0 t 2 h r ϕ max 2 h 2 π ω r ϕ 0 π h it is based on twice bilge keel height referring to the works of van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 where u 0 is the maximum roll velocity r stands for the radial distance from the base of the bilge keel to roll center as shown in fig 2 and ω is circular frequency of the roll motion cases of the simulations to be carried out are listed in table 2 in this investigation r is specified and holds a constant and kc number can be changed by changing roll amplitude and bilge keel height series a1 and a2 correspond to the investigation of the influence of kc number on the bilge keel loads and hull pressure distributions by varying the roll amplitude and the height of bilge keel respectively the results of these two series will be used to validate the present simulation by the published works of sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 keulegan and carpenter 1958 van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 besides series a3 a4 and a5 investigate the influence of draught circular frequency and bilge keel thickness respectively tables 3 and 4 summarize the corresponding kc numbers for different roll amplitudes when bilge keel height is h 0 01 m and for different bilge keel heights when the amplitude is ϕ 0 0 1 rad respectively 4 formulation of bilge keel load and hull pressure 4 1 drag and inertia coefficients of bilge keel normal force on bilge keel is calculated by the integral of dynamic pressure over bilge keel morison equation is commonly applied to express the force on slender object as an inertia force which is proportional to flow acceleration and a drag force proportional to signed square of flow velocity it yields as below 24 f t ρ c m u t 1 2 ρ c d h u t u t where f t is the time series of normal force on bilge keel represents the reference volume c m is the inertia coefficient and c d the drag coefficient u t and u t are the roll velocity and acceleration at the base of bilge keel ship section rolls in the present simulation rather than flow oscillates as presented in morison 1950 thus minus sign appears in the above equation the reference volume is chosen as π h 2 2 that is half the area of the circle with radius h because the force is only acting on the plate beneath ship bilge this choice of the reference volume is consistent with the ones used by keulegan and carpenter 1958 van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 the roll velocity at the base of bilge keel is solved by 25 u t u 0 cos ω t r ω ϕ 0 cos ω t and the roll acceleration is expressed as 26 u t r ω 2 ϕ 0 sin ω t substituting the roll velocity eq 25 and acceleration eq 26 at the base of bilge keel into eq 24 yields 27 2 f t ρ h u 0 2 π 2 k c c m sin ω t c d cos ω t cos ω t morison equation does not concern the higher harmonic drag and inertia coefficients normal force on bilge keel is commonly considered to be highly nonlinear and higher terms will be necessarily drew into since the normal force behaves in an odd and periodic function only those of odd harmonic terms would appear keulegan and carpenter 1958 ommani et al 2016 and eq 27 would be generally extended as 28 2 f t ρ h u 0 2 π 2 k c c m sin ω t c d cos ω t cos ω t a 3 sin 3 ω t b 3 cos 3 ω t a 5 sin 5 ω t b 5 cos 5 ω t accordingly when time series of the normal force is obtained if we write eq 28 as 29 2 f t ρ h u 0 2 f 1 i sin ω t f 1 d cos ω t f 3 i sin 3 ω t f 3 d cos 3 ω t f 3 i sin 5 ω t f 3 d cos 5 ω t the fourier coefficients can be evaluated by fourier analysis as below 30 f n i 2 t t 2 f t sin n ω t ρ h u 0 2 d t f n d 2 t t 2 f t cos n ω t ρ h u 0 2 d t therefore the drag inertia and higher harmonic coefficients can be deduced from the fourier coefficients as did by van t veer 2015 as follows 31 c m k c π 2 f 1 i c d 3 π 8 f 1 d a 3 f 3 i b 3 f 3 d 1 5 f 1 d a 5 f 5 i b 5 f 5 d 3 105 f 1 d 4 2 hull pressure coefficient pressure coefficient on the ship hull is defined by 32 c p 2 p d ρ u 0 2 2 p d ρ r ω ϕ 0 2 it should be noticed that since pressure p d represents the hydrodynamic pressure on the ship hull it contains only the pressure due to flow separation and wave radiation 5 uncertainty analysis 5 1 verification the case with roll amplitude 0 09 rad of series a1 is chosen for uncertainty analysis which accords to ittc recommended procedure ittc 2008 calculations for the cases with three different cell sizes and three time step sizes are performed the refinement ratio is 2 fig 4 shows the calculated bilge keel loads for all cases and table 5 lists the drag coefficients of the bilge keel and their differences where the differences between the medium and fine solutions and between the coarse and medium solutions are solved by 33 ε 21 c d 2 c d 1 ε 32 c d 3 c d 2 where the subscript 1 represents fine parameter 2 and 3 correspond to medium and coarse parameters changes between the difference of medium fine and coarse medium solutions are as below 34 r mesh size ε 21 ε 32 mesh size 0 1186 1 r time step ε 21 ε 32 time step 0 4312 1 the changes are both less than 1 it turns out the convergence of the solver with time step and mesh size 5 2 validation according to generalized richardson extrapolation one term estimate for error δ r e and order of accuracy p are calculated by 35 δ r e ε 21 2 p 1 p ln ε 32 ε 21 ln 2 the correction factor c is evaluated by 36 c 2 p 1 2 2 1 then the uncertainty u is estimated by 37 u 1 2 1 c δ r e finally the validation uncertainty u v is expressed as 38 u v u mesh size 2 u time step 2 0 0194 2 0 1261 2 0 1276 the comparison error e is the difference of the experimental data and the simulation one as 39 e c d exp c d num 0 2806 where the experimental result is from van t veer 2005 and is obtained in fig 7 since the validation uncertainty u v is less than the comparison error e the validation is achieved at the u v level 6 results and discussions this section presents the results and relevant discussions of bilge keel loads and hull pressure distributions for the cases listed in table 2 6 1 time series of bilge keel load figs 5 and 6 display the time series of normal force on bilge keel for a number of roll amplitudes series a1 and bilge keel heights series a2 respectively significant nonlinearity is observed owing to the complex flow induced by bilge keel it reveals that the higher harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are indispensable to analyze bilge keel load in addition normal force on bilge keel increases by increasing both roll amplitude and bilge keel height since larger roll amplitude or smaller bilge keel height would lead to bigger kc number according to eq 23 it cannot draw the conclusion of ommani et al 2016 that bigger kc number results in larger bilge keel load since fixed radial distance and bilge keel height are considered in their study according to the simulated results it may be modified as that larger roll amplitude or larger bilge keel height result in larger bilge keel load 6 2 drag and inertia coefficients this section displays the drag and inertia coefficients derived from bilge keel loads with the theory given in section 4 1 influence of roll amplitude and circular frequency draught and height and thickness of the bilge keel will be discussed in the following four separate parts 6 2 1 series a1 and a2 influence of kc number table 6 lists the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a1 and a2 nine roll amplitudes are concerned in series a1 and five bilge keel heights are included in series a2 fig 7 shows a comparison of the present results given in table 6 with the ones for a free fixed plate in oscillating currents by keulegan and carpenter 1958 a wall bounded fixed plate in oscillating currents by sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 and a rolling bilge keel fitted to a circular cylinder in initial still water by van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 it is evident from the figure that overall the present results tally well with the above published ones moreover the drag and inertia coefficients depend on kc number whatever mean is adopted either by changing roll amplitude or by changing bilge keel height drag coefficient decreases as the kc number rises by contrast inertia coefficient increases besides a same phenomenon is observed as did by van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 that inertia coefficient emerges a different trend for a wall bounded plate compared to the one for a free plate when kc number is larger than 4 this is due to the preservation of symmetric vortex shedding with the presence of wall in the wall bounded case while the onset of asymmetric vortex shedding in the free plate case 6 2 2 series a3 influence of draught the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a3 are listed in table 7 it concerns two draughts 0 1 m and 0 08 m from the results of series a1 in table 6 a third draught 0 1615 m is involved in the draught dependence study the results are plotted in fig 8 fig 8 demonstrates that with the decrease of draught drag coefficient slightly rises while inertia coefficient falls similar discovery is also observed in van t veer 2015 but he did not give a reason according to zhang et al 2019a bangun et al 2010 a part of the vortices previously shed from the bilge keel move toward and diffuse near the free surface with the roll motion of the ship fig 9 depicts the velocity vector around the right side of the ship section at the instant t 3 t the ship section rolls with an amplitude of 0 17 rad and a period of 1s clearly near the free surface vortex structures appear it may conclude that the interaction between the previous vortex which is now approaching the free surface and the new vortex which is now generated near the bilge keel strengthens the drag coefficient when the draught decreases as is known bilge keel inertia load gets maximum when the ship section moves to its extreme position t n t t 4 or t n t 3 t 4 at that moment the acceleration attains its peak the total water mass reduces with the decrease of draught which probably leads to the reduction of inertia coefficient but overall the influence of draught is minuscule and negligible 6 2 3 series a4 influence of frequency table 8 lists the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a4 it concerns two periods 0 8s and 1 4s from the results of series a1 in table 6 a third period 1s is involved in the frequency dependence study the results are plotted in fig 10 the results indicate that both drag and inertia coefficients are insensitive to the roll period in the range of 0 8s and 1 4s at larger kc number inertia coefficients for the three periods still have some amount of deviation about 5 5 but it is now difficult to explain 6 2 4 series a5 influence of bilge keel thickness table 9 lists the calculated drag and inertia coefficients for series a5 it concerns two bilge keel thicknesses 0 003 m and 0 004 m from the results of series a1 in table 6 a third bilge keel thickness 0 002 m is involved in the dependence study of bilge keel thickness the results are plotted in fig 11 in general the influence of bilge keel thickness on drag and inertia coefficients is quite small and negligible however as bilge keel thickness falls drag coefficient has a slight increase at lower kc number this is likely because the process of vortex shedding from the thicker bilge keel is a little bit slower when kc number is small besides with the falling of bilge keel thickness inertia coefficient mildly decreases at larger kc number which could be affected by the selection of reference volume of bilge keel 6 3 higher harmonic coefficients the higher harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are discussed in this section figs 12 15 show the comparison of the calculated third and fifth drag and inertia coefficients with the corresponding ones of van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 respectively all five series are concluded it can be seen that the coefficients agree basically with the previous literatures except the third harmonic drag coefficient from these figures one can see that influence of high harmonic terms on bilge keel load against kc number declines fast than the one in the abovementioned paper when kc 5 the present higher harmonic terms basically becomes zero since in this work the mid section of a kvlcc2 is taken as the object ship hull which is much plumper than the cylinder section used in van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 though the ship section marginally influence the results the higher harmonic terms are extremely sensitive this may result in the difference of the higher harmonic terms fig 16 displays the comparison of the calculated three harmonic terms of drag and inertia coefficients absolute values of the first harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are prominently larger than the third ones and the third ones are again larger than the fifth ones that is influence of higher harmonic terms on bilge keel load is gradually diminishing this discovery is also reported in van t veer 2015 and keulegan and carpenter 1958 6 4 radiated wave figs 17 and 18 depict time series of radiated wave elevation at the monitoring positions of wave probe 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 for series a1 and a2 respectively it is evident that roll amplitude has a strong influence on radiated wave and by contrast the effect of bilge keel height is exceptionally tiny since the bilge keel is only fitted to the right side of the ship section radiated wave elevation at the position of wave probe 1 almost remains constant with the change of bilge keel height the different behaviors of radiated wave elevation for series a1 and a2 will lead to distinct hull pressure distribution near free surface even though they have same kc number which will be illuminated in section 6 5 6 5 hull pressure distribution this section explores the characteristics of dynamic pressure distribution on the ship hull variations of the peaks of positive and negative pressure coefficients with kc number at the instants when roll velocity attains maximum t 3 t 0 5 t and t 3 t are given in figs 19 and 20 together with the results of van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 and ikeda et al 1977a series a1 and a2 are concerned considering that the vortices always shed and move towards the back side of bilge keel ikeda et al 1977a assumed that positive pressure coefficient in front of bilge keel is kc independent while negative pressure coefficient in back of bilge keel is kc dependent however the figures show that positive pressure coefficient varies obviously with kc number at low kc number while at high kc number it seems to be consistent with the one of ikeda et al 1977a and kc independent this finding is also reported in ommani et al 2016 furthermore a distinct slope change around kc 6 is observed thus the positive pressure coefficient ought to be kc dependent at low kc number especially when kc 6 besides from the figures empirical method underestimates the positive pressure coefficients at low kc number the negative pressure coefficient in back of bilge keel behaves queerly at low kc number a slope change is striking around kc 2 but it is hard to give a reason here besides it can be observed that empirical method overestimates negative pressure coefficients which is also found in van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 in the majority of cases the present pressure coefficients are in conformity with the ones of the aforementioned literatures table 10 presents the peaks of positive and negative pressure coefficients at the instants t 3 t 0 5 t and t 3 t series a1 and a2 are included the corresponding drag coefficients are also listed in this table the results for all kc numbers commonly satisfy the relationship between drag coefficient and the jump of pressure coefficient over bilge keel c d c p c p proposed by ikeda et al 1977a overall differences between drag coefficient c d and jump of pressure coefficient c p c p are within 10 figs 21 and 22 show distributions of dynamic pressure coefficient over the ship boundary at the instant with maximum roll velocity t 3 t for a selection of roll amplitudes series a1 and bilge keel heights series a2 respectively in the figures the abscissa represents the curve length between the simulated point and the base of bilge keel curve length is positive when the simulated point lies in front of bilge keel while negative at back side and zero denotes the position of bilge keel from figs 21 and 22 the negative pressure at first increases almost linearly over the round ship bilge and then decreases linearly over the large flat bottom to zero this phenomenon is somewhat analogous to the ones of van t veer 2015 and ommani et al 2016 as for the distribution of positive pressure coefficient it drops firstly over the round ship bilge an apparent slop change is observed at the end of round bilge or the beginning of the big flat side the distribution of positive pressure coefficient near free surface in fig 21 is distinctly different from the one in fig 22 as stated in section 6 4 roll amplitude strongly influences the radiated wave while bilge keel height has tiny effect thus in fig 21 positive pressure coefficient near free surface changes visibly with roll amplitude while it remains nearly constant for different bilge keel height in fig 22 7 conclusions this paper investigates the bilge keel load and hull pressure distribution on a harmonically rolling ship section the mid section of a kvlcc2 fitted with a bilge keel at one side influence of kc number by changing roll amplitude series a1 and changing bilge keel height series a2 are performed besides three draughts series a3 three periods series a4 and three bilge keel thicknesses series a5 are concerned to explore the effect of draught circular frequency and bilge keel thickness respectively a high order fractional step finite volume solver is applied to solve incompressible viscous flows on a collocated cartesian grid system where a fourth order compact scheme discretizes the convection and diffusion terms a fractional step method along with an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme advances the solutions of the navier stokes equations a les simulates turbulence a plic vof method captures free surface and a gcibm solves moving ship body besides drag and inertia coefficients in morison equation and the corresponding higher harmonic terms are derived in terms of the fourier analysis from bilge keel loads hull pressure distribution is presented by pressure coefficient bilge keel load shows pronounced nonlinearity it indicates the necessity of higher harmonic terms in addition the calculated drag and inertia coefficients are compared with the ones for a free keulegan and carpenter 1958 and a wall bounded sarpkaya and o keefe 1996 fixed plate in oscillating currents and for a rolling bilge keel fitted to a circular cylinder in an still water van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 an exceptionally good agreement are obtained drag and inertia coefficients rely on kc number by whatever mean either varying roll amplitude or varying bilge keel height besides with decreasing draught drag coefficient slightly rises while inertia coefficient falls but in general the influence of draught is minuscule and negligible roll period in the range of 0 8s and 1 4s and bilge keel thickness have little influence on bilge keel load moreover absolute values of the higher harmonic coefficients are always smaller than that of the lower ones it demonstrates that the influence of higher harmonic terms on bilge keel load is diminishing variations of the peaks of positive and negative pressure coefficients with kc number are compared with the ones of van t veer 2015 ommani et al 2016 and ikeda et al 1977a it is shown that positive pressure coefficient in front of bilge keel is kc dependent at low kc number especially when kc 6 and is underestimated by the empirical method besides empirical method overestimates negative pressure coefficient in back of bilge keel overall drag coefficient and the jump of pressure coefficient over bilge keel essentially satisfies the relationship assumed in ikeda et al 1977a holding c d c p c p as for pressure distribution over ship hull at the instant t n t negative coefficient at first increases linearly over the round ship bilge and then decreases over the flat bottom to zero and positive pressure coefficient drops firstly over the round ship bilge and then a striking slop change is observed at the beginning of vertical flat side i e the end of round bilge moreover due to the effect of radiated wave positive pressure coefficient near free surface changes visibly with roll amplitude credit authorship

22053,this paper describes a study of the fatigue characterization of polyamide mooring ropes for floating wind turbines under some conditions polyester ropes which are favoured for offshore oil and gas platform station keeping are too stiff for wind turbine moorings and polyamide may be a suitable alternative while early studies on fatigue of braided nylon ropes showed very short lifetimes some recent results have indicated that it is possible to significantly enhance lifetime by modifying rope construction and improving fibre coatings in this paper yarn on yarn abrasion testing is used first to evaluate a new yarn coating significant lifetime enhancement was noted so fatigue testing of ropes was then performed results confirm that excellent fatigue lifetimes can be achieved superior to those for steel chain finally failed yarn and rope samples were examined by microscopy in order to improve understanding of the fatigue mechanisms leading to failure keywords fatigue rope nylon mooring water floating wind turbine 1 introduction as offshore energy converter systems such as floating wind turbines approach commercial development there is a need for mooring lines in shallow water between 50 and 100 m since these applications aim at harnessing marine energies the systems are located in exposed areas where dynamic loading is significant in addition the inherent moderate to low water depth results in a globally stiff behaviour of the mooring system when the standard components for deep water floating oil and gas platforms weller et al 2015a are used steel chains or polyester rope the system integrity will be maintained by damping the dynamic loadings requiring the use of more stretchable fibre ropes than polyester in order to remain within limited floater offsets to protect the export cable polyamide 6 nylon fibres are a good candidate for these applications because of experience from previous use in other marine applications low price and high breaking strain up to 25 it is first instructive to examine the behaviour of individual nylon fibres bunsell developed a single fibre tensile test machine bunsell et al 1971 which was used in several fatigue test programmes on nylon bunsell and hearle 1971 ramirez et al 2006 colomban et al 2006 polyester le clerc et al 2007 lechat et al 2006 and higher stiffness lafitte and bunsell 1982 davies et al 2010 fibres the nylon used in those studies was polyamide 6 6 but a comparison with polyester showed that the tensile fatigue mechanisms are similar bunsell 2009 both fibres show distinctive failure morphology fatigue cracks originate at the surface or just below it at inclusions and run within the fibre in the axial direction producing long characteristic fatigue cracks in terms of fatigue lifetime one approach is to define a median number of cycles to failure the lifetime at which 50 of the samples break at a given load range typically 25 30 fibres are tested for each median value and tests are run dry table 1 shows some published values for nylon 66 and polyester fibres obtained in the same laboratory overall the pet lifetimes appear longer but the fibres tested in the two studies were not identical and this is reflected in differences between the two sets of data for individual test series such as those with a load range 0 75 the median lifetimes for pet in le clerc 2004 and nylon in herrera ramirez 2004 are very similar it should also be underlined that any comparison between nylon and polyester is complicated by the much lower stiffness of the former all the tests reported in those fibre studies were run under load control if strain control had been applied the nylon results would probably exceed those for polyester finally it should be noted that it is necessary to apply very large load ranges to obtain failures well above the usual service loads indicating that the intrinsic fatigue strength of both these fibres is high when ropes rather than single fibres are considered studies on braided nylon 6 ropes in the 1980 s kenney et al 1985 mandell 1987 have shown relatively poor fatigue performance compared to polyester which provided little incentive for developing nylon mooring ropes indeed nylon single point moorings used offshore are typically changed every one or two years a study published by ocimf the oil companies international marine forum in 1982 presented results from tests on small and large nylon rope hawsers both new and after service these revealed that a semi log relationship of the type n ea 100 l could be used to represent the data with n the cycles to failure a an empirical parameter and l the maximum load as a percentage of break load the empirical parameter a was found to be in the range 0 14 0 16 for ropes tested during that study for a wet rope this corresponded to only a few hundred cycles at 50 of the break load several other studies in the 1980 s and 1990 s generated fatigue data on braided nylon ropes for example seo et al 1997 examined wear and fatigue of nylon and polyester fibres and ropes they showed yarn on yarn yoy abrasion data which indicated that while nylon 66 fibres showed better durability than polyester when dry when tests were run wet the nylon 66 showed significant reduction in wear resistance whereas polyester did not they concluded that comparisons of yoy wear between nylon and polyester will vary significantly with the loading condition nylons are superior at very high tensions whereas at low tensions polyester lifetimes exceed those of nylon there is a widely perceived idea that polyester ropes have superior fatigue resistance to nylon ropes quite recently however ridge et al 2010 banfield and ridge 2017 have shown significantly improved fatigue results for twisted nylon ropes those authors qualified these ropes as ideal for wave energy convertor moorings and flory et al 2016 also discussed these applications two major differences compared to the earlier fatigue work were the use of twisted ropes with long lay lengths and the application of improved fibre coatings both can help to reduce internal abrasion which was shown by mandell to be a major failure mechanism during low load high cycle fatigue mandell 1987 at higher loads creep rupture is the main concern and this depends on the polymer structure rather than the fibre interactions there are few other relevant and recent results for these materials but weller et al 2015b examined a 44 mm diameter parallel twisted strand nylon 6 rope that had been tested at sea for 18 months on a wave energy buoy and showed the importance of loading history and operating conditions on nylon rope performance polyester fibre ropes have been used for mooring deep water offshore platforms for many years now de pellegrin 1999 bugg et al 2004 haslum et al 2005 and extensive fatigue testing has shown that their fatigue performance is better than equivalent steel components banfield et al 2000 the idea of using nylon ropes for long term mooring lines is relatively new as there is little available knowledge on the durability behaviour of such structures indeed as pham et al 2019 conclude in a very recent study a comprehensive study on the critical fatigue damage mechanisms of nylon should be the topic of future work it is therefore essential to generate further data on polyamide mooring ropes in order to validate their use for this application it is also of interest to see how these improved nylon rope constructions compare with the polyester ropes currently in use offshore the goal of the present study is to provide a better understanding of the mechanical behaviour and the fatigue damage of twisted polyamide ropes compared to other mooring line options in order to help design floating wind turbine mooring lines first the influence of fibre coating is evaluated by yarn on yarn abrasion tests then results from quasi static and cyclic tests on rope samples are shown finally failure mechanisms are described and discussed 2 materials and test methods 2 1 fibres and ropes polyamide 6 pa6 often described as nylon 6 in the form of yarns and ropes provided by bexco hamme belgium have been investigated in this study the yarns used are supplied by nexis fibers with a linear weight of 188 tex g km provided with and without a proprietary coating the nylon rope samples used in this series of tests were specially manufactured for the research project the rope is a 6 m long pin to pin three stranded rope of outer diameter around 15 mm for a nominal break load of 75 kn with eye splices at each end each strand is composed of the 188 tex yarns twisted together into rope yarns which are themselves twisted together to form the strand the strand lay length is similar to polyester sub rope constructions for deepwater mooring ropes and imposes splices of more than 2 m at each end of the rope leaving a 2 m central section ropes were all supplied from the same production run but in two deliveries which will be referred to as initial batch and final batch the coating details are confidential only ropes with coated yarn have been tested in this study 2 2 yarn on yarn tests the yarn on yarn abrasion tests were performed as described in the ci cordage institute requirements 2009 flory 2013 and astm d 6611 2007 this test is the standard industry method for testing inter yarn abrasion of synthetic fibers and provides a qualitative value of the abrasion resistance the only difference from the standard test procedure was that tests were performed in natural sea water here rather than the tap water defined in the standards these tests were carried out with the configuration presented in fig 1 a yarn is twisted with itself by turning it by 3 5 turns between three pulleys at one end of the yarn a weight is attached to apply a constant tension and at the other end a motor drives the cable back and forth with a 1 hz frequency until the yarn breaks due to abrasion in the twisted region different weights are applied to vary the applied tension the inter wrapped region is immersed in filtered untreated sea water throughout the test until failure two types of specimens have been tested with this test yarn without coating and yarn with a special marine finish results are given as cycles to failure versus the load expressed in grams per tex where tex is the linear weight of the yarn in grams per km 2 3 rope fatigue tests quasi static and fatigue testing have been performed on a servo hydraulic test machine at the ifremer marine structures laboratory in brest this has a load capacity of 300 kn aep tc4 load cell accuracy 1 kn and a piston stroke of 3 m a scaime wire transducer pt5dc 40 accuracy 1 mm was used to measure piston movements load was introduced to the eye splices through 100 mm diameter steel pins for tests in which strain was measured in the central part of the rope between splices a wire displacement transducer asm ws10 500 accuracy 0 5 mm was clamped to the rope over a known length it is well known that polyamides are sensitive to water and moisture has been shown to affect the long term behaviour of polyamide 6 fibres iso18692 2007 miri et al 2009 hunt and darlington 1980 humeau et al 2018 so it is essential to perform tests in the wet state before each test the rope sample was fully immersed in tap water for 4 h on the testing machine without load it was then continuously sprayed with tap water throughout the test as shown in fig 2 unless noted otherwise the fatigue test results presented here were obtained with a mean load of 40 of nominal break load and at a cycling frequency of 0 1 hz sinusoidal load amplitude was applied around this mean value before each test a pre cycling bedding in protocol was applied this consisted of five load unload cycles up to 50 of nominal break load with each loading and unloading ramp lasting 2 5 min and hold periods of 5 min at 10 and 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 yarn on yarn abrasion tests yarn on yarn abrasion tests were performed up to failure which occurred in the inter wrapped section of the yarn in all cases reported on fig 3 on this curve each point represents 3 to 8 test repeats at each applied stress level defined in grams tex depending on the scatter the error bars represent the minimum and maximum numbers of cycles found at each load the dashed lines show a linear best fit on the semi log scale the continuous red line corresponds to values in a cordage institute guidance document flory 2013 which recommends a minimum lifetime for each load level for offshore hawsers cycles to failure are significantly higher for coated yarn samples and there is more scatter in results for uncoated yarns there is a minimum performance criterion number of cycles versus applied tension defined for polyamide yarns for offshore use in hawsers given by the ci document flory 2013 which is represented as a red line on fig 3 the coating enables the mean test values at all applied stresses to satisfy this criterion though the criterion is only satisfied for all individual test lifetimes below an applied stress of 3 g tex a set of yarn on yarn abrasion tests was also performed on a 220 tex polyester fibre yarn with a marine finish currently used in offshore mooring line applications fig 4 shows the comparison between the polyester and the nylon these tests were all performed on the same test machine in natural seawater following the same test procedure it is apparent that the yarn on yarn abrasion lifetimes of the coated nylon yarn are similar to those of this polyester yarn the main conclusion from these test results is that addition of this special marine coating to yarns results in an increase in lifetime by one or two decades the coating enables mean lifetimes of this yarn to pass from below to above the ci limit and to achieve similar performance to those of a polyester yarn with marine finish given this promising improvement a set of rope specimens was then prepared from these coated yarns 3 2 rope quasi static break test wet and dry break tests were performed first to check nominal reference strength values on one wet sample the strain to failure was measured by fixing an expendable wire transducer gauge to the central section between splices table 2 shows the results from these six tests fig 5 shows the load strain plot for the wet break test this rope sample was subjected to unloading cycles at 20 40 60 and 80 of the nominal break load followed by a ramp to failure the other samples were loaded directly to failure at a rate of 20 break load minute the load strain response is very non linear as has been noted in previous studies 3 3 iso cyclic tests in order to compare the behaviour of the improved nylon rope with the polyester used today for offshore moorings two tests were run following the iso18692 2007 procedure for offshore station keeping the rope was cycled between 5 and 55 i e a load range of 50 and 10 000 cycles were applied followed by residual break tests in fact the iso test requires the number of cycles n to be only 5500 cycles for this load range n 166 r5 05 with r the load range as a percentage of break load so the tests performed here were more severe than the specified conditions table 3 shows the results the residual strengths are very close to 100 of the measured dry and wet strengths shown in table 2 this suggests that the cyclic performance of these ropes satisfies the iso fatigue requirement for permanent offshore moorings 3 4 multi specimen fatigue test results twenty five rope specimens were then tested wet in fatigue at different load levels with continuous cycling up to failure at 0 1 hz the longest test lasted around 320 000 cycles 37 days fig 6 shows examples of the load time and piston displacement time recordings for a fatigue test which involved 5 bedding in cycles to 37 5 kn followed by 4612 cycles between 10 and 50 kn to failure results are shown first in the traditional s n format in fig 7 with cycles to failure plotted versus maximum load fig 7a and load range fig 7b both normalized by the nominal dry break load 75 kn for all tests reported here failure occurred in the central section of the rope initiating near the transition between the end of a splice and the central section with complete separation of the specimen into two parts a small number of samples failed in the eye splice region at the sample end and these have been removed from the data set fig 8 shows an example of a broken specimen the fatigue data points are shown in an alternative presentation format in fig 9 in order to compare directly with the data published by ridge et al 2010 here the load range is normalized by the wet break load 75 kn and plotted on a log scale the dashed line in fig 9 shows the trend line for results from ridge et al 2010 on their improved polyamide rope for long term mooring of wave energy converters the results for the rope from the present study from a different rope manufacturer to that of ridge et al 2010 are grouped around those previous results a more detailed analysis of the results from the present tests shown in fig 9 revealed two populations as shown in fig 10 indeed when the results are plotted according to their batches it is apparent that the final batch provides significantly higher fatigue lives and lower variability than the initial batch the reasons for this difference are currently being investigated fig 11 shows a summary of the results from all tests in this study on nylon sub ropes and compares them with published results for nylon kenney et al 1985 ridge et al 2010 and polyester ropes banfield et al 2000 a plot is also included which corresponds to s n behaviour of steel chain banfield et al 2000 the coated nylon rope studied here provides considerably better fatigue lifetimes than the early double braid values kenney et al 1985 and a little better than recently published values on coated twisted ropes ridge et al 2010 values are a little lower than measured polyester offshore rope values but these nylon values exceed the minimum iso requirement thick red line confirming the iso test results noted previously in table 3 the fatigue lifetimes of these improved ropes are also considerably better than chain values these results reinforce the idea that provided appropriate rope constructions and coatings are adopted nylon fatigue may no longer be an issue for mooring lines for marine renewable energy applications 3 5 yarn and rope failure mechanisms optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei were used both to assess the main phenomena behind fatigue failure and to determine if the yarn on yarn test samples show the same damage mechanisms as those in rope fatigue testing 3 5 1 yarn samples after yarn on yarn abrasion tests specimens were analysed after yarn on yarn tests even at quite low loads some marks are observed on broken fibres which suggest a peeling mechanism may be acting examples are shown in fig 12 it should be noted that melted fibres were not observed on yarn samples 3 5 2 rope inspection after fatigue testing the results discussed by mandell 1987 suggest that two failure mechanisms dominate cyclic response of nylon ropes at high loads creep rupture is the main failure mode while at low loads abrasion can cause failure either external abrasion on bollards or internal abrasion between fibres however it should be noted that there is not a distinct cut off between these two mechanisms both may occur if loading amplitude and hence relative internal movement within the rope elements is sufficient as coatings are improved one would also expect the abrasion mechanism to be shifted to higher numbers of cycles most samples were taken from broken ropes at 200 mm from the final failure zone in order to detect damage but without the final high energy failure mechanisms additional observations on samples from tests interrupted before final failure and from areas of failed samples away from the break region revealed significant areas of abrasion in the contact areas between the rope strands fig 13 the outer surfaces of the strands are intact but the inner surfaces in contact reveal broken fibres more detailed examination in a scanning electron microscope revealed areas of surface peeling similar to those seen in yarn on yarn tests fig 14 similar features were documented by hearle et al 1998 a third significant feature in observations of broken ropes in fatigue in the failure zone is the presence of highly compacted and melted fibres fig 15 this probably occurs during the final separation of the rope when all the stored elastic energy is released 4 conclusion the results from yarn on yarn loading abrasion tests show a significant increase in abrasion resistance by the addition of a specially developed coating furthermore the long lay length rope construction enables these polyamide ropes to exhibit very good fatigue performance similar to that demonstrated recently for another rope product by ridge et al 2010 banfield and ridge 2017 flory et al 2016 however it is also shown here that the fibre coating conditions can significantly affect fatigue performance and must be carefully controlled sem observations show two particular failure mechanisms in ropes the first and most visible is melted fibres usually over a large area of the size of a yarn the second mechanism is the peeling of individual fibres this is probably indicative of abrasion as similar features were observed on broken fibres from the yarn on yarn test samples these results and the favourable comparison with polyester ropes currently being used for offshore platform station keeping suggest that provided appropriate coatings are applied to fibres fatigue lifetime should not be a limiting factor for mooring floating wind turbines with nylon fibre ropes

22053,this paper describes a study of the fatigue characterization of polyamide mooring ropes for floating wind turbines under some conditions polyester ropes which are favoured for offshore oil and gas platform station keeping are too stiff for wind turbine moorings and polyamide may be a suitable alternative while early studies on fatigue of braided nylon ropes showed very short lifetimes some recent results have indicated that it is possible to significantly enhance lifetime by modifying rope construction and improving fibre coatings in this paper yarn on yarn abrasion testing is used first to evaluate a new yarn coating significant lifetime enhancement was noted so fatigue testing of ropes was then performed results confirm that excellent fatigue lifetimes can be achieved superior to those for steel chain finally failed yarn and rope samples were examined by microscopy in order to improve understanding of the fatigue mechanisms leading to failure keywords fatigue rope nylon mooring water floating wind turbine 1 introduction as offshore energy converter systems such as floating wind turbines approach commercial development there is a need for mooring lines in shallow water between 50 and 100 m since these applications aim at harnessing marine energies the systems are located in exposed areas where dynamic loading is significant in addition the inherent moderate to low water depth results in a globally stiff behaviour of the mooring system when the standard components for deep water floating oil and gas platforms weller et al 2015a are used steel chains or polyester rope the system integrity will be maintained by damping the dynamic loadings requiring the use of more stretchable fibre ropes than polyester in order to remain within limited floater offsets to protect the export cable polyamide 6 nylon fibres are a good candidate for these applications because of experience from previous use in other marine applications low price and high breaking strain up to 25 it is first instructive to examine the behaviour of individual nylon fibres bunsell developed a single fibre tensile test machine bunsell et al 1971 which was used in several fatigue test programmes on nylon bunsell and hearle 1971 ramirez et al 2006 colomban et al 2006 polyester le clerc et al 2007 lechat et al 2006 and higher stiffness lafitte and bunsell 1982 davies et al 2010 fibres the nylon used in those studies was polyamide 6 6 but a comparison with polyester showed that the tensile fatigue mechanisms are similar bunsell 2009 both fibres show distinctive failure morphology fatigue cracks originate at the surface or just below it at inclusions and run within the fibre in the axial direction producing long characteristic fatigue cracks in terms of fatigue lifetime one approach is to define a median number of cycles to failure the lifetime at which 50 of the samples break at a given load range typically 25 30 fibres are tested for each median value and tests are run dry table 1 shows some published values for nylon 66 and polyester fibres obtained in the same laboratory overall the pet lifetimes appear longer but the fibres tested in the two studies were not identical and this is reflected in differences between the two sets of data for individual test series such as those with a load range 0 75 the median lifetimes for pet in le clerc 2004 and nylon in herrera ramirez 2004 are very similar it should also be underlined that any comparison between nylon and polyester is complicated by the much lower stiffness of the former all the tests reported in those fibre studies were run under load control if strain control had been applied the nylon results would probably exceed those for polyester finally it should be noted that it is necessary to apply very large load ranges to obtain failures well above the usual service loads indicating that the intrinsic fatigue strength of both these fibres is high when ropes rather than single fibres are considered studies on braided nylon 6 ropes in the 1980 s kenney et al 1985 mandell 1987 have shown relatively poor fatigue performance compared to polyester which provided little incentive for developing nylon mooring ropes indeed nylon single point moorings used offshore are typically changed every one or two years a study published by ocimf the oil companies international marine forum in 1982 presented results from tests on small and large nylon rope hawsers both new and after service these revealed that a semi log relationship of the type n ea 100 l could be used to represent the data with n the cycles to failure a an empirical parameter and l the maximum load as a percentage of break load the empirical parameter a was found to be in the range 0 14 0 16 for ropes tested during that study for a wet rope this corresponded to only a few hundred cycles at 50 of the break load several other studies in the 1980 s and 1990 s generated fatigue data on braided nylon ropes for example seo et al 1997 examined wear and fatigue of nylon and polyester fibres and ropes they showed yarn on yarn yoy abrasion data which indicated that while nylon 66 fibres showed better durability than polyester when dry when tests were run wet the nylon 66 showed significant reduction in wear resistance whereas polyester did not they concluded that comparisons of yoy wear between nylon and polyester will vary significantly with the loading condition nylons are superior at very high tensions whereas at low tensions polyester lifetimes exceed those of nylon there is a widely perceived idea that polyester ropes have superior fatigue resistance to nylon ropes quite recently however ridge et al 2010 banfield and ridge 2017 have shown significantly improved fatigue results for twisted nylon ropes those authors qualified these ropes as ideal for wave energy convertor moorings and flory et al 2016 also discussed these applications two major differences compared to the earlier fatigue work were the use of twisted ropes with long lay lengths and the application of improved fibre coatings both can help to reduce internal abrasion which was shown by mandell to be a major failure mechanism during low load high cycle fatigue mandell 1987 at higher loads creep rupture is the main concern and this depends on the polymer structure rather than the fibre interactions there are few other relevant and recent results for these materials but weller et al 2015b examined a 44 mm diameter parallel twisted strand nylon 6 rope that had been tested at sea for 18 months on a wave energy buoy and showed the importance of loading history and operating conditions on nylon rope performance polyester fibre ropes have been used for mooring deep water offshore platforms for many

of the present study is to provide a better understanding of the mechanical behaviour and the fatigue damage of twisted polyamide ropes compared to other mooring line options in order to help design floating wind turbine mooring lines first the influence of fibre coating is evaluated by yarn on yarn abrasion tests then results from quasi static and cyclic tests on rope samples are shown finally failure mechanisms are described and discussed 2 materials and test methods 2 1 fibres and ropes polyamide 6 pa6 often described as nylon 6 in the form of yarns and ropes provided by bexco hamme belgium have been investigated in this study the yarns used are supplied by nexis fibers with a linear weight of 188 tex g km provided with and without a proprietary coating the nylon rope samples used in this series of tests were specially manufactured for the research project the rope is a 6 m long pin to pin three stranded rope of outer diameter around 15 mm for a nominal break load of 75 kn with eye splices at each end each strand is composed of the 188 tex yarns twisted together into rope yarns which are themselves twisted together to form the strand the strand lay length is similar to polyester sub rope constructions for deepwater mooring ropes and imposes splices of more than 2 m at each end of the rope leaving a 2 m central section ropes were all supplied from the same production run but in two deliveries which will be referred to as initial batch and final batch the coating details are confidential only ropes with coated yarn have been tested in this study 2 2 yarn on yarn tests the yarn on yarn abrasion tests were performed as described in the ci cordage institute requirements 2009 flory 2013 and astm d 6611 2007 this test is the standard industry method for testing inter yarn abrasion of synthetic fibers and provides a qualitative value of the abrasion resistance the only difference from the standard test procedure was that tests were performed in natural sea water here rather than the tap water defined in the standards these tests were carried out with the configuration presented in fig 1 a yarn is twisted with itself by turning it by 3 5 turns between three pulleys at one end of the yarn a weight is attached to apply a constant tension and at the other end a motor drives the cable back and forth with a 1 hz frequency until the yarn breaks due to abrasion in the twisted region different weights are applied to vary the applied tension the inter wrapped region is immersed in filtered untreated sea water throughout the test until failure two types of specimens have been tested with this test yarn without coating and yarn with a special marine finish results are given as cycles to failure versus the load expressed in grams per tex where tex is the linear weight of the yarn in grams per km 2 3 rope fatigue tests quasi static and fatigue testing have been performed on a servo hydraulic test machine at the ifremer marine structures laboratory in brest this has a load capacity of 300 kn aep tc4 load cell accuracy 1 kn and a piston stroke of 3 m a scaime wire transducer pt5dc 40 accuracy 1 mm was used to measure piston movements load was introduced to the eye splices through 100 mm diameter steel pins for tests in which strain was measured in the central part of the rope between splices a wire displacement transducer asm ws10 500 accuracy 0 5 mm was clamped to the rope over a known length it is well known that polyamides are sensitive to water and moisture has been shown to affect the long term behaviour of polyamide 6 fibres iso18692 2007 miri et al 2009 hunt and darlington 1980 humeau et al 2018 so it is essential to perform tests in the wet state before each test the rope sample was fully immersed in tap water for 4 h on the testing machine without load it was then continuously sprayed with tap water throughout the test as shown in fig 2 unless noted otherwise the fatigue test results presented here were obtained with a mean load of 40 of nominal break load and at a cycling frequency of 0 1 hz sinusoidal load amplitude was applied around this mean value before each test a pre cycling bedding in protocol was applied this consisted of five load unload cycles up to 50 of nominal break load with each loading and unloading ramp lasting 2 5 min and hold periods of 5 min at 10 and 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 yarn on yarn abrasion tests yarn on yarn abrasion tests were performed up to failure which occurred in the inter wrapped section of the yarn in all cases reported on fig 3 on this curve each point represents 3 to 8 test repeats at each applied stress level defined in grams tex depending on the scatter the error bars represent the minimum and maximum numbers of cycles found at each load the dashed lines show a linear best fit on the semi log scale the continuous red line corresponds to values in a cordage institute guidance document flory 2013 which recommends a minimum lifetime for each load level for offshore hawsers cycles to failure are significantly higher for coated yarn samples and there is more scatter in results for uncoated yarns there is a minimum performance criterion number of cycles versus applied tension defined for polyamide yarns for offshore use in hawsers given by the ci document flory 2013 which is represented as a red line on fig 3 the coating enables the mean test values at all applied stresses to satisfy this criterion though the criterion is only satisfied for all individual test lifetimes below an applied stress of 3 g tex a set of yarn on yarn abrasion tests was also performed on a 220 tex polyester fibre yarn with a marine finish currently used in offshore mooring line applications fig 4 shows the comparison between the polyester and the nylon these tests were all performed on the same test machine in natural seawater following the same test procedure it is apparent that the yarn on yarn abrasion lifetimes of the coated nylon yarn are similar to those of this polyester yarn the main conclusion from these test results is that addition of this special marine coating to yarns results in an increase in lifetime by one or two decades the coating enables mean lifetimes of this yarn to pass from below to above the ci limit and to achieve similar performance to those of a polyester yarn with marine finish given this promising improvement a set of rope specimens was then prepared from these coated yarns 3 2 rope quasi static break test wet and dry break tests were performed first to check nominal reference strength values on one wet sample the strain to failure was measured by fixing an expendable wire transducer gauge to the central section between splices table 2 shows the results from these six tests fig 5 shows the load strain plot for the wet break test this rope sample was subjected to unloading cycles at 20 40 60 and 80 of the nominal break load followed by a ramp to failure the other samples were loaded directly to failure at a rate of 20 break load minute the load strain response is very non linear as has been noted in previous studies 3 3 iso cyclic tests in order to compare the behaviour of the improved nylon rope with the polyester used today for offshore moorings two tests were run following the iso18692 2007 procedure for offshore station keeping the rope was cycled between 5 and 55 i e a load range of 50 and 10 000 cycles were applied followed by residual break tests in fact the iso test requires the number of cycles n to be only 5500 cycles for this load range n 166 r5 05 with r the load range as a percentage of break load so the tests performed here were more severe than the specified conditions table 3 shows the results the residual strengths are very close to 100 of the measured dry and wet strengths shown in table 2 this suggests that the cyclic performance of these ropes satisfies the iso fatigue requirement for permanent offshore moorings 3 4 multi specimen fatigue test results twenty five rope specimens were then tested wet in fatigue at different load levels with continuous cycling up to failure at 0 1 hz the longest test lasted around 320 000 cycles 37 days fig 6 shows examples of the load time and piston displacement time recordings for a fatigue test which involved 5 bedding in cycles to 37 5 kn followed by 4612 cycles between 10 and 50 kn to failure results are shown first in the traditional s n format in fig 7 with cycles to failure plotted versus maximum load fig 7a and load range fig 7b both normalized by the nominal dry break load 75 kn for all tests reported here failure occurred in the central section of the rope initiating near the transition between the end of a splice and the central section with complete separation of the specimen into two parts a small number of samples failed in the eye splice region at the sample end and these have been removed from the data set fig 8 shows an example of a broken specimen the fatigue data points are shown in an alternative presentation format in fig 9 in order to compare directly with the data published by ridge et al 2010 here the load range is normalized by the wet break load 75 kn and plotted on a log scale the dashed line in fig 9 shows the trend line for results from ridge et al 2010 on their improved polyamide rope for long term mooring of wave energy converters the results for the rope from the present study from a different rope manufacturer to that of ridge et al 2010 are grouped around those previous results a more detailed analysis of the results from the present tests shown in fig 9 revealed two populations as shown in fig 10 indeed when the results are plotted according to their batches it is apparent that the final batch provides significantly higher fatigue lives and lower variability than the initial batch the reasons for this difference are currently being investigated fig 11 shows a summary of the results from all tests in this study on nylon sub ropes and compares them with published results for nylon kenney et al 1985 ridge et al 2010 and polyester ropes banfield et al 2000 a plot is also included which corresponds to s n behaviour of steel chain banfield et al 2000 the coated nylon rope studied here provides considerably better fatigue lifetimes than the early double braid values kenney et al 1985 and a little better than recently published values on coated twisted ropes ridge et al 2010 values are a little lower than measured polyester offshore rope values but these nylon values exceed the minimum iso requirement thick red line confirming the iso test results noted previously in table 3 the fatigue lifetimes of these improved ropes are also considerably better than chain values these results reinforce the idea that provided appropriate rope constructions and coatings are adopted nylon fatigue may no longer be an issue for mooring lines for marine renewable energy applications 3 5 yarn and rope failure mechanisms optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei were used both to assess the main phenomena behind fatigue failure and to determine if the yarn on yarn test samples show the same damage mechanisms as those in rope fatigue testing 3 5 1 yarn samples after yarn on yarn abrasion tests specimens were analysed after yarn on yarn tests even at quite low loads some marks are observed on broken fibres which suggest a peeling mechanism may be acting examples are shown in fig 12 it should be noted that melted fibres were not observed on yarn samples 3 5 2 rope inspection after fatigue testing the results discussed by mandell 1987 suggest that two failure mechanisms dominate cyclic response of nylon ropes at high loads creep rupture is the main failure mode while at low loads abrasion can cause failure either external abrasion on bollards or internal abrasion between fibres however it should be noted that there is not a distinct cut off between these two mechanisms both may occur if loading amplitude and hence relative internal movement within the rope elements is sufficient as coatings are improved one would also expect the abrasion mechanism to be shifted to higher numbers of cycles most samples were taken from broken ropes at 200 mm from the final failure zone in order to detect damage but without the final high energy failure mechanisms additional observations on samples from tests interrupted before final failure and from areas of failed samples away from the break region revealed significant areas of abrasion in the contact areas between the rope strands fig 13 the outer surfaces of the strands are intact but the inner surfaces in contact reveal broken fibres more detailed examination in a scanning electron microscope revealed areas of surface peeling similar to those seen in yarn on yarn tests fig 14 similar features were documented by hearle et al 1998 a third significant feature in observations of broken ropes in fatigue in the failure zone is the presence of highly compacted and melted fibres fig 15 this probably occurs during the final separation of the rope when all the stored elastic energy is released 4 conclusion the results from yarn on yarn loading abrasion tests show a significant increase in abrasion resistance by the addition of a specially developed coating furthermore the long lay length rope construction enables these polyamide ropes to exhibit very good fatigue performance similar to that demonstrated recently for another rope product by ridge et al 2010 banfield and ridge 2017 flory et al 2016 however it is also shown here that the fibre coating conditions can significantly affect fatigue performance and must be carefully controlled sem observations show two particular failure mechanisms in ropes the first and most visible is melted fibres usually over a large area of the size of a yarn the second mechanism is the peeling of individual fibres this is probably indicative of abrasion as similar features were observed on broken fibres from the yarn on yarn test samples these results and the favourable comparison with polyester ropes currently being used for offshore platform station keeping suggest that provided appropriate coatings are applied to fibres fatigue lifetime should not be a limiting factor for mooring floating wind turbines with nylon fibre ropes

of marine shipping the collisions and groundings take 71 of accidents in european waters as reported by the european maritime safety agency allianz global corporate and speciality 2018 during the period 2011 2016 teixeira and guedes soares 2018 reported that general cargo ships account for 43 of all marine casualties reported followed by passenger ships 24 one of the most significant reasons is that the size of cargo ship grows large which causes the ship s manoeuvrability to decrease especially in shallow water and confined waters as described by vantorre et al 2017 the study on ship manoeuvrability in shallow water is critically important as ships have to access harbours in shallow and confined waters where the traffic is more complex this put forward higher requirement about ship s manoeuvrability as discussed in lataire et al 2012 maimun et al 2011 tello ruiz et al 2018 2015 vantorre et al 2017 yoshimura 1986 zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the ship s roll response model in shallow water for a container ship model was studied using nonlinear least squares support vector machine chen et al 2019 the study on ship manoeuvrability considering shallow water effect can benefit the design of ship autopilot and provide a decision making reference for the sailor mathematical models are widely used to describe the dynamics of ships in deep and shallow water maimun et al 2011 inoue and murayama 1969 employed the wing theory to calculate the derivative of manoeuvring motion in shallow water norrbin 1971 discussed consequences of finite water depth for mathematical manoeuvring an evaluation of semi empirical formulae for manoeuvring in shallow water was discussed by vantorre 2001 katrien et al 2015 carried out a shallow water manoeuvring simulation using free running tests vantorre et al 2017 discussed the effect of shallow water for marine surface ship benchmark data for manoeuvring in shallow water of dtc ship model have been addressed by van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 as described in the report by the manoeuvring committee of 24th international towing tank conference ittc 2005 the hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained using system identification method which is a mature technique for building mathematical models with the measured data ljung 1999 least square ls method is a popular technology due to the fact that it can provide the theoretical solution if the data is ideal and rich enough to activate the dynamic of the system but the measured data is always with noise which causes a large uncertainty of the obtained parameters in some cases xu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c employed the singular value decomposition and regularize method to diminish the parameter uncertainty sutulo and guedes soares 2014 employed least square for the parameter estimation of a nonlinear manoeuvring model using the zigzag tests with noise a similar study can also be found in xu et al 2018 where a loss function considering both the bias and variance of the errors between the reference outputs and the mathematical model outputs was proposed perera et al 2015 2016 used kalman filter to estimate the dynamic parameters of a modified nomoto model for vessel steering an online least square support vector machine was applied to modelling the nonlinear ship steering motion in real time in xu et al 2019c support vector machine svm has been widely used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients for marine vessels it is a universal learning machine in the framework of structural risk minimization srm suykens and vandewalle 1999 vapnik 1998 in luo et al 2016 luo and zou 2009 the least square support vector machine ls svm was used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of an abkowitz model the further work on this topic can be found in luo et al 2016 in which particle swarm optimization was employed to choose the regularization factor xu and guedes soares 2016 used the least square support vector machine ls svm to identify a nonlinear steering model for ship autopilot design zhu et al 2017 used an optimal ls svm combined with artificial bee colony algorithm to estimate a dynamic model of a large container ship the main contribution of this paper is to carry out an experimental study on the manoeuvring motion of a marine surface ship in shallow water and to investigate the shallow water effect on vessel steering model using the system identification method in order to carry out the manoeuvring test a scaled free running ship model with one propeller and rudder was constructed the sensors and actuators were installed and synchronized in labview platform an optimal truncated ls svm xu and guedes soares 2019 2020 was employed to estimate the parameters this method can reduce the dimensionality of the kernel matrix and avoids the costly matrix inversion operation by using the singular values decomposition the validation of truncated ls svm was carried out and the shallow water effect on vessel steering mode was discussed according to the identified parameters 2 nonlinear vessel steering models the nonlinear vessel steering models are described in this section a marine surface vessel moving on the sea can be usually described in 6 degree of freedoms dofs as illustrated in fig 1 as described by sutulo and guedes soares 2011 the motions in 3 dofs surge sway and yaw typically occur with a much lower frequency than the wave encounter frequencies so it is reasonable to neglect the fluid memory effects fossen 2011 usually nonlinear manoeuvring models are used to describe the manoeuvring motions such as mmg abkowitz model those models have a complex structure and are not typically used to design autopilots right now most of the controllers autopilots are designed based on the nomoto model which is a simplified linear model by neglecting the higher order effects the manoeuvring motions of a conventional ship can be described in 3 dofs surge sway and yaw and the hydrodynamic coefficients can be presented using constant values assuming a ship moving in a horizontal plane as presented in fig 2 the euler equations of arbitrary motion in the horizontal plane are given 1 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 x m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r y m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r n where m and i z z are the mass and the moment of inertia respectively x g is the position of centre of mass in the x direction μ 11 μ 22 and μ 26 are the added masses and moments respectively x y and n are the hydrodynamic forces and moments for ship steering problem the constant surge speed is usually assumed then the surge force equation can be decoupled from the 3 dof motion equations linearize the sway force and yaw moment then liner equation is given 2 m y v v m x g y r r m u r y v v y r r y δ

åström and källström 1976 tzeng and chen 1999 because the difference between t 2 and t 3 is small they are usually of the same order of magnitude therefore the pole zero cancellation can be implied to

represents an inner product between its operands it is positive definite and satisfies the mercer condition suykens and vandewalle 1999 vapnik 1995 as presented in eq 16 the dimension of the kernel matrix a is n 1 n 1 it is proportional to the length of the training set when the training set is large the classical ls svm will be failed due to the heavy computation meanwhile the large kernel matrix will result in an unstable solution which is usually dominated by the noise and drift from the true values the corresponded numerical model fits well with the training data and fails to reproduce the training set in the following part an optimal truncated ls svm is proposed to solve the parameter estimation for a large scale problem the parameter uncertainty is also discussed using singular value decomposition then a truncated least square support vector machine is proposed to diminish the parameter drift firstly using the singular value decomposition the matrix a can be rewritten as 17 a i 1 n u i σ i v i t u σ v t then the parameter matrix in eq 16 are given as 18 θ u σ v t 1 y v σ 1 u t y i 1 n v i u i t σ i y where the matrix u and v are orthonormal u t u i and v t v i ʃ is the diagonal matrix of the singular values of the matrix a assuming there is an additive perturbation δ y it will propagate to a perturbation in the solution 19 δ θ v σ 1 u t δ y i 1 n v i u i t σ i δ y as can be observed if the singular value σ i is very small or close to the numerical precision of the computation then the perturbation in the y is magnified and potentially dominate the solutions θ i in order to diminish such uncertainty and obtain a robust estimation it is necessary to neglect the effect caused by the smaller singular values truncated singular value decomposition tsvd can be used to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the matrix a by retaining the first r singular values of a and the corresponding columns of u and v the tsvd can be presented as 20 a r u r σ r v r t where the matrix σ r is obtained by retaining the first r singular values of σ similarly matrices u r and v r are found using the corresponding singular vectors the resulted a r represents the reduced data set where the data related to the omitted singular values are filtered meanwhile the dimensionality of the matrix is also reduced by using truncated singular values decomposition l curve hansen and o leary 1993 can be used to find the optimal value of r l curve is a graphical tool for displaying the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data as the r varies golub et al 1999 hansen and johnston 2001 from the l curve plot it is convenient to get the optimal parameters the whole program is given in fig 3 4 free running ship model test in shallow water in this section a free running ship model is used to carry out the manoeuvring tests in shallow water shallow water has an important effect on the manoeuvrability of the marine surface ship the vessel model considered in this paper is a scaled chemical tanker presented in fig 4 the scaled factor is 61 2 and the main dimensions of the ship model are given in table 1 the ship model is from a conventional ship it has one propeller and one rudder in the aft 4 1 hardware system of the free running ship model hardware system of the free running ship model consists of all the sensor and actuators as illustrated in fig 5 the hardware system is further divided into two groups onboard and offshore control centre the on board system is composed by propeller ruder and set of sensors internal measurement unit yaw rate sensor electrical motors and industrial wi fi unit etc where all the signals are synchronized using a compact rio and stored in a laptop it is used to control the self running model remotely 4 2 software system of the free running ship model the software architecture is mainly programmed by labview software as presented in fig 6 the software architecture consists of several program loops fpga loop real time loop and tcp ip loop the fpga loop is associated with collecting data from the sensors i e gps internal measurement unit yaw rate sensor etc and controlling the actuation of propeller and rudder sub systems that have been programmed under a reconfigurable fpga platform in labview the real time loop is associated with a reconfigurable fgpa platform and an embedded real time processor the data processing and saving for the respective sensors are implemented under the internal non deterministic data processing loop that has lower priority with compare to the deterministic control loop the sensor data has been incorporated into a network shared variables that are forecasted along the entire network the tcp ip loop is associated with a real time processor and the human machine interface hmi is used for analysis post processing data logging communications and control of the ship model the tcp ip loop is implemented under wireless communication through the industrial wi fi unit 4 3 experimental facilities and manoeuvring tests model tests with the self running model were conducted in the tank of laboratory national de civil engineering lnec fig 7 presents the water depths considered for the experiments where λ h t is the ratio between the tank depth and ship draft as discussed in ref xu et al 2017 λ h t 3 is considered as deep water λ 1 5 3 as medium water λ 1 2 1 5 is shallow water and λ 1 2 is very shallow water in this study considering the safety the manoeuvring tests in very shallow water were not carried out the ratios of water depth to draft considered in this paper are 1 32 1 46 2 9 and 5 6 where the draft of the model model is 0 14m as presented in table 1 and the corresponded ratios of water depth to draft are given in table 2 the ship s speeds are chosen as 40 and 60 of the maximum speed the velocity of the ship model is 0 54 m s and 0 36 m s where the large speed 0 54 m s is the scaled average speed of the real ship for the turning tests only one speed 60 vmax was carried out due to the limited size of the tank all the tests are repeated twice in order to obtain stable results the test with good quality will be chosen as the training set for the parameter estimation 5 parameter estimation of vessel steering model in shallow water in this section the parameters of the vessel steering model are estimated using the proposed method based on the free running manoeuvring tests in shallow water in order to validate the proposed truncated ls svm the estimated parameters are compared with the analytical values as well as the values estimated using the least square method classical least square support vector machine nu support vector machine at last the parameters of vessel steering model with different water depth are estimated and the shallow water effect is discussed 5 1 validation of parameter estimation method as discussed in refs clarke 2003 journee 1970 the parameters of the 1st order nomoto model can be calculated directly from zigzag manoeuvring tests integrate eq 6 with respect to time t gives as 21 t 0 t r d t 0 t r d t k δ 0 t δ r d t by choosing the range of time the parameters and can be calculated 22 k δ ψ 1 ψ 2 t 1 t 2 δ r d t t t 3 t 4 δ r d t r 3 r 4 k δ firstly the time t 1 and t 2 are chosen where the yaw rate is zero as indicated in fig 8 a the shaded area in fig 8 a is the integrals of the rudder from fig 8 a the parameter k δ can be calculated in fig 8 b the time t 3 and t 4 are chosen where the yaw angle is zero in fig 8 b the represented the integrals of the rudder the analytical values of k δ and t are given in table 3 all the methods ls ls svm truncated ls svm and nu svm were used to estimated the parameters here the zigzag 30 30 is used as the training set as presented in table 3 all the methods can provide a reasonable estimation compared with analytical values the parameters estimated using truncated ls svm are closer to the analytical values the parameters of the 2nd order nomoto model as presented in eq 3 were estimated using the least square method ls svm truncated ls svm and nu svm the results are given in table 4 usually parameter t can be estimated using the empirical formula t t 1 t 2 t 3 they are close to the analytical value of 1st order nomoto model in order to test the generalization performance the obtained 2nd order nomoto model was used to predict the yaw rate and yaw angle of new zigzag tests the test data sets include a new zigzag 10 10 20 20 and 30 30 test those tests were not used in the previous training process the validation results are presented in fig 9 the prediction of the yaw rate agrees well with the experimental results the errors of yaw rate prediction are given in this figure the heading angle can be obtained by integrating the yaw rate in order to eliminate the accumulated error due to the integration one step prediction is adopted when calculating the yaw angle as shown in the figure the prediction of heading angle agree very well with the experiments 5 2 shallow water effect on vessel steering model in this phase the truncated ls svm is employed to estimate the parameters of the nomoto model using the manoeuvring tests in different water depths the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvring tests are used for the training as suggested by ittc 2002 the tests used for identification are given in appendix a the identified parameters of 1st order nomoto model with the different water depth are given in table 5 the manoeuvring tests are carried out at low speed 40 vmax table 6 presented the identified parameters when the speed is large 60 vmax the general tendency of the t and k δ are presented in fig 10 in fig 10 a the values of the t decreases with the ration λ shallow water effect increases the values of the t it means that the ship will take a longer time to enter a stable turning when the ship moves at a low speed 40 vmax a linear regression function of the parameter t is y 0 4105 x 9 4498 it agrees very well with the first three water depths r2 0 99 where the ration λ is 5 6 2 9 and 1 46 when the ship s speed is high 60 vmax the regress function is y 0 3245 x 6 6513 and the r2 is 0 93 the slope of the two straight lines in fig 10 a is very close the intercepts are different it can be concluded that the parameter t will increase when the water depth decrease the ship s speed only changes the intercept of the regression function the ship s speed is larger the parameter t is smaller in fig 10 a the regression function fails to approximate the point where the λ is 1 32 and speed is 40 vmax a smaller value of t provides a quicker response to the rudder deflection angle as can be observed with the decrease of the water depth the value of t is becoming bigger especially with a large speed since quick response is obviously valuable in course keeping or steering it is thus consistent with a smaller t so shallow water effect increases the response time which makes the ship hard to manoeuvre in fig 10 b the parameter k δ increases when the ration λ shallow water effect decreases the values of the k δ it means that the diameter of the turning is becoming bigger in shallow water because the diameter of the turning is inverse ratio to the k δ when the ship enters the steady turning when the ship s speed is high 60 vmax the regress function is y 0 0148 x 0 1485 and the r2 is 0 76 when the ship s speed is low 40 vmax the regress function is y 0 0069 x 0 0993 and the r2 is 0 46 it can be observed that the parameter k δ has a larger value when the ship s speed is large and it can be significantly affected by the shallow water effect so the diameter of the turning d increases when the water depth the water decrease in the other word when the ship enters the shallow water the diameter of the turning is becoming large this fitted the common sense that manoeuvrability of a ship is becoming bad due to the shallow water effect the slope of the regression function of 40 vmax is smaller than the function of 60 vmax so the shallow water effect is not significant when the ship s speed is low the parameters of the 2nd order nomoto model were estimated using the truncated ls svm the results are given in table 7 and table 8 the tendency with different water depth is presented in fig 11 from fig 11 the parameter t1 decrease with the ration λ the tendency is the same in both speeds the regression functions are y 0 2998 x 8 256 r 2 0 78 and y 0 3227 x 6 4744 r 2 0 97 for the low speed 40 vmax and high speed 60 vmax for the parameter t2 it can be approximate with a linear function y 0 0602 x 0 5528 r 2 0 82 at high speed 60 vmax but when the ship s speed is low 40 vmax the regression function is y 0 0229 x 0 3447 with low accuracy r 2 0 44 when the ship moves at a low speed 40 vmax the regression function of the t3 is y 0 0104 x 0 2112 and r 2 is 0 51 the values of the t3 decrease with the ratio λ when the ship s speed is large 60 vmax the parameter t3 cannot approximate with a linear function the speed s speed has a small effect on the parameter t3 it has the same values for both speeds when the ration is 5 6 1 46 and 1 32 the regression functions for the k δ are y 0 0167 x 0 1353 r 2 0 82 and y 0 0075 x 0 0965 r 2 0 62 for 60 vmax and 40 vmax respectively fig 12 presents the non dimensional trajectory of the 30 turning test in different water depths when the ship s speed is 60 vmax it can be clearly observed that the diameter of the turning is bigger when the water depth is small and the ship can enter the steady turn quickly in deep water λ 5 6 the trajectory of the ship drifts in shallow waters especially when λ is 1 32 the shallow water effect reduces course stability of the ship 6 conclusions this paper carried out an experimental investigation of the shallow water effect on vessel steering model using the system identification method a scale ship model which is a conventional displacement ship with one propeller and rudder was constructed various sensors and actuators were installed and synchronized in the labview platform the manoeuvring tests such as zigzag and turning tests have been carried out with four different water depths and two speed in order to estimate the parameters and optimal truncated ls svm was introduced this method can reduce the dimensionality of the kernel matrix and avoids the costly matrix inversion operation by using the singular values decomposition the smaller singular values and corresponded matrix are neglected considering their contribution to the solutions is negligible the performance of the truncated ls svm was validated by comparing with analytical results of nomoto model meanwhile it was also compared with the least square method classical ls svm and nu svm the results show that the truncated ls svm improve the accuracy of parameter estimation the shallow water effect was discussed in the paper generally speaking shallow water damages the manoeuvrability capabilities of a ship it increases the diameter of the steady turning and reduces course stability of the ship the response time of the ship to the rudder deflection angle increases in shallow water in order to improve the statistical significance of the experiments more repetitions of model tests can be carried out in the future the results of this paper can be used to improve the onboard controller of the ship model if it is used to design the controller for the full scale ship the scale effects need to be considered to do so the sea trials of a full scale ship need to be conducted credit authorship contribution statement haitong xu methodology software formal analysis writing original draft

is that the size of cargo ship grows large which causes the ship s manoeuvrability to decrease especially in shallow water and confined waters as described by vantorre et al 2017 the study on ship manoeuvrability in shallow water is critically important as ships have to access harbours in shallow and confined waters where the traffic is more complex this put forward higher requirement about ship s manoeuvrability as discussed in lataire et al 2012 maimun et al 2011 tello ruiz et al 2018 2015 vantorre et al 2017 yoshimura 1986 zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the ship s roll response model in shallow water for a container ship model was studied using nonlinear least squares support vector machine chen et al 2019 the study on ship manoeuvrability considering shallow water effect can benefit the design of ship autopilot and provide a decision making reference for the sailor mathematical models are widely used to describe the dynamics of ships in deep and shallow water maimun et al 2011 inoue and murayama 1969 employed the wing theory to calculate the derivative of manoeuvring motion in shallow water norrbin 1971 discussed consequences of finite water depth for mathematical manoeuvring an evaluation of semi empirical formulae for manoeuvring in shallow water was discussed by vantorre 2001 katrien et al 2015 carried out a shallow water manoeuvring simulation using free running tests vantorre et al 2017 discussed the effect of shallow water for marine surface ship benchmark data for manoeuvring in shallow water of dtc ship model have been addressed by van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 as described in the report by the manoeuvring committee of 24th international towing tank conference ittc 2005 the hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained using system identification method which is a mature technique for building mathematical models with the measured data ljung 1999 least square ls method is a popular technology due to the fact that it can provide the theoretical solution if the data is ideal and rich enough to activate the dynamic of the system but the measured data is always with noise which causes a large uncertainty of the obtained parameters in some cases xu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c employed the singular value decomposition and regularize method to diminish the parameter uncertainty sutulo and guedes soares 2014 employed least square for the parameter estimation of a nonlinear manoeuvring model using the zigzag tests with noise a similar study can also be found in xu et al 2018 where a loss function considering both the bias and variance of the errors between the reference outputs and the mathematical model outputs was proposed perera et al 2015 2016 used kalman filter to estimate the dynamic parameters of a modified nomoto model for vessel steering an online least square support vector machine was applied to modelling the nonlinear ship steering motion in real time in xu et al 2019c support vector machine svm has been widely used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients for marine vessels it is a universal learning machine in the framework of structural risk minimization srm suykens and vandewalle 1999 vapnik 1998 in luo et al 2016 luo and zou 2009 the least square support vector machine ls svm was used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of an abkowitz model the further work on this topic can be found in luo et al 2016 in which particle swarm optimization was employed to choose the regularization factor xu and guedes soares 2016 used the least square support vector machine ls svm to identify a nonlinear steering model for ship autopilot design zhu et al 2017 used an optimal ls svm combined with artificial bee colony algorithm to estimate a dynamic model of a large container ship the main contribution of this paper is to carry out an experimental study on the manoeuvring motion of a marine surface ship in shallow water and to investigate the shallow water effect on vessel steering model using the system identification method in order to carry out the manoeuvring test a scaled free running ship model with one propeller and rudder was constructed the sensors and actuators were installed and synchronized in labview platform an optimal truncated ls svm xu and guedes soares 2019 2020 was employed to estimate the parameters this method can reduce the dimensionality of the kernel matrix and avoids the costly matrix inversion operation by using the singular values decomposition the validation of truncated ls svm was carried out and the shallow water effect on vessel steering mode was discussed according to the identified parameters 2 nonlinear vessel steering models the nonlinear vessel steering models are described in this section a marine surface vessel moving on the sea can be usually described in 6 degree of freedoms dofs as illustrated in fig 1 as described by sutulo and guedes soares 2011 the motions in 3 dofs surge sway and yaw typically occur with a much lower frequency than the wave encounter frequencies so it is reasonable to neglect the fluid memory effects fossen 2011 usually nonlinear manoeuvring models are used to describe the manoeuvring motions such as mmg abkowitz model those models have a complex structure and are not typically used to design autopilots right now most of the controllers autopilots are designed based on the nomoto model which is a simplified linear model by neglecting the higher order effects the manoeuvring motions of a conventional ship can be described in 3 dofs surge sway and yaw and the hydrodynamic coefficients can be presented using constant values assuming a ship moving in a horizontal plane as presented in fig 2 the euler equations of arbitrary motion in the horizontal plane are given 1 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 x m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r y m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r n where m and i z z are the mass and the moment of inertia respectively x g is the position of centre of mass in the x direction μ 11 μ 22 and μ 26 are the added masses and moments respectively x y and n are the hydrodynamic forces and moments for ship steering problem the constant surge speed is usually assumed then the surge force equation can be decoupled from the 3 dof motion equations linearize the sway force and yaw moment then liner equation is given 2 m y v v m x g y r r m u r y v v y r r y δ

åström and källström 1976 tzeng and chen 1999 because the difference between t 2 and t 3 is small they are usually of the same order of magnitude therefore the pole zero cancellation can be implied to simplify this equation the resulted equation is the well known 1st order nomoto model 8 t r r k δ δ r the linear nomoto model can be used for the heading control but its accuracy is not adequate due

represents an inner product between its operands it is positive definite and satisfies the mercer condition suykens and vandewalle 1999 vapnik 1995 as presented in eq 16 the dimension of the kernel matrix a is n 1 n 1 it is proportional to the length of the training set when the training set is large the classical ls svm will be failed due to the heavy computation meanwhile the large kernel matrix will result in an unstable solution which is usually dominated by the noise and drift from the true values the corresponded numerical model fits well with the training data and fails to reproduce the training set in the following part an optimal truncated ls svm is proposed to solve the parameter estimation for a large scale problem the parameter uncertainty is also discussed using singular value decomposition then a truncated least square support vector machine is proposed to diminish the parameter drift firstly using the singular value decomposition the matrix a can be rewritten as 17 a i 1 n u i σ i v i t u σ v t then the parameter matrix in eq 16 are given as 18 θ u σ v t 1 y v σ 1 u t y i 1 n v i u i t σ i y where the matrix u and v are orthonormal u t u i and v t v i ʃ is the diagonal matrix of the singular values of the matrix a assuming there is an additive perturbation δ y it will propagate to a perturbation in the solution 19 δ θ v σ 1 u t δ y i 1 n v i u i t σ i δ y as can be observed if the singular value σ i is very small or close to the numerical precision of the computation then the perturbation in the y is magnified and potentially dominate the solutions θ i in order to diminish such uncertainty and obtain a robust estimation it is necessary to neglect the effect caused by the smaller singular values truncated singular value decomposition tsvd can be used to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the matrix a by retaining the first r singular values of a and the corresponding columns of u and v the tsvd can be presented as 20 a r u r σ r v r t where the matrix σ r is obtained by retaining the first r singular values of σ similarly matrices u r and v r are found using the corresponding singular vectors the resulted a r represents the reduced data set where the data related to the omitted singular values are filtered meanwhile the dimensionality of the matrix is also reduced by using truncated singular values decomposition l curve hansen and o leary 1993 can be used to find the optimal value of r l curve is a graphical tool for displaying the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data as the r varies golub et al 1999 hansen and johnston 2001 from the l curve plot it is convenient to get the optimal parameters the whole program is given in fig 3 4 free running ship model test in shallow water in this section a free running ship model is used to carry out the manoeuvring tests in shallow water shallow water has an important effect on the manoeuvrability of the marine surface ship the vessel model considered in this paper is a scaled chemical tanker presented in fig 4 the scaled factor is 61 2 and the main dimensions of the ship model are given in table 1 the ship model is from a conventional ship it has one propeller and one rudder in the aft 4 1 hardware system of the free running ship model hardware system of the free running ship model consists of all the sensor and actuators as illustrated in fig 5 the hardware system is further divided into two groups onboard and offshore control centre the on board system is composed by propeller ruder and set of sensors internal measurement unit yaw rate sensor electrical motors and industrial wi fi unit etc where all the signals are synchronized using a compact rio and stored in a laptop it is used to control the self running model remotely 4 2 software system of the free running ship model the software architecture is mainly programmed by labview software as presented in fig 6 the software architecture consists of several program loops fpga loop real time loop and tcp ip loop the fpga loop is associated with collecting data from the sensors i e gps internal measurement unit yaw rate sensor etc and controlling the actuation of propeller and rudder sub systems that have been programmed under a reconfigurable fpga platform in labview the real time loop is associated with a reconfigurable fgpa platform and an embedded real time processor the data processing and saving for the respective sensors are implemented under the internal non deterministic data processing loop that has lower priority with compare to the deterministic control loop the sensor data has been incorporated into a network shared variables that are forecasted along the entire network the tcp ip loop is associated with a real time processor and the human machine interface hmi is used for analysis post processing data logging communications and control of the ship model the tcp ip loop is implemented under wireless communication through the industrial wi fi unit 4 3 experimental facilities and manoeuvring tests model tests with the self running model were conducted in the tank of laboratory national de civil engineering lnec fig 7 presents the water depths considered for the experiments where λ h t is the ratio between the tank depth and ship draft as discussed in ref xu et al 2017 λ h t 3 is considered as deep water λ 1 5 3 as medium water λ 1 2 1 5 is shallow water and λ 1 2 is very shallow water in this study considering the safety the manoeuvring tests in very shallow water were not carried out the ratios of water depth to draft considered in this paper are 1 32 1 46 2 9 and 5 6 where the draft of the model model is 0 14m as presented in table 1 and the corresponded ratios of water depth to draft are given in table 2 the ship s speeds are chosen as 40 and 60 of the maximum speed the velocity of the ship model is 0 54 m s and 0 36 m s where the large speed 0 54 m s is the scaled average speed of the real ship for the turning tests only one speed 60 vmax was carried out due to the limited size of the tank all the tests are repeated twice in order to obtain stable results the test with good quality will be chosen as the training set for the parameter estimation 5 parameter estimation of vessel steering model in shallow water in this section the parameters of the vessel steering model are estimated using the proposed method based on the free running manoeuvring tests in shallow water in order to validate the proposed truncated ls svm the estimated parameters are compared with the analytical values as well as the values estimated using the least square method classical least square support vector machine nu support vector machine at last the parameters of vessel steering model with different water depth are estimated and the shallow water effect is discussed 5 1 validation of parameter estimation method as discussed in refs clarke 2003 journee 1970 the parameters of the 1st order nomoto model can be calculated directly from zigzag manoeuvring tests integrate eq 6 with respect to time t gives as 21 t 0 t r d t 0 t r d t k δ 0 t δ r d t by choosing the range of time the parameters and can be calculated 22 k δ ψ 1 ψ 2 t 1 t 2 δ r d t t t 3 t 4 δ r d t r 3 r 4 k δ firstly the time t 1 and t 2 are chosen where the yaw rate is zero as indicated in fig 8 a the shaded area in fig 8 a is the integrals of the rudder from fig 8 a the parameter k δ can be calculated in fig 8 b the time t 3 and t 4 are chosen where the yaw angle is zero in fig 8 b the represented the integrals of the rudder the analytical values of k δ and t are given in table 3 all the methods ls ls svm truncated ls svm and nu svm were used to estimated the parameters here the zigzag 30 30 is used as the training set as presented in table 3 all the methods can provide a reasonable estimation compared with analytical values the parameters estimated using truncated ls svm are closer to the analytical values the parameters of the 2nd order nomoto model as presented in eq 3 were estimated using the least square method ls svm truncated ls svm and nu svm the results are given in table 4 usually parameter t can be estimated using the empirical formula t t 1 t 2 t 3 they are close to the analytical value of 1st order nomoto model in order to test the generalization performance the obtained 2nd order nomoto model was used to predict the yaw rate and yaw angle of new zigzag tests the test data sets include a new zigzag 10 10 20 20 and 30 30 test those tests were not used in the previous training process the validation results are presented in fig 9 the prediction of the yaw rate agrees well with the experimental results the errors of yaw rate prediction are given in this figure the heading angle can be obtained by integrating the yaw rate in order to eliminate the accumulated error due to the integration one step prediction is adopted when calculating the yaw angle as shown in the figure the prediction of heading angle agree very well with the experiments 5 2 shallow water effect on vessel steering model in this phase the truncated ls svm is employed to estimate the parameters of the nomoto model using the manoeuvring tests in different water depths the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvring tests are used for the training as suggested by ittc 2002 the tests used for identification are given in appendix a the identified parameters of 1st order nomoto model with the different water depth are given in table 5 the manoeuvring tests are carried out at low speed 40 vmax table 6 presented the identified parameters when the speed is large 60 vmax the general tendency of the t and k δ are presented in fig 10 in fig 10 a the values of the t decreases with the ration λ shallow water effect increases the values of the t it means that the ship will take a longer time to enter a stable turning when the ship moves at a low speed 40 vmax a linear regression function of the parameter t is y 0 4105 x 9 4498 it agrees very well with the first three water depths r2 0 99 where the ration λ is 5 6 2 9 and 1 46 when the ship s speed is high 60 vmax the regress function is y 0 3245 x 6 6513 and the r2 is 0 93 the slope of the two straight lines in fig 10 a is very close the intercepts are different it can be concluded that the parameter t will increase when the water depth decrease the ship s speed only changes the intercept of the regression function the ship s speed is larger the parameter t is smaller in fig 10 a the regression function fails to approximate the point where the λ is 1 32 and speed is 40 vmax a smaller value of t provides a quicker response to the rudder deflection angle as can be observed with the decrease of the water depth the value of t is becoming bigger especially with a large speed since quick response is obviously valuable in course keeping or steering it is thus consistent with a smaller t so shallow water effect increases the response time which makes the ship hard to manoeuvre in fig 10 b the parameter k δ increases when the ration λ shallow water effect decreases the values of the k δ it means that the diameter of the turning is becoming bigger in shallow water because the diameter of the turning is inverse ratio to the k δ when the ship enters the steady turning when the ship s speed is high 60 vmax the regress function is y 0 0148 x 0 1485 and the r2 is 0 76 when the ship s speed is low 40 vmax the regress function is y 0 0069 x 0 0993 and the r2 is 0 46 it can be observed that the parameter k δ has a larger value when the ship s speed is large and it can be significantly affected by the shallow water effect so the diameter of the turning d increases when the water depth the water decrease in the other word when the ship enters the shallow water the diameter of the turning is becoming large this fitted the common sense that manoeuvrability of a ship is becoming bad due to the shallow water effect the slope of the regression function of 40 vmax is smaller than the function of 60 vmax so the shallow water effect is not significant when the ship s speed is low the parameters of the 2nd order nomoto model were estimated using the truncated ls svm the results are given in table 7 and table 8 the tendency with different water depth is presented in fig 11 from fig 11 the parameter t1 decrease with the ration λ the tendency is the same in both speeds the regression functions are y 0 2998 x 8 256 r 2 0 78 and y 0 3227 x 6 4744 r 2 0 97 for the low speed 40 vmax and high speed 60 vmax for the parameter t2 it can be approximate with a linear function y 0 0602 x 0 5528 r 2 0 82 at high speed 60 vmax but when the ship s speed is low 40 vmax the regression function is y 0 0229 x 0 3447 with low accuracy r 2 0 44 when the ship moves at a low speed 40 vmax the regression function of the t3 is y 0 0104 x 0 2112 and r 2 is 0 51 the values of the t3 decrease with the ratio λ when the ship s speed is large 60 vmax the parameter t3 cannot approximate with a linear function the speed s speed has a small effect on the parameter t3 it has the same values for both speeds when the ration is 5 6 1 46 and 1 32 the regression functions for the k δ are y 0 0167 x 0 1353 r 2 0 82 and y 0 0075 x 0 0965 r 2 0 62 for 60 vmax and 40 vmax respectively fig 12 presents the non dimensional trajectory of the 30 turning test in different water depths when the ship s speed is 60 vmax it can be clearly observed that the diameter of the turning is bigger when the water depth is small and the ship can enter the steady turn quickly in deep water λ 5 6 the trajectory of the ship drifts in shallow waters especially when λ is 1 32 the shallow water effect reduces course stability of the ship 6 conclusions this paper carried out an experimental investigation of the shallow water effect on vessel steering model using the system identification method a scale ship model which is a conventional displacement ship with one propeller and rudder was constructed various sensors and actuators were installed and synchronized in the labview platform the manoeuvring tests such as zigzag and turning tests have been carried out with four different water depths and two speed in order to estimate the parameters and optimal truncated ls svm was introduced this method can reduce the dimensionality of the kernel matrix and avoids the costly matrix inversion operation by using the singular values decomposition the smaller singular values and corresponded matrix are neglected considering their contribution to the solutions is negligible the performance of the truncated ls svm was validated by comparing with analytical results of nomoto model meanwhile it was also compared with the least square method classical ls svm and nu svm the results show that the truncated ls svm improve the accuracy of parameter estimation the shallow water effect was discussed in the paper generally speaking shallow water damages the manoeuvrability capabilities of a ship it increases the diameter of the steady turning and reduces course stability of the ship the response time of the ship to the rudder deflection angle increases in shallow water in order to improve the statistical significance of the experiments more repetitions of model tests can be carried out in the future the results of this paper can be used to improve the onboard controller of the ship model if it is used to design the controller for the full scale ship the scale effects need to be considered to do so the sea trials of a full scale ship need to be conducted credit authorship contribution statement haitong xu methodology software formal analysis writing original draft
