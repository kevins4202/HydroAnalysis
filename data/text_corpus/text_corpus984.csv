4920,a fixed z r relationship approach such as the marshall palmer relationship for an entire year and for different seasons can be problematic in cases where the relationship varies spatially and temporally throughout a region from this perspective this study explores the use of a long term radar reflectivity factor for south korea to obtain a nationwide calibrated power law relationship z α r β where r is the rainfall intensity and z is the reflectivity factor in the context of bias correction and the associated uncertainties within a bayesian regression framework this study also investigates seasonal differences in the bias correction parameters i e additive and multiplicative bias correction factors and their roles in reducing systematic error distinct differences in the calibrated parameters over stations are identified and more importantly an inverse relationship between the two reflectivity parameters α and β i e decreasing trend in β with increasing α is clearly identified with different parameter space based on the seasons a spatially structured pattern in the parameters exists particularly parameter α for the wet season and parameter β for the dry season a pronounced region of high values in the power law parameters i e α and β during the wet and dry seasons may be partially due to the overestimation of the radar reflectivity factor associated with enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region finally the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship are compared with the currently used z r relationships for estimating stratiform rainfall and convective rainfall overall the radar rainfall fields based on the proposed modeling procedure are similar to the observed rainfall fields whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the currently used marshall palmer z r relationship show a systematic underestimation the calibrated z r relationships are further validated by testing the predictions of unseen radar gauge pairs in the year 2018 in the context of cross validation the cross validation results are largely similar to those in the calibration process suggesting that the derived z r relationships fit the radar gauge pairs reasonably well keywords z r relationship bayesian regression radar rainfall bias correction uncertainty 1 introduction the extent of spatio temporal variation in precipitation has been observed and documented over south korea lee et al 2012 son et al 2017 wi et al 2016 especially during the summer season an increase the local variation in spatio temporal rainfall patterns has been of concern over the last few decades in relation to flood risk management lima et al 2015 sankarasubramanian and lall 2003 ward et al 2016 and this variation may become more extensive and continuous under climate change specifically increased rainfall variability has resulted in locally heavy rainfalls leading to socio economic and human losses in many communities moreover such heavy rainfall events could trigger landslides and flash floods in mountainous areas therefore it is important to understand the role of heavy rainfall in the context of spatio temporal patterns and this information can be utilized to better manage water related disasters however in many countries including south korea ground based long term minutely or hourly rainfall networks are too sparse to capture complex spatio temporal patterns aghakouchak et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the korean peninsula in particular is mainly affected by the east asia monsoon system kim et al 2018a during the summer season and there is significant spatio temporal variability in rainfall during that season park et al 2011 in these contexts weather radar rainfall information is becoming more widely utilized to support spatio temporal aspects of rainfall patterns early radar equipment was developed for military purposes and the current weather radar system was designed to detect raindrop particles and further estimate rainfall intensities in the spatio temporal context a main advantage of weather radar rainfall information is to minimize the spatial intermittency of rainfall fields including rainfall over the ocean compared to ground observations to be more specific weather radar is able to continuously present nearly real time rainfall fields over a larger range and provide spatio temporal rainfall information over ungauged watersheds but is bedeviled by beam blocking anomalous propagation high altitude at distance beam widening and so on thus the weather radar system has enabled us to observe and explore complex rainfall patterns that may not be observed in ground based rain gauge data other efforts have been made to produce high spatial resolution gridded rainfall products by combining remote sensing data e g weather radar and satellite data and a dense rain gauge network the operational programme for the exchange of weather radar information opera is the radar program of eumetnet that aimed to coordinate european weather radar networks for 20 years similarly a nationwide radar system combining multiple radars has been operated to provide spatial radar composites in australia national radar loop nrl china i e chinese new generation weather radar cinrad keenan et al 2003 park et al 2019 shi et al 2018 beside south korea suk et al 2013 you et al 2014 moreover a more sophisticated blending technique to merge multiple radars satellites and a dense network of rain gauges has been proposed han et al 2011 shen et al 2018 sinclair and pegram 2005 for example the multi radar multi sensor mrms operated by national severe storms laboratory nssl in noaa is a representative system that integrates different sources of data from multiple radars satellite ground and airborne observations chen et al 2013 yu and smull 2000 zhang et al 2016 a blending approach using kriging with external drift ked has been proposed to better represent the spatial distribution of radar rainfall estimates by merging ground and radar rainfall measurements delrieu et al 2014 jewell and gaussiat 2015 associated algorithms for representing rainfall patterns have been developed in line with the weather radar systems which are key instruments in hydrometeorology for monitoring rainfall and wind and have become a primary tool for short term weather forecasting maddox et al 2002 papagiannaki et al 2013 shi and cui 2012 srivastava et al 2010 moreover radar rainfall fields can be effectively applied in the hydrological modeling framework such as in distributed rainfall runoff analysis berenguer and zawadzki 2008 borga 2002 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 germann et al 2009 more recently the use of weather radar rainfall data has been emphasized in water resources management in many countries anagnostou et al 2018 ciach et al 2007 dai et al 2014 2018 ghaemi et al 2017 krajewski and smith 2002 overeem et al 2009 rico ramirez and cluckie 2008 villarini and krajewski 2010 for example weather radar is now widely used for flash flood warning systems requiring high spatio temporal resolution of precipitation bell and moore 1998 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 creutin and borga 2003 looper and vieux 2012 smith et al 2004 yu et al 2001 however it has been acknowledged that the direct use of weather radar rainfall data for hydrologic modeling is not recommended due to its systematic bias that may result in substantial underestimation or overestimation in rainfall amounts kim et al 2018a seto and iguchi 2007 therefore a quantitative evaluation of the uncertainties in weather radar rainfall estimates has been an issue in the field of radar hydrology in this context a bias correction approach is generally introduced to reduce the systematic bias of radar rainfall estimates that are typically obtained by the z r radar reflectivity to rain rate relationship one of the greatest challenges for operational hydrology is to obtain spatio temporal rainfall patterns at fine scales for flood risk management in urban or mountainous areas arguably weather radar based quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is recognized as the most skillful source of high resolution rainfall data high resolution qpe can offer opportunities for better representing small scale variations of rainfall patterns in both space and time which in turn can lead to more accurate representations of discharges at local and regional scales a relationship between the radar reflectivity and the rain rate is routinely required for producing radar rainfall estimates anagnostou et al 2004 krajewski et al 2010 schrom and kumjian 2016 villarini and krajewski 2010 more specifically radar rainfall estimates from reflectivity rely on a z r relationship which forms a power law function between radar reflectivity z and rain rate r marshall and palmer 1948 radar rainfall retrieval procedures are mainly based on spatially and temporally averaged drop size distributions dsds which lead to a fixed z r relationship bringi et al 2003 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 2003 in south korea the weather radar network is established and maintained by the government and this relationship is typically based on the marshall palmer equation z 200r1 6 yoo et al 2016 a crucial issue in the practical implementation of radar rainfall estimates is the range dependent systematic error stemming from the sampling differences in location and time between the ground rainfall and the radar estimates goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 kann et al 2015 montopoli et al 2017 for example intensive frontal rainfall often evaporates completely before it reaches the ground moreover there are differences in microphysical properties due to the influence of seasons and locations or regions which result in variability in the raindrop size distribution dsd bringi et al 2003 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 2003 along with significant uncertainties associated with the retrieval of microphysical information from the z r parameters rainfall measurement uncertainties may also affect the subsequent analysis in the z r relationship steiner et al 2004 given this background we investigate the following questions specifically over the korean peninsula 1 how much of the systematic error is reduced by the calibrated z r relationship with a long term radar reflectivity factor can the use of a long term radar reflectivity factor be more effective in correcting systematic bias in the z r relationship 2 what is the spatial distribution of the bias correction parameters or factors in the calibrated z r relationship are there any spatial patterns in the parameters 3 is there a seasonal difference in the calibrated parameters of z r relationship does the seasonally calibrated z r relationship adequately describe the systematic errors and their statistical properties to address these questions this study explored the long term radar reflectivity equation to establish a nationwide calibrated parameter of the z r relationship to obtain consistent radar rainfall estimates and their uncertainties over the entire south korea region within a bayesian regression framework this study also investigated seasonal differences in the calibrated z r relationship and their contributions to the systematic error turning to the layout of this paper the research background is introduced in this section the radar data and ground rainfall data used in this study are summarized in section 2 the theoretical background for the calibration of the z r relationship using bayesian inference is offered in the methodology section section 3 in section 4 the proposed approach is then applied to calibrate the z r relationship over the entire south korea region and is comprehensively discussed finally section 5 provides our concluding remarks 2 weather radar and ground rain gauges weather radar indirectly estimates both rainfall and wind direction by analyzing the interval of return of the transmitted electromagnetic pulses primarily weather radar is designed for mapping fields of precipitation and measuring their intensity and motion spatio temporal high resolution weather 9 s band and 2c band radar data may contribute to a short range forecast by monitoring and tracking the early stage of heavy rainfall snowstorm or a typhoon the weather radar system in korea began with the installation of the first weather radar on mt gwanak in 1969 a total of 11 weather radars are currently in operation and the details of the kma korea meteorological administration weather radar resources can be found in table 1 the weather radar center wrc similar to the nexrad radar operations center roc in the united states has been in operation since 2010 and provides nationwide coverage of radar rainfall estimates the wrc combines all the information available from different weather radar systems operated by different agencies so as to provide the full range of radar rainfall estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 5 min the specifications of the wrc weather radars including locations and altitudes used in this study are summarized in table 1 most c band weather radars have been replaced by s band over the last decade to produce more accurate precipitation estimates recently dual polarization radar i e kwk psn gsn ksn bri jni gdk myn and ssp has been gradually adopted for even better estimates in south korea currently long term radar rainfall estimates are used for various purposes in many countries fairman et al 2015 overeem et al 2009 tabary 2007 kma uses the radar constant altitude plan position indicator cappi for operational qpe and rainfall composites of average reflectivities can be obtained from 2011 to 2017 the cappi data provides a horizontal cross section of the plan position indicator ppi volume scan data at a constant altitude 1 5 km which is in turn used to represent the weather at a given altitude the 1 5 km reflectivity data is routinely adopted to offer an accurate estimation of radar rainfall particularly for the bright band the range of the 1 5 km ppi at the lowest elevation angle is varied between 70 km and 125 km it should be noted that the weather radar reflectivity is significantly affected by ground clutter beam blockage anomalous propagation and so on moreover there is a bright band region of high reflectivity at 3 4 km height above the ground and at around 2 km height during the summer especially for stratiform precipitation the bright band may be lower during the winter due to the lower freezing level bordoy et al 2010 nearly 70 of the territory is a mountainous area in south korea so that reflectivity below 1 0 km can be affected by ground clutter due to strong surface reflectivity signals and anomalous propagation chang et al 2009 kwon et al 2015 in this perspective the 1 5 km reflectivity data with the effective radius of approximately 100 km is routinely adopted to provide an accurate estimate of radar rainfall hong and lee 2009 jeong et al 2014 kim et al 2018a lee et al 2011 yoo et al 2014 2016 kma uses the open radar product generator orpg with a fuzzy quality control algorithm fqca as quality control techniques to minimize systematic error cho et al 2006 jain et al 1997 kim et al 2015 kim and kwon 2016 ye et al 2015 more specifically an interpolation approach is employed to fill the beam blockages and cone of silence andrieu and creutin 1995 bech et al 2003 haase et al 2007 and fqca is often used to alleviate the ground clutter and anomalous propagation hubbert et al 2009 rico ramirez and cluckie 2008 as indicated in the introduction in south korea the marshall palmer mp z r equation is officially adopted to estimate the rain rate park and lee 2010 suk et al 2013 yoon and bae 2013 however some studies haveshown that the direct use of the marshall palmer equation over an entire basin is generally affected by systematic errors in radar measurement due to lack of adequate representation ofthe z r relationship bárdossy and pegram 2017 biggs and atkinson 2011 brandes et al 2006 kim et al 2018a more specifically the z r relationship may change continuously over time and space due to the considerable variability of the raindrop size distribution hasan et al 2016 steiner and smith 2004 wang et al 2016 therefore this study mainly compares the results to the rain rate estimated from the mp equation there are nearly 1 000 aws automatic weather stations available nevertheless most stations have been in operation since late 2000 the unit of observation for aws precipitation is 0 5 mm which is relatively larger than the unit of asos automated synoptic observing system observation 0 1 mm more than 100 asos stations are in operation throughout south korea at an average spatial resolution of 13 15 km and they release consistent real time weather variables such as precipitation temperature and air pressure park et al 2018 for this study asos 85 stations covering the period from 2011 to 2017 were selected asos precipitation data is known to be more reliable and stable compared to aws precipitation data in this regard this study mainly used asos precipitation data the rain gauge data is accumulated on a minute by minute basis in this study 60 minute rainfall sequences are reconstructed based on 85 stations from 2011 to 2017 to obtain a set of bias corrected parameters for the calibrated z r relationship and their uncertainties the radar reflectivity factor z was linearly averaged over 3 3 squares of 1 km pixels centered on the locations of the ground rain gauges of interest to avoid oversampling of the data and provide spatially integrated rainfall estimates aghakouchak et al 2010 the asos weather stations used in this study are illustrated in fig 1 b and the details of the stations are summarized in table 2 3 parameterization of z r equation 3 1 z r relationship reflectivity is simply a measure of how much energy is scattered back to the weather radar by the rain drops more specifically the strength of the reflectivity the travel time from the rain drops and the phase shift of the energy are available at several different elevations or angles and are then used to obtain radar rainfall estimates including storm structure some degree of the transmitted energy is obtained through a radar antenna receiver as a result of backscattering and the reflectivity factor is then transformed into the rain rate by the z r relationship which relates the radar reflectivity factor to the rain rate the reflectivity factor z is measured in mm6 m3 and is then converted into dbz and a light rain rate can be detected with a dbz value of 20 the higher the reflectivity in the dbz the greater the rainfall intensity assuming that the radar echo has a known distribution of precipitation particles enables one to convert the reflectivity to the rainfall rate named the z r relationship marshall and palmer 1948 blanchard 1953 jones 1956 carlson 1970 jorgensen and willis 1982 rosenfeld et al 1993 fulton et al 1998 brommundt and bárdossy 2007 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 mapiam et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 looper and vieux 2012 wang et al 2012 hasan et al 2014 gochis et al 2015 a power law z r relationship is commonly assumed as follows 1 z α r β o r r z α 1 β where r is the rainfall intensity in m m h r and z is the reflectivity factor in mm6 m3 the values α and β are regression coefficients that depend on the rainfall distribution and intensity and the reflectivity z is by definition proportional to the 6th moment of the raindrop size distribution in the rayleigh approximation 2a z 0 n d d 6 d d 2b d b z 10 log 10 z where n d is the number of raindrops per unit volume and d denotes the diameter of the raindrop a set of calibrated parameters can be estimated using paired samples of reflectivity factor and rainfall rate dependent on the dsd the z r relationship appears to be highly variant over space and time due to the different weather types synoptic patterns and inadequate sampling of the drop size along these lines a number of studies have attempted to improve radar rainfall estimates obtained from the existing z r relationships with a limited number of paired data sets between radar reflectivity factor and rainfall intensity in the context of hydrologic applications the commonly used z r relationships are summarized in table 3 among these the marshall palmer equation has been widely adopted in many countries including south korea however some studies have shown that the use of a fixed marshall palmer equation over an entire basin is generally affected by systematic errors in radar measurement due to a lack of an appropriate parameterization of the z r relationship more specifically the z r relationship may change continuously over time and space due to the considerable variability of the raindrop size distribution the main disadvantage of using predefined z r relationships is that they do not adequately represent various storm types such as stratiform or convective for a specific basin alfieri et al 2010 lee and zawadzki 2005 for this reason we use a long term set of weather radar data to obtain a range of calibrated parameters for the z r relationship and its uncertainty for wet and dry seasons over the entire south korea region under the assumption that the calibrated parameters may differ across subregions and seasons a theoretical background of the uncertainty estimation in the calibrated reflectivity rainfall rate z r relationship within a bayesian framework is further described in the following section 3 2 bayesian approach to the calibrated z r relationship the bayesian approach has become increasingly widespread in many fields of science especially in hydrology where the bayesian model has been employed to estimate parameters and their uncertainties leung and wu 2000 todini 2001 copsey and webb 2003 lima and lall 2009 devineni et al 2013 kim et al 2017 the bayesian model specifies a posterior or conditional distribution of the parameter θ conditioned on a prior distribution that is related to the event of interest in other words the posterior distribution of the parameters can be obtained by continuously updating the likelihood function with the predefined prior distributions of the parameters kim et al 2018c kwon et al 2008b the posterior distribution of the set of parameters can be defined by factorizing the likelihood p x θ and prior p θ as follows 3 p θ x p x θ p θ p x p x θ p θ where x is the data vector i e the weather radar reflectivity factor z and ground rainfall data r and θ is the set of parameters to be estimated in the calibrated z r relationship in this section the details of bayesian approaches in the context of calibrating the z r relationship are described as illustrated above the z r relationship typically follows a power law of the form for converting radar reflectivity into rainfall estimates the proposed model for calibrating or correcting a z r relationship can be written as eqs 4a and 4b in the context of a generalized log linear model glm the observed ground rainfall r and reflectivity factor z are assumed to have a lognormal distribution note that the values i e rainfall and reflectivity factor were log transformed prior to analysis the lognormal assumption for rainfall rate and reflectivity has been made by a number of studies das and maitra 2018 grayman and eagleson 1970 kim et al 2018a pegram and clothier 2001 ro and yoo 2020 seo and smith 1991 wilson and brandes 1979 here intercept term α and slope term β can be treated as mean additive and multiplicative bias correction factors respectively after the log transformation of both the observed ground rainfall r and radar reflectivity factor z as follows 4a log z t log α β l o g r t t 1 2 t 4b l o g r t n μ t σ 2 4c μ t l o g z t log α β where n stands for the normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ of the observed rainfall s natural logarithm and t is the total number of data samples the regression coefficients α and β are the bias correction parameters of interest to be estimated which may vary depending on the rainfall intensity and the meteorological pattern here as for hyper prior distributions conjugate prior distributions are considered to be most practical in the estimation of parameters in the bayesian framework a conjugate prior of the normal distribution for the mean and standard deviation are the normal and gamma distributions respectively the prior distributions of the range of reflection coefficients and variance can be written as eqs 5a c we use long term hourly weather radar data 85 radar gauge pairs to derive the bias correction factors for the calibrated z r relationship and thus it should be reasonable to assume that weak prior distributions for the two regression parameters could be given vague normal priors with a mean of 0 and a precision of 10 3 as suggested in the literature gelman 2006 moreover a weak gamma prior distribution is used for the variance 5a α n 0 10 3 5b β n 0 10 3 5c σ 2 g 10 1 10 1 where g denotes the gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters the joint posterior distribution function p θ x for the calibrated z r relationship can be formed as a result of the factorization of the likelihood function and prior distributions as follows 6 p α β x r z t 1 t n l o g r t μ t l o g z t log α β σ 2 n α 0 10 3 n β 0 10 3 g σ 2 10 1 10 1 direct integration of the joint posterior likelihood function is not analytically tractable so this study used the widely employed markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to maximize the joint posterior likelihood functions cheng and aghakouchak 2014 kwon et al 2008a 2011 lima and lall 2009 specifically the model is coded in a matlab environment for the mcmc sampling approach in this study we consider 30 000 samplings for each of three chains and the first 10 000 samples are disregarded to minimize serial correlation over the samples the rate of convergence of the posterior distributions to an unknown set of the parameters is evaluated by gelman rubin gr values less than 1 2 that are obtained from the mixture of the three chains convergence in terms of the gr values is confirmed with the values less than 1 2 in this study for all parameters gelman and rubin 1992 3 3 goodness of fit gof measures in this study the model performance is quantitatively assessed to judge the fit by comparing four different goodness of fit measures the index of agreement ioa the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the bias between radar rainfall estimates and observed rainfall over the entire 8 year period from 2011 to 2017 the goodness of fit measures used in this study are given in eqs 7 through 10 7 i o a 1 i 1 n y i obs y i re i 1 n y i obs y obs y i re y re 8 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i re 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i re 2 10 b i a s 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i re where y i obs represents the gauge observed rainfall and y i re the radar rainfall estimates respectively the ioa has a range from 0 to 1 and the closer to 1 the better the model performance here we used the ioa to measure the degree of predictive skill the mae is the average of the absolute values of the deviations between the observed rainfall intensity and the radar rainfall estimates similarly the rmse is the square root of the mean of the squared deviations between the radar estimates and the observed ground rainfall both are measures of mean error ranging from zero to infinity in the same units of measurement the mae rmse and bias are three of the most common metrics used to measure accuracy for continuous variables 4 results and discussion nearly 70 of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer monsoon over the korean peninsula considering the strong seasonality of precipitation the division of the year into wet and dry seasons is even more important to ensure reliable and consistent calibration of z r relationships under different climatic regimes chowdhury and ndiaye 2017 kim et al 2018b kwon and lall 2016 wu and kirtman 2007 we therefore considered two distinct seasons for the purpose of comparing the z r relationship the wet season from june to september jjas and the dry season from november to february ndjf this study collected relatively long term radar gauge pairs over the entire recording period from 2011 to 2017 coveringthe whole country ofsouthkorea because previous studies typically use a limited number of radar gauge pairs containing data from a few rainfall events during the wet season to calibrate the z r relationship the uncertainty in the parameters may have been increased due to sampling error to our knowledge our work is the first systematic attempt to calibrate z r relationships all over south korea for a better understanding of the variability in space and time using long term radar measurements within a bayesian framework it has been shown that data sets i e weather radar reflectivity factor and ground rainfall data containing zero values can lead to biased estimates of parameters germann et al 2006 ruiz et al 2015 zhang and weng 2015 here only radar reflectivity exceeding a certain threshold of 3 to 4 mm6 m3 i e 5 dbz and its corresponding rainfall are used to alleviate problems associated with a low signal to noise ratio snr in the context of calibration of parametersof the z r relationship we have not explored model performance for a fixed length of data instead this study is based on paired data ranging from 174 to 718 events and 1 374 to 2 225 events for the dry and wet seasons respectively which we judged to be sufficient to determine the behavior of the two parameters in the calibrated z r relationship moreover this study attempted to estimate all the parameters in a bayesian modeling framework so that we could better characterize the uncertainty associated with the length of data in this study seasonal differences in the calibrated parameters are first explored by comparing posterior distributions of the estimated parameters of all 85 weather stations for the two seasons then the degree of uncertainty in the parameters is evaluated in terms of the interquartile range iqr with the 25th and 75th percentiles of the posterior distribution as illustrated in figs 2 and 3 again note that parameter α can be regarded as the additive bias correction factor and parameter β can be viewed as the multiplicative bias correction parameter in the context of a generalized log linear regression model in the wet season we identify distinct differences in the parameters over stations particularly parameter α representing the mean additive bias in a way that may reflect the variation in precipitation over stations moreover the degree of uncertainty in the parameters varies significantly from onestation to another and the uncertainty range is increased by an increase in parameter α on the other hand although parameter β is observed to change significantly over the radar stations the range of parameter β is much smaller as compared with changes found in parameter α the results obtained here are largely consistent with previous studies that variation in the multiplicative bias correction factor β is smaller than that of the parameter α ochou et al 2011 orellana alvear et al 2017 seed et al 2002 more specifically the calibrated parameters α and β are found to be within the ranges of 8 16 119 1 and 1 41 2 71 respectively during the wet season in the dry season the presence of distinct variations in the parameters is clearly identified this study reveals a more pronounced difference in parameter α across the stations for parameter α similar to the wet season the degree of uncertainty in the parameters differs significantly across the stations and the range of uncertainty becomes larger as parameter α is increased parameter β varies significantly over the stations but its range 1 94 4 14 is much smaller than that of parameter α 1 05 25 95 in this context in summary the values of parameters α and β obtained from the calibrated model lie from 1 05 25 95 and 1 94 4 14 respectively during the dry season the estimated parameters and their credible intervals are reported in table 4 as expected parameter α representing the additive bias correction factor during the wet season is considerably larger than those of the dry season up to about 8 74 12 29 dbz as averaged in the case of the multiplicative bias correction parameter β the values during the dry season are also significantly larger than those obtained from the wet season the larger values of parameter β during the dry season represent an increase in multiplicative bias and vice versa during the wet season as found by other researchers doelling et al 1998 rendon et al 2012 steiner and smith 2000 we further compared the coefficient of variation also known as the relative standard deviation rsd to understand the extent of variation in terms of the mean of the distribution of the parameters the rsd is a standardized measure of the dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution holvoet et al 2005 johnson and sharma 2015 more importantly the rsd might be useful for identifying variations in relation to the mean leading to a dimensionless number for a more effective comparison the rsd of parameter α based on the median value obtained from a posterior distribution over all of the stations is 0 514 and 1 138 for the wet season and dry season respectively the rsd of parameter β over all of the stations is about 0 124 and 0 174 for the wet season and dry season respectively the higher the rsd the greater the level of variation relative to the mean furthermore compared to the dry season there is much less variability in the parameter estimates during the wet season for the calibrated z r relationship in our case study an expanded range of uncertainty in the parameter estimates is primarily attributable to the degree ofinconsistency in the reflectivity rainfall rate relationship therefore it can be concluded that the degree of uncertainty in radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship over the dry season may be subsequently increased compared to that of the wet season first given these results the question remains whether there exists a systematic relationship between parameters α and β in the calibrated z r relationships for the two seasons fig 4 illustrates the relationships of the parameters obtained from the 85 calibrated relationships we found a steadily decreasing trend in β with increasing α and these relationships can be unambiguously separated into distinct evolutionary regimes based on season suggesting the need for an additional approach to explicitly consider the relationship in the estimation of parameters the seasonal difference in the calibrated z r relationship is generally related to the change in the drop size distribution with respect to the droplet radius fujiwara 1965 sulochana et al 2016 secondly we explored the spatial distribution of the parameters in the calibrated z r relationship over the two seasons figs 5 and 6 illustrate the spatial distributions of parameters α and β in the calibrated z r relationships and their credible intervals directly sampled from the posterior distribution for the two seasons as shown in the figures there are spatially structured patterns in the parameters particularly parameter α for the wet season and parameter β for the dry season a pronounced region of high values in parameter α during the wet season over midwestern south korea indicates the enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region the enhanced radar reflectivity in the offshore zone extended over that limited area and then gradually decreased note again that parameters α and β represent the additive and multiplicative bias correction factors respectively an important implication is that a pronounced region of high values in parameter α during the wet season represents the relatively larger additive bias partially due to the overestimation of the radar reflectivity factor associated with enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region distinct values of parameter α during the dry season are found in spatially isolated regions in southwestern south korea where rainfall is generally higher than in other regions thus the additive bias plays a leading role while the multiplicative bias plays a limited role in the wet season and vice versa in the dry season overall increased uncertainty in parameter α is accompanied by an enhanced reflectivity but is less constrained at low reflectivity for parameter β the entire south korea region shows a consistent pattern during the wet season whereas there is a spatial separation between the north and south subregions that already appeared in parameter α the inverse relationship between the parameters i e decreasing trend in β with increasing α identified in fig 4 is similarly represented in space in summary the main goal of this study was to explore how much of the systematic error can be reduced by using the calibrated z r relationship with long term radar reflectivity accordingly the model performance was quantitatively assessed to judge the fit by comparing four different goodness of fit measures as illustrated in section 3 3 the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship were then considered to compare model efficiency with the existing z r relationships for estimating stratiform rainfall i e the marshall palmer relationship and convective rainfall based on ioa mae rmse and bias as summarized in fig 7a 7b a bayesian approach to parameter estimation in the calibrated z r relationship using long term radar gauge pairs generally outperforms the two existing ones in terms of the four goodness of fit measures as seen in figs 7a and b the ioa values of the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship for the wet and dry seasons are generally higher than 0 7 and 0 6 respectively indicating a close agreement between the observed rainfall and radar rainfall estimates conversely the values of ioa for the existing z r relationships are considerably lower than that of the proposed calibrated z r relationship a reduction in the mae is largely seen in the calibrated z r relationship but the difference is not readily apparent particularly in the wet season a reduction in the rmse is more clearly visible than the mae which can be attributed to a reduction in the error associated with larger values since the rmse takes the average of the squared errors kim et al 2018a willmott and matsuura 2005 in terms of the bias the differences between the current practices and the proposed approach are even more pronounced compared with those obtained from the remaining goodness of fit measures given these results the proposed modeling scheme should be more effective in terms of reducing systematic errors in radar rainfall estimates the calibrated z r relationships over all of the stations were used to generate the radar rainfall fields and then compared to those of the observed ground rainfall here the parameters were gridded using a biharmonic spline interpolation method by sandwell 1987 overall the radar rainfall fields are very similar to the observed rainfall fields whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the existing marshall palmer z r relationship yield a systematic underestimation with respect to the observed ground rainfall as illustrated in figs 8 and 9 the obtained z r relationships are further validated by testing their predictions on unseen radar gauge pairs in the year 2018 in the context of cross validation as shown in figs 10 and 11 for the wet and dry season respectively and model efficiency with the existing z r relationship is summarized in figs 7a and b the temporal cross validated results are largely similar to those in the calibration process suggesting that the calibrated z r relationships fit the radar gauge pairs reasonably well moreover a more detailed comparison of the cross validation in the space domain with the model fitting results over the entire year is presented in figs 7a and b here a leave one out loo cross validation scheme that drops one station during the calibration phase and the remaining stations are used to estimate the model parameters as was done in the temporal cross validation scheme finally the performance measures i e ioa mae rmse and bias of different methods with respect to rainfall thresholds low 5 mm h medium 5 15 mm h and high 15 25 mm h and more than 25 mm h are summarized in table s1 s4 the calibrated z r relationship is more effective in the reduction of systematic error compared to the two existing ones in three different rainfall thresholds significant differences in the rmse in space are identifiedregardless of sparseanddenseregions of the weather stations or radar stations as shown in fig 12 we identified spatially structured patterns in the rmse where similar patterns were obtained for the parameter α and β during the wet season and the dry season respectively it can be concluded that structured spatial patterns in the rmse is partly attributable to the structured patterns identified in these two parameters as expected 5 concluding remarks in the last three decades weather radar has come to play a much larger role in operational hydrology particularly in the recognition and detection of severe local storms this stems from the development ofradar hardwarecalibration as well as other improvements in radar rainfall estimating methodologies weather radars can now provide continuous rainfall estimates in near real time over large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution which in turn enables appropriate hydrologic responses by means of well calibrated hydrologic models as inputs however the direct use of weather radar rainfall for hydrological modeling usually results in over or underestimation due to its systematic bias and surprisingly there may be seasonal differences and spatial variability in the dsd within a weather radar pixel jaffrain et al 2011 therefore the relationship between radar reflectivity and the actual rain rate must be determined to obtain accurate radar rainfall estimates the marshall palmer z r relationship has been extensively employed in south korea under its assumption of spatially and temporally averaged drop size distributions however a fixed z r relationship approach for an entire year and for different seasons wet and dry is clearly problematic because the relationship varies spatially and temporally throughout the large region given this background this study investigated the use of long term radar reflectivity factor to determine a nationwide calibrated parameter or bias correction factor for the radar reflectivity factor and the associated uncertainties over the entire south korea region within a bayesian regression framework under the assumption that the estimated parameters may differ across subregions and seasons this study explored seasonal differences in calibrated parameters and their roles in reducing the systematic error the main findings of this study are as follows 1 distinct differences in the calibrated parameters of the power law relationship z α r β where r is the rainfall intensity and z is the reflectivity factor in space are clearly identified particularly parameter α representing the mean additive bias to reflectivity factor which takes account of the spatial variations of precipitation similarly the parameter β representing the bias correction ratio significantly varies over the stations which reflect the degree of the bias in space regardless of the season the degree of uncertainty in the parameters varies spatially and the uncertainty ranges of both parameters α and β increase as the parameters increase regarding the seasonal characteristics of the parameters α is larger in the wet season while β is larger in the dry season in addition compared to the dry season there is less variability in the parameter estimates during the wet season 2 an inverse relationship between the two reflectivity parameters α and β is clearly identified with distinct evolutionary regimes based on seasons to our knowledge there are no other studies explicitly reporting the inverse relationship of the correction parameters for the calibrated z r relationships using long term radar gauge pairs over relatively large areas the inverse relationship between the parameters identified in the current study is also structured in space 3 there is a spatially structured pattern in the parameters particularly in parameter α for the wet season and in parameter β for the dry season a pronounced region of high values of parameter α during the wet season may partially be associated with storm movements in that season distinct values of parameter α during the dry season are found in spatially isolated regions in southwestern south korea where rainfall is generally higher than other regions for parameter β there is a spatial separation between the north and south subregions that already appeared in parameter α during the dry season 4 the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship are compared with the existing ones for estimating stratiform rainfall and convective rainfall based on four different goodness of fit measures a bayesian approach to bias correction factor estimation for the reflectivity factor is very effective in terms of reducing the systematic error in radar rainfall estimates overall the modeled radar rainfall fields are very similar to the observed rainfall fields whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the existing marshall palmer z r relationship show systematic underestimation there are several potential areas to be further explored in radar rainfall studies first more research is needed to explore the variability in the bias correction factors in relation to geomorphological characteristics e g latitude longitude and altitude second further studies are needed to develop a bayesian approach for explicitly considering the covariance structure of the model parameters in the calibrated z r relationship identified in this study credit

4920,a fixed z r relationship approach such as the marshall palmer relationship for an entire year and for different seasons can be problematic in cases where the relationship varies spatially and temporally throughout a region from this perspective this study explores the use of a long term radar reflectivity factor for south korea to obtain a nationwide calibrated power law relationship z α r β where r is the rainfall intensity and z is the reflectivity factor in the context of bias correction and the associated uncertainties within a bayesian regression framework this study also investigates seasonal differences in the bias correction parameters i e additive and multiplicative bias correction factors and their roles in reducing systematic error distinct differences in the calibrated parameters over stations are identified and more importantly an inverse relationship between the two reflectivity parameters α and β i e decreasing trend in β with increasing α is clearly identified with different parameter space based on the seasons a spatially structured pattern in the parameters exists particularly parameter α for the wet season and parameter β for the dry season a pronounced region of high values in the power law parameters i e α and β during the wet and dry seasons may be partially due to the overestimation of the radar reflectivity factor associated with enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region finally the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship are compared with the currently used z r relationships for estimating stratiform rainfall and convective rainfall overall the radar rainfall fields based on the proposed modeling procedure are similar to the observed rainfall fields whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the currently used marshall palmer z r relationship show a systematic underestimation the calibrated z r relationships are further validated by testing the predictions of unseen radar gauge pairs in the year 2018 in the context of cross validation the cross validation results are largely similar to those in the calibration process suggesting that the derived z r relationships fit the radar gauge pairs reasonably well keywords z r relationship bayesian regression radar rainfall bias correction uncertainty 1 introduction the extent of spatio temporal variation in precipitation has been observed and documented over south korea lee et al 2012 son et al 2017 wi et al 2016 especially during the summer season an increase the local variation in spatio temporal rainfall patterns has been of concern over the last few decades in relation to flood risk management lima et al 2015 sankarasubramanian and lall 2003 ward et al 2016 and this variation may become more extensive and continuous under climate change specifically increased rainfall variability has resulted in locally heavy rainfalls leading to socio economic and human losses in many communities moreover such heavy rainfall events could trigger landslides and flash floods in mountainous areas therefore it is important to understand the role of heavy rainfall in the context of spatio temporal patterns and this information can be utilized to better manage water related disasters however in many countries including south korea ground based long term minutely or hourly rainfall networks are too sparse to capture complex spatio temporal patterns aghakouchak et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the korean peninsula in particular is mainly affected by the east asia monsoon system kim et al 2018a during the summer season and there is significant spatio temporal variability in rainfall during that season park et al 2011 in these contexts weather radar rainfall information is becoming more widely utilized to support spatio temporal aspects of rainfall patterns early radar equipment was developed for military purposes and the current weather radar system was designed to detect raindrop particles and further estimate rainfall intensities in the spatio temporal context a main advantage of weather radar rainfall information is to minimize the spatial intermittency of rainfall fields including rainfall over the ocean compared to ground observations to be more specific weather radar is able to continuously present nearly real time rainfall fields over a larger range and provide spatio temporal rainfall information over ungauged watersheds but is bedeviled by beam blocking anomalous propagation high altitude at distance beam widening and so on thus the weather radar system has enabled us to observe and explore complex rainfall patterns that may not be observed in ground based rain gauge data other efforts have been made to produce high spatial resolution gridded rainfall products by combining remote sensing data e g weather radar and satellite data and a dense rain gauge network the operational programme for the exchange of weather radar information opera is the radar program of eumetnet that aimed to coordinate european weather radar networks for 20 years similarly a nationwide radar system combining multiple radars has been operated to provide spatial radar composites in australia national radar loop nrl china i e chinese new generation weather radar cinrad keenan et al 2003 park et al 2019 shi et al 2018 beside south korea suk et al 2013 you et al 2014 moreover a more sophisticated blending technique to merge multiple radars satellites and a dense network of rain gauges has been proposed han et al 2011 shen et al 2018 sinclair and pegram 2005 for example the multi radar multi sensor mrms operated by national severe storms laboratory nssl in noaa is a representative system that integrates different sources of data from multiple radars satellite ground and airborne observations chen et al 2013 yu and smull 2000 zhang et al 2016 a blending approach using kriging with external drift ked has been proposed to better represent the spatial distribution of radar rainfall estimates by merging ground and radar rainfall measurements delrieu et al 2014 jewell and gaussiat 2015 associated algorithms for representing rainfall patterns have been developed in line with the weather radar systems which are key instruments in hydrometeorology for monitoring rainfall and wind and have become a primary tool for short term weather forecasting maddox et al 2002 papagiannaki et al 2013 shi and cui 2012 srivastava et al 2010 moreover radar rainfall fields can be effectively applied in the hydrological modeling framework such as in distributed rainfall runoff analysis berenguer and zawadzki 2008 borga 2002 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 germann et al 2009 more recently the use of weather radar rainfall data has been emphasized in water resources management in many countries anagnostou et al 2018 ciach et al 2007 dai et al 2014 2018 ghaemi et al 2017 krajewski and smith 2002 overeem et al 2009 rico ramirez and cluckie 2008 villarini and krajewski 2010 for example weather radar is now widely used for flash flood warning systems requiring high spatio temporal resolution of precipitation bell and moore 1998 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 creutin and borga 2003 looper and vieux 2012 smith et al 2004 yu et al 2001 however it has been acknowledged that the direct use of weather radar rainfall data for hydrologic modeling is not recommended due to its systematic bias that may result in substantial underestimation or overestimation in rainfall amounts kim et al 2018a seto and iguchi 2007 therefore a quantitative evaluation of the uncertainties in weather radar rainfall estimates has been an issue in the field of radar hydrology in this context a bias correction approach is generally introduced to reduce the systematic bias of radar rainfall estimates that are typically obtained by the z r radar reflectivity to rain rate relationship one of the greatest challenges for operational hydrology is to obtain spatio temporal rainfall patterns at fine scales for flood risk management in urban or mountainous areas arguably weather radar based quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is recognized as the most skillful source of high resolution rainfall data high resolution qpe can offer opportunities for better representing small scale variations of rainfall patterns in both space and time which in turn can lead to more accurate representations of discharges at local and regional scales a relationship between the radar reflectivity and the rain rate is routinely required for producing radar rainfall estimates anagnostou et al 2004 krajewski et al 2010 schrom and kumjian 2016 villarini and krajewski 2010 more specifically radar rainfall estimates from reflectivity rely on a z r relationship which forms a power law function between radar reflectivity z and rain rate r marshall and palmer 1948 radar rainfall retrieval procedures are mainly based on spatially and temporally averaged drop size distributions dsds which lead to a fixed z r relationship bringi et al 2003 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 2003 in south korea the weather radar network is established and maintained by the government and this relationship is typically based on the marshall palmer equation z 200r1 6 yoo et al 2016 a crucial issue in the practical implementation of radar rainfall estimates is the range dependent systematic error stemming from the sampling differences in location and time between the ground rainfall and the radar estimates goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 kann et al 2015 montopoli et al 2017 for example intensive frontal rainfall often evaporates completely before it reaches the ground moreover there are differences in microphysical properties due to the influence of seasons and locations or regions which result in variability in the raindrop size distribution dsd bringi et al 2003 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 2003 along with significant uncertainties associated with the retrieval of microphysical information from the z r parameters rainfall measurement uncertainties may also affect the subsequent analysis in the z r relationship steiner et al 2004 given this background we investigate the following questions specifically over the korean peninsula 1 how much of the systematic error is reduced by the calibrated z r relationship with a long term radar reflectivity factor can the use of a long term radar reflectivity factor be more effective in correcting systematic bias in the z r relationship 2 what is the spatial distribution of the bias correction parameters or factors in the calibrated z r relationship are there any spatial patterns in the parameters 3 is there a seasonal difference in the calibrated parameters of z r relationship does the seasonally calibrated z r relationship adequately describe the systematic errors and their statistical properties to address these questions this study explored the long term radar reflectivity equation to establish a nationwide calibrated parameter of the z r relationship to obtain consistent radar rainfall estimates and their uncertainties over the entire south korea region within a bayesian regression framework this study also investigated seasonal differences in the calibrated z r relationship and their contributions to the systematic error turning to the layout of this paper the research background is introduced in this section the radar data and ground rainfall data used in this study are summarized in section 2 the theoretical background for the calibration of the z r relationship using bayesian inference is offered in the methodology section section 3 in section 4 the proposed approach is then applied to calibrate the z r relationship over the entire south korea region and is comprehensively discussed finally section 5 provides our concluding remarks 2 weather radar and ground rain gauges weather radar indirectly estimates both rainfall and wind direction by analyzing the interval of return of the transmitted electromagnetic pulses primarily weather radar is designed for mapping fields of precipitation and measuring their intensity and motion spatio temporal high resolution weather 9 s band and 2c band radar data may contribute to a short range forecast by monitoring and tracking the early stage of heavy rainfall snowstorm or a typhoon the weather radar system in korea began with the installation of the first weather radar on mt gwanak in 1969 a total of 11 weather radars are currently in operation and the details of the kma korea meteorological administration weather radar resources can be found in table 1 the weather radar center wrc similar to the nexrad radar operations center roc in the united states has been in operation since 2010 and provides nationwide coverage of radar rainfall estimates the wrc combines all the information available from different weather radar systems operated by different agencies so as to provide the full range of radar rainfall estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 5 min the specifications of the wrc weather radars including locations and altitudes used in this study are summarized in table 1 most c band weather radars have been replaced by s band over the last decade to produce more accurate precipitation estimates recently dual polarization radar i e kwk psn gsn ksn bri jni gdk myn and ssp has been gradually adopted for even better estimates in south korea currently long term radar rainfall estimates are used for various purposes in many countries fairman et al 2015 overeem et al 2009 tabary 2007 kma uses the radar constant altitude plan position indicator cappi for operational qpe and rainfall composites of average reflectivities can be obtained from 2011 to 2017 the cappi data provides a horizontal cross section of the plan position indicator ppi volume scan data at a constant altitude 1 5 km which is in turn used to represent the weather at a given altitude the 1 5 km reflectivity data is routinely adopted to offer an accurate estimation of radar rainfall particularly for the bright band the range of the 1 5 km ppi at the lowest elevation angle is varied between 70 km and 125 km it should be noted that the weather radar reflectivity is significantly affected by ground clutter beam blockage anomalous propagation and so on moreover there is a bright band region of high reflectivity at 3 4 km height above the ground and at around 2 km height during the summer especially for stratiform precipitation the bright band may be lower during the winter due to the lower freezing level bordoy et al 2010 nearly 70 of the territory is a mountainous area in south korea so that reflectivity below 1 0 km can be affected by ground clutter due to strong surface reflectivity signals and anomalous propagation chang et al 2009 kwon et al 2015 in this perspective the 1 5 km reflectivity data with the effective radius of approximately 100 km is routinely adopted to provide an accurate estimate of radar rainfall hong and lee 2009 jeong et al 2014 kim et al 2018a lee et al 2011 yoo et al 2014 2016 kma uses the open radar product generator orpg with a fuzzy quality control algorithm fqca as quality control techniques to minimize systematic error cho et al 2006 jain et al 1997 kim et al 2015 kim and kwon 2016 ye et al 2015 more specifically an interpolation approach is employed to fill the beam blockages and cone of silence andrieu and creutin 1995 bech et al 2003 haase et al 2007 and fqca is often used to alleviate the ground clutter and anomalous propagation hubbert et al 2009 rico ramirez and cluckie 2008 as indicated in the introduction in south korea the marshall palmer mp z r equation is officially adopted to estimate the rain rate park and lee 2010 suk et al 2013 yoon and bae 2013 however some studies haveshown that the direct use of the marshall palmer equation over an entire basin is generally affected by systematic errors in radar measurement due to lack of adequate representation ofthe z r relationship bárdossy and pegram 2017 biggs and atkinson 2011 brandes et al 2006 kim et al 2018a more specifically the z r relationship may change continuously over time and space due to the considerable variability of the raindrop size distribution hasan et al 2016 steiner and smith 2004 wang et al 2016 therefore this study mainly compares the results to the rain rate estimated from the mp equation there are nearly 1 000 aws automatic weather stations available nevertheless most stations have been in operation since late 2000 the unit of observation for aws precipitation is 0 5 mm which is relatively larger than the unit of asos automated synoptic observing system observation 0 1 mm more than 100 asos stations are in operation throughout south korea at an average spatial resolution of 13 15 km and they release consistent real time weather variables such as precipitation temperature and air pressure park et al 2018 for this study asos 85 stations covering the period from 2011 to 2017 were selected asos precipitation data is known to be more reliable and stable compared to aws precipitation data in this regard this study mainly used asos precipitation data the rain gauge data is accumulated on a minute by minute basis in this study 60 minute rainfall sequences are reconstructed based on 85 stations from 2011 to 2017 to obtain a set of bias corrected parameters for the calibrated z r relationship and their uncertainties the radar reflectivity factor z was linearly averaged over 3 3 squares of 1 km pixels centered on the locations of the ground rain gauges of interest to avoid oversampling of the data and provide spatially integrated rainfall estimates aghakouchak et al 2010 the asos weather stations used in this study are illustrated in fig 1 b and the details of the stations are summarized in table 2 3 parameterization of z r equation 3 1 z r relationship reflectivity is simply a measure of how much energy is scattered back to the weather radar by the rain drops more specifically the strength of the reflectivity the travel time from the rain drops and the phase shift of the energy are available at several different elevations or angles and are then used to obtain radar rainfall estimates including storm structure some degree of the transmitted energy is obtained through a radar antenna receiver as a result of backscattering and the reflectivity factor is then transformed into the rain rate by the z r relationship which relates the radar reflectivity factor to the rain rate the reflectivity factor z is measured in mm6 m3 and is then converted into dbz and a light rain rate can be detected with a dbz value of 20 the higher the reflectivity in the dbz the greater the rainfall intensity assuming that the radar echo has a known distribution of precipitation particles enables one to convert the reflectivity to the rainfall rate named the z r relationship marshall and palmer 1948 blanchard 1953 jones 1956 carlson 1970 jorgensen and willis 1982 rosenfeld et al 1993 fulton et al 1998 brommundt and bárdossy 2007 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 mapiam et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 looper and vieux 2012 wang et al 2012 hasan et al 2014 gochis et al 2015 a power law z r relationship is commonly assumed as follows 1 z α r β o r r z α 1 β where r is the rainfall intensity in m m h r and z is the reflectivity factor in mm6 m3 the values α and β are regression coefficients that depend on the rainfall distribution and intensity and the reflectivity z is by definition proportional to the 6th moment of the raindrop size distribution in the rayleigh approximation 2a z 0 n d d 6 d d 2b d b z 10 log 10 z where n d is the number of raindrops per unit volume and d denotes the diameter of the raindrop a set of calibrated parameters can be estimated using paired samples of reflectivity factor and rainfall rate dependent on the dsd the z r relationship appears to be highly variant over space and time due to the different weather types synoptic patterns and inadequate sampling of the drop size along these lines a number of studies have attempted to improve radar rainfall estimates obtained from the existing z r relationships with a limited number of paired data sets between radar reflectivity factor and rainfall intensity in the context of hydrologic applications the commonly used z r relationships are summarized in table 3 among these the marshall palmer equation has been widely adopted in many countries including south korea however some studies have shown that the use of a fixed marshall palmer equation over an entire basin is generally affected by systematic errors in radar measurement due to a lack of an appropriate parameterization of the z r relationship more specifically the z r relationship may change continuously over time and space due to the considerable variability of the raindrop size distribution the main disadvantage of using predefined z r relationships is that they do not adequately represent various storm types such as stratiform or convective for a specific basin alfieri et al 2010 lee and zawadzki 2005 for this reason we use a long term set of weather radar data to obtain a range of calibrated parameters for the z r relationship and its uncertainty for wet and dry seasons over the entire south korea region under the assumption that the calibrated parameters may differ across subregions and seasons a theoretical background of the uncertainty estimation in the calibrated reflectivity rainfall rate z r relationship within a bayesian framework is further described in the following section 3 2 bayesian approach to the calibrated z r relationship the bayesian approach has become increasingly widespread in many fields of science especially in hydrology where the bayesian model has been employed to estimate parameters and their uncertainties leung and wu 2000 todini 2001 copsey and webb 2003 lima and lall 2009 devineni et al 2013 kim et al 2017 the bayesian model specifies a posterior or conditional distribution of the parameter θ conditioned on a prior distribution that is related to the event of interest in other words the posterior distribution of the parameters can be obtained by continuously updating the likelihood function with the predefined prior distributions of the parameters kim et al 2018c kwon et al 2008b the posterior distribution of the set of parameters can be defined by factorizing the likelihood p x θ and prior p θ as follows 3 p θ x p x θ p θ p x p x θ p θ where x is the data vector i e the weather radar reflectivity factor z and ground rainfall data r and θ is the set of parameters to be estimated in the calibrated z r relationship in this section the details of bayesian approaches in the context of calibrating the z r relationship are described as illustrated above the z r relationship typically follows a power law of the form for converting radar reflectivity into rainfall estimates the proposed model for calibrating or correcting a z r relationship can be written as eqs 4a and 4b in the context of a generalized log linear model glm the observed ground rainfall r and reflectivity factor z are assumed to have a lognormal distribution note that the values i e rainfall and reflectivity factor were log transformed prior to analysis the lognormal assumption for rainfall rate and reflectivity has been made by a number of studies das and maitra 2018 grayman and eagleson 1970 kim et al 2018a pegram and clothier 2001 ro and yoo 2020 seo and smith 1991 wilson and brandes 1979 here intercept term α and slope term β can be treated as mean additive and multiplicative bias correction factors respectively after the log transformation of both the observed ground rainfall r and radar reflectivity factor z as follows 4a log z t log α β l o g r t t 1 2 t 4b l o g r t n μ t σ 2 4c μ t l o g z t log α β where n stands for the normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ of the observed rainfall s natural logarithm and t is the total number of data samples the regression coefficients α and β are the bias correction parameters of interest to be estimated which may vary depending on the rainfall intensity and the meteorological pattern here as for hyper prior distributions conjugate prior distributions are considered to be most practical in the estimation of parameters in the bayesian framework a conjugate prior of the normal distribution for the mean and standard deviation are the normal and gamma distributions respectively the prior distributions of the range of reflection coefficients and variance can be written as eqs 5a c we use long term hourly weather radar data 85 radar gauge pairs to derive the bias correction factors for the calibrated z r relationship and thus it should be reasonable to assume that weak prior distributions for the two regression parameters could be given vague normal priors with a mean of 0 and a precision of 10 3 as suggested in the literature gelman 2006 moreover a weak gamma prior distribution is used for the variance 5a α n 0 10 3 5b β n 0 10 3 5c σ 2 g 10 1 10 1 where g denotes the gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters the joint posterior distribution function p θ x for the calibrated z r relationship can be formed as a result of the factorization of the likelihood function and prior distributions as follows 6 p α β x r z t 1 t n l o g r t μ t l o g z t log α β σ 2 n α 0 10 3 n β 0 10 3 g σ 2 10 1 10 1 direct integration of the joint posterior likelihood function is not analytically tractable so this study used the widely employed markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to maximize the joint posterior likelihood functions cheng and aghakouchak 2014 kwon et al 2008a 2011 lima and lall 2009 specifically the model is coded in a matlab environment for the mcmc sampling approach in this study we consider 30 000 samplings for each of three chains and the first 10 000 samples are disregarded to minimize serial correlation over the samples the rate of convergence of the posterior distributions to an unknown set of the parameters is evaluated by gelman rubin gr values less than 1 2 that are obtained from the mixture of the three chains convergence in terms of the gr values is confirmed with the values less than 1 2 in this study for all parameters gelman and rubin 1992 3 3 goodness of fit gof measures in this study the model performance is quantitatively assessed to judge the fit by comparing four different goodness of fit measures the index of agreement ioa the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the bias between radar rainfall estimates and observed rainfall over the entire 8 year period from 2011 to 2017 the goodness of fit measures used in this study are given in eqs 7 through 10 7 i o a 1 i 1 n y i obs y i re i 1 n y i obs y obs y i re y re 8 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i re 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i re 2 10 b i a s 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i re where y i obs represents the gauge observed rainfall and y i re the radar rainfall estimates respectively the ioa has a range from 0 to 1 and the closer to 1 the better the model performance here we used the ioa to measure the degree of predictive skill the mae is the average of the absolute values of the deviations between the observed rainfall intensity and the radar rainfall estimates similarly the rmse is the square root of the mean of the squared deviations between the radar estimates and the observed ground rainfall both are measures of mean error ranging from zero to infinity in the same units of measurement the mae rmse and bias are three of the most common metrics used to measure accuracy for continuous variables 4 results and discussion nearly 70 of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer monsoon over the korean peninsula considering the strong seasonality of precipitation the division of the year into wet and dry seasons is even more important to ensure reliable and consistent calibration of z r relationships under different climatic regimes chowdhury and ndiaye 2017 kim et al 2018b kwon and lall 2016 wu and kirtman 2007 we therefore considered two distinct seasons for the purpose of comparing the z r relationship the wet season from june to september jjas and the dry season from november to february ndjf this study collected relatively long term radar gauge pairs over the entire recording period from 2011 to 2017 coveringthe whole country ofsouthkorea because previous studies typically use a limited number of radar gauge pairs containing data from a few rainfall events during the wet season to calibrate the z r relationship the uncertainty in the parameters may have been increased due to sampling error to our knowledge our work is the first systematic attempt to calibrate z r relationships all over south korea for a better understanding of the variability in space and time using long term radar measurements within a bayesian framework it has been shown that data sets i e weather radar reflectivity factor and ground rainfall data containing zero values can lead to biased estimates of parameters germann et al 2006 ruiz et al 2015 zhang and weng 2015 here only radar reflectivity exceeding a certain threshold of 3 to 4 mm6 m3 i e 5 dbz and its corresponding rainfall are used to alleviate problems associated with a low signal to noise ratio snr in the context of calibration of parametersof the z r relationship we have not explored model performance for a fixed length of data instead this study is based on paired data ranging from 174 to 718 events and 1 374 to 2 225 events for the dry and wet seasons respectively which we judged to be sufficient to determine the behavior of the two parameters in the calibrated z r relationship moreover this study attempted to estimate all the parameters in a bayesian modeling framework so that we could better characterize the uncertainty associated with the length of data in this study seasonal differences in the calibrated parameters are first explored by comparing posterior distributions of the estimated parameters of all 85 weather stations for the two seasons then the degree of uncertainty in the parameters is evaluated in terms of the interquartile range iqr with the 25th and 75th percentiles of the posterior distribution as illustrated in figs 2 and 3 again note that parameter α can be regarded as the additive bias correction factor and parameter β can be viewed as the multiplicative bias correction parameter in the context of a generalized log linear regression model in the wet season we identify distinct differences in the parameters over stations particularly parameter α representing the mean additive bias in a way that may reflect the variation in precipitation over stations moreover the degree of uncertainty in the parameters varies significantly from onestation to another and the uncertainty range is increased by an increase in parameter α on the other hand although parameter β is observed to change significantly over the radar stations the range of parameter β is much smaller as compared with changes found in parameter α the results obtained here are largely consistent with previous studies that variation in the multiplicative bias correction factor β is smaller than that of the parameter α ochou et al 2011 orellana alvear et al 2017 seed et al 2002 more specifically the calibrated parameters α and β are found to be within the ranges of 8 16 119 1 and 1 41 2 71 respectively during the wet season in the dry season the presence of distinct variations in the parameters is clearly identified this study reveals a more pronounced difference in parameter α across the stations for parameter α similar to the wet season the degree of uncertainty in the parameters differs significantly across the stations and the range of uncertainty becomes larger as parameter α is increased parameter β varies significantly over the stations but its range 1 94 4 14 is much smaller than that of parameter α 1 05 25 95 in this context in summary the values of parameters α and β obtained from the calibrated model lie from 1 05 25 95 and 1 94 4 14 respectively during the dry season the estimated parameters and their credible intervals are reported in table 4 as expected parameter α representing the additive bias correction factor during the wet season is considerably larger than those of the dry season up to about 8 74 12 29 dbz as averaged in the case of the multiplicative bias correction parameter β the values during the dry season are also significantly larger than those obtained from the wet season the larger values of parameter β during the dry season represent an increase in multiplicative bias and vice versa during the wet season as found by other researchers doelling et al 1998 rendon et al 2012 steiner and smith 2000 we further compared the coefficient of variation also known as the relative standard deviation rsd to understand the extent of variation in terms of the mean of the distribution of the parameters the rsd is a standardized measure of the dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution holvoet et al 2005 johnson and sharma 2015 more importantly the rsd might be useful for identifying variations in relation to the mean leading to a dimensionless number for a more effective comparison the rsd of parameter α based on the median value obtained from a posterior distribution over all of the stations is 0 514 and 1 138 for the wet season and dry season respectively the rsd of parameter β over all of the stations is about 0 124 and 0 174 for the wet season and dry season respectively the higher the rsd the greater the level of variation relative to the mean furthermore compared to the dry season there is much less variability in the parameter estimates during the wet season for the calibrated z r relationship in our case study an expanded range of uncertainty in the parameter estimates is primarily attributable to the degree ofinconsistency in the reflectivity rainfall rate relationship therefore it can be concluded that the degree of uncertainty in radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship over the dry season may be subsequently increased compared to that of the wet season first given these results the question remains whether there exists a systematic relationship between parameters α and β in the calibrated z r relationships for the two seasons fig 4 illustrates the relationships of the parameters obtained from the 85 calibrated relationships we found a steadily decreasing trend in β with increasing α and these relationships can be unambiguously separated into distinct evolutionary regimes based on season suggesting the need for an additional approach to explicitly consider the relationship in the estimation of parameters the seasonal difference in the calibrated z r relationship is generally related to the change in the drop size distribution with respect to the droplet radius fujiwara 1965 sulochana et al 2016 secondly we explored the spatial distribution of the parameters in the calibrated z r relationship over the two seasons figs 5 and 6 illustrate the spatial distributions of parameters α and β in the calibrated z r relationships and their credible intervals directly sampled from the posterior distribution for the two seasons as shown in the figures there are spatially structured patterns in the parameters particularly parameter α for the wet season and parameter β for the dry season a pronounced region of high values in parameter α during the wet season over midwestern south korea indicates the enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region the enhanced radar reflectivity in the offshore zone extended over that limited area and then gradually decreased note again that parameters α and β represent the additive and multiplicative bias correction factors respectively an important implication is that a pronounced region of high values in parameter α during the wet season represents the relatively larger additive bias partially due to the overestimation of the radar reflectivity factor associated with enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region distinct values of parameter α during the dry season are found in spatially isolated regions in southwestern south korea where rainfall is generally higher than in other regions thus the additive bias plays a leading role while the multiplicative bias plays a limited role in the wet season and vice versa in the dry season overall increased uncertainty in parameter α is accompanied by an enhanced reflectivity but is less constrained at low reflectivity for parameter β the entire south korea region shows a consistent pattern during the wet season whereas there is a spatial separation between the north and south subregions that already appeared in parameter α the inverse relationship between the parameters i e decreasing trend in β with increasing α identified in fig 4 is similarly represented in space in summary the main goal of this study was to explore how much of the systematic error can be reduced by using the calibrated z r relationship with long term radar reflectivity accordingly the model performance was quantitatively assessed to judge the fit by comparing four different goodness of fit measures as illustrated in section 3 3 the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship were then considered to compare model efficiency with the existing z r relationships for estimating stratiform rainfall i e the marshall palmer relationship and convective rainfall based on ioa mae rmse and bias as summarized in fig 7a 7b a bayesian approach to parameter estimation in the calibrated z r relationship using long term radar gauge pairs generally outperforms the two existing ones in terms of the four goodness of fit measures as seen in figs 7a and b the ioa values of the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship for the wet and dry seasons are generally higher than 0 7 and 0 6 respectively indicating a close agreement between the observed rainfall and radar rainfall estimates conversely the values of ioa for the existing z r relationships are considerably lower than that of the proposed calibrated z r relationship a reduction in the mae is largely seen in the calibrated z r relationship but the difference is not readily apparent particularly in the wet season a reduction in the rmse is more clearly visible than the mae which can be attributed to a reduction in the error associated with larger values since the rmse takes the average of the squared errors kim et al 2018a willmott and matsuura 2005 in terms of the bias the differences between the current practices and the proposed approach are even more pronounced compared with those obtained from the remaining goodness of fit measures given these results the proposed modeling scheme should be more effective in terms of reducing systematic errors in radar rainfall estimates the calibrated z r relationships over all of the stations were used to generate the radar rainfall fields and then compared to those of the observed ground rainfall here the parameters were gridded using a biharmonic spline interpolation method by sandwell 1987 overall the radar rainfall fields are very similar to the observed rainfall fields whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the existing marshall palmer z r relationship yield a systematic underestimation with respect to the observed ground rainfall as illustrated in figs 8 and 9 the obtained z r relationships are further validated by testing their predictions on unseen radar gauge pairs in the year 2018 in the context of cross validation as shown in figs 10 and 11 for the wet and dry season respectively and model efficiency with the existing z r relationship is summarized in figs 7a and b the temporal cross validated results are largely similar to those in the calibration process suggesting that the calibrated z r relationships fit the radar gauge pairs reasonably well moreover a more detailed comparison of the cross validation in the space domain with the model fitting results over the entire year is presented in figs 7a and b here a leave one out loo cross validation scheme that drops one station during the calibration phase and the remaining stations are used to estimate the model parameters as was done in the temporal cross validation scheme finally the performance measures i e ioa mae rmse and bias of different methods with respect to rainfall thresholds low 5 mm h medium 5 15 mm h and high 15 25 mm h and more than 25 mm h are summarized in table s1 s4 the calibrated z r relationship is more effective in the reduction of systematic error compared to the two existing ones in three different rainfall thresholds significant differences in the rmse in space are identifiedregardless of sparseanddenseregions of the weather stations or radar stations as shown in fig 12 we identified spatially structured patterns in the rmse where similar patterns were obtained for the parameter α and β during the wet season and the dry season respectively it can be concluded that structured spatial patterns in the rmse is partly attributable to the structured patterns identified in these two parameters as expected 5 concluding remarks in the last three decades weather radar has come to play a much larger role in operational hydrology particularly in the recognition and detection of severe local storms this stems from the development ofradar hardwarecalibration as well as other improvements in radar rainfall estimating methodologies weather radars can now provide continuous rainfall estimates in near real time over large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution which in turn enables appropriate hydrologic responses by means of well calibrated hydrologic models as inputs however the direct use of weather radar rainfall for hydrological modeling usually results in over or underestimation due to its systematic bias and surprisingly there may be seasonal differences and spatial variability in the dsd within a weather radar pixel jaffrain et al 2011 therefore the relationship between radar reflectivity and the actual rain rate must be determined to obtain accurate radar rainfall estimates the marshall palmer z r relationship has been extensively employed in south korea under its assumption of spatially and temporally averaged drop size distributions however a fixed z r relationship approach for an entire year and for different seasons wet and dry is clearly problematic because the relationship varies spatially and temporally throughout the large region given this background this study investigated the use of long term radar reflectivity factor to determine a nationwide calibrated parameter or bias correction factor for the radar reflectivity factor and the associated uncertainties over the entire south korea region within a bayesian regression framework under the assumption that the estimated parameters may differ across subregions and seasons this study explored seasonal differences in calibrated parameters and their roles in reducing the systematic error the main findings of this study are as follows 1 distinct differences in the calibrated parameters of the power law relationship z α r β where r is the rainfall intensity and z is the reflectivity factor in space are clearly identified particularly parameter α representing the mean additive bias to reflectivity factor which takes account of the spatial variations of precipitation similarly the parameter β representing the bias correction ratio significantly varies over the stations which reflect the degree of the bias in space regardless of the season the degree of uncertainty in the parameters varies spatially and the uncertainty ranges of both parameters α and β increase as the parameters increase regarding the seasonal characteristics of the parameters α is larger in the wet season while β is larger in the dry season in addition compared to the dry season there is less variability in the parameter estimates during the wet season 2 an inverse relationship between the two reflectivity parameters α and β is clearly identified with distinct evolutionary regimes based on seasons to our knowledge there are no other studies explicitly reporting the inverse relationship of the correction parameters for the calibrated z r relationships using long term radar gauge pairs over relatively large areas the inverse relationship between the parameters identified in the current study is also structured in space 3 there is a spatially structured pattern in the parameters particularly in parameter α for the wet season and in parameter β for the dry season a pronounced region of high values of parameter α during the wet season may partially be associated with storm movements in that season distinct values of parameter α during the dry season are found in spatially isolated regions in southwestern south korea where rainfall is generally higher than other regions for parameter β there is a spatial separation between the north and south subregions that already appeared in parameter α during the dry season 4 the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated z r relationship are compared with the existing ones for estimating stratiform rainfall and convective rainfall based on four different goodness of fit measures a bayesian approach to bias correction factor estimation for the reflectivity factor is very effective in terms of reducing the systematic error in radar rainfall estimates overall the modeled radar rainfall fields are very similar to the observed rainfall fields whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the existing marshall palmer z r relationship show systematic underestimation there are several potential areas to be further explored in radar rainfall studies first more research is needed to explore the variability in the bias correction factors in relation to geomorphological characteristics e g latitude longitude and altitude second further studies are needed to develop a bayesian approach for explicitly considering the covariance structure of the model parameters in the calibrated z r relationship identified in this study credit

4921,reducing the risk of wildfire and increasing the security of water supply from mountain catchments are both urgent priorities in the western us these goals may be synergistic thanks to the reductions in transpiration and fire hazard associated with reducing forest cover data and modeling efforts based on the illilouette creek basin icb in yosemite national park where fire use policies have been implemented to restore wildfire since 1972 suggest that these policies reduced fire hazards and increased annual streamflow production through large changes to landscape scale forest cover and structure expanding fire use strategies through the western us however would mean that any such changes in forest cover and structure would occur in the middle of the 21st century under different fire frequency and climate conditions than experienced in the icb to date it is therefore important to understand if hydrological benefits of fire use are sensitive to anticipated changes in climate and fire frequency here we force an ecohydrological model previously developed for the icb with an ensemble of downscaled future climate predictions to assess the impacts of climate change and fire use strategies on the hydrology of the icb we find that the hydrological impacts of fire use are comparable under observed climate and projected future climates and are largely insensitive to the significant uncertainties regarding post fire successional trajectories for vegetation while expected increases in fire frequency cause minor changes in the basin hydrology the main impact of more frequent fires is to cause the basin to reach peak hydrological change more rapidly 1 introduction mountain watersheds represent a locus of environmental change and vulnerability in the western us the sierra nevada for example produce 9 30 of california s electricity and 60 90 of california s water supply madani and lund 2009 provisioning ecosystem services stephens et al 2020 that supply water to 30 million of the state s residents and support agricultural industries with an estimated value of 50 billion year klausmeyer and fitzgerald 2012 california department of food and agriculture 2019 these watersheds however experience a naturally volatile climate are expected to warm and dry due to climate change and are at increasing risk of disturbance particularly from wildfire which is also expected to increase in severity and frequency in a warmer climate goulden and bales 2019 westerling 2008 this volatility warming drying and increase in fire risk present significant risks to power production tarroja et al 2016 water supply dahm et al 2015 writer et al 2014 human lives calfire 2019a health and infrastructure calfire 2019b biodiversity richter et al 2019 ecosystem services wood and jones 2019 and amenity of the montane landscape millar and stephenson 2015 conventional management approaches are unlikely to be able to address these joint threats for example the costs of fire suppression and firefighting in california are growing exponentially reaching 950 million usd in 2018 calfire 2019c with reparation costs in the billions of dollars thomas et al 2017 consequently foresters and catchment managers are seeking alternative management paradigms for fire prone montane forests stephens et al 2020 one option is to adopt a fire use policy also known as managed wildfire for watershed management fire use policies allow lightning ignited wildfires to burn subject to a strict management policy that calls for intervention to suppress fire when air quality structures or people are placed at risk van wagtendonk 2007 in part this policy attempts to restore the natural fire regime in western us forests reversing the more than one hundred years of fire suppression in the region fire suppression has altered contemporary forests relative to their pre european settlement condition such that fuel loads the prevalence of shade tolerant and fire intolerant species and density of forest vegetation have all increased relative to historical baselines collins and stephens 2007 van wagtendonk et al 2012 scholl and taylor 2010 stephens et al 2015 although interest in adopting fire use strategies is growing stephens et al 2016 there have been relatively few locations where they have been implemented for long enough to assess their effects within the sierra nevada the illilouette creek basin icb in yosemite national park ca collins and stephens 2007 has experienced 29 fires larger than 40 ha since 1972 when 100 years of fire exclusion and suppression in the basin ended van wagtendonk et al 2012 icb is located in proximity to long term weather stations and is gauged shortly downstream of its confluence with the upper merced river these unique characteristics have made it the subject of ongoing research to establish the ecological and hydrological effects of fire use policies e g collins and stephens 2007 ponisio et al 2016 boisramé et al 2017a 2018 2019 hydrologically the impact of fire use strategies in the icb has been to increase streamflow production and expand wet environments boisramé et al 2017a 2019 changes to the water balance of the basin inferred using the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys suggest that annual transpiration has decreased by up to 30 mm peak snowpack depth increased by up to 10 mm of snow water equivalent swe annual discharge has increased by up to 40 mm year in the fire affected section of the watershed or approximately 5 25 mm year overall and storage of water in the soil and groundwater referred to as subsurface storage hereafter has increased by an average of 60 mm boisramé et al 2019 these changes although modest are comparable to inference of increased streamflow subsurface storage and snowpack and decreased evapotranspiration following wildfires in the consumnes watershed in the sierra nevada maina and siirila woodburn 2019 such post fire wetting occurs against a background of warming and drying in the sierra nevada and could represent a positive hydrological co benefit relevant to the social and economic case for fire use policies c f gonzález sanchis et al 2019 expanding wildland fire use policies to other locations involves confronting the long timescales on which the forests adjust to changed fire regimes stevens et al 2020 these timescales mean that changes in fire management policy implemented in the near future would impact forests and their hydrology during the mid 21st century in comparison to the late 20th century when most of the changes occurred in the icb thus before attempting to use the hydrological insights gained from the icb to inform contemporary forest management decisions it is pertinent to ask whether the hydrological outcomes of wildland fire use are sensitive to the changes in climate expected by the mid 21st century although assessments of the hydrological impact of climatic extremes on watersheds in the western us suggest that the increases in streamflow due to wildfire dwarf the reductions predicted due to climate change by 2050 wine et al 2018 many uncertainties surround these predictions including variable effects of post fire vegetation growth rates and the impact of different fire regimes on water balance tague et al 2019 poorly understood post fire vegetation successional trajectories in a changed climate and uncertainties surrounding the future fire regime itself by the mid 21st century the sierra nevada region is projected to be warmer to experience similar or slightly elevated precipitation inputs dettinger 2005 pierce et al 2013 and more frequent fires than in the 1972 present period westerling 2008 yue et al 2013 geos institute 2013 multiple studies agree that warmer conditions will dry fuels and increase fire frequency severity and extent e g westerling 2008 2018 littell et al 2009 but recent re appraisals of this work in the sierra nevada suggest that fire frequency in future climates is over estimated because projections have ignored the effects of fuel limitation hurteau et al 2019 additional complexities including non stationary relationships between drought and fire occurrence across climate gradients mckenzie and littell 2017 and feedbacks between fire extent vegetation dynamics and distributions syphard et al 2018 mean there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future fire regime so much that syphard et al 2018 concluded that there was no way to ascertain which projections of fire are most feasible compounding uncertainties about future fire regimes is the hard to predict successional trajectory of vegetation post fire and the interaction of these trajectories with a non stationary climate lenihan et al 2003 steel et al 2015 cornwell et al 2012 batllori et al 2015 rapid vegetation transitions from conifer forests to shrubland are associated with the loss of tree seed banks which limits forest regeneration within large patches of high severity fire meng et al 2015 young et al 2019 and with arid post fire conditions that create unfavorable growth conditions for many forest species davis et al 2019 shrublands regenerate rapidly after a fire and have a greater tolerance for arid conditions lauvaux et al 2016 serra diaz et al 2018 baudena et al 2019 in the absence of high severity fires forest succession occurs on timescales of multiple decades halofsky et al 2018 liang et al 2016 and fire excluded forests are hypothesized to lie near tipping points where disturbances could cause significant changes in vegetation composition batllori et al 2018 this literature suggests that the potential range of post fire vegetation transitions is poorly bounded fully predicting the effects of wildland fire use on hydrologic regimes under future climates would require unraveling these uncertain processes to specify the feedbacks between vegetation water fire risk and successional dynamics a highly challenging problem brotons and duane 2019 riley et al 2019 we therefore do not directly address this problem for the specific case of the icb but instead adopt a set of simplifying assumptions which are further developed and justified in the methods section i we use standard approaches to predicting future climate in icb by downscaling and bias correction of an ensemble of global circulation models lanzante et al 2019 luo et al 2018 ii we assume that the characteristics of the fire regime that would arise if applied to fire suppressed forests in 2030 2070 are well represented by the severity area distribution of the historical fires that occurred in icb from 1972 2010 and we allow for the frequency of these fires to increase across a set of scenarios drawn from the literature and considering climate impacts on frequency only see section 2 4 for details specifically the assumptions keep severity and fire area constant and therefore do not account for possible feedbacks between these aspects of fire climate and vegetation finally iii we assess the hydrological implications of climate change on fire impacts under two vegetation scenarios one in which post fire vegetation transitions match those which occurred in the historical period a scenario which might arise if for example topography and geological context primarily drive vegetation community types and one bounding case scenario in which we force all post fire vegetation regeneration to occur as a single plant type conifers shrublands or wet meadows assuming that reality would lie in between these extreme limits of vegetation change with these assumptions we use an existing rhessys model parameterization for the icb boisramé et al 2019 to answer three questions i how would the hydrology of the icb respond to climate change in the absence of the fire use policy where vegetation remains in a fire excluded state ii how do the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies in icb differ under future climate conditions 2030 2070 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 relative to those outcomes under the observed climate 1970 2010 and iii how sensitive are the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies for the 2030 2070 period to potential increases in fire frequency 2 methods 2 1 study site illilouette creek basin icb is located within yosemite national park california usa fig 1 the 150 km2 basin spans an elevation range of 1 270 3 600 meters with a mean elevation of 2 500 meters about 41 of the icb is forested with pinus jeffreyi abies concolor abies magnifica and pinus contorta interspersed with meadows 16 and shrubland 9 about 34 of the basin is high elevation granite which acts to confine fires to the basin boisramé et al 2017b collins et al 2009 icb experiences a mediterranean climate with warm dry summers and cool wet winters the nearest weather station is located in yosemite valley 1 240 meters 37 74 lat 119 59 lon cdec station yyv and has operated since 1926 over 1970 2010 this station recorded a mean annual precipitation of 92 0 cm mean daily minimum january temperature of 2 c and mean daily maximum july temperature of 27 c the icb has similar precipitation totals to yosemite valley but is approximately 7 c cooler january 2015 to december 2017 appendix fig b 1 leading to a greater fraction of precipitation falling as snowfall while streamflow data for the icb itself are limited the basin comprises 33 of the upper merced river basin which has a century long streamflow record at the happy isles gauge located downstream of the confluence of the illilouette creek with the upper merced river fig 1 boisramé et al 2019 the mean flow at happy isles was 10 m3 sec 71 cm year for 1970 2010 usgs gauge 11264500 data from waterdata usgs gov during the period from 1700 1900 prior to fire suppression icb had a fire return interval of 6 3 years following the initiation of fire use strategies the fire return interval was 6 8 years from 1972 2005 similar to the pre exclusion era collins and stephens 2007 from 1972 to 2019 there were 29 fires greater than 40 ha in icb of which 1 was human caused 1986 burned 291 ha 1 was prescribed 1999 54 ha and the other 27 fires were lightning ignited van wagtendonk et al 2012 of the 8187 ha burned in icb 75 of the watershed s vegetated area 4463 ha 55 burned twice 767 ha 9 three times 72 ha 1 four times and 4 ha 1 five times fig 1 as shown in fig 2 this high wildfire activity in icb has doubled the area of dense and sparse meadows in the basin boisramé et al 2017b 2018 increased landscape heterogeneity and habitat for multiple plant and animal species and is associated with increased biodiversity ponisio et al 2016 campos et al 2017 stephens et al 2019 the contemporary 1972 present fire regime in the icb has been relatively stationary fig 3 following the initiation of fire use strategies the fires were relatively small in area with low to moderate burn severities as assessed by landsat derived indices where the relative difference normalized vegetation index rdndvi was used prior to 1984 and the relative difference normalized burn ratio rdnbr post 1984 collins et al 2009 both burn severities fig 3 a and burn areas fig 3 b in the icb are more stable in the contemporary period than in the surrounding sierra nevada where fire severity and area have both increased fire perimeters in the icb indicate that fires in the basin are self limiting collins et al 2009 2 2 rhessys model the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys version 5 20 1 is a spatially distributed ecohydrological model that simulates water energy and vegetation growth processes it represents landscapes through a hierarchy of spatial units small areas of uniform soil and vegetation are represented as patches water is routed between patches within hillslopes and basin scale processes arise from water fluxes and stores aggregated across hillslopes the ability of rhessys to simulate climatic hydrological and vegetation growth processes at a basin scale makes it well suited to simulating the effects of disturbance such as fire on water balance at the patch scale rhessys resolves a detailed vertical energy and water balance the energy balance is forced by shortwave radiation inputs varied to account for slope aspect topographic shading and seasonality other energy flux terms and wind speeds are attenuated through vegetation canopies as a function of leaf area index lai which itself changes dynamically as the vegetation grows incoming precipitation is intercepted by canopy and litter layers and is partitioned between infiltration via green and ampt 1911 and surface detention storage which contributes to runoff if sufficiently large at the soil surface vapor fluxes include evaporation or sublimation from all vertical layers and transpiration separately computed from sunlit and shaded canopy layers all computed using the penman monteith approach monteith 1965 infiltrated water is routed between a root zone an unsaturated and saturated zone based on darcy relationships and soil parameters and lateral fluxes of water between spatially explicit patches are resolved based on surface topography and calibrated drainage parameters in addition to specifying lai growth rates species specific plant properties control maximum stomatal conductance values and their response to changing soil water a more detailed description of the rhessys model is provided in tague and band 2004 boisramé et al 2019 implemented rhessys in the icb drawing on lidar elevation data at 10 m resolution kane et al 2015 a vegetation analysis boisramé et al 2017a that used aerial photos and the yosemite national park vegetation mapping to delineate six cover types daily weather data from the yosemite headquarters weather station and flow records at happy isles gauge and a short flow record within the illilouette creek the six cover types are conifer forest aspen populus tremuloides shrub primarily ceanothus cordulatus wet meadow dense grasses and forbs dry grassland sparsely vegetated areas dominated by grasses or unvegetated exposed rock or sand the model was calibrated to identify behavioral parameter ensembles consisting of i temperature and precipitation lapse rates ii decay of hydraulic conductivity with depth iii saturated hydraulic conductivity at the land surface iv depth of hydrologically active water storage across soil and saprolite layers v the proportion of saturated soil water routed directly via preferential flow paths to deeper groundwater stores below plant root access and vi the proportion of these deeper groundwater stores draining to the stream each day rhessys captures spatial variations in subsurface properties across soil types by scaling them using mapped soil categories for the icb calibration was performed against happy isles flow data and identified an ensemble of 93 behavioral parameter sets assessed across a multi objective set of criteria aiming to capture volume and timing of streamflow on monthly seasonal and annual scales that were used to constrain model uncertainty using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 1992 more details regarding the parameterization calibration and validation of rhessys for the icb are provided in boisramé et al 2019 2 3 modeling the effect of an individual fire individual fires in rhessys were defined based on fire perimeter and severity maps fires were treated as having an instantaneous effect on vegetation biomass on the thickness of the litter layer and on the species specific properties of the vegetation to represent post fire vegetation transitions these factors drive subsequent hydrological responses in rhessys wildfires can however have other hydrologically relevant effects that were omitted from the model including reduced albedo from charred surfaces burles and boon 2011 gleason et al 2013 2019 changes in the size and distribution of canopy gaps stevens 2017 kostadinov et al 2019 lundquist et al 2013 reduced soil infiltration capacity due to ash clogging or soil hydrophobicity neary et al 2005 ebel and moody 2020 doerr et al 2006 and increased erosion rates larsen et al 2009 in the icb low moderate severity fires are most common rather than the high severity fires that generate persistent changes in soil properties doerr et al 2006 and water quality monitoring at the happy isles gauge indicates no increases in turbidity or flow peaks post fire results not shown the reliance of our modeling on spatially uniform daily precipitation although necessary given lack of more resolved precipitation data for the merced river basin henn et al 2018 would likely prevent the model from resolving surface flow events that might arise due to soil changes consequently the model which was calibrated to optimize long timescale water balance predictions may under estimate peak flow occurrences particularly immediately post fire fire severity was used to determine the degree of biomass and litter loss in each fire affected patch the threshold approach of miller and thode 2007 was used to relate rdndvi rdnbr observations to fire severity in icb following collins et al 2009 we considered three classes of change i for rdnbr and rdndvi values between 69 and 315 low severity only litter stores were removed ii for values between 315 and 640 moderate severity in addition to litter removal plant carbon stores were reduced 50 iii for values greater than 640 high severity all carbon and litter layers were removed within the fire perimeter additionally if analysis of aerial photos indicated a change in vegetation cover type following a fire we mapped these patches also as high severity burn areas where high severity fire occurred all above ground vegetation carbon and litter stores were set to zero and modeled vegetation was allowed to immediately regrow dynamically to account for the possibility of a post fire cover type transition we reset the vegetation parameters in these patches to represent one of two scenarios in one scenario individual pixels followed the observed historical successional trajectory that occurred in the 1972 2010 setting in the other scenario pixels that burned at high severity were forced to regenerate with a single vegetation type all forest all shrub or all wetland this bounding cases scenario was used to constrain the uncertainty in the hydrological projections that arises due to unknown patterns of future post fire regeneration under the assumption that enforcing a single vegetation type provides a limiting case the bounding case scenarios were run for the historical fire regime only 2 4 using 1972 2010 fire data to define potential future fire regimes the characteristics of the fire regime that has prevailed in icb since 1972 are illustrated in fig 3 which shows rdndvi and rdnbr distributions fire return interval and area of all fires over 40 ha note that the most recent fire the empire fire of 2017 the only fire after 2010 is not shown on this figure it was omitted from this study due to a lack of data about post fire vegetation type and condition however as illustrated in the appendix section c the empire fire was similar to previous fires in size and severity these data are suggestive of a relatively stable fire regime consistent with the self limiting behavior of fire in the icb defining the spatial temporal and severity characteristics of potential future fire regime is as the literature reviewed in the introduction suggests inherently uncertain in light of these uncertainties and the stability of the fire regime in the icb over five decades of climatic and vegetation change we use the observed fire perimeters and severity maps to define potential future fire areas and severities with the historical fire perimeters providing some control on fuel limitation warmer temperatures are expected to increase the probability of ignition by decreasing fuel moisture leading to increased fire occurrence riley and loehman 2016 westerling 2008 lauvaux et al 2016 to explore the effects of changing fire frequency we shortened the time interval in days between historical fires by 30 and 60 in line with predictions for the sierra nevada based on climatic warming riley and loehman 2016 westerling 2008 lauvaux et al 2016 this had the effect of some fire perimeter severity combinations being imposed twice in the modeled record for the 30 increase in fire frequency scenario 30 these were the fires from 1974 and 1978 for the 60 scenario the fires from 1974 1978 1980 1981 1986 1988 and 1990 were imposed twice as can be seen visually in fig 3 these fires are broadly representative of the range of fires in the icb i e we did not repeat extreme cases we checked if these increases were reasonable in light of the minimum time needed to allow fuel to build up and reburn in the icb estimated as approximately 9 years collins et al 2009 for a 60 increase in fire frequency scenario 60 the average interval between reusing a given fire perimeter is 24 years and the average interval between pixels reburning is 7 years suggesting that this increase represents a reasonable fuel limited maximum for the basin using a historical fire occurrence record as a basis for increasing fire frequency can lead to a situation where a fire is predicted to occur outside the fire season historically observed to be june september in the icb if this projected timing was such that the fire occurred in the window of april 1st to october 31st a period that we confirmed is snow free in all modeled future climate scenarios we allowed the fire to burn on that projected date in line with the expected lengthening of the regional fire season yue et al 2013 if however the projected fire date lay outside this seasonal range it was assigned a random date from the nearest fire season the approach of using historical fire perimeters to define the future fire regime omits exploration of other future fire scenarios for example scenarios in which the severity area of fires changes dramatically using historical fire perimeters does not allow a fully comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty in hydrological predictions associated with the specific sequence of fires it does not explore a situation in which fire frequency is reduced in the basin relative to historical conditions although the fact that three fires were suppressed during the california drought 2011 2016 this is likely responsible for the large fire free interval before the empire fire in 2017 suggests that reduced fire frequency regime could be a possible outcome within the future climate given these limitations our goal is not to be predictive but rather to determine if the hydrological responses to this sequence of historically managed fires or to a sped up version of this sequence of fires are the same as they were under historical climate conditions 2 5 future climate data and bias correction ensembles of climate model predictions are widely recognized as being essential to characterize the uncertainty surrounding future climates pierce et al 2009 hagedorn et al 2005 thompson 1977 since too few regional climate models are available over the icb to generate such an ensemble we downscaled the minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation output of 10 gcms using data from the cell ranging from 0 75 2 8 degrees latitude and longitude containing the icb for the 2030 2070 period in selecting 10 models we followed the recommendations of pierce et al 2009 who suggested that climate ensembles became stable after 5 or more models are included the gcms we selected were access1 3 canesm2 cmcc cm csiro mk3 6 0 gfdl esm2m inm cm4 ipsl cm5a mr miroc5 mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m appendix fig b 2 provides additional descriptions of each model these models were chosen to maximize model skill and model independence as computed by sanderson et al 2017 and to cover a range of predicted future climate extremes i e to include models that predict both cooler wetter futures in the region and those that predict hotter drier conditions all model data were obtained from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 and have the same initializations realizations and parameterization states abbreviated as r1i1p1 in cmip5 we obtained future climate timeseries from both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios where rcp 4 5 scenario represents a decline in greenhouse emissions around year 2040 and rcp 8 5 is a business as usual scenario with a continuous rise in greenhouse emissions both scenarios predict a global rise in temperature choosing temperature and precipitation data of the single gcm grid point containing icb we used quantile delta mapping qdm mbc package in r to bias correct the gcm data and downscale it to the location of the yosemite headquarters weather station qdm is a non parametric method to correct systematic modeled biases with respect to observed values while preserving model projected relative changes in precipitation and temperature quantiles cannon et al 2015 in addition to modeled observed and future climate timeseries qdm requires observed climate observations which we obtained from the yosemite headquarters weather station and gap filled via multivariate imputation mice package in r and data from adjacent weather stations see appendix section b we bias corrected the daily precipitation and the daily maximum and minimum temperatures for 2030 2070 treating the historical period 1970 2010 as static during a static period the distribution of climatic variables does not change significantly for any decade qdm was then used to superimpose the modeled quantile trends delta changes onto the observed static period the delta changes were applied multiplicatively to the precipitation correction and additively to the temperature corrections cannon et al 2015 the resulting bias corrected model timeseries form the climate ensemble were used to drive rhessys modeling the timeseries were summarized in terms of rainfall temperature snowfall and snow season statistics across the ensemble these quantities are important determinants of the length of the fire season and basin hydrology although co2 concentrations are predicted to rise in the future climate due to model limitations they are held constant across all model simulations 2 6 model experiments the model experiments were set up to answer the research questions prior to conducting the model experiments rhessys was initialized with the 1969 fire excluded vegetation map which was spun up for a few hundred years using observed historical climate repeated time series starting from no carbon stores and until lai reached a steady state boisramé et al 2019 then prior to the future climate simulations 2030 2070 for each rcp scenario the 1969 fire excluded and spun up vegetation was further spun up using the 2020 2030 climate research question i asks how changing climate would alter the hydrology of the fire excluded icb assuming vegetation was initialized in the same state as was observed in 1969 to answer this question we held vegetation type constant and ran rhessys for 40 years using the observed 1970 2010 climate and for the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 future 2030 2070 climates see fig 4 differences in the predictions can be interpreted as the impact of climate on vegetation and hydrology in the absence of changes imposed by fire research question ii addresses the differences in how wildland fire use affects icb hydrology under future versus observed climates to answer this question we ran rhessys for a 40 year period using the observed 1970 2010 climate and for the future climate ensemble for the period 2030 2070 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for each of these climates we ran a control model representing fire excluded conditions based on the 1969 vegetation map fig 2 a with no fire disturbance imposed fire excluded we also ran a treatment model in which fire disturbance was imposed based on the observed historical 1970 2010 fire regime historical frequency and updated vegetation maps after fires using both the observed post fire vegetation transitions and the bounding cases where all vegetation transitions to specific cover types the differences in hydrological predictions between control and treatment models can be attributed to the effects of fire on vegetation and litter the differences in these differences sensu angrist and pischke 2008 can be attributed to the role of different climates interacting with the fires research question iii is addressed by repeating this analysis using the higher frequency fire regimes in combination with the future climate scenarios fig 4 however in this case only historical vegetation transitions were modeled again the fire excluded landscape was modeled across all climate regimes as a control differences between control and treatment can again be attributed to the role of fire rhessys output was generated on daily timescales at the scale of the entire illilouette creek basin the analysis focuses on streamflow vertically aggregated depth of saturated and unsaturated groundwater storage subsurface storage snow water equivalent swe snow sublimation lai evaporation and transpiration these variables were aggregated to water year to visualise long term fire effects all results were reported as a depth of water with basin scale fluxes normalized by the basin area 150 km2 however in interpreting these results it is important to recall that all changes in basin scale hydrology were derived from fire induced changes that occurred in at most 75 112 km2 of the watershed if considering how the observed changes in icb might play out in other watersheds it may be more appropriate to weigh these changes by fire affected area in each basin heterogeneity in hydrological processes should also be considered for example only approximately 52 of the streamflow in icb is generated in the area that burned and the remaining 48 is generated on high elevation rock and is largely uninfluenced by downgradient vegetation condition snowpack dynamics are also highly spatially variable with these spatial patterns shifting greatly between climate scenarios these variations are masked in the whole of basin averaging used to present hydrological change in this study but analysis of heterogeneity in hydrological response to fire is beyond the scope of this manuscript 2 7 uncertainty analysis recognizing that the scenarios modeled do not fully bound the range of possible fire climate vegetation interactions our uncertainty analysis follows the glue approach to constrain the combination of uncertainty due to climate projections and hydrological parameter uncertainty each hydrological model experiment consisted of running the 93 highest performing calibration parameter ensembles in conjunction with the 10 climate model ensemble members thus each combination of a future climate scenario rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 and a fire scenario exclusion observed historical 30 or 60 generated an ensemble of 930 modeled timeseries for each variable 93 rhessys model parameterizations times 10 climate models this ensemble formed the basis for uncertainty analyses in general the question we were asking was related to the significance relative to parameter and climate model uncertainty of differences in predicted values of any hydrological variable between two scenarios to compute this significance we differenced model output from equivalent ensemble members having the same combination of driving climate model and rhessys model parameters from the two scenarios of interest this generated a set of 930 differences except in the case where fire scenarios were compared for the observed climate when 93 differences result the 95 confidence interval was then specified as the interval between the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles for these 930 differences if this interval excluded zero the difference was considered significant at the 95 confidence level see appendix d for a mathematical formulation of how the ensemble of differences was calculated 3 results 3 1 future climate table 1 shows climate statistics aggregated by decade for the 4 decades of simulation where decades 1 2 3 and 4 correspond to the historical time periods of 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and future time periods of 2031 2040 2041 2050 2051 2060 2061 2070 respectively by considering output on this decadal basis we can better compare between climates based on the common time since first fire first fire occurs in 1974 for the historical modeling and 2034 for future model scenarios each decadal value shown is based on the average of the 10 gcm models following downscaling and bias correction all results discussed below refer to comparisons between 1970 2010 historical averages and 2030 2070 future climate simulations by 2060 2070 icb will warm by 2 2 c under rcp 4 5 and by 3 1 c under rcp 8 5 climate scenarios predicted annual precipitation totals in both scenarios are slightly wetter than the historically observed record the 2030 2070 rcp 4 5 climate on average receives 159 mm more precipitation per year than the 1970 2010 period while rcp 8 5 receives 32 mm more the historically observed precipitation lies within the 95 uncertainty bounds of both future climate ensembles meaning that some models predict a drier and others a wetter future climate ensemble averaged precipitation under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios exhibits much less inter annual variability than do historical observations see appendix fig b 3 a which is a result of averaging over the ensemble the rcp 8 5 climate ensemble distributions of daily precipitation show an increase in extreme events when compared to the historically observed precipitation distribution see appendix fig b 4 higher average temperatures with similar total precipitation result in a shorter snow season on average by 2060 2070 the snow season length drops by 26 days for rcp 4 5 and 43 days for rcp 8 5 climates additionally and again due to the warmer temperatures the snow fraction of precipitation precipitation falling as snow declines for future climates historically 60 70 of precipitation in icb occurred as snowfall and this percentage falls to 49 rcp 4 5 and 42 rcp 8 5 by 2060 2070 3 2 hydrological outcomes of wildfires to understand the hydrological outcomes of wildfire we considered multiple hydrological variables at the annual scale transpiration evaporation streamflow subsurface storage and maximum snow water equivalent and their mean values across all model parameter sets and climate ensemble members we averaged the value of these variables on decadal timescales and table 2 shows these decadal averages for the observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios for the four fire regimes fire excluded historical fire frequency and 30 and 60 fire frequency the analysis of the results is broken down based on the model scenarios showing the changes in hydrology due to 1 climate only 2 climate in combination with the historical wildland fire use regime and 3 climate combined with hypothetical higher frequency fire regimes 3 2 1 climate only answering research question i isolates the influence of climate on hydrology if vegetation was to remain in a fire excluded state overall other than expected but statistically non significant decreases in snowpack the different climate scenarios cause only minimal changes in predicted icb hydrology at annual timescales to discuss these changes we focus on the final decade of simulation i e 2000 2010 and 2060 2070 trends in all water balance components across the climate scenarios are shown in fig 5 a as a fraction of annual precipitation streamflow is always the largest component of the water balance representing 83 4 observed 86 1 rcp 4 5 and 86 7 rcp 8 5 of precipitation independent of the climate scenario transpiration represents 6 of annual precipitation meaning it increased in absolute terms in the slightly wetter climate projections by 19 mm for rcp 4 5 and 10 mm for rcp 8 5 the small projected increases in streamflow as a fraction of the water balance in rcp 4 5 and 8 5 can be attributed to reduced evaporation litter canopy and soil evaporation excluding transpiration plus snow sublimation which declines from 10 4 of precipitation observed climate to 7 7 rcp 4 5 and 6 8 rcp 8 5 almost entirely due to lower snowpack and thus sublimation in the warmer climates unsurprisingly the maximum basin averaged snow water equivalent decreases in future climates by 42 mm rcp 4 5 and 146 mm rcp 8 5 relative to observed climate conditions fire excluded in table 2 lower snowfall and snowpack also reduce the fraction of streamflow derived from snowmelt and move the month of peak streamflow earlier for example peak snowmelt occurs in may for 2000 2010 but in april for 2060 2070 in both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in this peak snowmelt month the proportion of streamflow derived from snowmelt declines from a historical maximum of 95 2000 2010 to 83 and 79 2060 2070 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively see appendix fig e 3 a and b notably in this final decade there are no observed trends in subsurface storage δ s in fig 5 a where δ s is the net change in storage over one water year is near zero this means that the differences in water balance across the climate scenarios are exogenously driven rather than arising from non stationarity associated with interannual trends of wetting or drying of the basin lastly the only significant changes in future climate when compared to the observed climate gray shading in table 2 is a 19 mm year increase in transpiration rcp 4 5 climate and a 18 mm year decrease in evaporation rcp 8 5 this lack of significance is associated with high uncertainty of both climate models and hydrological parameters which is a common phenomenon in hydrological models her et al 2019 najafi et al 2011 even if they are not statistically significant there are clear trends in hydrological variables across climate scenarios particularly there is higher transpiration increased streamflow and decreased maximum snow water equivalent for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios compared to the historical baseline table 2 3 2 2 climate historical fire regime this section addresses research question ii which asks how the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies in icb would differ under future climate conditions 2030 2070 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 relative to those outcomes under the observed climate 1970 2010 answering this question repeats the analysis above but including fire under the historical frequency model scenario enabling us to compare the differences in hydrology associated with fire between different climate scenarios these model runs were conducted for both the observed post fire vegetation succession and for bounding cases where all post fire vegetation in high severity burn areas was forced to transition to a single vegetation type these bounding cases suggest that the hydrological changes predicted have low sensitivity to the type of vegetation regrowing in high severity burn areas fig 2 subsurface storage and streamflow were almost entirely insensitive to the vegetation transitions prescribed regardless of the future climate scenario and variations in the predicted change in other hydrological variables across vegetation types were on the order of 10 being largest where vegetation was forced to regenerate as conifers a more detailed analysis of the uncertainty due to the prescribed successional trajectories is provided in appendix f but considering this limited sensitivity we focus here on the models using the observed vegetation transitions only detailed results showing water balance components for each scenario are provided in table 2 timeseries results showing how the historical fire regime influenced the trajectory of hydrological variables in the different climates are shown in the first column of fig 6 again we focus the discussion here on the final simulated decade and discuss the magnitude of the differences in the fire induced changes that arise in the different components of the water balance across the climate scenarios for this decade similarly to the fire excluded condition described in section 3 2 1 there are few statistically significant differences between future climate conditions and observed climate under a historical fire regime comparing future climate of 2060 2070 to observed climate of 2000 2010 the only statistically significant differences gray shading in historical frequency rows in table 2 were observed for rcp 4 5 transpiration 16 mm year greater than observed climate and rcp 8 5 evaporation 18 mm year decrease in this paragraph we compare icb s hydrology under historical fire frequency to icb s hydrology under fire excluded conditions though there is little significant difference across climate regimes in a basin experiencing historical fire frequency many changes induced by fire compared to a fire excluded scenario are significant asterisks in table 2 for rcp 4 5 by the final decade of simulation statistically significant declines in transpiration 15 mm year and evaporation 9 mm year are associated with a statistically significant increase in subsurface water storage 34 mm year a statistically significant but small increase in peak snow water equivalent 3 2 mm year and a non significant 23 mm year increase in streamflow for rcp 8 5 historical frequency fire regime results in statistically significant decreases in transpiration 15 mm year and evaporation 6 mm year increases in subsurface water storage 35 mm year and peak snow water equivalent 2 9 mm year and a non significant increase in streamflow 19 mm year the results do suggest that fire management could slow the climatically driven loss of snowpack in the icb although climate warming reduces snowpack there is more snowpack in a given future climate in the context of wildfire compared to fire exclusion table 2 the overall effect of the historical frequency fire regime across all climates is to decrease the relative importance of transpiration and evaporation where transpiration declines by 1 4 1 2 and 1 5 and evaporation declines by 0 7 0 8 and 0 6 for observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climates respectively fig 5 b the decline in precipitation normalized evaporation and transpiration results in an increase of the runoff ratio by 1 91 1 85 and 1 82 for observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climates respectively fire induced change in annual soil storage gain loss is 1 across all climates other indicators of hydrological function in the basin are also similar across the climate scenarios for example most streamflow increases due to fire occur during peak snowmelt regardless of climate scenario see appendix fig e 3 the increases in peak snow water equivalent due to the imposition of fire use are caused by decreases in sublimation and canopy interception see appendix figs e 4 and e 1 again mostly independently of the climate scenario fire use causes snowmelt to become less important as a driver of streamflow snowmelt explains at most 38 47 and 31 of the fire induced change in streamflow for observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climates respectively by 2060 2070 see appendix fig e 3 d e f the impacts of fire use policies on hydrology are more apparent amongst climate scenarios when considering intra annual responses under the observed climate wildfire use causes the greatest change to streamflow relative to fire exclusion during the peak snowmelt months of march through may however wildfire use under future climates significantly increases streamflow relative to fire excluded conditions for the period of october through may for the final decade of simulation little change in streamflow is modeled during the summer months june september in any fire climate scenario appendix fig e 3 d e f the maximum change in transpiration due to fire occurs one month earlier june under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios than it does under observed climate see appendix fig e 2 overall these results suggest that the changes associated with fire use in the icb during the 1970 2010 period are highly comparable to those that would be predicted if the same set of fires and vegetation changes occurred under future climate conditions this is visually evident in the right hand column of fig 6 where trajectories of hydrological change and its confidence interval under different climate scenarios track each other closely for most variables 3 2 3 climate changing fire regimes research question iii asks how sensitive the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies for the 2030 2070 period were to potential increases in fire frequency again we focus on the results for the observed vegetation transitions only detailed results showing water balance components for each scenario are provided in table 2 different fire regimes influence the trajectory of hydrological variables in the different climates as shown in the left hand columns of fig 6 these plots show that the most dramatic effect of the increasing fire frequency is to reduce the time needed to approach a pseudo steady condition which itself is very similar across the climate scenarios since the first wildfire occurrence it takes approximately 13 22 and 30 years to observe maximum changes in most water balance components under the 60 30 and historical fire frequency scenarios respectively these distinctions in timing are most easily observed in the subsurface storage and streamflow plots of fig 6 increasing fire frequency increases the maximum observed changes slightly in the hydrological variables where 60 fire frequency scenario generally results in greatest hydrological change across climate scenarios with the exception of streamflow all water balance variables experience significant change due to fire across all climate and fire regimes by the final simulated decade streamflow increases relative to fire excluded conditions under all scenarios although the increases are significant only for certain climate and fire scenarios for the rcp 4 5 climate scenario streamflow is significantly higher in the final simulated decade of the 30 fire frequency scenario and the last two decades of the 60 fire frequency scenario and in the rcp 8 5 climate scenario streamflow increase is only significant in the third decade 2050 2060 of the 60 fire frequency scenario the decades with significant increases in streamflow due to fire correspond to decades with greater precipitation and decades in which many fire events occur averaging across the final simulated decade the greatest changes between fire scenarios compared to the fire excluded scenario for the same climate are an 18 mm decrease in transpiration rcp 4 5 30 and 11 mm decrease in evaporation rcp 4 5 30 a 29 mm increase in streamflow rcp 4 5 30 a 44 mm increase in subsurface storage rcp 4 5 60 and a 4 1 mm increase in maximum snow water equivalent rcp 4 5 30 with the exception of maximum snowpack the historical fire regime always produced the smallest changes in hydrological variables for each climate type fig 2 the different pace of change across the scenarios is closely related to the rate of change of lai more frequent fires cause a more rapid decline in lai see appendix fig e 1 in the final simulated decade lai had declined by 0 07 and 0 08 for rcp 8 5 and 4 5 climate scenarios respectively historical fire regime by 0 10 and 0 11 30 increase and 0 08 and 0 09 60 relative to the fire excluded cases see appendix table e 1 one possible risk associated with fire use strategies is that by removing vegetation from the icb the peak flow and flood risks might increase noting that the model calibration was not optimized to predict peak flows boisramé et al 2019 we nonetheless examined the largest daily streamflows for each year and how these varied with fire regime and climate forcing the maximum daily flow increased by about 3 2 due to fire in the final simulated decade an increase that did not vary across the different climate and wildfire scenarios and which was not statistically significant relative to model uncertainty see appendix fig e 5 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of fire use on icb hydrology under future climates the modeling efforts presented here suggest that fire use strategies will have a similar impact on the hydrology of the icb under future climates to that which occurred due to the historical fire management from 1972 present namely modest increases in streamflow driven primarily by reductions in vapor fluxes particularly sublimation and evaporation see boisramé et al 2019 for additional detail on fire induced decreases in evaporation and increased subsurface water storage the broad similarity in these outcomes is perhaps unsurprising given the modest changes in water balance predicted for fixed fire suppressed vegetation cover when climate change alone is considered these differences may be increased in models that are able to consider variation in co2 concentration across the future climate scenarios unlike the present model which held co2 constant in all scenarios initiating a fire use strategy in 2030 is predicted to increase streamflow by an average of 19 29 mm year by 2070 relative to maintaining fire exclusion c f a 17 mm year historical increase although the predicted streamflow increases are not always statistically significant given the uncertainties associated with future climate and the hydrological model parameters the drivers of this increase greater snowpack and subsurface storage and reductions in evaporation and transpiration due to fire use relative to fire suppressed conditions are significant in all climate and fire frequency scenarios future applications of fire use strategies in the icb would therefore be likely to increase natural water storage in the basin and may result in increased streamflow increasing fire frequency while maintaining similar spatial fire severity distributions to the historical period has the primary effect of speeding up the rate of change without altering the final hydrological state of the basin greatly the final hydrological state predicted for the icb was largely robust to changes in the post fire vegetation transitions used in the model model scenarios in which highly burned regions transitioned to coniferous forests shrublands or wetlands diverged minimally from each other we did not quantitatively explore the robustness of these final states to our modeling decision to use historical fire areas and severities to represent these elements of future climate but the consequences of these decisions can be qualitatively explored for example the similarity in the final hydrological state of the basin across fire frequency scenarios may be partly attributable to the re use of the same fire perimeters in all scenarios all cases converged on a similar basin averaged lai independently of the fire frequency these fire perimeters do however cover 75 of the vegetated area of icb so that the modeled fires affected most of the area of the icb that can burn however by preventing fire from burning into areas that did not experience a fire in 1970 2010 the modeled fire perimeters may under estimate the maximum vegetation changes which could be induced in icb thus also underestimating the extremes of vegetation and hydrological changes that could be induced by fire on the other hand a scenario where the historical perimeters over estimate fire extent and severity seems probable due to additional fuel reductions consideration of this fuel limitation means the use of historical fire severity in the models is likely an upper bound on future fire severity therefore it is likely that uncertainties in the future fire regime associated with our fire modeling choices are opposite in sign and likely to mitigate each other our work has focused on representing known fire impacts of a frequently burned watershed rather than modeling them and thus introducing additional uncertainty however there is promising work being done coupling rhessys to a fire spread model wmfire which uses rhessys fuel loads and water deficits to model fire spread for a given location kennedy et al 2017 bart et al 2020 both studies have demonstrated that such coupling can re produce realistic historical fire regime characteristics across different eco systems and stand ages without being specifically tuned to do so further validation of this coupled model is needed especially its representation of the sensitivity of fire vegetation feedbacks to a changing climate future work will explore the potential of rhessys wmfire to study fire hydrology vegetation feedbacks in icb while the eco hydrological model used in this study has been successfully validated using a number of streamflow metrics it was not configured to capture high flow events important for flood and erosion management due to the lack of high resolution precipitation and streamflow observations the model also ignores post fire changes to soil properties which could lead to greater overland and streamflow from heightened soil water repellency within these limitations modeling suggests that fire use in the icb would increase peak streamflow by at most 3 2 from fire excluded conditions for all climate and fire regime scenarios this increase is likely under predicted in spite of the limitations on the modeling which mean that results should not be interpreted as a forecast of absolute hydrological behavior in fire affected watersheds like the icb it is important to recognise that the limitations also affect the historical baseline estimates of hydrological change from 1970 2010 similarly to future modeled scenarios thus we can conclude that fire use policies implemented in fire suppressed basins similar to icb and generating similar or more frequent fire regimes would generate similar hydrological co benefits to those experienced to date 4 2 management implications these hydrological co benefits may be an essential component of building an economic case for forest management because the economic investment needed to implement forest management strategies remains an impediment to their uptake gonzález sanchis et al 2019 for instance although the streamflow gains predicted from icb to date are modest on a per area basis in the watershed the additional streamflow gains from icb alone could produce 1 5 2 3 million of hydropower revenue per year and represent a volume equivalent to approximately 5 1 of the city of san francisco s annual water use which itself is worth approximately 6 0 9 2 million in water sales from the san francisco public utility commission detailed calculations in appendix g although the icb does not directly feed the hetch hetchy reservoir that forms san francisco s water supply these figures provide an indication of the potential economic value of even modest local changes in water balance which could be driven by fire use policies of course this value would be offset by the costs of the negative impacts of wildfire on watersheds such as increased erosion and declines in water quality tiedemann et al 1979 smith et al 2011 which should also form part of any economic analysis of wildfire use policies to date there is no evidence of extensive erosion or downstream water quality declines in response to icb wildfires but work to better establish the potential scope of such problems remains needed the icb remains a unique long term experiment on the effects of fire restoration on forests and water balance but policy is shifting to extend fire restoration across the sierra nevada for example current revisions to the land and resource management plans for national forests nf in the southern sierra nevada emphasize fire use for resource benefit over some 69 to 84 of national forest land boisramé et al 2017a estimated that approximately 19 100 km2 of the sierra nevada region is topographically and climatically similar to icb and may be suitable for similar fire use strategies however to achieve similar hydrological outcomes as in icb fire use in other basins would also need to achieve the substantial changes in forest cover that occurred in that basin in the only other basin in the sierra nevada with a multi decadal history of fire use policies sugarloaf creek basin in sequoia kings canyon national park greater fire suppression activity in the recent decades and lower productivity forests have led to a much more modest impact of fire on vegetation than observed in icb stevens et al 2020 the relatively limited sensitivity of predicted hydrological outcomes to climate however suggests that extension of the fire use policy beyond icb to other productive and topographically suitable forests could produce modest but valuable increases in streamflow 5 conclusion downscaling and bias correction of climate projections for icb and their use in the rhessys hydrological model suggest that the modest increases in streamflow estimated to have occurred due to fire use policies in the late 20th early 21st century are likely to be robust to the warmer future climate although the timing and provenance of streamflow shifts earlier in the year and towards rainfall rather than snowmelt these changes are not projected to result in large alterations in annual water balance partitioning to summarize our response to the posed questions i in the absence of fire use policy hydrology of the icb is relatively similar during rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2030 2070 climates and under the observed historical climate of 1970 2010 in terms of annual volumes of various fluxes one notable difference is the reduction of snowpack which leads to lower total evaporation due to a reduction in sublimation in the future climate scenarios ii the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies in icb under future climate conditions are similar to those under observed climate the historical fire frequency regime produces similar reductions in evaporation and transpiration and gains in streamflow across all climates fire induced increase in snowpack partially counteracts climate change induced reductions in snowpack iii considering fuel limited conditions in icb anticipated increases in fire frequency due to ignitions and not fuel availability in the future climate of 2030 2070 will lead to similar hydrologic changes as historic fires but in a shorter timeframe though we provide a broad range of possible fire regime outcomes future work should focus on fully coupling post fire vegetation transitions to climate and hydrology and consequent fire regime more advanced modeling of fire effects on hydrology may be needed as well in addition to wildfire impacts on vegetation removal changes to soil properties are needed to accurately model high intensity precipitation events that have an impact on erosion flooding and water quality rising temperatures and a naturally volatile hydroclimatic setting present ongoing challenges to california s water supply security and forest resilience this study suggests that where self limiting fire behavior as per icb can be anticipated the hydrological co benefits should be considered as part of future fire policy development

4921,reducing the risk of wildfire and increasing the security of water supply from mountain catchments are both urgent priorities in the western us these goals may be synergistic thanks to the reductions in transpiration and fire hazard associated with reducing forest cover data and modeling efforts based on the illilouette creek basin icb in yosemite national park where fire use policies have been implemented to restore wildfire since 1972 suggest that these policies reduced fire hazards and increased annual streamflow production through large changes to landscape scale forest cover and structure expanding fire use strategies through the western us however would mean that any such changes in forest cover and structure would occur in the middle of the 21st century under different fire frequency and climate conditions than experienced in the icb to date it is therefore important to understand if hydrological benefits of fire use are sensitive to anticipated changes in climate and fire frequency here we force an ecohydrological model previously developed for the icb with an ensemble of downscaled future climate predictions to assess the impacts of climate change and fire use strategies on the hydrology of the icb we find that the hydrological impacts of fire use are comparable under observed climate and projected future climates and are largely insensitive to the significant uncertainties regarding post fire successional trajectories for vegetation while expected increases in fire frequency cause minor changes in the basin hydrology the main impact of more frequent fires is to cause the basin to reach peak hydrological change more rapidly 1 introduction mountain watersheds represent a locus of environmental change and vulnerability in the western us the sierra nevada for example produce 9 30 of california s electricity and 60 90 of california s water supply madani and lund 2009 provisioning ecosystem services stephens et al 2020 that supply water to 30 million of the state s residents and support agricultural industries with an estimated value of 50 billion year klausmeyer and fitzgerald 2012 california department of food and agriculture 2019 these watersheds however experience a naturally volatile climate are expected to warm and dry due to climate change and are at increasing risk of disturbance particularly from wildfire which is also expected to increase in severity and frequency in a warmer climate goulden and bales 2019 westerling 2008 this volatility warming drying and increase in fire risk present significant risks to power production tarroja et al 2016 water supply dahm et al 2015 writer et al 2014 human lives calfire 2019a health and infrastructure calfire 2019b biodiversity richter et al 2019 ecosystem services wood and jones 2019 and amenity of the montane landscape millar and stephenson 2015 conventional management approaches are unlikely to be able to address these joint threats for example the costs of fire suppression and firefighting in california are growing exponentially reaching 950 million usd in 2018 calfire 2019c with reparation costs in the billions of dollars thomas et al 2017 consequently foresters and catchment managers are seeking alternative management paradigms for fire prone montane forests stephens et al 2020 one option is to adopt a fire use policy also known as managed wildfire for watershed management fire use policies allow lightning ignited wildfires to burn subject to a strict management policy that calls for intervention to suppress fire when air quality structures or people are placed at risk van wagtendonk 2007 in part this policy attempts to restore the natural fire regime in western us forests reversing the more than one hundred years of fire suppression in the region fire suppression has altered contemporary forests relative to their pre european settlement condition such that fuel loads the prevalence of shade tolerant and fire intolerant species and density of forest vegetation have all increased relative to historical baselines collins and stephens 2007 van wagtendonk et al 2012 scholl and taylor 2010 stephens et al 2015 although interest in adopting fire use strategies is growing stephens et al 2016 there have been relatively few locations where they have been implemented for long enough to assess their effects within the sierra nevada the illilouette creek basin icb in yosemite national park ca collins and stephens 2007 has experienced 29 fires larger than 40 ha since 1972 when 100 years of fire exclusion and suppression in the basin ended van wagtendonk et al 2012 icb is located in proximity to long term weather stations and is gauged shortly downstream of its confluence with the upper merced river these unique characteristics have made it the subject of ongoing research to establish the ecological and hydrological effects of fire use policies e g collins and stephens 2007 ponisio et al 2016 boisramé et al 2017a 2018 2019 hydrologically the impact of fire use strategies in the icb has been to increase streamflow production and expand wet environments boisramé et al 2017a 2019 changes to the water balance of the basin inferred using the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys suggest that annual transpiration has decreased by up to 30 mm peak snowpack depth increased by up to 10 mm of snow water equivalent swe annual discharge has increased by up to 40 mm year in the fire affected section of the watershed or approximately 5 25 mm year overall and storage of water in the soil and groundwater referred to as subsurface storage hereafter has increased by an average of 60 mm boisramé et al 2019 these changes although modest are comparable to inference of increased streamflow subsurface storage and snowpack and decreased evapotranspiration following wildfires in the consumnes watershed in the sierra nevada maina and siirila woodburn 2019 such post fire wetting occurs against a background of warming and drying in the sierra nevada and could represent a positive hydrological co benefit relevant to the social and economic case for fire use policies c f gonzález sanchis et al 2019 expanding wildland fire use policies to other locations involves confronting the long timescales on which the forests adjust to changed fire regimes stevens et al 2020 these timescales mean that changes in fire management policy implemented in the near future would impact forests and their hydrology during the mid 21st century in comparison to the late 20th century when most of the changes occurred in the icb thus before attempting to use the hydrological insights gained from the icb to inform contemporary forest management decisions it is pertinent to ask whether the hydrological outcomes of wildland fire use are sensitive to the changes in climate expected by the mid 21st century although assessments of the hydrological impact of climatic extremes on watersheds in the western us suggest that the increases in streamflow due to wildfire dwarf the reductions predicted due to climate change by 2050 wine et al 2018 many uncertainties surround these predictions including variable effects of post fire vegetation growth rates and the impact of different fire regimes on water balance tague et al 2019 poorly understood post fire vegetation successional trajectories in a changed climate and uncertainties surrounding the future fire regime itself by the mid 21st century the sierra nevada region is projected to be warmer to experience similar or slightly elevated precipitation inputs dettinger 2005 pierce et al 2013 and more frequent fires than in the 1972 present period westerling 2008 yue et al 2013 geos institute 2013 multiple studies agree that warmer conditions will dry fuels and increase fire frequency severity and extent e g westerling 2008 2018 littell et al 2009 but recent re appraisals of this work in the sierra nevada suggest that fire frequency in future climates is over estimated because projections have ignored the effects of fuel limitation hurteau et al 2019 additional complexities including non stationary relationships between drought and fire occurrence across climate gradients mckenzie and littell 2017 and feedbacks between fire extent vegetation dynamics and distributions syphard et al 2018 mean there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future fire regime so much that syphard et al 2018 concluded that there was no way to ascertain which projections of fire are most feasible compounding uncertainties about future fire regimes is the hard to predict successional trajectory of vegetation post fire and the interaction of these trajectories with a non stationary climate lenihan et al 2003 steel et al 2015 cornwell et al 2012 batllori et al 2015 rapid vegetation transitions from conifer forests to shrubland are associated with the loss of tree seed banks which limits forest regeneration within large patches of high severity fire meng et al 2015 young et al 2019 and with arid post fire conditions that create unfavorable growth conditions for many forest species davis et al 2019 shrublands regenerate rapidly after a fire and have a greater tolerance for arid conditions lauvaux et al 2016 serra diaz et al 2018 baudena et al 2019 in the absence of high severity fires forest succession occurs on timescales of multiple decades halofsky et al 2018 liang et al 2016 and fire excluded forests are hypothesized to lie near tipping points where disturbances could cause significant changes in vegetation composition batllori et al 2018 this literature suggests that the potential range of post fire vegetation transitions is poorly bounded fully predicting the effects of wildland fire use on hydrologic regimes under future climates would require unraveling these uncertain processes to specify the feedbacks between vegetation water fire risk and successional dynamics a highly challenging problem brotons and duane 2019 riley et al 2019 we therefore do not directly address this problem for the specific case of the icb but instead adopt a set of simplifying assumptions which are further developed and justified in the methods section i we use standard approaches to predicting future climate in icb by downscaling and bias correction of an ensemble of global circulation models lanzante et al 2019 luo et al 2018 ii we assume that the characteristics of the fire regime that would arise if applied to fire suppressed forests in 2030 2070 are well represented by the severity area distribution of the historical fires that occurred in icb from 1972 2010 and we allow for the frequency of these fires to increase across a set of scenarios drawn from the literature and considering climate impacts on frequency only see section 2 4 for details specifically the assumptions keep severity and fire area constant and therefore do not account for possible feedbacks between these aspects of fire climate and vegetation finally iii we assess the hydrological implications of climate change on fire impacts under two vegetation scenarios one in which post fire vegetation transitions match those which occurred in the historical period a scenario which might arise if for example topography and geological context primarily drive vegetation community types and one bounding case scenario in which we force all post fire vegetation regeneration to occur as a single plant type conifers shrublands or wet meadows assuming that reality would lie in between these extreme limits of vegetation change with these assumptions we use an existing rhessys model parameterization for the icb boisramé et al 2019 to answer three questions i how would the hydrology of the icb respond to climate change in the absence of the fire use policy where vegetation remains in a fire excluded state ii how do the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies in icb differ under future climate conditions 2030 2070 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 relative to those outcomes under the observed climate 1970 2010 and iii how sensitive are the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies for the 2030 2070 period to potential increases in fire frequency 2 methods 2 1 study site illilouette creek basin icb is located within yosemite national park california usa fig 1 the 150 km2 basin spans an elevation range of 1 270 3 600 meters with a mean elevation of 2 500 meters about 41 of the icb is forested with pinus jeffreyi abies concolor abies magnifica and pinus contorta interspersed with meadows 16 and shrubland 9 about 34 of the basin is high elevation granite which acts to confine fires to the basin boisramé et al 2017b collins et al 2009 icb experiences a mediterranean climate with warm dry summers and cool wet winters the nearest weather station is located in yosemite valley 1 240 meters 37 74 lat 119 59 lon cdec station yyv and has operated since 1926 over 1970 2010 this station recorded a mean annual precipitation of 92 0 cm mean daily minimum january temperature of 2 c and mean daily maximum july temperature of 27 c the icb has similar precipitation totals to yosemite valley but is approximately 7 c cooler january 2015 to december 2017 appendix fig b 1 leading to a greater fraction of precipitation falling as snowfall while streamflow data for the icb itself are limited the basin comprises 33 of the upper merced river basin which has a century long streamflow record at the happy isles gauge located downstream of the confluence of the illilouette creek with the upper merced river fig 1 boisramé et al 2019 the mean flow at happy isles was 10 m3 sec 71 cm year for 1970 2010 usgs gauge 11264500 data from waterdata usgs gov during the period from 1700 1900 prior to fire suppression icb had a fire return interval of 6 3 years following the initiation of fire use strategies the fire return interval was 6 8 years from 1972 2005 similar to the pre exclusion era collins and stephens 2007 from 1972 to 2019 there were 29 fires greater than 40 ha in icb of which 1 was human caused 1986 burned 291 ha 1 was prescribed 1999 54 ha and the other 27 fires were lightning ignited van wagtendonk et al 2012 of the 8187 ha burned in icb 75 of the watershed s vegetated area 4463 ha 55 burned twice 767 ha 9 three times 72 ha 1 four times and 4 ha 1 five times fig 1 as shown in fig 2 this high wildfire activity in icb has doubled the area of dense and sparse meadows in the basin boisramé et al 2017b 2018 increased landscape heterogeneity and habitat for multiple plant and animal species and is associated with increased biodiversity ponisio et al 2016 campos et al 2017 stephens et al 2019 the contemporary 1972 present fire regime in the icb has been relatively stationary fig 3 following the initiation of fire use strategies the fires were relatively small in area with low to moderate burn severities as assessed by landsat derived indices where the relative difference normalized vegetation index rdndvi was used prior to 1984 and the relative difference normalized burn ratio rdnbr post 1984 collins et al 2009 both burn severities fig 3 a and burn areas fig 3 b in the icb are more stable in the contemporary period than in the surrounding sierra nevada where fire severity and area have both increased fire perimeters in the icb indicate that fires in the basin are self limiting collins et al 2009 2 2 rhessys model the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys version 5 20 1 is a spatially distributed ecohydrological model that simulates water energy and vegetation growth processes it represents landscapes through a hierarchy of spatial units small areas of uniform soil and vegetation are represented as patches water is routed between patches within hillslopes and basin scale processes arise from water fluxes and stores aggregated across hillslopes the ability of rhessys to simulate climatic hydrological and vegetation growth processes at a basin scale makes it well suited to simulating the effects of disturbance such as fire on water balance at the patch scale rhessys resolves a detailed vertical energy and water balance the energy balance is forced by shortwave radiation inputs varied to account for slope aspect topographic shading and seasonality other energy flux terms and wind speeds are attenuated through vegetation canopies as a function of leaf area index lai which itself changes dynamically as the vegetation grows incoming precipitation is intercepted by canopy and litter layers and is partitioned between infiltration via green and ampt 1911 and surface detention storage which contributes to runoff if sufficiently large at the soil surface vapor fluxes include evaporation or sublimation from all vertical layers and transpiration separately computed from sunlit and shaded canopy layers all computed using the penman monteith approach monteith 1965 infiltrated water is routed between a root zone an unsaturated and saturated zone based on darcy relationships and soil parameters and lateral fluxes of water between spatially explicit patches are resolved based on surface topography and calibrated drainage parameters in addition to specifying lai growth rates species specific plant properties control maximum stomatal conductance values and their response to changing soil water a more detailed description of the rhessys model is provided in tague and band 2004 boisramé et al 2019 implemented rhessys in the icb drawing on lidar elevation data at 10 m resolution kane et al 2015 a vegetation analysis boisramé et al 2017a that used aerial photos and the yosemite national park vegetation mapping to delineate six cover types daily weather data from the yosemite headquarters weather station and flow records at happy isles gauge and a short flow record within the illilouette creek the six cover types are conifer forest aspen populus tremuloides shrub primarily ceanothus cordulatus wet meadow dense grasses and forbs dry grassland sparsely vegetated areas dominated by grasses or unvegetated exposed rock or sand the model was calibrated to identify behavioral parameter ensembles consisting of i temperature and precipitation lapse rates ii decay of hydraulic conductivity with depth iii saturated hydraulic conductivity at the land surface iv depth of hydrologically active water storage across soil and saprolite layers v the proportion of saturated soil water routed directly via preferential flow paths to deeper groundwater stores below plant root access and vi the proportion of these deeper groundwater stores draining to the stream each day rhessys captures spatial variations in subsurface properties across soil types by scaling them using mapped soil categories for the icb calibration was performed against happy isles flow data and identified an ensemble of 93 behavioral parameter sets assessed across a multi objective set of criteria aiming to capture volume and timing of streamflow on monthly seasonal and annual scales that were used to constrain model uncertainty using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 1992 more details regarding the parameterization calibration and validation of rhessys for the icb are provided in boisramé et al 2019 2 3 modeling the effect of an individual fire individual fires in rhessys were defined based on fire perimeter and severity maps fires were treated as having an instantaneous effect on vegetation biomass on the thickness of the litter layer and on the species specific properties of the vegetation to represent post fire vegetation transitions these factors drive subsequent hydrological responses in rhessys wildfires can however have other hydrologically relevant effects that were omitted from the model including reduced albedo from charred surfaces burles and boon 2011 gleason et al 2013 2019 changes in the size and distribution of canopy gaps stevens 2017 kostadinov et al 2019 lundquist et al 2013 reduced soil infiltration capacity due to ash clogging or soil hydrophobicity neary et al 2005 ebel and moody 2020 doerr et al 2006 and increased erosion rates larsen et al 2009 in the icb low moderate severity fires are most common rather than the high severity fires that generate persistent changes in soil properties doerr et al 2006 and water quality monitoring at the happy isles gauge indicates no increases in turbidity or flow peaks post fire results not shown the reliance of our modeling on spatially uniform daily precipitation although necessary given lack of more resolved precipitation data for the merced river basin henn et al 2018 would likely prevent the model from resolving surface flow events that might arise due to soil changes consequently the model which was calibrated to optimize long timescale water balance predictions may under estimate peak flow occurrences particularly immediately post fire fire severity was used to determine the degree of biomass and litter loss in each fire affected patch the threshold approach of miller and thode 2007 was used to relate rdndvi rdnbr observations to fire severity in icb following collins et al 2009 we considered three classes of change i for rdnbr and rdndvi values between 69 and 315 low severity only litter stores were removed ii for values between 315 and 640 moderate severity in addition to litter removal plant carbon stores were reduced 50 iii for values greater than 640 high severity all carbon and litter layers were removed within the fire perimeter additionally if analysis of aerial photos indicated a change in vegetation cover type following a fire we mapped these patches also as high severity burn areas where high severity fire occurred all above ground vegetation carbon and litter stores were set to zero and modeled vegetation was allowed to immediately regrow dynamically to account for the possibility of a post fire cover type transition we reset the vegetation parameters in these patches to represent one of two scenarios in one scenario individual pixels followed the observed historical successional trajectory that occurred in the 1972 2010 setting in the other scenario pixels that burned at high severity were forced to regenerate with a single vegetation type all forest all shrub or all wetland this bounding cases scenario was used to constrain the uncertainty in the hydrological projections that arises due to unknown patterns of future post fire regeneration under the assumption that enforcing a single vegetation type provides a limiting case the bounding case scenarios were run for the historical fire regime only 2 4 using 1972 2010 fire data to define potential future fire regimes the characteristics of the fire regime that has prevailed in icb since 1972 are illustrated in fig 3 which shows rdndvi and rdnbr distributions fire return interval and area of all fires over 40 ha note that the most recent fire the empire fire of 2017 the only fire after 2010 is not shown on this figure it was omitted from this study due to a lack of data about post fire vegetation type and condition however as illustrated in the appendix section c the empire fire was similar to previous fires in size and severity these data are suggestive of a relatively stable fire regime consistent with the self limiting behavior of fire in the icb defining the spatial temporal and severity characteristics of potential future fire regime is as the literature reviewed in the introduction suggests inherently uncertain in light of these uncertainties and the stability of the fire regime in the icb over five decades of climatic and vegetation change we use the observed fire perimeters and severity maps to define potential future fire areas and severities with the historical fire perimeters providing some control on fuel limitation warmer temperatures are expected to increase the probability of ignition by decreasing fuel moisture leading to increased fire occurrence riley and loehman 2016 westerling 2008 lauvaux et al 2016 to explore the effects of changing fire frequency we shortened the time interval in days between historical fires by 30 and 60 in line with predictions for the sierra nevada based on climatic warming riley and loehman 2016 westerling 2008 lauvaux et al 2016 this had the effect of some fire perimeter severity combinations being imposed twice in the modeled record for the 30 increase in fire frequency scenario 30 these were the fires from 1974 and 1978 for the 60 scenario the fires from 1974 1978 1980 1981 1986 1988 and 1990 were imposed twice as can be seen visually in fig 3 these fires are broadly representative of the range of fires in the icb i e we did not repeat extreme cases we checked if these increases were reasonable in light of the minimum time needed to allow fuel to build up and reburn in the icb estimated as approximately 9 years collins et al 2009 for a 60 increase in fire frequency scenario 60 the average interval between reusing a given fire perimeter is 24 years and the average interval between pixels reburning is 7 years suggesting that this increase represents a reasonable fuel limited maximum for the basin using a historical fire occurrence record as a basis for increasing fire frequency can lead to a situation where a fire is predicted to occur outside the fire season historically observed to be june september in the icb if this projected timing was such that the fire occurred in the window of april 1st to october 31st a period that we confirmed is snow free in all modeled future climate scenarios we allowed the fire to burn on that projected date in line with the expected lengthening of the regional fire season yue et al 2013 if however the projected fire date lay outside this seasonal range it was assigned a random date from the nearest fire season the approach of using historical fire perimeters to define the future fire regime omits exploration of other future fire scenarios for example scenarios in which the severity area of fires changes dramatically using historical fire perimeters does not allow a fully comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty in hydrological predictions associated with the specific sequence of fires it does not explore a situation in which fire frequency is reduced in the basin relative to historical conditions although the fact that three fires were suppressed during the california drought 2011 2016 this is likely responsible for the large fire free interval before the empire fire in 2017 suggests that reduced fire frequency regime could be a possible outcome within the future climate given these limitations our goal is not to be predictive but rather to determine if the hydrological responses to this sequence of historically managed fires or to a sped up version of this sequence of fires are the same as they were under historical climate conditions 2 5 future climate data and bias correction ensembles of climate model predictions are widely recognized as being essential to characterize the uncertainty surrounding future climates pierce et al 2009 hagedorn et al 2005 thompson 1977 since too few regional climate models are available over the icb to generate such an ensemble we downscaled the minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation output of 10 gcms using data from the cell ranging from 0 75 2 8 degrees latitude and longitude containing the icb for the 2030 2070 period in selecting 10 models we followed the recommendations of pierce et al 2009 who suggested that climate ensembles became stable after 5 or more models are included the gcms we selected were access1 3 canesm2 cmcc cm csiro mk3 6 0 gfdl esm2m inm cm4 ipsl cm5a mr miroc5 mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m appendix fig b 2 provides additional descriptions of each model these models were chosen to maximize model skill and model independence as computed by sanderson et al 2017 and to cover a range of predicted future climate extremes i e to include models that predict both cooler wetter futures in the region and those that predict hotter drier conditions all model data were obtained from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 and have the same initializations realizations and parameterization states abbreviated as r1i1p1 in cmip5 we obtained future climate timeseries from both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios where rcp 4 5 scenario represents a decline in greenhouse emissions around year 2040 and rcp 8 5 is a business as usual scenario with a continuous rise in greenhouse emissions both scenarios predict a global rise in temperature choosing temperature and precipitation data of the single gcm grid point containing icb we used quantile delta mapping qdm mbc package in r to bias correct the gcm data and downscale it to the location of the yosemite headquarters weather station qdm is a non parametric method to correct systematic modeled biases with respect to observed values while preserving model projected relative changes in precipitation and temperature quantiles cannon et al 2015 in addition to modeled observed and future climate timeseries qdm requires observed climate observations which we obtained from the yosemite headquarters weather station and gap filled via multivariate imputation mice package in r and data from adjacent weather stations see appendix section b we bias corrected the daily precipitation and the daily maximum and minimum temperatures for 2030 2070 treating the historical period 1970 2010 as static during a static period the distribution of climatic variables does not change significantly for any decade qdm was then used to superimpose the modeled quantile trends delta changes onto the observed static period the delta changes were applied multiplicatively to the precipitation correction and additively to the temperature corrections cannon et al 2015 the resulting bias corrected model timeseries form the climate ensemble were used to drive rhessys modeling the timeseries were summarized in terms of rainfall temperature snowfall and snow season statistics across the ensemble these quantities are important determinants of the length of the fire season and basin hydrology although co2 concentrations are predicted to rise in the future climate due to model limitations they are held constant across all model simulations 2 6 model experiments the model experiments were set up to answer the research questions prior to conducting the model experiments rhessys was initialized with the 1969 fire excluded vegetation map which was spun up for a few hundred years using observed historical climate repeated time series starting from no carbon stores and until lai reached a steady state boisramé et al 2019 then prior to the future climate simulations 2030 2070 for each rcp scenario the 1969 fire excluded and spun up vegetation was further spun up using the 2020 2030 climate research question i asks how changing climate would alter the hydrology of the fire excluded icb assuming vegetation was initialized in the same state as was observed in 1969 to answer this question we held vegetation type constant and ran rhessys for 40 years using the observed 1970 2010 climate and for the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 future 2030 2070 climates see fig 4 differences in the predictions can be interpreted as the impact of climate on vegetation and hydrology in the absence of changes imposed by fire research question ii addresses the differences in how wildland fire use affects icb hydrology under future versus observed climates to answer this question we ran rhessys for a 40 year period using the observed 1970 2010 climate and for the future climate ensemble for the period 2030 2070 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for each of these climates we ran a control model representing fire excluded conditions based on the 1969 vegetation map fig 2 a with no fire disturbance imposed fire excluded we also ran a treatment model in which fire disturbance was imposed based on the observed historical 1970 2010 fire regime historical frequency and updated vegetation maps after fires using both the observed post fire vegetation transitions and the bounding cases where all vegetation transitions to specific cover types the differences in hydrological predictions between control and treatment models can be attributed to the effects of fire on vegetation and litter the differences in these differences sensu angrist and pischke 2008 can be attributed to the role of different climates interacting with the fires research question iii is addressed by repeating this analysis using the higher frequency fire regimes in combination with the future climate scenarios fig 4 however in this case only historical vegetation transitions were modeled again the fire excluded landscape was modeled across all climate regimes as a control differences between control and treatment can again be attributed to the role of fire rhessys output was generated on daily timescales at the scale of the entire illilouette creek basin the analysis focuses on streamflow vertically aggregated depth of saturated and unsaturated groundwater storage subsurface storage snow water equivalent swe snow sublimation lai evaporation and transpiration these variables were aggregated to water year to visualise long term fire effects all results were reported as a depth of water with basin scale fluxes normalized by the basin area 150 km2 however in interpreting these results it is important to recall that all changes in basin scale hydrology were derived from fire induced changes that occurred in at most 75 112 km2 of the watershed if considering how the observed changes in icb might play out in other watersheds it may be more appropriate to weigh these changes by fire affected area in each basin heterogeneity in hydrological processes should also be considered for example only approximately 52 of the streamflow in icb is generated in the area that burned and the remaining 48 is generated on high elevation rock and is largely uninfluenced by downgradient vegetation condition snowpack dynamics are also highly spatially variable with these spatial patterns shifting greatly between climate scenarios these variations are masked in the whole of basin averaging used to present hydrological change in this study but analysis of heterogeneity in hydrological response to fire is beyond the scope of this manuscript 2 7 uncertainty analysis recognizing that the scenarios modeled do not fully bound the range of possible fire climate vegetation interactions our uncertainty analysis follows the glue approach to constrain the combination of uncertainty due to climate projections and hydrological parameter uncertainty each hydrological model experiment consisted of running the 93 highest performing calibration parameter ensembles in conjunction with the 10 climate model ensemble members thus each combination of a future climate scenario rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 and a fire scenario exclusion observed historical 30 or 60 generated an ensemble of 930 modeled timeseries for each variable 93 rhessys model parameterizations times 10 climate models this ensemble formed the basis for uncertainty analyses in general the question we were asking was related to the significance relative to parameter and climate model uncertainty of differences in predicted values of any hydrological variable between two scenarios to compute this significance we differenced model output from equivalent ensemble members having the same combination of driving climate model and rhessys model parameters from the two scenarios of interest this generated a set of 930 differences except in the case where fire scenarios were compared for the observed climate when 93 differences result the 95 confidence interval was then specified as the interval between the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles for these 930 differences if this interval excluded zero the difference was considered significant at the 95 confidence level see appendix d for a mathematical formulation of how the ensemble of differences was calculated 3 results 3 1 future climate table 1 shows climate statistics aggregated by decade for the 4 decades of simulation where decades 1 2 3 and 4 correspond to the historical time periods of 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and future time periods of 2031 2040 2041 2050 2051 2060 2061 2070 respectively by considering output on this decadal basis we can better compare between climates based on the common time since first fire first fire occurs in 1974 for the historical modeling and 2034 for future model scenarios each decadal value shown is based on the average of the 10 gcm models following downscaling and bias correction all results discussed below refer to comparisons between 1970 2010 historical averages and 2030 2070 future climate simulations by 2060 2070 icb will warm by 2 2 c under rcp 4 5 and by 3 1 c under rcp 8 5 climate scenarios predicted annual precipitation totals in both scenarios are slightly wetter than the historically observed record the 2030 2070 rcp 4 5 climate on average receives 159 mm more precipitation per year than the 1970 2010 period while rcp 8 5 receives 32 mm more the historically observed precipitation lies within the 95 uncertainty bounds of both future climate ensembles meaning that some models predict a drier and others a wetter future climate ensemble averaged precipitation under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios exhibits much less inter annual variability than do historical observations see appendix fig b 3 a which is a result of averaging over the ensemble the rcp 8 5 climate ensemble distributions of daily precipitation show an increase in extreme events when compared to the historically observed precipitation distribution see appendix fig b 4 higher average temperatures with similar total precipitation result in a shorter snow season on average by 2060 2070 the snow season length drops by 26 days for rcp 4 5 and 43 days for rcp 8 5 climates additionally and again due to the warmer temperatures the snow fraction of precipitation precipitation falling as snow declines for future climates historically 60 70 of precipitation in icb occurred as snowfall and this percentage falls to 49 rcp 4 5 and 42 rcp 8 5 by 2060 2070 3 2 hydrological outcomes of wildfires to understand the hydrological outcomes of wildfire we considered multiple hydrological variables at the annual scale transpiration evaporation streamflow subsurface storage and maximum snow water equivalent and their mean values across all model parameter sets and climate ensemble members we averaged the value of these variables on decadal timescales and table 2 shows these decadal averages for the observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios for the four fire regimes fire excluded historical fire frequency and 30 and 60 fire frequency the analysis of the results is broken down based on the model scenarios showing the changes in hydrology due to 1 climate only 2 climate in combination with the historical wildland fire use regime and 3 climate combined with hypothetical higher frequency fire regimes 3 2 1 climate only answering research question i isolates the influence of climate on hydrology if vegetation was to remain in a fire excluded state overall other than expected but statistically non significant decreases in snowpack the different climate scenarios cause only minimal changes in predicted icb hydrology at annual timescales to discuss these changes we focus on the final decade of simulation i e 2000 2010 and 2060 2070 trends in all water balance components across the climate scenarios are shown in fig 5 a as a fraction of annual precipitation streamflow is always the largest component of the water balance representing 83 4 observed 86 1 rcp 4 5 and 86 7 rcp 8 5 of precipitation independent of the climate scenario transpiration represents 6 of annual precipitation meaning it increased in absolute terms in the slightly wetter climate projections by 19 mm for rcp 4 5 and 10 mm for rcp 8 5 the small projected increases in streamflow as a fraction of the water balance in rcp 4 5 and 8 5 can be attributed to reduced evaporation litter canopy and soil evaporation excluding transpiration plus snow sublimation which declines from 10 4 of precipitation observed climate to 7 7 rcp 4 5 and 6 8 rcp 8 5 almost entirely due to lower snowpack and thus sublimation in the warmer climates unsurprisingly the maximum basin averaged snow water equivalent decreases in future climates by 42 mm rcp 4 5 and 146 mm rcp 8 5 relative to observed climate conditions fire excluded in table 2 lower snowfall and snowpack also reduce the fraction of streamflow derived from snowmelt and move the month of peak streamflow earlier for example peak snowmelt occurs in may for 2000 2010 but in april for 2060 2070 in both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in this peak snowmelt month the proportion of streamflow derived from snowmelt declines from a historical maximum of 95 2000 2010 to 83 and 79 2060 2070 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively see appendix fig e 3 a and b notably in this final decade there are no observed trends in subsurface storage δ s in fig 5 a where δ s is the net change in storage over one water year is near zero this means that the differences in water balance across the climate scenarios are exogenously driven rather than arising from non stationarity associated with interannual trends of wetting or drying of the basin lastly the only significant changes in future climate when compared to the observed climate gray shading in table 2 is a 19 mm year increase in transpiration rcp 4 5 climate and a 18 mm year decrease in evaporation rcp 8 5 this lack of significance is associated with high uncertainty of both climate models and hydrological parameters which is a common phenomenon in hydrological models her et al 2019 najafi et al 2011 even if they are not statistically significant there are clear trends in hydrological variables across climate scenarios particularly there is higher transpiration increased streamflow and decreased maximum snow water equivalent for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios compared to the historical baseline table 2 3 2 2 climate historical fire regime this section addresses research question ii which asks how the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies in icb would differ under future climate conditions 2030 2070 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 relative to those outcomes under the observed climate 1970 2010 answering this question repeats the analysis above but including fire under the historical frequency model scenario enabling us to compare the differences in hydrology associated with fire between different climate scenarios these model runs were conducted for both the observed post fire vegetation succession and for bounding cases where all post fire vegetation in high severity burn areas was forced to transition to a single vegetation type these bounding cases suggest that the hydrological changes predicted have low sensitivity to the type of vegetation regrowing in high severity burn areas fig 2 subsurface storage and streamflow were almost entirely insensitive to the vegetation transitions prescribed regardless of the future climate scenario and variations in the predicted change in other hydrological variables across vegetation types were on the order of 10 being largest where vegetation was forced to regenerate as conifers a more detailed analysis of the uncertainty due to the prescribed successional trajectories is provided in appendix f but considering this limited sensitivity we focus here on the models using the observed vegetation transitions only detailed results showing water balance components for each scenario are provided in table 2 timeseries results showing how the historical fire regime influenced the trajectory of hydrological variables in the different climates are shown in the first column of fig 6 again we focus the discussion here on the final simulated decade and discuss the magnitude of the differences in the fire induced changes that arise in the different components of the water balance across the climate scenarios for this decade similarly to the fire excluded condition described in section 3 2 1 there are few statistically significant differences between future climate conditions and observed climate under a historical fire regime comparing future climate of 2060 2070 to observed climate of 2000 2010 the only statistically significant differences gray shading in historical frequency rows in table 2 were observed for rcp 4 5 transpiration 16 mm year greater than observed climate and rcp 8 5 evaporation 18 mm year decrease in this paragraph we compare icb s hydrology under historical fire frequency to icb s hydrology under fire excluded conditions though there is little significant difference across climate regimes in a basin experiencing historical fire frequency many changes induced by fire compared to a fire excluded scenario are significant asterisks in table 2 for rcp 4 5 by the final decade of simulation statistically significant declines in transpiration 15 mm year and evaporation 9 mm year are associated with a statistically significant increase in subsurface water storage 34 mm year a statistically significant but small increase in peak snow water equivalent 3 2 mm year and a non significant 23 mm year increase in streamflow for rcp 8 5 historical frequency fire regime results in statistically significant decreases in transpiration 15 mm year and evaporation 6 mm year increases in subsurface water storage 35 mm year and peak snow water equivalent 2 9 mm year and a non significant increase in streamflow 19 mm year the results do suggest that fire management could slow the climatically driven loss of snowpack in the icb although climate warming reduces snowpack there is more snowpack in a given future climate in the context of wildfire compared to fire exclusion table 2 the overall effect of the historical frequency fire regime across all climates is to decrease the relative importance of transpiration and evaporation where transpiration declines by 1 4 1 2 and 1 5 and evaporation declines by 0 7 0 8 and 0 6 for observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climates respectively fig 5 b the decline in precipitation normalized evaporation and transpiration results in an increase of the runoff ratio by 1 91 1 85 and 1 82 for observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climates respectively fire induced change in annual soil storage gain loss is 1 across all climates other indicators of hydrological function in the basin are also similar across the climate scenarios for example most streamflow increases due to fire occur during peak snowmelt regardless of climate scenario see appendix fig e 3 the increases in peak snow water equivalent due to the imposition of fire use are caused by decreases in sublimation and canopy interception see appendix figs e 4 and e 1 again mostly independently of the climate scenario fire use causes snowmelt to become less important as a driver of streamflow snowmelt explains at most 38 47 and 31 of the fire induced change in streamflow for observed rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climates respectively by 2060 2070 see appendix fig e 3 d e f the impacts of fire use policies on hydrology are more apparent amongst climate scenarios when considering intra annual responses under the observed climate wildfire use causes the greatest change to streamflow relative to fire exclusion during the peak snowmelt months of march through may however wildfire use under future climates significantly increases streamflow relative to fire excluded conditions for the period of october through may for the final decade of simulation little change in streamflow is modeled during the summer months june september in any fire climate scenario appendix fig e 3 d e f the maximum change in transpiration due to fire occurs one month earlier june under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios than it does under observed climate see appendix fig e 2 overall these results suggest that the changes associated with fire use in the icb during the 1970 2010 period are highly comparable to those that would be predicted if the same set of fires and vegetation changes occurred under future climate conditions this is visually evident in the right hand column of fig 6 where trajectories of hydrological change and its confidence interval under different climate scenarios track each other closely for most variables 3 2 3 climate changing fire regimes research question iii asks how sensitive the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies for the 2030 2070 period were to potential increases in fire frequency again we focus on the results for the observed vegetation transitions only detailed results showing water balance components for each scenario are provided in table 2 different fire regimes influence the trajectory of hydrological variables in the different climates as shown in the left hand columns of fig 6 these plots show that the most dramatic effect of the increasing fire frequency is to reduce the time needed to approach a pseudo steady condition which itself is very similar across the climate scenarios since the first wildfire occurrence it takes approximately 13 22 and 30 years to observe maximum changes in most water balance components under the 60 30 and historical fire frequency scenarios respectively these distinctions in timing are most easily observed in the subsurface storage and streamflow plots of fig 6 increasing fire frequency increases the maximum observed changes slightly in the hydrological variables where 60 fire frequency scenario generally results in greatest hydrological change across climate scenarios with the exception of streamflow all water balance variables experience significant change due to fire across all climate and fire regimes by the final simulated decade streamflow increases relative to fire excluded conditions under all scenarios although the increases are significant only for certain climate and fire scenarios for the rcp 4 5 climate scenario streamflow is significantly higher in the final simulated decade of the 30 fire frequency scenario and the last two decades of the 60 fire frequency scenario and in the rcp 8 5 climate scenario streamflow increase is only significant in the third decade 2050 2060 of the 60 fire frequency scenario the decades with significant increases in streamflow due to fire correspond to decades with greater precipitation and decades in which many fire events occur averaging across the final simulated decade the greatest changes between fire scenarios compared to the fire excluded scenario for the same climate are an 18 mm decrease in transpiration rcp 4 5 30 and 11 mm decrease in evaporation rcp 4 5 30 a 29 mm increase in streamflow rcp 4 5 30 a 44 mm increase in subsurface storage rcp 4 5 60 and a 4 1 mm increase in maximum snow water equivalent rcp 4 5 30 with the exception of maximum snowpack the historical fire regime always produced the smallest changes in hydrological variables for each climate type fig 2 the different pace of change across the scenarios is closely related to the rate of change of lai more frequent fires cause a more rapid decline in lai see appendix fig e 1 in the final simulated decade lai had declined by 0 07 and 0 08 for rcp 8 5 and 4 5 climate scenarios respectively historical fire regime by 0 10 and 0 11 30 increase and 0 08 and 0 09 60 relative to the fire excluded cases see appendix table e 1 one possible risk associated with fire use strategies is that by removing vegetation from the icb the peak flow and flood risks might increase noting that the model calibration was not optimized to predict peak flows boisramé et al 2019 we nonetheless examined the largest daily streamflows for each year and how these varied with fire regime and climate forcing the maximum daily flow increased by about 3 2 due to fire in the final simulated decade an increase that did not vary across the different climate and wildfire scenarios and which was not statistically significant relative to model uncertainty see appendix fig e 5 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of fire use on icb hydrology under future climates the modeling efforts presented here suggest that fire use strategies will have a similar impact on the hydrology of the icb under future climates to that which occurred due to the historical fire management from 1972 present namely modest increases in streamflow driven primarily by reductions in vapor fluxes particularly sublimation and evaporation see boisramé et al 2019 for additional detail on fire induced decreases in evaporation and increased subsurface water storage the broad similarity in these outcomes is perhaps unsurprising given the modest changes in water balance predicted for fixed fire suppressed vegetation cover when climate change alone is considered these differences may be increased in models that are able to consider variation in co2 concentration across the future climate scenarios unlike the present model which held co2 constant in all scenarios initiating a fire use strategy in 2030 is predicted to increase streamflow by an average of 19 29 mm year by 2070 relative to maintaining fire exclusion c f a 17 mm year historical increase although the predicted streamflow increases are not always statistically significant given the uncertainties associated with future climate and the hydrological model parameters the drivers of this increase greater snowpack and subsurface storage and reductions in evaporation and transpiration due to fire use relative to fire suppressed conditions are significant in all climate and fire frequency scenarios future applications of fire use strategies in the icb would therefore be likely to increase natural water storage in the basin and may result in increased streamflow increasing fire frequency while maintaining similar spatial fire severity distributions to the historical period has the primary effect of speeding up the rate of change without altering the final hydrological state of the basin greatly the final hydrological state predicted for the icb was largely robust to changes in the post fire vegetation transitions used in the model model scenarios in which highly burned regions transitioned to coniferous forests shrublands or wetlands diverged minimally from each other we did not quantitatively explore the robustness of these final states to our modeling decision to use historical fire areas and severities to represent these elements of future climate but the consequences of these decisions can be qualitatively explored for example the similarity in the final hydrological state of the basin across fire frequency scenarios may be partly attributable to the re use of the same fire perimeters in all scenarios all cases converged on a similar basin averaged lai independently of the fire frequency these fire perimeters do however cover 75 of the vegetated area of icb so that the modeled fires affected most of the area of the icb that can burn however by preventing fire from burning into areas that did not experience a fire in 1970 2010 the modeled fire perimeters may under estimate the maximum vegetation changes which could be induced in icb thus also underestimating the extremes of vegetation and hydrological changes that could be induced by fire on the other hand a scenario where the historical perimeters over estimate fire extent and severity seems probable due to additional fuel reductions consideration of this fuel limitation means the use of historical fire severity in the models is likely an upper bound on future fire severity therefore it is likely that uncertainties in the future fire regime associated with our fire modeling choices are opposite in sign and likely to mitigate each other our work has focused on representing known fire impacts of a frequently burned watershed rather than modeling them and thus introducing additional uncertainty however there is promising work being done coupling rhessys to a fire spread model wmfire which uses rhessys fuel loads and water deficits to model fire spread for a given location kennedy et al 2017 bart et al 2020 both studies have demonstrated that such coupling can re produce realistic historical fire regime characteristics across different eco systems and stand ages without being specifically tuned to do so further validation of this coupled model is needed especially its representation of the sensitivity of fire vegetation feedbacks to a changing climate future work will explore the potential of rhessys wmfire to study fire hydrology vegetation feedbacks in icb while the eco hydrological model used in this study has been successfully validated using a number of streamflow metrics it was not configured to capture high flow events important for flood and erosion management due to the lack of high resolution precipitation and streamflow observations the model also ignores post fire changes to soil properties which could lead to greater overland and streamflow from heightened soil water repellency within these limitations modeling suggests that fire use in the icb would increase peak streamflow by at most 3 2 from fire excluded conditions for all climate and fire regime scenarios this increase is likely under predicted in spite of the limitations on the modeling which mean that results should not be interpreted as a forecast of absolute hydrological behavior in fire affected watersheds like the icb it is important to recognise that the limitations also affect the historical baseline estimates of hydrological change from 1970 2010 similarly to future modeled scenarios thus we can conclude that fire use policies implemented in fire suppressed basins similar to icb and generating similar or more frequent fire regimes would generate similar hydrological co benefits to those experienced to date 4 2 management implications these hydrological co benefits may be an essential component of building an economic case for forest management because the economic investment needed to implement forest management strategies remains an impediment to their uptake gonzález sanchis et al 2019 for instance although the streamflow gains predicted from icb to date are modest on a per area basis in the watershed the additional streamflow gains from icb alone could produce 1 5 2 3 million of hydropower revenue per year and represent a volume equivalent to approximately 5 1 of the city of san francisco s annual water use which itself is worth approximately 6 0 9 2 million in water sales from the san francisco public utility commission detailed calculations in appendix g although the icb does not directly feed the hetch hetchy reservoir that forms san francisco s water supply these figures provide an indication of the potential economic value of even modest local changes in water balance which could be driven by fire use policies of course this value would be offset by the costs of the negative impacts of wildfire on watersheds such as increased erosion and declines in water quality tiedemann et al 1979 smith et al 2011 which should also form part of any economic analysis of wildfire use policies to date there is no evidence of extensive erosion or downstream water quality declines in response to icb wildfires but work to better establish the potential scope of such problems remains needed the icb remains a unique long term experiment on the effects of fire restoration on forests and water balance but policy is shifting to extend fire restoration across the sierra nevada for example current revisions to the land and resource management plans for national forests nf in the southern sierra nevada emphasize fire use for resource benefit over some 69 to 84 of national forest land boisramé et al 2017a estimated that approximately 19 100 km2 of the sierra nevada region is topographically and climatically similar to icb and may be suitable for similar fire use strategies however to achieve similar hydrological outcomes as in icb fire use in other basins would also need to achieve the substantial changes in forest cover that occurred in that basin in the only other basin in the sierra nevada with a multi decadal history of fire use policies sugarloaf creek basin in sequoia kings canyon national park greater fire suppression activity in the recent decades and lower productivity forests have led to a much more modest impact of fire on vegetation than observed in icb stevens et al 2020 the relatively limited sensitivity of predicted hydrological outcomes to climate however suggests that extension of the fire use policy beyond icb to other productive and topographically suitable forests could produce modest but valuable increases in streamflow 5 conclusion downscaling and bias correction of climate projections for icb and their use in the rhessys hydrological model suggest that the modest increases in streamflow estimated to have occurred due to fire use policies in the late 20th early 21st century are likely to be robust to the warmer future climate although the timing and provenance of streamflow shifts earlier in the year and towards rainfall rather than snowmelt these changes are not projected to result in large alterations in annual water balance partitioning to summarize our response to the posed questions i in the absence of fire use policy hydrology of the icb is relatively similar during rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2030 2070 climates and under the observed historical climate of 1970 2010 in terms of annual volumes of various fluxes one notable difference is the reduction of snowpack which leads to lower total evaporation due to a reduction in sublimation in the future climate scenarios ii the hydrological outcomes of fire use strategies in icb under future climate conditions are similar to those under observed climate the historical fire frequency regime produces similar reductions in evaporation and transpiration and gains in streamflow across all climates fire induced increase in snowpack partially counteracts climate change induced reductions in snowpack iii considering fuel limited conditions in icb anticipated increases in fire frequency due to ignitions and not fuel availability in the future climate of 2030 2070 will lead to similar hydrologic changes as historic fires but in a shorter timeframe though we provide a broad range of possible fire regime outcomes future work should focus on fully coupling post fire vegetation transitions to climate and hydrology and consequent fire regime more advanced modeling of fire effects on hydrology may be needed as well in addition to wildfire impacts on vegetation removal changes to soil properties are needed to accurately model high intensity precipitation events that have an impact on erosion flooding and water quality rising temperatures and a naturally volatile hydroclimatic setting present ongoing challenges to california s water supply security and forest resilience this study suggests that where self limiting fire behavior as per icb can be anticipated the hydrological co benefits should be considered as part of future fire policy development

4922,on the edge of sedimentary basins karst aquifers can be fed by several water origins from both autogenic and allogenic recharge in some cases water origin assessment is difficult and issues in water management may arise the main goal of this study is to understand what controls hydrodynamical and geochemical variations at the outflow of a quite complex and large karst system more precisely this study illustrates how a consistent observational setup can be developed based on a multi proxy approach that can be used for tracing water origins evaluating mixing phenomena and contributions in

aquifers contribute substantially to freshwater supplies in many regions of the world about 13 8 of the world land surface is covered by carbonate rocks chen et al 2017 nowadays approximately 20 25 of the world s population depends largely or entirely on groundwater obtained from karst aquifers ford and williams 2007 goldscheider et al 2020 these aquifers are distinguished from porous aquifers by the high degree of heterogeneity featured in both surface and underground white 1998 bakalowicz 2005 carbonate sedimentary formations such as limestone and dolomite are the most important karst prone rocks ford and williams 2007 however karstification can also occurs in other rock types such as carbonatic conglomerates goeppert et al 2011 carbonatic metamorphic rocks such as marble or calcite schist skoglund and lauritzen 2011 and evaporitic formations such as gypsum or anhydrite gil márquez et al 2019 because of these unique hydrogeological characteristics karst aquifers are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and are difficult to manage stevanovic 2015 stevanović 2019 management of these aquifers requires a good knowledge of its structure and function analysis of

vulnerability of the karst system kavouri et al 2011 but have left questions about the dynamic water quality mixing process and groundwater origins into the karst aquifer the ouysse karst aquifer offers the opportunity to understand the dynamics of karst aquifers located on the edge of sedimentary basins and origins of the aquifer using a simple acquisition of hydrodynamic responses and natural hydrochemical tracers it also offers the opportunity to open up the black box by comparing hydrodynamics and hydrochemical signals in the sinking stream underground river courtilles borehole

identifying groundwater flowpaths water origins and their respective contributions to spring outflow in a complex karst aquifer with both allogenic and autogenic feeding in other words this article describes the set up of an environmental observatory dedicated to karst and demonstrates its value to assess karst dynamics and sensitivity of such systems to external forcings to do so the first objective is to characterize water types and origins over the hydrogeological catchment using natural hydrochemical tracers the second one is to assess the evolution of water quantity and water

les vitarelles fig 1 2 1 local geology and hydrogeology the geological situation of the ouysse karst system consists of a tabular sequence of upper jurassic carbonate rocks in contact with paleozoic substratum fig 1 with a thickness of 300 350 m for jurassic carbonate sediments early lias middle and upper lias bajocian bathonian callovian and oxfordian the paleozoic rocks are a mix of igneous rocks such as schist micaschist and gneiss above there are trias evaporites with a thickness of 50 m then the bottom of the carbonate sequence starts with a liassic mix of marls and carbonates at the top of the sequence bajocian bathonian callovian and oxfordian carbonate formations consist of dolomitic limestones fig 1 the sequence is slightly tilted toward the southwest implying the older outcropping rocks are in the east of the hydrogeological catchment and the later ones in the west karst landforms are well developed at the surface of the carbonate outcrops as noticed by the existence of numerous sinkholes and swallow holes the ouysse karst system is a mixed autogenic and allogenic karst system covering 650 km2 in total in which a 154 km2 area corresponds to a runoff basin whose surface water infiltrates to the karst aquifer through several sinking streams at the eastern boundary of the carbonate sequence aalenian the regional hydrogeology consists of one main aquifer located at the top of the jurassic carbonate sequence bajocian bathonian callovian and oxfordian this aquifer is captured by three natural outlets the cabouy spring the saint sauveur spring and the fontbelle spring several tracer tests have been conducted over the past 50 years leading to the delineation of the catchment area of the ouysse karst system fig 1 and to the direct connection of sinking streams to outlets in the northeastern part of the catchment with flow speed between 26 m h 1 and 135 m h 1 2 2 local hydrology and consequences on hydrogeology three perennial rivers are located over the study site i the francès river ii the ouysse river iii the alzou river the francès river and the ouysse river have their runoff basin located in the limargue area eastern part and emerge from paleozoic rocks in crystalline springs fig 1 for the alzou river the runoff basin is located in the northeastern part of the catchment and emerges in middle and upper lias rocks from deep water springs rising from trias evaporite rocks alzou spring fig 1 these rivers have important discharge variations in response to rainfall events 0 001 m3 s 1 to 5 m3 s 1 for the francès river 0 02 m3 s 1 to 10 m3 s 1 for the ouysse river and 0 02 m3 s 1 to 8 m3 s 1 for the alzou river unpublished data previous tracer tests studies show a connection between the alzou sinking stream and the cabouy spring unpublished data point source recharge due to sinking streams increases the karstification process in the jurassic aquifer and contributes to the expansion of many underground rivers below the surface the most important one is the underground river les vitarelles exploited for drinking water via the courtilles borehole tracer tests revealed a good hydraulic connection between this underground river and cabouy spring hence the cabouy spring and the courtilles borehole are both partly fed by sinking streams on allogenic karst system and diffuse recharge via infiltrations through carbonate rocks over the surface of autogenic karst system such recharge implies the input of several water origins in the aquifer increasing the difficulty to understand the hydrogeological dynamic of the karst system 2 3 climate the causses du quercy has a temperate climate with an average annual temperature of 13 c an average summer temperature between 20 c and 21 c and an average winter temperature between 5 c and 6 c météo france data the study area has one weather station located in lunegarde although the average annual precipitation varies between 800 and 1000 mm evapotranspiration from vegetation and soil leads to a computed effective rainfall ranging from 200 mm to 350 mm per year calculated from the penman monteith equation with météo france data evapotranspiration reaches a peak in july october when rainfall is generally insufficient to produce any significant discharge except during strong storms 3 material and methods the hydrogeological approach developed in this paper is divided in two steps first water samples were collected every three months from 2012 to 2014 on every water types of the study area in order to identify each hydrochemical signature over the hydrogeological catchment such as i the crystalline springs ii the limargue sinks iii the alzou springs iv the alzou sinks v the underground river les vitarelles vi the autogenic underground karst rivers vii the outlets water samples were performed in high water conditions and in low water conditions second the francès sinking stream at théminettes the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring were monitored with high resolution monitoring for hydrodynamic and physio chemical parameters and daily samples for hydrochemical parameters during a flood event the courtilles borehole offers the opportunity to study the transfer of water inside the karst system and to analyze differences between the input francès sinking stream the output cabouy spring and an intermediary underground river 3 1 water sampling and continuous monitoring 3 1 1 sampling strategy for long term monitoring over the hydrogeological catchment of the ouysse karst system samples were collected every 3 months from 2012 to 2014 a total of 45 samples were collected 3 from crystalline springs 11 from limargue sinks 5 from the courtilles borehole 6 from the alzou river 4 from autogenic karst underground rivers and 16 from outlets of the karst system cabouy saint sauveur and fontbelle in the field a multiparameter wtw 3430 was used to measure the ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen o2 were measured with accuracy of 0 05 ph unit 1 µs cm 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 water samples were filtered 0 45 µm directly in the field and cation sample were acidified with nitric acid hno3 70 pure alkilinity hco3 was measured within 12 h by acid titration major ion concentration ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 were determined by chromatography using a dionex ics 1500 for the cations and using a dionex 1100 equipped with an accuracy of 2 3 1 2 sampling strategy during may 2016 flood event at the courtilles borehole the cabouy spring and the combettes underground river water samples were collected daily from 02 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 at the francès sinking stream water samples were collected daily from 25 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 a total of 165 samples were collected 24 from the francès sinking stream 49 from the courtilles borehole 44 from the cabouy spring and 48 from the combettes underground river water samples were filtered 0 45 µm directly in the field and cation sample were acidified with nitric acid hno3 70 pure alkilinity hco3 was measured within 12 h by acid titration at each sampling point high resolution monitoring of hydrodynamic and physio chemical parameters is performed the water level ec and temperature are recorded continuously using a ctd diver every 1 h with an accuracy of 0 5 mm 1 µs cm 1 and 0 1 c respectively the ph is recorded using an ysi 600 xlm with accuracy of 0 05 ph unit alkalinity was measured by acid titration major ion concentration ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 were determined by chromatography using a dionex ics 1500 for the cations and using a dionex 1100 equipped with an accuracy of 2 3 2 methods a multidisciplinary approach is performed to identify groundwater flows water origins and its respective contribution in a complex karst aquifer with both allogenic and autogenic supply this approach combines both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical approaches coupled with statistical approach 3 2 1 time series analysis cross correlation function ccf is used to determine the relationship between two variables x and y these two variables usually have an input output relationship as in rainfall discharge this analysis gives the impulse response caused by an input signal provided it can considered a random process free of serial correlation some authors have used ccf to determine the relationship between other variables as for rainfall electrical conductivity turbidity and water temperature amraoui et al 2003 bouchaou et al 2002 genthon et al 2005 labat et al 2000 larocque et al 1998 mangin 1984 massei et al 2006 the ccf is represented by a cross correlogram which has a positive part and a negative part a peak in the positive part means that there is a relationship between the input and output time series in this study only the positive part is shown as hydrodynamic causal links were already identified by tracer tests the maximum amplitude and the lag value of the ccf provide information about delay which indicates the response time to variations of the input signal shorter delay times mean faster aquifer transfer when rainfall is considered as input and discharge as output correlogram memory effect and delay time can be use to describe the karstification degree and the response of the aquifer covington et al 2009 mayaud et al 2014 lo russo et al 2015 fu et al 2016 3 2 2 water rock interaction the major ions calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 bicarbonate hco3 and sulfate so4 2 are generally provided in aquifers by the dissolution of carbonates calcite dolomite and gypsum the dissolution of calcite eq 1 dolomite eq 2 and gypsum eq 3 can be expressed as follows 1 caco3 h2o co2 g ca2 2hco3 2 camg co3 2 2h2o 2co2 g ca2 mg2 4hco3 3 caso4 2h2o ca2 so4 2 2h2o binary plots are used to compare two concentrations between two variables x and y concentrations are expressed in meq l 1 applied to karst environment binary plots are usually used to compare different parameters such as ca2 mg2 and hco3 or so4 2 in conjunction with the composition of the dissolving rocks such as calcite dolomite or gypsum comparing these parameters can highlight water origins at the outlet of a karst system frank et al 2019 according to eq 1 if the dissolution of calcite is the only source of ca2 and hco3 the theoretical ratio of ca2 and hco3 would be 1 1 in terms of charge balance in the same way according to eq 2 if the dissolution of calcite and dolomite occurred side by side the theoretical ratio of ca2 and hco3 would be between 1 1 and 1 2 but the theoretical ratio of ca2 mg2 and hco3 would be 1 1 finally according to eq 3 if the dissolution of gypsum in the only source of ca2 and so4 2 the theoretical ratio of ca2 and so4 2 would be 1 1 fluid mineral equilibrium e g co2 partial pressure pco2 was calculated with phreeqc software version 3 3 parkhurst 1999 3 2 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca shows the relations and correlations between variables from an orthogonal transformation that converts the different variables physio chemical parameters for this study into a reduced number of non correlated synthetic variables called components formed by linear combination of initial variables hill and smith 1976 jolliffe 1986 it reduces the dimensions of the dataset variable correlations and samples variations are represented in factor planes composed by components explaining the most of the variability as axes all components explaining over 10 of the variability are plotted the pca is performed with standardized data i e data subtracted from their average and divided by their standard deviations the more a variable is projected near the edge of the correlation circle the more its variability is explained by the plotted components when two or more variables are located in the same area of this factor plane they are positively correlated principal component analysis is used to identify clusters of samples that are inclined towards specific variables this statistical tool is commonly used in the literature to describe waters of karst systems fournier et al 2007 mudarra et al 2011 mudarra and andreo 2011 dassi 2011 bicalho et al 2012 minvielle et al 2015 lorette et al 2018 gil márquez et al 2019 3 2 4 source mixing calculation once the chemical characteristics of the different origins are established they can be used to quantify the contribution for each water origin in a mixed sample ribolzi et al 1997 katz et al 1998 long and putnam 2004 bicalho 2010 harguindeguy et al 2014 in a mix of two end members 1 and

4 results and discussion from 2012 to 2014 hydrochemical parameters physicochemical parameters and major ions were measured at springs sinking streams underground rivers and outlets over the hydrogeological catchment in addition from the 02 05 2016 to the 17 06 2016 hydrodynamic water level and hydrochemical parameters physicochemical parameters and major ions were measured during a flood event signals in the continuum sinking stream francès underground river courtilles borehole outlet cabouy spring table 1 summarizes the data tables 2 and 3 summarize statistical parameters of data from the long term monitoring and the flood term monitoring respectively raw data are given in supplementary materials 4 1 hydrochemical background over the hydrogeological catchment the piper diagram fig 2 plots the proportions in meq l 1 of the major cations and anions and helps to determine the geochemical facies of water over the study area the hco3 so4 2 anion facies with dominating bicarbonate anions is prevalent in the area regarding cations ca2 and mg2 dominate cations in water in the area the piper diagram shows clear variations in ion ratios between the samples three contrasted water types can be identified fig 2 the samples from the springs originating from the crystalline rocks have very low concentrations of all dissolved elements but relatively higher proportions of chloride sodium and potassium this is typical for water coming from such geological context modica et al 1998 mcguire et al 2005 ayraud et al 2008 jaunat et al 2012 the alzou samples show high sulfate and calcium amounts the springs of the alzou river flow from an evaporitic aquifer and present the highest so4 2 proportion these sulfates and calcium come from the dissolution of the gypsum at the alzou sinking stream in gramat there are slightly fewer so4 2 and higher hco3 due to the outcropping carbonate formations along the riverbed upstream of the sink table 2 the autogenic karst water is sampled in underground rivers from the south west of the hydrogeological catchment fig 1 solely fed by infiltration at the top of the upper jurassic limestones the samples have high ca2 and hco3 amounts the other samples are mixes of those water types fig 2 the limargue sinks are surface water fed by waters flowing from crystalline substratum but also dolomites limestones and marls from early jurassic formations the samples have a high calcium proportion but also present non negligible amounts of mg2 and cl the courtilles borehole is located in an underground river located under the jurassic limestones and is directly linked to the limargue sinks it is also fed by infiltrations on the karst its samples position intermediate between limargue and autogenic karst waters on the piper diagram fig 2 but closer to the limargue samples with higher ca2 and hco3 amounts finally the outlets are located between these various water types in the piper diagram like the autogenic karst water they have high amounts of ca2 and hco3 but some samples show high so4 2 values table 2 these piper diagram fig 2 highlight the multiple water types and mixing phenomena in the study area as a consequence of the geological situation on the edge of a sedimentary basin all these input mix in the aquifer and the origin of so42 at the outlets is the key in determining the origins of water in this karst aquifer 4 2 hydrograph analysis during the one and a half month period 02 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 shown in fig 3 two different events of cumulative precipitations occurred the first was short and showed the lower cumulative rainfall at the lunegarde rain gauge fig 1 of 38 5 mm from the 22 05 2016 to the 25 05 2016 the second was longer than the first one and showed higher cumulative rainfall of 87 8 mm from the 28 05 2016 to the 01 06 2016 the two rainfall events led to two hydrogeological events showing different responses depending on site location and configuration the first event happens during a low baseflow and the second during a higher baseflow for the first rainfall event francès and combettes do not show high waterlevel variations but cabouy spring shows an increase of 40 cm with two successive peaks during the second rainfall event all measurement stations show high variations of waterlevel the shape of hydrograph is not the same for each site the francès sinking stream at theminettes station and the courtilles borehole record similar variations but the shape of the hydrograph is different fig 3 the combettes underground river fed by autogenic recharge fig 1 recorded a double peak associated with the rainfall event 2 fig 3 the cabouy spring the main outlet of the ouysse karst system fig 1 has more complicated natural responses associated with rainfall event during the first rainfall event two distinctive increases of waterlevel are recorded the maximum peak values are measured 24 h and 15 h respectively after the beginning of increases during the second rainfall event a double peak is recorded the increase of the first peak begins the 29 05 2016 at 00 h00 53 cm the maximum value of 116 cm is measured 16 h after the beginning 29 05 2016 at 16 h00 then the waterlevel decreases the increase of the second peak begins the 31 05 2016 at 01 h00 with a baseflow of 47 cm the maximum peak value of 139 42 m is recorded the 01 06 2016 at 22 h00 45 h after the beginning of the increase the waterlevel returns to the baseflow value cm 43 h after the maximum value 03 06 2016 at 17 h00 punctual discharge measurements show values between 0 5 m3 s 1 and at least 60 m3 s 1 unpublished data demonstrating that the cabouy springs among the biggest karst spring in france unfortunately continuous data are not available yet 4 3 cross correlation functions cross correlation functions ccfs were calculated between the rainfall and the water level during a flood event from 02 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 of i the francès sinking stream at théminettes ii the underground river directly linked to the sink the courtilles borehole and iii the main outlet of the karst system the cabouy spring the ccf shows two peaks for all four locations corresponding to two rainfall periods leading to two floods fig 4 for the first peak the francès sinking stream reaches a correlation rxy k of 0 30 with the precipitation for a time lag of 10 h courtilles reaches a maximum value of 0 24 for a lag time of 17 h and cabouy reaches a correlation rxy k of 0 30 with the precipitation for a time lag of 21 h the second peak is calculated at 75 h at the francès station with an rxy k of 0 33 and an 87 h lag at courtilles for an rxy k of 0 31 in cabouy the lag is 84 h and the rxy k peaks at 0 27 the results for the bivariate analysis for the ouysse karst system are in agreement with those found by previous study where the lag time is between hours dzikowski et al 1995 bailly comte et al 2008 covington et al 2009 mayaud et al 2014 and days padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 lorette et al 2018 the shape of ccfs gives information about the dynamic of the karst aquifer for all stations the ccfs show that a quickflow component is present for the flood event of may 2016 response between 17 and 21 h for courtilles and cabouy respectively however a large part of the input signal is filtered through the karst system ccf between 0 24 and 0 30 for courtilles and cabouy respectively moreover the shapes of ccfs are variable for the three stations for the francès station the peak is narrow and the signal decrease quickly indicating that the baseflow component is not predominant for the courtilles borehole the peak is wider than the francès one and decreases more slowly indicating that another water origin contributes to the baseflow component for the cabouy spring the signal is very inertial compared to the two others its location at the outlet of the karst system includes every process occurring over the hydrogeological catchment even if tracer tests have shown connection with limargue sinking stream the ccf of the may 2016 flood event indicates that sinkholes are not the only component responsible for this hydrodynamic behavior the ccfs between waterlevel at the francès sink input and at the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring output provide additional information on the dynamic of the ouysse karst system fig 4 the ccfs show high values of rxy k from 0 70 for cabouy to 0 85 for courtilles these values are reached after 11 h at courtilles and 17 h at cabouy hence the courtilles borehole has a better correlation with the francès sinking stream than with the cabouy spring the francès cabouy ccf is also more inertial than the francès courtilles one this indicates that another water origin is responsible for these more inertial responses this other origin could be either i a large support of water from another sinking stream with steady baseflow discharge ii a large support of water from the autogenic part of the karst system 4 4 hydrochemistry during may 2016 flood event hydrochemical parameters are used to identify variations of hydrochemical signatures during the flood of may june 2016 and determine the water origins at the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring from 02 05 2016 to the 17 06 2016 hydrodynamic and hydrochemical data were obtained in different water conditions during a flood event fig 5 illustrates the temporal evolution of water level and hydrochemical parameters of the francès sinking stream at theminettes the courtilles borehole the cabouy springs and the combettes underground river for quality control the charge balance error of all ion samples is given in fig 5 all samples are in range with a charge balance 5 table 3 shows statistical parameters of the water samples for all samples the facies is calcium bicarbonate due to the carbonate nature of the aquifer rocks although they may become calcium sulfate bicarbonate during low water periods depending on location over the karst aquifer sinking stream underground river outlet site measurements can have various hydrochemical variations associated with water origins and recharge conditions 4 4 1 the francès sinking stream theminettes the francès sinking stream at theminettes is a surface river temporal evolution of hydrochemical parameters in fig 5a showed that rainfall events can provoke an evolution in water quality water temperature has daily variations associated to the day night temperature influence which is usual in surface waters beaufort et al 2016 xie et al 2017 pco2 is recorded between 0 06 and 0 32 in water which is close to the atmospheric pco2 0 03 sutton 2014 the variations of electrical conductivity the main indicator of mineralization show that following rainfall events there is a considerable diminution in this parameters at the sinking stream from values of almost 500 µs cm 1 to 200 µs cm 1 most of the components followed a pattern similar to the electrical conductivity all parameters have the same behavior on the chemiographs the maximum concentrations of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl are observed before the flood event and have respective values of 63 91 mg l 1 18 32 mg l 1 250 mg l 1 32 34 mg l 1 and 8 38 mg l 1 the minimum concentrations are measured during flood event and have respective values of 35 41 mg l 1 for ca2 9 3 mg l 1 for mg2 138 mg l 1 for hco3 6 92 mg l 1 for so4 2 and 4 57 mg l 1 for cl 4 4 2 the courtilles borehole the courtilles borehole catches the underground river les vitarelles in the central part of the hydrogeological catchment despite being underground the vitarelles river has daily temperature variations of 0 3 c these variations are probably due to the influence of limargue sinking streams which are connected to courtilles borehole according to tracer test fig 1 generally concentrations of hydrochemical parameters are close to those measured from the francès sinking stream table 3 but ca2 hco3 and pco2 are higher with 62 3 mg l 1 223 mg l 1 and 0 5 respectively against 55 9 mg l 1 221 mg l 1 and 0 1 respectively for the francès sinking stream so4 2 concentrations are lower at courtilles borehole than francès with respectively 51 9 mg l 1 and 18 9 mg l 1 in the upstream part of the underground network of the vitarelles river several tributaries come from the south of the hydrogeological catchment at courtilles borehole it is then possible to have a support of karstic water with variable contributions depending on hydrological conditions the recording of physicochemical parameters fig 5b show that at the beginning of the rainfall event temperature ec pco2 hco3 and ca2 increase associated with a little increase of water level then all parameters decrease associated with a higher increase of water level at the end of the flood event all parameters start to return to their initial concentrations the couples of parameters ca2 hco3 mg2 so4 2 and na cl evolve together indicating a possible support of water in variable quantity which involve a mix of water in the underground river the vitarelles between allogenic and autogenic water limargue and carbonate karst 4 4 3 the cabouy spring as the main outlet of the karst system ouysse karst system the cabouy spring includes every process occurring over the hydrogeological catchment as illustrated by its natural responses in fig 5c water from the cabouy spring shows high ca2 and hco3 proportions so4 2 concentrations are higher than in other sampling point during the flood event with values between 5 4 mg l 1 and 55 9 mg l 1 this result supposes another origin of in so4 2 the cabouy spring during the may 2016 flood event hydrochemical parameters have complex evolution according to water origins and groundwater flow interactions at the beginning of this period the waterlevel decreases in absence of rainfall event ca2 and hco3 have roughly stable concentrations at 110 mg l 1 and 330 mg l 1 respectively as shown by points 1 and 2 09 05 2016 and 20 05 2016 the first rainfall event induces two increases of the waterlevel associated with these increases some parameters such as ec ca2 and so4 2 also increase but others such as hco3 decrease at point 3 25 05 2016 ca2 and so4 2 concentrations are respectively at 115 7 mg l 1 and 53 83 mg l 1 this evolution can be a consequence of i a support of water from saturated zone ii a support of water with higher concentration of so4 2 and ca2 over the hydrogeological catchment the alzou sinking stream is the only water with ca so4 facies the second rainfall event also imply two increases of the waterlevel but more important as shown in fig 5c this second event implies a decrease of all parameters with the exception of pco2 this evolution can be associated with a supply of water from unsaturated zone as shown by the increase of pco2 mudarra et al 2012 peyraube et al 2012 minvielle et al 2015 houillon et al 2017 lorette et al 2018 at points 4 and 5 pco2 values are at 2 2 and 2 39 at the end of the flood event all parameters start to return to their initial concentrations 4 4 4 the combettes underground river the combettes underground river is located in the west part of the hydrogeological catchment and is fed by autogenic recharge through carbonate this river has hydraulic connection with saint sauveur spring fig 1 and is representative of typical autogenic karstic water as shown by its high mean concentration of ca2 and hco3 146 5 mg l 1 and 431 4 mg l 1 respectively and its low so4 2 concentration 3 6 mg l 1 table 3 water pco2 is higher than the courtilles boreholes with a mean value of 4 1 as a consequence of water rock interaction with carbonates fig 5d during the may 2016 flood event hydrochemical parameters evolve simultaneously as a response of water recharge from the infiltration of low mineralized water through epikarst and unsaturated zone during rainfall event ec and temperature have slightly variations 650 µs cm 1 to 600 µs cm 1 and 12 95 c to 12 8 c respectively most of the components followed a pattern similar to the electrical conductivity patterns 4 5 water origins a binary diagram illustrates the chemical equilibrium between the plotted elements a ca2 mg2 vshco3 plot fig 6 a and b inquire if the samples chemistry is only due to carbonate dissolution or if other influences are observed for carbonate dissolution limestone or dolomitic limestone in respect to eqs 1 and 2 equal amounts of ca2 mg2 as hco3 must be measured on the ca2 mg2 vshco3 plot samples must follow a 1 1 straight line this is the case for the limargue sink of theminettes the courtilles borehole and the combettes autogenic karst underground river fig 6a and b this is not the case for alzou where the data were located below the 1 1 line of ca2 mg2 vshco3 fig 6a indicating that dissolution of carbonate is not the only source of ca2 and mg2 in the ca2 vsso4 2 binary plot fig 6c the samples only affected by gypsum dissolution follow a 1 1 straight line in respect to eq 3 the alzou samples are parallel to this line but the ratio of ca2 and so4 2 is greater than 1 this is probably due to an additional dissolution before the carbonate dissolution providing the surplus of ca2 the gypsum dissolution for the cabouy spring a first look at the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 plot fig 6a seems to indicate an excess of calcium and magnesium compared to carbonate dissolution equilibrium highlighted by a slight drift away of the points distribution from the 1 1 line fig 6b samples were numbered from 1 to 7 and are linked with samples numbers from fig 5 the sample numbered 5 was sampled during flood event and seem closer to the carbonate dissolution equilibrium line the samples 3 4 and 7 have a low flow signature and are further away towards the alzou samples signature the samples 1 2 6 and 7 sampled during previous flood 1 and 2 post flood recession 6 and 7 are intermediate and show the shift happening progressively with the decrease of the flow forming an hysteresis on the side of the carbonate dissolution equilibrium line on the ca2 vs so4 2 plot fig 6d the same shift and the same hysteresis can be observed characterized by an increase in so42 concentrations relatively to the ca2 concentrations from samples 1 to 4 as the flow decreases from the flood sample 1 toward recession sample 4 it is followed by a sharp decrease in both ca2 and so4 2 for sample 5 due to a new flood episode followed by a new increase between samples 5 7 during once again the flow recession the tracer tests have shown that the alzou sink is connected to the cabouy spring fig 1 the chemical analyses also indicate a clear connection between them but also point to variation in this connection according to the flow condition during high flow there are few influences of water from alzou sink while during low flow the cabouy samples chemistry are more influenced by alzou water these binary plots also show another connection the link between theminettes sink and the courtilles borehole the chemical signatures of the samples from these two locations are very similar on the four plots and vary concomitantly fig 6 the courtilles borehole signature tends slightly more towards the autogenic karstic water showing water in vitarelles underground river also coming from diffuse infiltrations on the karst mixed with the water coming from the limargue sinks 4 6 geochemical decomposition of the flood chemiograph in order to quantify the respective contributions of the hydrochemical signatures of the alzou limargue sinks autogenic karst and rainwater in the hydrochemistry of the cabouy spring and the courtilles borehole it is necessary to select the most discriminating variables as input in eq 5 to this end a principal component analysis pca is conducted using data from the may 2016 flood event from the francès sinking stream the courtilles borehole the cabouy spring the combettes underground river the alzou sinking stream and rainfall the pca is based on 172 samples and 7 variables ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl and so4 2 the results of the pca are presented through the correlation circle and the samples variations in the first two components fig 7 these first two components represent 90 of the data variability the other components have an eigenvalue inferior to 1 following the kaiser criterion they will not be considered braeken 2017 the first axis 60 of the variability is positively correlated with hco3 and anti correlated with k na cl and mg2 the combettes samples representative of the autogenic karst are positive on this axis while allogenic waters from the francès sinking stream limargue and the alzou river are negative the second axis of the pca is anti correlated with ca2 so4 2 and hco3 the alzou river samples show a negative signature on this axis while the rain the francès sinking stream and the courtilles borehole samples are positive cabouy spring has intermediate position in both axis 1 and axis 2 thus the variables selected as the marker tracer for autogenic karst is hco3 because they are both positively correlated with axis 1 and negatively with axis 2 the so4 2 variable is chosen as the marker variable for alzou since they are both negatively correlated with axis 1 and 2 the k variable is negatively correlated with axis 1 and a slightly positively correlated with axis 2 same as francès sink it is the chosen marker variable for this origin the rain is typical of south western france for its low concentrations in each element bertrand et al 2008 millot et al 2010 jaunat et al 2013 houillon 2016 lorette 2019 as such any elements correlated for the other origins can also be used as a marker for this pole cl is chosen as it is well represented in the pca and the model seems to perform better with this element as tracer than with others four samples are chosen as representative from each origin in order to choose a sensibility analysis was carried out between the samples with minimum median and maximum concentration in the corresponding tracer element concentrations for each origin the highest negative values are shown when using minimum and median concentration using the maximum concentrations ensures that all of the courtilles and cabouy samples of the may 2016 flood are confined in the area between each pole the respective contributions of the three origins autogenic karst limargue and rainwater feeding courtilles water can be calculated for each sample of the flood event at courtilles using the tracer elements concentrations hco3 karst k limargue and cl rain in eq 5 results are shown in fig 8 a before the flood the proportions of water from karst and limargue are stable with an estimated predominance of autogenic karst contribution 61 75 the contributions left are attributed to the limargue sinks 24 35 the direct rainwater contribution is low 3 at the start of the flood event the 29th of may and until the 31st there is an increase in limargue sinks contributions up to 58 and a decrease in autogenic karst water contribution down to 44 the rainwater part falls down to negative values 2 showing the limits of the model the limargue contributions already start decreasing the 1st of june two days before the main peak in waterlevel after the flood events the respective contributions revert back slowly to their initial values around 67 79 karst water 17 29 limargue sinks and 2 3 rain water this shows the major contribution of limargue water in feeding les vitarelles underground river during the flood event and the major contribution of autogenic karst in feeding the underground river during flood recession and low flow periods like courtilles the cabouy chemiograph decomposition is carried out with eq 5 on the basis of characteristic parameters hco3 k so4 2 and cl for respectively autogenic karst limargue alzou and rainwater which are the four origins feeding cabouy results are shown in fig 8b contributions are stable before the flood event with an estimated predominance of autogenic karst water 68 69 and lower proportions of alzou sink 20 21 and limargue sinks 7 8 the dilution by rainfall is low 2 contribution during both peaks of the flood the autogenic karst contribution increase up to 83 while the limargue sinks contributions show a slight increase with 20 contributions and the alzou sink does not contribute significantly anymore 1 2 like courtilles the rain contribution falls down to negative values 2 after the flood the autogenic karst and limargue sinks proportion decrease and the alzou sink increases back to their initial contribution karst 72 limargue 10 alzou 15 and rainfall 2 very low of direct contributions of rainwater are observed for courtilles and cabouy this is consistent with the results of bicalho 2010 with rainfall having maximum of 6 contribution for all of her studied flood events and 70 to 80 of contributions from the karstic aquifer for the proportions of sink water contributions katz et al 1998 estimates contributions from 30 to 90 depending on the chosen tracer emblanch et al 2003 finds a contribution of 0 to 60 of the unsaturated zone compared to the saturated aquifer part contribution the range of the results presented in this study seems to be in accordance with the data from the literature here we are interested about the direct contribution of rainwater to the geochemical composition of the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring the direct rainwater contribution is very low sometimes negative the rainwater contribution is included in the geochemistry of end members during the may 2016 flood event each end member is considered as static constant composition with time while in reality the sources compositions may be temporally variable it is also possible to use variable values for the composition of the different water that step in the mixing model but this method would need to take the signal lag in account for each parameter for each origin which could be estimated with cross correlation analysis this approach would allow the withdrawal of the rain origin and remove the need to choose one sample to summarize the whole distribution of each origin and thus eliminate the associated bias it wasn t possible for this study to use variable values as origins due to missing values for the alzou river during the studied flood 4 7 the ouysse karst aquifer conceptual dynamic and implication in terms of water management as the only drinking water source for more than 12 000 people the ouysse karst aquifer management monitoring and protection are keys for a sustainable resource hence the assessment of hydrogeological dynamic water origins and contributions is a step for a better management over the hydrogeological catchment the geological situation on the edge of a sedimentary basin is responsible for this complex hydrogeological dynamic of the ouysse karst system the highly dynamic responses and the highly karstified structure of the aquifer are the consequences of the mix of allogenic and autogenic recharge but also the consequences of the polyphased karstification of jurassic rocks associated with geological history pelissié 1982 platel 1987 rey et al 1988 cubaynes et al 1989 pelissié and astruc 1996 husson et al 2016 this study showed that the hydrogeological situation at the edge of a sedimentary basin involves difficulties in identifying water dynamics inside the karst aquifer the multiple origins for groundwater over the hydrogeological catchment imply difficulties to assess the water quality at the outlet of the karst system using natural hydrochemical tracers the study showed that courtilles borehole is only influenced by the limargue sinks and autogenic karst infiltrations on the other hand cabouy spring is influenced by the limargue sinks the autogenic karst infiltrations and the alzou sink outside flood events water from limargue sinking streams allogenic part are about 24 to 35 in the central part of the aquifer and 7 to 8 at the outlet whereas the autogenic karst part is estimated at about 61 to 75 in the central part of the aquifer and 68 to 69 at the outlet at the central part rainfall is estimated at about 2 but its chemical signature has totally disappeared at the outlet the alzou sinking stream is not linked to the courtilles borehole but contributes from 20 to 21 of the outlet water before the flood event during the flood the contribution decreases to 2 previous analysis are used to identify water origins and contributions over karst aquifers fed by both autogenic and allogenic water a synopsis of the method is described in supplementary materials the proposed approach is cut in three main phases i a long term analysis lta of hydrochemical parameters used for identification of water types over the hydrogeological catchment thanks to a piper diagram the results are used to drive the second phase ii a short term analysis sta during a flood event of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical parameters to bring further information on the dynamic of the karst system more precisely several tools are used first cross correlation function is performed to evaluate the dynamic of the karst system this ccf is performed on input output data such as rainfall outlet waterlevel and sinking stream waterlevel outlet waterlevel then temporal evolution of water quality and binary plots on chemical composition are performed to identify water origins at the outlet of the karst system finally source mixing modelling is performed to estimate the respective contribution of water type during the flood event studied iii observation and results are coupled to the knowledge of the geological situation of the ouysse karst system to propose a conceptual model of dynamic hence the proposed approach suggests that i the allogenic recharge from sinking streams limargue and alzou can feed the system in non negligible amounts depending of the hydrological situation fig 9 ii the autogenic karst water recharge assumes the chemical baseline that majorly feed the system particularly during high water periods fig 9 iii the contribution of the rainwater to the feeding of the karst aquifer remains unclear since the composition of pure diluted rainwater seems to be rapidly altered by either mixing with surface runoff water notably in the limargue area or by interaction with carbonate rocks in epikarst the estimations of mixing contributions are important in terms of water management of the resource as major potential contaminations are associated with surface input sinking stream are linkable to the main vulnerability associated with surface contamination of the hydrogeological catchment indeed at courtilles borehole the proportion of the francès sinking stream can be at least 44 daily variation of temperature recorded at the courtilles borehole is a good indicator of the non equilibrium between surface water and sub terranean environment this underlines the quickflow from surface water which was already detected by tracer test moreover the natural drainage of evaporitic system e g alzou river can be accompanied by a deterioration in the chemical quality of freshwater aquifers apaydın and aktaş 2012 hence in order to ensure good water quality it is necessary to adapt the management of the hydrogeological catchment to do so there are three complementary possibilities i increase the protection zone in the surface catchment of sinking stream ii identify vulnerability of surface contamination bacteria nitrate particles metals trace elements etc associated with each sinking stream during a flood event but also on the outcrops over the allogenic karst area iii install remote controlled monitoring devices on the two main sinking stream francès sinking stream at theminettes and alzou sinking stream at gramat as an alert system of potential contamination 5 conclusion in water resource management knowledge about possible water origins and their respective contributions is critical it is even more crucial for karst systems which are highly heterogeneous and can be characterized by many different flowpaths extending over many different distances from a more fundamental standpoint the need for acquiring such a knowledge emphasizes the crucial importance of deploying appropriate observational setups on the scale of the considered catchment this study illustrates how such a consistent observational setup can be developed based on a multi proxy approach that can be used for tracing water origins evaluating mixing phenomena and contributions in karst aquifers considering both autogenic and allogenic recharge this approach was applied to a large karst system as the only local drinking water source for more than 12 000 people management monitoring and protection of the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring are keys for a sustainable water resource hence the identification of water origins and its respective contribution is the first step in managing the hydrogeological catchment better in this study the analysis of hydrochemical parameters helped in determining water origins ca2 mg2 hco3 water with low contents of so4 2 characterizes the courtilles borehole located in the main underground river of the study area it is a mix between water from limargue sinking streams and karstic water from the underground tributaries of the south of the hydrogeological catchment contributions of water can be variable depending on the hydrodynamic conditions during the hydrological cycle concerning the cabouy spring during low flow conditions the spring is characterized by high so4 2 contents but during rainfall events the water chemistry is shifted to ca2 mg2 hco3 water infiltrating from the surface through the carbonate formation the ca2 so4 2 water chemistry observed during low flow condition is a consequence of higher contributions of water originating from evaporite aquifer via the alzou sinking stream hence water from the main outlet of the ouysse karst system is a mix between autogenic water karstic water infiltrating from the surface through the carbonate and allogenic water alzou sinking stream and limargue sinking streams this work suggests a discussion about quantification of the contributions for each water origin in a mixed sample hence the geochemical decomposition of chemograph is available to highlight a main contribution of autogenic water 83 during the may 2016 flood event at the outlet of the karst system before the flood event autogenic water contribution decreases to 70 and the allogenic water contributes to 28 20 from the alzou sinking stream and 8 from the limargue sinking stream in the upstream part of the aquifer the highest contribution of autogenic water 75 is calculated before the flood event the remaining 25 are linkable with the allogenic water from the limargue sinking stream during the flood event most of the water is associated to allogenic water 58 and the remaining water comes mainly from the autogenic water the geochemical decomposition of chemiograph of n end members defined by m non covariant elements is an innovative tool to improve knowledge of hydrogeological dynamic in binary complex kart aquifers somehow some limitations can be suggested i the use of rainwater in the model can be improved to avoid punctual negative values of rainwater contributions ii the use of variable end member associated with the geochemical variations of end member during flood events the use of variable end members needs to take in account the lag for each parameter for each origin which can be estimated using cross correlation functions future steps of the research on the ouysse karst system will focus on the comparison between quantification with discharge measurements and quantification with chemical values discharge measurements are currently being acquired research will also focus on contaminants transport from several water origins e g bacteria turbidity trace metal elements and nitrate standpoint researches needs to be improved on an adapted strategy over karstic hydrogeological catchment indeed the quick flow component highlight the necessity of perennial high resolution monitoring on strategic points this high resolution monitoring is crucial to precisely identify flowpaths extending over many different distances their respective quality associated and their respective temporal evolution quantity and quality to external forcings demography climate change etc this proposed approach based on hydrochemical parameters can be applied for the characterization of any binary karst systems hosting swallow holes in their hydrogeological catchment using it is rather simple leading to an easy method of comparison between karst systems credit authorship contribution statement guillaume lorette conceptualization

4922,on the edge of sedimentary basins karst aquifers can be fed by several water origins from both autogenic and allogenic recharge in some cases water origin assessment is difficult and issues in water management may arise the main goal of this study is to understand what controls hydrodynamical and geochemical variations at the outflow of a quite complex and large karst system more precisely this study illustrates how a consistent observational setup can be developed based on a multi proxy approach that can be used for tracing water origins evaluating mixing phenomena and contributions in karst aquifers considering both autogenic and allogenic recharge the ouysse karst system 650 km2 located in western france provides the opportunity of studying water mixing processes in binary karst systems fed by allogenic and autogenic recharges global water chemistry hydrograph and chemograph analysis during a flood event and source mixing calculation were used to evaluate groundwater flow origins and the contribution of each water type during the studied flood event i karstic water ii evaporite water iii water from igneous metamorphic rock aquifers in terms of resource management the information obtained can be used as a basis of forecasting and management actions keywords karst aquifer hydrochemistry hydrodynamic source mixing calculation conceptual model 1 introduction karst aquifers contribute substantially to freshwater supplies in many regions of the world about 13 8 of the world land surface is covered by carbonate rocks chen et al 2017 nowadays approximately 20 25 of the world s population depends largely or entirely on groundwater obtained from karst aquifers ford and williams 2007 goldscheider et al 2020 these aquifers are distinguished from porous aquifers by the high degree of heterogeneity featured in both surface and underground white 1998 bakalowicz 2005 carbonate sedimentary formations such as limestone and dolomite are the most important karst prone rocks ford and williams 2007 however karstification can also occurs in other rock types such as carbonatic conglomerates goeppert et al 2011 carbonatic metamorphic rocks such as marble or calcite schist skoglund and lauritzen 2011 and evaporitic formations such as gypsum or anhydrite gil márquez et al 2019 because of these unique hydrogeological characteristics karst aquifers are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and are difficult to manage stevanovic 2015 stevanović 2019 management of these aquifers requires a good knowledge of its structure and function analysis of karst systems is usually led using various methods based on basic hydrochemistry isotopic chemistry hydrodynamic responses or lithology characteristics the joint use of hydrodynamic and natural hydrochemical responses within a framework of a multidisciplinary approach provides a linkable characterization of the hydrogeological dynamics of karst aquifers lastennet and mudry 1997 grasso et al 2003 perrin et al 2003 birk et al 2004 bicalho et al 2012 brkić et al 2018 filippini et al 2018 lorette et al 2018 on the edge of sedimentary basins carbonate sequences can be in contact with igneous rocks moreover polyphased karstification in relation to both epigene and hypogene karstification klimchouk 2007 2004 palmer 2011 audra et al 2015 husson et al 2016 imply deep water rising lorette et al 2018 the unique configuration of the edges of sedimentary basins led to i the existence of a hydrologic surface network on igneous formations ii the existence of major sinking streams located in contact with carbonate rocks ii deep water rising on the edge of sedimentary basins which can infiltrate through sinking stream and mix with the karst aquifer from this specificity follow unique hydrogeological characteristics where recharge can occur i from point infiltration through sinking stream as a consequence of allogenic origin ii from more diffuse infiltration over the carbonate outcrops as a consequence of autogenic origin few studies highlight knowledge on karst systems located on the edge of sedimentary basins we can note recent insights from bicalho et al 2012 mahler and bourgeais 2013 lorette et al 2017 lorette et al 2018 lorette et al 2020 and flook et al 2020 through the example of the lez spring france the barton spring usa the toulon springs france and the surat basin australia respectively the ouysse karst system is a good example of a complex karst system drained by both allogenic and autogenic karst aquifer located on the northeastern edge of the aquitaine sedimentary basin in france 66 000 km2 the ouysse karst aquifer provides drinking water to the northern part of the causses du quercy unesco global geopark more than 12000 people with three collection points i the courtilles borehole catching the main underground river in the middle of the karst system ii the cabouy spring the main outlet of the karst system iii the fontbelle spring the minor outlet of the karst system previous work had led to the first studies about tracer test beaudoing et al 1989 dzikowski et al 1995 geophysical caracterization guérin et al 2009 and intrinsic vulnerability of the karst system kavouri et al 2011 but have left questions about the dynamic water quality mixing process and groundwater origins into the karst aquifer the ouysse karst aquifer offers the opportunity to understand the dynamics of karst aquifers located on the edge of sedimentary basins and origins of the aquifer using a simple acquisition of hydrodynamic responses and natural hydrochemical tracers it also offers the opportunity to open up the black box by comparing hydrodynamics and hydrochemical signals in the sinking stream underground river courtilles borehole outlet cabouy spring continuum particular attention is given on water origins and mixing processes in the aquifer the main goal of this study is to understand what controls hydrodynamical and geochemical variations at the outflow of a quite complex and large karst system in a more general way this paper establishes and discusses how a multi proxy approach is needed to reach this goal by identifying groundwater flowpaths water origins and their respective contributions to spring outflow in a complex karst aquifer with both allogenic and autogenic feeding in other words this article describes the set up of an environmental observatory dedicated to karst and demonstrates its value to assess karst dynamics and sensitivity of such systems to external forcings to do so the first objective is to characterize water types and origins over the hydrogeological catchment using natural hydrochemical tracers the second one is to assess the evolution of water quantity and water quality in the continuum sinking stream underground river outlet during a flood event then the third objective is to identify the contribution of each water type to the outlet of the karst system proposing a conceptual model of dynamic 2 general characteristics of the study area the ouysse karst system is the second largest karst system in france in terms of area 650 km2 it is located in the causses du quercy natural parc and unescp global geoparc in south western france at the northeastern edge of the aquitaine sedimentary basin fig 1 over the hydrogeological catchment the resource is mainly used as drinking water at the cabouy spring the courtilles borehole and the fontbelle spring fig 1 cabouy spring is a major regional spring and is located in the western part of the ouysse karst system fig 1 it is a vauclusian type spring and the main outlet of the ouysse karst system can reach up to more than 100 m3 s 1 during rainfall events with a mean annual discharge of 5 m3 s 1 the courtilles borehole is the main borehole over the study area it is located at the central part of the catchment in the town of gramat and captures the main underground river the underground river les vitarelles fig 1 2 1 local geology and hydrogeology the geological situation of the ouysse karst system consists of a tabular sequence of upper jurassic carbonate rocks in contact with paleozoic substratum fig 1 with a thickness of 300 350 m for jurassic carbonate sediments early lias middle and upper lias bajocian bathonian callovian and oxfordian the paleozoic rocks are a mix of igneous rocks such as schist micaschist and gneiss above there are trias evaporites with a thickness of 50 m then the bottom of the carbonate sequence starts with a liassic mix of marls and carbonates at the top of the sequence bajocian bathonian callovian and oxfordian carbonate formations consist of dolomitic limestones fig 1 the sequence is slightly tilted toward the southwest implying the older outcropping rocks are in the east of the hydrogeological catchment and the later ones in the west karst landforms are well developed at the surface of the carbonate outcrops as noticed by the existence of numerous sinkholes and swallow holes the ouysse karst system is a mixed autogenic and allogenic karst system covering 650 km2 in total in which a 154 km2 area corresponds to a runoff basin whose surface water infiltrates to the karst aquifer through several sinking streams at the eastern boundary of the carbonate sequence aalenian the regional hydrogeology consists of one main aquifer located at the top of the jurassic carbonate sequence bajocian bathonian callovian and oxfordian this aquifer is captured by three natural outlets the cabouy spring the saint sauveur spring and the fontbelle spring several tracer tests have been conducted over the past 50 years leading to the delineation of the catchment area of the ouysse karst system fig 1 and to the direct connection of sinking streams to outlets in the northeastern part of the catchment with flow speed between 26 m h 1 and 135 m h 1 2 2 local hydrology and consequences on hydrogeology three perennial rivers are located over the study site i the francès river ii the ouysse river iii the alzou river the francès river and the ouysse river have their runoff basin located in the limargue area eastern part and emerge from paleozoic rocks in crystalline springs fig 1 for the alzou river the runoff basin is located in the northeastern part of the catchment and emerges in middle and upper lias rocks from deep water springs rising from trias evaporite rocks alzou spring fig 1 these rivers have important discharge variations in response to rainfall events 0 001 m3 s 1 to 5 m3 s 1 for the francès river 0 02 m3 s 1 to 10 m3 s 1 for the ouysse river and 0 02 m3 s 1 to 8 m3 s 1 for the alzou river unpublished data previous tracer tests studies show a connection between the alzou sinking stream and the cabouy spring unpublished data point source recharge due to sinking streams increases the karstification process in the jurassic aquifer and contributes to the expansion of many underground rivers below the surface the most important one is the underground river les vitarelles exploited for drinking water via the courtilles borehole tracer tests revealed a good hydraulic connection between this underground river and cabouy spring hence the cabouy spring and the courtilles borehole are both partly fed by sinking streams on allogenic karst system and diffuse recharge via infiltrations through carbonate rocks over the surface of autogenic karst system such recharge implies the input of several water origins in the aquifer increasing the difficulty to understand the hydrogeological dynamic of the karst system 2 3 climate the causses du quercy has a temperate climate with an average annual temperature of 13 c an average summer temperature between 20 c and 21 c and an average winter temperature between 5 c and 6 c météo france data the study area has one weather station located in lunegarde although the average annual precipitation varies between 800 and 1000 mm evapotranspiration from vegetation and soil leads to a computed effective rainfall ranging from 200 mm to 350 mm per year calculated from the penman monteith equation with météo france data evapotranspiration reaches a peak in july october when rainfall is generally insufficient to produce any significant discharge except during strong storms 3 material and methods the hydrogeological approach developed in this paper is divided in two steps first water samples were collected every three months from 2012 to 2014 on every water types of the study area in order to identify each hydrochemical signature over the hydrogeological catchment such as i the crystalline springs ii the limargue sinks iii the alzou springs iv the alzou sinks v the underground river les vitarelles vi the autogenic underground karst rivers vii the outlets water samples were performed in high water conditions and in low water conditions second the francès sinking stream at théminettes the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring were monitored with high resolution monitoring for hydrodynamic and physio chemical parameters and daily samples for hydrochemical parameters during a flood event the courtilles borehole offers the opportunity to study the transfer of water inside the karst system and to analyze differences between the input francès sinking stream the output cabouy spring and an intermediary underground river 3 1 water sampling and continuous monitoring 3 1 1 sampling strategy for long term monitoring over the hydrogeological catchment of the ouysse karst system samples were collected every 3 months from 2012 to 2014 a total of 45 samples were collected 3 from crystalline springs 11 from limargue sinks 5 from the courtilles borehole 6 from the alzou river 4 from autogenic karst underground rivers and 16 from outlets of the karst system cabouy saint sauveur and fontbelle in the field a multiparameter wtw 3430 was used to measure the ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen o2 were measured with accuracy of 0 05 ph unit 1 µs cm 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 water samples were filtered 0 45 µm directly in the field and cation sample were acidified with nitric acid hno3 70 pure alkilinity hco3 was measured within 12 h by acid titration major ion concentration ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 were determined by chromatography using a dionex ics 1500 for the cations and using a dionex 1100 equipped with an accuracy of 2 3 1 2 sampling strategy during may 2016 flood event at the courtilles borehole the cabouy spring and the combettes underground river water samples were collected daily from 02 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 at the francès sinking stream water samples were collected daily from 25 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 a total of 165 samples were collected 24 from the francès sinking stream 49 from the courtilles borehole 44 from the cabouy spring and 48 from the combettes underground river water samples were filtered 0 45 µm directly in the field and cation sample were acidified with nitric acid hno3 70 pure alkilinity hco3 was measured within 12 h by acid titration at each sampling point high resolution monitoring of hydrodynamic and physio chemical parameters is performed the water level ec and temperature are recorded continuously using a ctd diver every 1 h with an accuracy of 0 5 mm 1 µs cm 1 and 0 1 c respectively the ph is recorded using an ysi 600 xlm with accuracy of 0 05 ph unit alkalinity was measured by acid titration major ion concentration ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 were determined by chromatography using a dionex ics 1500 for the cations and using a dionex 1100 equipped with an accuracy of 2 3 2 methods a multidisciplinary approach is performed to identify groundwater flows water origins and its respective contribution in a complex karst aquifer with both allogenic and autogenic supply this approach combines both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical approaches coupled with statistical approach 3 2 1 time series analysis cross correlation function ccf is used to determine the relationship between two variables x and y these two variables usually have an input output relationship as in rainfall discharge this analysis gives the impulse response caused by an input signal provided it can considered a random process free of serial correlation some authors have used ccf to determine the relationship between other variables as for rainfall electrical conductivity turbidity and water temperature amraoui et al 2003 bouchaou et al 2002 genthon et al 2005 labat et al 2000 larocque et al 1998 mangin 1984 massei et al 2006 the ccf is represented by a cross correlogram which has a positive part and a negative part a peak in the positive part means that there is a relationship between the input and output time series in this study only the positive part is shown as hydrodynamic causal links were already identified by tracer tests the maximum amplitude and the lag value of the ccf provide information about delay which indicates the response time to variations of the input signal shorter delay times mean faster aquifer transfer when rainfall is considered as input and discharge as output correlogram memory effect and delay time can be use to describe the karstification degree and the response of the aquifer covington et al 2009 mayaud et al 2014 lo russo et al 2015 fu et al 2016 3 2 2 water rock interaction the major ions calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 bicarbonate hco3 and sulfate so4 2 are generally provided in aquifers by the dissolution of carbonates calcite dolomite and gypsum the dissolution of calcite eq 1 dolomite eq 2 and gypsum eq 3 can be expressed as follows 1 caco3 h2o co2 g ca2 2hco3 2 camg co3 2 2h2o 2co2 g ca2 mg2 4hco3 3 caso4 2h2o ca2 so4 2 2h2o binary plots are used to compare two concentrations between two variables x and y concentrations are expressed in meq l 1 applied to karst environment binary plots are usually used to compare different parameters such as ca2 mg2 and hco3 or so4 2 in conjunction with the composition of the dissolving rocks such as calcite dolomite or gypsum comparing these parameters can highlight water origins at the outlet of a karst system frank et al 2019 according to eq 1 if the dissolution of calcite is the only source of ca2 and hco3 the theoretical ratio of ca2 and hco3 would be 1 1 in terms of charge balance in the same way according to eq 2 if the dissolution of calcite and dolomite occurred side by side the theoretical ratio of ca2 and hco3 would be between 1 1 and 1 2 but the theoretical ratio of ca2 mg2 and hco3 would be 1 1 finally according to eq 3 if the dissolution of gypsum in the only source of ca2 and so4 2 the theoretical ratio of ca2 and so4 2 would be 1 1 fluid mineral equilibrium e g co2 partial pressure pco2 was calculated with phreeqc software version 3 3 parkhurst 1999 3 2 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca shows the relations and correlations between variables from an orthogonal transformation that converts the different variables physio chemical parameters for this study into a reduced number of non correlated synthetic variables called components formed by linear combination of initial variables hill and smith 1976 jolliffe 1986 it reduces the dimensions of the dataset variable correlations and samples variations are represented in factor planes composed by components explaining the most of the variability as axes all components explaining over 10 of the variability are plotted the pca is performed with standardized data i e data subtracted from their average and divided by their standard deviations the more a variable is projected near the edge of the correlation circle the more its variability is explained by the plotted components when two or more variables are located in the same area of this factor plane they are positively correlated principal component analysis is used to identify clusters of samples that are inclined towards specific variables this statistical tool is commonly used in the literature to describe waters of karst systems fournier et al 2007 mudarra et al 2011 mudarra and andreo 2011 dassi 2011

4 results and discussion from 2012 to 2014 hydrochemical parameters physicochemical parameters and major ions were measured at springs sinking streams underground rivers and outlets over the hydrogeological catchment in addition from the 02 05 2016 to the 17 06 2016 hydrodynamic water level and hydrochemical parameters physicochemical parameters and major ions were measured during a flood event signals in the continuum sinking stream francès underground river courtilles borehole outlet cabouy spring table 1 summarizes the data tables 2 and 3 summarize statistical parameters of data from the long term monitoring and the flood term monitoring respectively raw data are given in supplementary materials 4 1 hydrochemical background over the hydrogeological catchment the piper diagram fig 2 plots the proportions in meq l 1 of the major cations and anions and helps to determine the geochemical facies of water over the study area the hco3 so4 2 anion facies with dominating bicarbonate anions is prevalent in the area regarding cations ca2 and mg2 dominate cations in water in the area the piper diagram shows clear variations in ion ratios between the samples three contrasted water types can be identified fig 2 the samples from the springs originating from the crystalline rocks have very low concentrations of all dissolved elements but relatively higher proportions of chloride sodium and potassium this is typical for water coming from such geological context modica et al 1998 mcguire et al 2005 ayraud et al 2008 jaunat et al 2012 the alzou samples show high sulfate and calcium amounts the springs of the alzou river flow from an evaporitic aquifer and present the highest so4 2 proportion these sulfates and calcium come from the dissolution of the gypsum at the alzou sinking stream in gramat there are slightly fewer so4 2 and higher hco3 due to the outcropping carbonate formations along the riverbed upstream of the sink table 2 the autogenic karst water is sampled in underground rivers from the south west of the hydrogeological catchment fig 1 solely fed by infiltration at the top of the upper jurassic limestones the samples have high ca2 and hco3 amounts the other samples are mixes of those water types fig 2 the limargue sinks are surface water fed by waters flowing from crystalline substratum but also dolomites limestones and marls from early jurassic formations the samples have a high calcium proportion but also present non negligible amounts of mg2 and cl the courtilles borehole is located in an underground river located under the jurassic limestones and is directly linked to the limargue sinks it is also fed by infiltrations on the karst its samples position intermediate between limargue and autogenic karst waters on the piper diagram fig 2 but closer to the limargue samples with higher ca2 and hco3 amounts finally the outlets are located between these various water types in the piper diagram like the autogenic karst water they have high amounts of ca2 and hco3 but some samples show high so4 2 values table 2 these piper diagram fig 2 highlight the multiple water types and mixing phenomena in the study area as a consequence of the geological situation on the edge of a sedimentary basin all these input mix in the aquifer and the origin of so42 at the outlets is the key in determining the origins of water in this karst aquifer 4 2 hydrograph analysis during the one and a half month period 02 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 shown in fig 3 two different events of cumulative precipitations occurred the first was short and showed the lower cumulative rainfall at the lunegarde rain gauge fig 1 of 38 5 mm from the 22 05 2016 to the 25 05 2016 the second was longer than the first one and showed higher cumulative rainfall of 87 8 mm from the 28 05 2016 to the 01 06 2016 the two rainfall events led to two hydrogeological events showing different responses depending on site location and configuration the first event happens during a low baseflow and the second during a higher baseflow for the first rainfall event francès and combettes do not show high waterlevel variations but cabouy spring shows an increase of 40 cm with two successive peaks during the second rainfall event all measurement stations show high variations of waterlevel the shape of hydrograph is not the same for each site the francès sinking stream at theminettes station and the courtilles borehole record similar variations but the shape of the hydrograph is different fig 3 the combettes underground river fed by autogenic recharge fig 1 recorded a double peak associated with the rainfall event 2 fig 3 the cabouy spring the main outlet of the ouysse karst system fig 1 has more complicated natural responses associated with rainfall event during the first rainfall event two distinctive increases of waterlevel are recorded the maximum peak values are measured 24 h and 15 h respectively after the beginning of increases during the second rainfall event a double peak is recorded the increase of the first peak begins the 29 05 2016 at 00 h00 53 cm the maximum value of 116 cm is measured 16 h after the beginning 29 05 2016 at 16 h00 then the waterlevel decreases the increase of the second peak begins the 31 05 2016 at 01 h00 with a baseflow of 47 cm the maximum peak value of 139 42 m is recorded the 01 06 2016 at 22 h00 45 h after the beginning of the increase the waterlevel returns to the baseflow value cm 43 h after the maximum value 03 06 2016 at 17 h00 punctual discharge measurements show values between 0 5 m3 s 1 and at least 60 m3 s 1 unpublished data demonstrating that the cabouy springs among the biggest karst spring in france unfortunately continuous data are not available yet 4 3 cross correlation functions cross correlation functions ccfs were calculated between the rainfall and the water level during a flood event from 02 05 2016 to 17 06 2016 of i the francès sinking stream at théminettes ii the underground river directly linked to the sink the courtilles borehole and iii the main outlet of the karst system the cabouy spring the ccf shows two peaks for all four locations corresponding to two rainfall periods leading to two floods fig 4 for the first peak the francès sinking stream reaches a correlation rxy k of 0 30 with the precipitation for a time lag of 10 h courtilles reaches a maximum value of 0 24 for a lag time of 17 h and cabouy reaches a correlation rxy k of 0 30 with the precipitation for a time lag of 21 h the second peak is calculated at 75 h at the francès station with an rxy k of 0 33 and an 87 h lag at courtilles for an rxy k of 0 31 in cabouy the lag is 84 h and the rxy k peaks at 0 27 the results for the bivariate analysis for the ouysse karst system are in agreement with those found by previous study where the lag time is between hours dzikowski et al 1995 bailly comte et al 2008 covington et al 2009 mayaud et al 2014 and days padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 lorette et al 2018 the shape of ccfs gives information about the dynamic of the karst aquifer for all stations the ccfs show that a quickflow component is present for the flood event of may 2016 response between 17 and 21 h for courtilles and cabouy respectively however a large part of the input signal is filtered through the karst system ccf between 0 24 and 0 30 for courtilles and cabouy respectively moreover the shapes of ccfs are variable for the three stations for the francès station the peak is narrow and the signal decrease quickly indicating that the baseflow component is not predominant for the courtilles borehole the peak is wider than the francès one and decreases more slowly indicating that another water origin contributes to the baseflow component for the cabouy spring the signal is very inertial compared to the two others its location at the outlet of the karst system includes every process occurring over the hydrogeological catchment even if tracer tests have shown connection with limargue sinking stream the ccf of the may 2016 flood event indicates that sinkholes are not the only component responsible for this hydrodynamic behavior the ccfs between waterlevel at the francès sink input and at the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring output provide additional information on the dynamic of the ouysse karst system fig 4 the ccfs show high values of rxy k from 0 70 for cabouy to 0 85 for courtilles these values are reached after 11 h at courtilles and 17 h at cabouy hence the courtilles borehole has a better correlation with the francès sinking stream than with the cabouy spring the francès cabouy ccf is also more inertial than the francès courtilles one this indicates that another water origin is responsible for these more inertial responses this other origin could be either i a large support of water from another sinking stream with steady baseflow discharge ii a large support of water from the autogenic part of the karst system 4 4 hydrochemistry during may 2016 flood event hydrochemical parameters are used to identify variations of hydrochemical signatures during the flood of may june 2016 and determine the water origins at the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring from 02 05 2016 to the 17 06 2016 hydrodynamic and hydrochemical data were obtained in different water conditions during a flood event fig 5 illustrates the temporal evolution of water level and hydrochemical parameters of the francès sinking stream at theminettes the courtilles borehole the cabouy springs and the combettes underground river for quality control the charge balance error of all ion samples is given in fig 5 all samples are in range with a charge balance 5 table 3 shows statistical parameters of the water samples for all samples the facies is calcium bicarbonate due to the carbonate nature of the aquifer rocks although they may become calcium sulfate bicarbonate during low water periods depending on location over the karst aquifer sinking stream underground river outlet site measurements can have various hydrochemical variations associated with water origins and recharge conditions 4 4 1 the francès sinking stream theminettes the francès sinking stream at theminettes is a surface river temporal evolution of hydrochemical parameters in fig 5a showed that rainfall events can provoke an evolution in water quality water temperature has daily variations associated to the day night temperature influence which is usual in surface waters beaufort et al 2016 xie et al 2017 pco2 is recorded between 0 06 and 0 32 in water which is close to the atmospheric pco2 0 03 sutton 2014 the variations of electrical conductivity the main indicator of mineralization show that following rainfall events there is a considerable diminution in this parameters at the sinking stream from values of almost 500 µs cm 1 to 200 µs cm 1 most of the components followed a pattern similar to the electrical conductivity all parameters have the same behavior on the chemiographs the maximum concentrations of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl are observed before the flood event and have respective values of 63 91 mg l 1 18 32 mg l 1 250 mg l 1 32 34 mg l 1 and 8 38 mg l 1 the minimum concentrations are measured during flood event and have respective values of 35 41 mg l 1 for ca2 9 3 mg l 1 for mg2 138 mg l 1 for hco3 6 92 mg l 1 for so4 2 and 4 57 mg l 1 for cl 4 4 2 the courtilles borehole the courtilles borehole catches the underground river les vitarelles in the central part of the hydrogeological catchment despite being underground the vitarelles river has daily temperature variations of 0 3 c these variations are probably due to the influence of limargue sinking streams which are connected to courtilles borehole according to tracer test fig 1 generally concentrations of hydrochemical parameters are close to those measured from the francès sinking stream table 3 but ca2 hco3 and pco2 are higher with 62 3 mg l 1 223 mg l 1 and 0 5 respectively against 55 9 mg l 1 221 mg l 1 and 0 1 respectively for the francès sinking stream so4 2 concentrations are lower at courtilles borehole than francès with respectively 51 9 mg l 1 and 18 9 mg l 1 in the upstream part of the underground network of the vitarelles river several tributaries come from the south of the hydrogeological catchment at courtilles borehole it is then possible to have a support of karstic water with variable contributions depending on hydrological conditions the recording of physicochemical parameters fig 5b show that at the beginning of the rainfall event temperature ec pco2 hco3 and ca2 increase associated with a little increase of water level then all parameters decrease associated with a higher increase of water level at the end of the flood event all parameters start to return to their initial concentrations the couples of parameters ca2 hco3 mg2 so4 2 and na cl evolve together indicating a possible support of water in variable quantity which involve a mix of water in the underground river the vitarelles between allogenic and autogenic water limargue and carbonate karst 4 4 3 the cabouy spring as the main outlet of the karst system ouysse karst system the cabouy spring includes every process occurring over the hydrogeological catchment as illustrated by its natural responses in fig 5c water from the cabouy spring shows high ca2 and hco3 proportions so4 2 concentrations are higher than in other sampling point during the flood event with values between 5 4 mg l 1 and 55 9 mg l 1 this result supposes another origin of in so4 2 the cabouy spring during the may 2016 flood event hydrochemical parameters have complex evolution according to water origins and groundwater flow interactions at the beginning of this period the waterlevel decreases in absence of rainfall event ca2 and hco3 have roughly stable concentrations at 110 mg l 1 and 330 mg l 1 respectively as shown by points 1 and 2 09 05 2016 and 20 05 2016 the first rainfall event induces two increases of the waterlevel associated with these increases some parameters such as ec ca2 and so4 2 also increase but others such as hco3 decrease at point 3 25 05 2016 ca2 and so4 2 concentrations are respectively at 115 7 mg l 1 and 53 83 mg l 1 this evolution can be a consequence of i a support of water from saturated zone ii a support of water with higher concentration of so4 2 and ca2 over the hydrogeological catchment the alzou sinking stream is the only water with ca so4 facies the second rainfall event also imply two increases of the waterlevel but more important as shown in fig 5c this second event implies a decrease of all parameters with the exception of pco2 this evolution can be associated with a supply of water from unsaturated zone as shown by the increase of pco2 mudarra et al 2012 peyraube et al 2012 minvielle et al 2015 houillon et al 2017 lorette et al 2018 at points 4 and 5 pco2 values are at 2 2 and 2 39 at the end of the flood event all parameters start to return to their initial concentrations 4 4 4 the combettes underground river the combettes underground river is located in the west part of the hydrogeological catchment and is fed by autogenic recharge through carbonate this river has hydraulic connection with saint sauveur spring fig 1 and is representative of typical autogenic karstic water as shown by its high mean concentration of ca2 and hco3 146 5 mg l 1 and 431 4 mg l 1 respectively and its low so4 2 concentration 3 6 mg l 1 table 3 water pco2 is higher than the courtilles boreholes with a mean value of 4 1 as a consequence of water rock interaction with carbonates fig 5d during the may 2016 flood event hydrochemical parameters evolve simultaneously as a response of water recharge from the infiltration of low mineralized water through epikarst and unsaturated zone during rainfall event ec and temperature have slightly variations 650 µs cm 1 to 600 µs cm 1 and 12 95 c to 12 8 c respectively most of the components followed a pattern similar to the electrical conductivity patterns 4 5 water origins a binary diagram illustrates the chemical equilibrium between the plotted elements a ca2 mg2 vshco3 plot fig 6 a and b inquire if the samples chemistry is only due to carbonate dissolution or if other influences are observed for carbonate dissolution limestone or dolomitic limestone in respect to eqs 1 and 2 equal amounts of ca2 mg2 as hco3 must be measured on the ca2 mg2 vshco3 plot samples must follow a 1 1 straight line this is the case for the limargue sink of theminettes the courtilles borehole and the combettes autogenic karst underground river fig 6a and b this is not the case for alzou where the data were located below the 1 1 line of ca2 mg2 vshco3 fig 6a indicating that dissolution of carbonate is not the only source of ca2 and mg2 in the ca2 vsso4 2 binary plot fig 6c the samples only affected by gypsum dissolution follow a 1 1 straight line in respect to eq 3 the alzou samples are parallel to this line but the ratio of ca2 and so4 2 is greater than 1 this is probably due to an additional dissolution before the carbonate dissolution providing the surplus of ca2 the gypsum dissolution for the cabouy spring a first look at the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 plot fig 6a seems to indicate an excess of calcium and magnesium compared to carbonate dissolution equilibrium highlighted by a slight drift away of the points distribution from the 1 1 line fig 6b samples were numbered from 1 to 7 and are linked with samples numbers from fig 5 the sample numbered 5 was sampled during flood event and seem closer to the carbonate dissolution equilibrium line the samples 3 4 and 7 have a low flow signature and are further away towards the alzou samples signature the samples 1 2 6 and 7 sampled during previous flood 1 and 2 post flood recession 6 and 7 are intermediate and show the shift happening progressively with the decrease of the flow forming an hysteresis on the side of the carbonate dissolution equilibrium line on the ca2 vs so4 2 plot fig 6d the same shift and the same hysteresis can be observed characterized by an increase in so42 concentrations relatively to the ca2 concentrations from samples 1 to 4 as the flow decreases from the flood sample 1 toward recession sample 4 it is followed by a sharp decrease in both ca2 and so4 2 for sample 5 due to a new flood episode followed by a new increase between samples 5 7 during once again the flow recession the tracer tests have shown that the alzou sink is connected to the cabouy spring fig 1 the chemical analyses also indicate a clear connection between them but also point to variation in this connection according to the flow condition during high flow there are few influences of water from alzou sink while during low flow the cabouy samples chemistry are more influenced by alzou water these binary plots also show another connection the link between theminettes sink and the courtilles borehole the chemical signatures of the samples from these two locations are very similar on the four plots and vary concomitantly fig 6 the courtilles borehole signature tends slightly more towards the autogenic karstic water showing water in vitarelles underground river also coming from diffuse infiltrations on the karst mixed with the water coming from the limargue sinks 4 6 geochemical decomposition of the flood chemiograph in order to quantify the respective contributions of the hydrochemical signatures of the alzou limargue sinks autogenic karst and rainwater in the hydrochemistry of the cabouy spring and the courtilles borehole it is necessary to select the most discriminating variables as input in eq 5 to this end a principal component analysis pca is conducted using data from the may 2016 flood event from the francès sinking stream the courtilles borehole the cabouy spring the combettes underground river the alzou sinking stream and rainfall the pca is based on 172 samples and 7 variables ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl and so4 2 the results of the pca are presented through the correlation circle and the samples variations in the first two components fig 7 these first two components represent 90 of the data variability the other components have an eigenvalue inferior to 1 following the kaiser criterion they will not be considered braeken 2017 the first axis 60 of the variability is positively correlated with hco3 and anti correlated with k na cl and mg2 the combettes samples representative of the autogenic karst are positive on this axis while allogenic waters from the francès sinking stream limargue and the alzou river are negative the second axis of the pca is anti correlated with ca2 so4 2 and hco3 the alzou river samples show a negative signature on this axis while the rain the francès sinking stream and the courtilles borehole samples are positive cabouy spring has intermediate position in both axis 1 and axis 2 thus the variables selected as the marker tracer for autogenic karst is hco3 because they are both positively correlated with axis 1 and negatively with axis 2 the so4 2 variable is chosen as the marker variable for alzou since they are both negatively correlated with axis 1 and 2 the k variable is negatively correlated with axis 1 and a slightly positively correlated with axis 2 same as francès sink it is the chosen marker variable for this origin the rain is typical of south western france for its low concentrations in each element bertrand et al 2008 millot et al 2010 jaunat et al 2013 houillon 2016 lorette 2019 as such any elements correlated for the other origins can also be used as a marker for this pole cl is chosen as it is well represented in the pca and the model seems to perform better with this element as tracer than with others four samples are chosen as representative from each origin in order to choose a sensibility analysis was carried out between the samples with minimum median and maximum concentration in the corresponding tracer element concentrations for each origin the highest negative values are shown when using minimum and median concentration using the maximum concentrations ensures that all of the courtilles and cabouy samples of the may 2016 flood are confined in the area between each pole the respective contributions of the three origins autogenic karst limargue and rainwater feeding courtilles water can be calculated for each sample of the flood event at courtilles using the tracer elements concentrations hco3 karst k limargue and cl rain in eq 5 results are shown in fig 8 a before the flood the proportions of water from karst and limargue are stable with an estimated predominance of autogenic karst contribution 61 75 the contributions left are attributed to the limargue sinks 24 35 the direct rainwater contribution is low 3 at the start of the flood event the 29th of may and until the 31st there is an increase in limargue sinks contributions up to 58 and a decrease in autogenic karst water contribution down to 44 the rainwater part falls down to negative values 2 showing the limits of the model the limargue contributions already start decreasing the 1st of june two days before the main peak in waterlevel after the flood events the respective contributions revert back slowly to their initial values around 67 79 karst water 17 29 limargue sinks and 2 3 rain water this shows the major contribution of limargue water in feeding les vitarelles underground river during the flood event and the major contribution of autogenic karst in feeding the underground river during flood recession and low flow periods like courtilles the cabouy chemiograph decomposition is carried out with eq 5 on the basis of characteristic parameters hco3 k so4 2 and cl for respectively autogenic karst limargue alzou and rainwater which are the four origins feeding cabouy results are shown in fig 8b contributions are stable before the flood event with an estimated predominance of autogenic karst water 68 69 and lower proportions of alzou sink 20 21 and limargue sinks 7 8 the dilution by rainfall is low 2 contribution during both peaks of the flood the autogenic karst contribution increase up to 83 while the limargue sinks contributions show a slight increase with 20 contributions and the alzou sink does not contribute significantly anymore 1 2 like courtilles the rain contribution falls down to negative values 2 after the flood the autogenic karst and limargue sinks proportion decrease and the alzou sink increases back to their initial contribution karst 72 limargue 10 alzou 15 and rainfall 2 very low of direct contributions of rainwater are observed for courtilles and cabouy this is consistent with the results of bicalho 2010 with rainfall having maximum of 6 contribution for all of her studied flood events and 70 to 80 of contributions from the karstic aquifer for the proportions of sink water contributions katz et al 1998 estimates contributions from 30 to 90 depending on the chosen tracer emblanch et al 2003 finds a contribution of 0 to 60 of the unsaturated zone compared to the saturated aquifer part contribution the range of the results presented in this study seems to be in accordance with the data from the literature here we are interested about the direct contribution of rainwater to the geochemical composition of the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring the direct rainwater contribution is very low sometimes negative the rainwater contribution is included in the geochemistry of end members during the may 2016 flood event each end member is considered as static constant composition with time while in reality the sources compositions may be temporally variable it is also possible to use variable values for the composition of the different water that step in the mixing model but this method would need to take the signal lag in account for each parameter for each origin which could be estimated with cross correlation analysis this approach would allow the withdrawal of the rain origin and remove the need to choose one sample to summarize the whole distribution of each origin and thus eliminate the associated bias it wasn t possible for this study to use variable values as origins due to missing values for the alzou river during the studied flood 4 7 the ouysse karst aquifer conceptual dynamic and implication in terms of water management as the only drinking water source for more than 12 000 people the ouysse karst aquifer management monitoring and protection are keys for a sustainable resource hence the assessment of hydrogeological dynamic water origins and contributions is a step for a better management over the hydrogeological catchment the geological situation on the edge of a sedimentary basin is responsible for this complex hydrogeological dynamic of the ouysse karst system the highly dynamic responses and the highly karstified structure of the aquifer are the consequences of the mix of allogenic and autogenic recharge but also the consequences of the polyphased karstification of jurassic rocks associated with geological history pelissié 1982 platel 1987 rey et al 1988 cubaynes et al 1989 pelissié and astruc 1996 husson et al 2016 this study showed that the hydrogeological situation at the edge of a sedimentary basin involves difficulties in identifying water dynamics inside the karst aquifer the multiple origins for groundwater over the hydrogeological catchment imply difficulties to assess the water quality at the outlet of the karst system using natural hydrochemical tracers the study showed that courtilles borehole is only influenced by the limargue sinks and autogenic karst infiltrations on the other hand cabouy spring is influenced by the limargue sinks the autogenic karst infiltrations and the alzou sink outside flood events water from limargue sinking streams allogenic part are about 24 to 35 in the central part of the aquifer and 7 to 8 at the outlet whereas the autogenic karst part is estimated at about 61 to 75 in the central part of the aquifer and 68 to 69 at the outlet at the central part rainfall is estimated at about 2 but its chemical signature has totally disappeared at the outlet the alzou sinking stream is not linked to the courtilles borehole but contributes from 20 to 21 of the outlet water before the flood event during the flood the contribution decreases to 2 previous analysis are used to identify water origins and contributions over karst aquifers fed by both autogenic and allogenic water a synopsis of the method is described in supplementary materials the proposed approach is cut in three main phases i a long term analysis lta of hydrochemical parameters used for identification of water types over the hydrogeological catchment thanks to a piper diagram the results are used to drive the second phase ii a short term analysis sta during a flood event of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical parameters to bring further information on the dynamic of the karst system more precisely several tools are used first cross correlation function is performed to evaluate the dynamic of the karst system this ccf is performed on input output data such as rainfall outlet waterlevel and sinking stream waterlevel outlet waterlevel then temporal evolution of water quality and binary plots on chemical composition are performed to identify water origins at the outlet of the karst system finally source mixing modelling is performed to estimate the respective contribution of water type during the flood event studied iii observation and results are coupled to the knowledge of the geological situation of the ouysse karst system to propose a conceptual model of dynamic hence the proposed approach suggests that i the allogenic recharge from sinking streams limargue and alzou can feed the system in non negligible amounts depending of the hydrological situation fig 9 ii the autogenic karst water recharge assumes the chemical baseline that majorly feed the system particularly during high water periods fig 9 iii the contribution of the rainwater to the feeding of the karst aquifer remains unclear since the composition of pure diluted rainwater seems to be rapidly altered by either mixing with surface runoff water notably in the limargue area or by interaction with carbonate rocks in epikarst the estimations of mixing contributions are important in terms of water management of the resource as major potential contaminations are associated with surface input sinking stream are linkable to the main vulnerability associated with surface contamination of the hydrogeological catchment indeed at courtilles borehole the proportion of the francès sinking stream can be at least 44 daily variation of temperature recorded at the courtilles borehole is a good indicator of the non equilibrium between surface water and sub terranean environment this underlines the quickflow from surface water which was already detected by tracer test moreover the natural drainage of evaporitic system e g alzou river can be accompanied by a deterioration in the chemical quality of freshwater aquifers apaydın and aktaş 2012 hence in order to ensure good water quality it is necessary to adapt the management of the hydrogeological catchment to do so there are three complementary possibilities i increase the protection zone in the surface catchment of sinking stream ii identify vulnerability of surface contamination bacteria nitrate particles metals trace elements etc associated with each sinking stream during a flood event but also on the outcrops over the allogenic karst area iii install remote controlled monitoring devices on the two main sinking stream francès sinking stream at theminettes and alzou sinking stream at gramat as an alert system of potential contamination 5 conclusion in water resource management knowledge about possible water origins and their respective contributions is critical it is even more crucial for karst systems which are highly heterogeneous and can be characterized by many different flowpaths extending over many different distances from a more fundamental standpoint the need for acquiring such a knowledge emphasizes the crucial importance of deploying appropriate observational setups on the scale of the considered catchment this study illustrates how such a consistent observational setup can be developed based on a multi proxy approach that can be used for tracing water origins evaluating mixing phenomena and contributions in karst aquifers considering both autogenic and allogenic recharge this approach was applied to a large karst system as the only local drinking water source for more than 12 000 people management monitoring and protection of the courtilles borehole and the cabouy spring are keys for a sustainable water resource hence the identification of water origins and its respective contribution is the first step in managing the hydrogeological catchment better in this study the analysis of hydrochemical parameters helped in determining water origins ca2 mg2 hco3 water with low contents of so4 2 characterizes the courtilles borehole located in the main underground river of the study area it is a mix between water from limargue sinking streams and karstic water from the underground tributaries of the south of the hydrogeological catchment contributions of water can be variable depending on the hydrodynamic conditions during the hydrological cycle concerning the cabouy spring during low flow conditions the spring is characterized by high so4 2 contents but during rainfall events the water chemistry is shifted to ca2 mg2 hco3 water infiltrating from the surface through the carbonate formation the ca2 so4 2 water chemistry observed during low flow condition is a consequence of higher contributions of water originating from evaporite aquifer via the alzou sinking stream hence water from the main outlet of the ouysse karst system is a mix between autogenic water karstic water infiltrating from the surface through the carbonate and allogenic water alzou sinking stream and limargue sinking streams this work suggests a discussion about quantification of the contributions for each water origin in a mixed sample hence the geochemical decomposition of chemograph is available to highlight a main contribution of autogenic water 83 during the may 2016 flood event at the outlet of the karst system before the flood event autogenic water contribution decreases to 70 and the allogenic water contributes to 28 20 from the alzou sinking stream and 8 from the limargue sinking stream in the upstream part of the aquifer the highest contribution of autogenic water 75 is calculated before the flood event the remaining 25 are linkable with the allogenic water from the limargue sinking stream during the flood event most of the water is associated to allogenic water 58 and the remaining water comes mainly from the autogenic water the geochemical decomposition of chemiograph of n end members defined by m non covariant elements is an innovative tool to improve knowledge of hydrogeological dynamic in binary complex kart aquifers somehow some limitations can be suggested i the use of rainwater in the model can be improved to avoid punctual negative values of rainwater contributions ii the use of variable end member associated with the geochemical variations of end member during flood events the use of variable end members needs to take in account the lag for each parameter for each origin which can be estimated using cross correlation functions future steps of the research on the ouysse karst system will focus on the comparison between quantification with discharge measurements and quantification with chemical values discharge measurements are currently being acquired research will also focus on contaminants transport from several water origins e g bacteria turbidity trace metal elements and nitrate standpoint researches needs to be improved on an adapted strategy over karstic hydrogeological catchment indeed the quick flow component highlight the necessity of perennial high resolution monitoring on strategic points this high resolution monitoring is crucial to precisely identify flowpaths extending over many different distances their respective quality associated and their respective temporal evolution quantity and quality to external forcings demography climate change etc this proposed approach based on hydrochemical parameters can be applied for the characterization of any binary karst systems hosting swallow holes in their hydrogeological catchment using it is rather simple leading to an easy method of comparison between karst systems credit authorship contribution statement guillaume lorette conceptualization

4923,issues of pollution pervade the eco environment including water sources resulting from constant pollutant release into river channels from varying sources the presence of hyporheic zones in rivers play a role in the fate of pollutants in water systems this paper studies pollutant transport in a natural river with hyporheic zone exchange and non point source inflows a non point source hyporheic exchange hybrid cells in series model is proposed and derived analytically the proposed model is simulated under varying time delays between the hyporheic zone and the overflow channel the breakthrough curves produced from the simulations are in good agreement with field tracer test results as presented in most studies the model adequately captures the elongated arrival and trailing tails of field data breakthrough profiles the proposed model s overall performance shows that the model adequately predicts pollutants transport and fate along a natural river keywords non point

pollutants of non point source origin is on the increase wang et al 2013 hu and huang 2014 bi et al 2015 strokal et al 2016 the situation worsens with the temporary trapping of pollutants within the riverbed sediments hester and gooseff 2010 harvey and gooseff 2015 gradual re entry of trapped pollutants results in fluctuating concentration gradients in the river harvey et al 2012 kumar and dalal 2014 the trapping and release process hyporheic exchange increases the travel time of pollutants within the river the long tails evidence this in the breakthrough curves btc produced from field scale tracer experiments tonina and buffington 2009 kumarasamy et al 2011 krause et al 2011 bardini et al 2012 boano et al 2014 thus it signifies that pollutants remain in the sediment bed for timescales that exceed those in the river channel this water exchange in and out of the hyporheic zone must be adequately captured through modeling processes to enhance pollutant transport monitoring in rivers to preserve the eco environment the one dimensional advection dispersion equation ade model eq 1 with a combined first order mass exchange between the dead zone and river channel is the most common

pollutant velocity hansen and vesselinov 2018 c is pollutant concentration t denotes time and d is the coefficient of longitudinal dispersion x is the distance and u is the flow rate the ade model s inability to replicate the elongated tail in breakthrough curves btcs for pollutant transport is a significant shortcoming of the model cardenas 2015 the ade model sufficiently predicts tracer centroid and variance behavior but cannot adequately predict its skewness rutherford 1994 amongst the many models proposed to describe these natural processes satisfactorily the transient storage model tsm is prominent bencala and walters 1983 bencala 1983 the tsm modification of the advection dispersion zone adz model includes a transient storage component lees et al 2000 it considers shear flow in uniform channels to simulate dispersion within a stream and it divides instream flows into two interacting zones linked by a first order mass exchange bencala and walters 1983 the model suggests advection and dispersion processes occur only in the stream overflow while the flow in the storage zone is presumed to be stagnant runkel and chapra 1993 runkel et al 1995 kumar and dalal 2014 although a successful model the numerical solutions of the tsm equations require as many as three calibration parameters estimating these parameters is considered difficult and complicated rutherford 1994 lees et al 2000 consequently according to harvey et al 1996 wagner and harvey 1997 fuller and harvey 2000 zaramella et al 2003 bottacin 2010 the parameter uncertainties in tsm restrict its extensive use kazezyılmaz alhan and medina 2006 developed an enhanced tsm the improved model introduced the process of advection and dispersion within the hyporheic zone presenting a numerical solution using the implicit finite difference method however the process is cumbersome and oscillations in numerical solutions would make it challenging to derive satisfactory results rutherford 1994 haggerty et al 2000 developed the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt that expresses transient storage by integral convolution of pollutant concentration residence time and distribution bourke et al 2014 went on to characterize hyporheic exchange parameters based on radon activities of longitudinal streams kumar and dalal 2014 developed a diffusive transfer zone model dtsm by analytically solving the diffusive exchange model developed by jonsson et al 2003 however these attempts have not been without their complications in approach and applications requiring further research bencala 2000 runkel et al 2003 trends in hyporheic zone hz processes and model development are well described in boano et al 2014 the transport of solutes within storage zones is complex and subject to delays the mobility of the pollutant depends on the relationship of the retardation factor r and sorption distribution coefficient kd eq 2 2 r 1 ρ b ϕ k d ϕ is the porosity of the storage zone and ρb is the bulk density eq 2 assumes that sorption is linear and instantaneous sorption and or desorption processes retard the plume s transport due to interactions with the storage zones maghrebi et al 2013 kim et al 2014 bear in mind that to adequately predict retardation effects sorption processes must be described quantitatively and estimated a limiting factor to this relationship is the assumption that the hyporheic zone does not affect the migration of pollutants and sets kd as default krupka et al 1999 dentz and castro 2009 deng et al 2013 kd s inclusion as a term in r infers that reactions occurring in the channel are reversible and in equilibrium and do not vary in time or space muller et al 1983 this assumption is not realistic in natural environments consequently it is likely to underestimate pollutant migration krupka et al 1999 coles 2007 kumarasamy 2011 formulated the hybrid cells in series hcis model for the mass exchange of point source conservative pollutants through hyporheic zones defining retardation factor as 3 r 1 ϕ w p d f a here wp is the wetted perimeter of the stream interface and hyporheic zone a is the cross sectional area of the stream while f is a proportionality constant non dimensional the hcis effectively simulated the skewness observed in btcs for point source conservative pollutants and is found to overcome the limitations of the fickian based models adequately and is considered reliable olowe and kumarasamy 2017 chabokpour 2019 adu and kumarasamy 2020b developed an hcis model for combined point and non point source nps pollution simulation further a first order kinematic equation for decay was incorporated into the hcis nps model to simulate reactive contaminants in rivers adu and kumarasamy 2020a this study extends the hcis nps model by incorporating the hyporheic exchange component to simulate conservative pollutant transport from point and non point sources in streams and rivers to capture the exchange and transport of pollutants across the sediment water interface as it travels through the hyporheic zone for effective water quality management 2 mathematical framework for the model development the base hcis model as derived by ghosh 2001 and further extended by kumarasmy 2011 divides a river length into several hybrid units each hybrid unit as shown in fig 1 consists of a plug flow zone and two thoroughly mixed zones of independent retention times of α t1 and t2 the movement of particles in the plug flow zone is purely due to advection in contrast thorough mixing due to advection and dispersion occurs in subsequent two mixed zones with outflow concentrations equal to the preceding cell concentration the framework for the derivation of the hcis nps model is as in adu and kumarasamy 2020b the partial differential equation for a control volume of a natural river with non point source pollutant inputs and hyporheic exchange is derived as eq 4 4 c x t t u c x t x q l a c l c x t ϕ d r h c s x t t ϕ is the porosity of the stream bed d is the depth of the underlying zone rh is the hydraulic radius of the stream and cs x t is the concentration of trapped pollutants in hz for a well mixed hz the flux between the zone and the overlying water depends on the solute concentration between both zones defined as eq 5 rutherford 1994 5 c s x t f c x t f 0 50 if the hyporheic zone occupies 50 of the entire bed length extending across the entire channel rutherford 1994 the solution of eq 4 where the initial and boundary conditions are c x 0 0 x 0 c 0 t cr t 0 and c αu t 0 0 t α and replacing ql a

concentration of the first well mixed zone the step response describes a travel distance of αu at time t from injection through the plug zone u t αr is the step function of the equation when t αr u t αr 0 and for t αr u t αr 1 similarly for the first well mixed zone a mass balance equation eq 7 which accounts for the inflows from the plug flow zone eq 6 inflow from non point sources and effects of

the river n is convoluted and at the end of the nth hybrid unit of iδt the pollutant concentration is expressed as eq 11 ghosh et al 2004 11 c n δ x i δ t γ 1 i c n 1 δ x γ δ t δ hcis n p s h e z i γ 1 δ t 3 results and discussions 3 1 model testing with hypothetical data a conceptual 2 km river channel with a 20 m2 cross sectional area and a 400 m3 min flow rate is cut into several hybrid units δx of 200 m δx is determined when peclet number pe δxu dl 4 a dispersion coefficient dl of 1000 m2 min and flow velocity u of 20 m min satisfies this condition the retention time parameters α t1 and t2 are derived from the relationships α 0 04δx2 dl t1 0 05δx2 dl and t2 δx u 0 09δx2 dl provided that the dimensionless equation α t1 t2 u δx 1 is satisfied ghosh et al 2004 2008 buragohain et al 2018 non point source in flow rate and concentration values ql and cl are set as 0 016 m3 min m and 0 008 mg l a hyporheic zone depth of 0 72 m is estimated while the stream hydraulic radius is 0 53 m the set proportionality constant is 0 5 rutherford 1994 and porosity ϕ values of 0 3 and 0 0 are assumed for comparative purposes and to test the models sensitivity to varying stream bed porosity retardation factors r of 1 2 and 1 0 are calculated using eq 3 for the chosen porosity values of 0 3 and 0 0 a conservative pollutant of no specific type is assumed and the initial boundary concentration cr is set at 1 0 mg l the impulse response at the end of the first third seventh and tenth hybrid units when r 1 2 and 1 0 is produced in fig 2 the btc when r 1 0 shows steep concentration gradients and shorter tails however with r 1 2 the btc describes the curve s skewness and elongated arrival and trailing tails the first hybrid unit shows both curves arrive simultaneously from the point of pollutant injection a delay is noticed in the trailing tail for r 1 2 subsequent curves show late arrival and trailing edges for r 1 2 relative to r 1 0 r 1 0 zero porosity signifies no hyporheic exchange which reflects in the behavior of the btc the use of hypothetical data is necessary to simulate the spatio temporal variance of pollutant concentration in a natural river and validate the proposed model to establish its performance under varying stream conditions 3 2 hcis npshez in comparison with ade npshez the ade model is used to evaluate the proposed hcis nps hez model the ade model is modified to include non point source and hyporheic exchange components in line with the hcis nps hez model the numerical solution of the differential equation by explicit finite difference method yields eq 12 which is the step response function of the ade npshez model 12 c x t δ t c x t 1 2 d l δ t r δ x 2 q l ar δ t c x δ x t u δ t 2 r δ x d l δ t r δ x 2 c x δ x t u δ t 2 r δ x d l δ t r δ x 2 c l q l ar δ t to prevent oscillations in the numerical solution and to satisfy the courant number conditions the relationship uδt δx 1 is observed equation 12 is solved numerically to produce the unit impulse response of the ade npshez model downstream concentrations are simulated by numerical convolution fig 3 the btc produced shows similar trends in time to peak however an overall difference in peak concentrations is observed the first hybrid unit presents a right skewed curve however the curves tend towards a normally distributed skewness downstream bearing that the first hybrid unit represents the first pollutant injection in the control volume differences in the arrival and trailing tails as the pollutants travel downstream is evident between both models the hcis npshez model demonstrates more extended arrival and trailing tails and more rounded concentration peaks consistent with stream tracer test results 3 3 testing of the model using field data to further validate the model field data for chloride concentrations obtained from bencala et al 1990 are used the study area snake river colorado bencala et al 1990 is mountainous with unlying precambrian rocks plume granite and swandyke hornblende gneiss hornberger et al 1994 the bed s porosity is estimated to be 0 2 morin et al 1993 leeman et al 2009 simulations for 628 m 2845 m 3192 m and 5231 m before and after the snake river and deer creek confluence were performed adu and kumarasamy 2020a 2020b a retardation factor of 1 1 was applied based on the bed porosity the simulated btc was compared with actual field data from bencala et al 1990 presented in figs 4 and 5 for control purposes and to further understand the effects of hyporheic zones on contaminant fate in water bodies a retardation factor of 1 0 was used fig 4 tables 1 and 2 show the parameters used for the simulations the results show that when r 1 1 the btc of the model is similar and consistent with the field tracer test results for the four simulated points figs 4 and 5 the early arrival of the pollutant trail when r 1 0 is understandable as r 1 0 indicates the absence of porosity in the riverbed and therefore no interaction between the stream and hyporheic zone the models performance is evaluated using statistical tools and tested at a 95 percent confidence level for the coefficient of determination r2 and standard error se between the observed and simulated data r2 for river reach lengths of 628 m and 2845 m is 0 9724 and 0 8468 while for reaches 3192 and 5231 it is 0 9341 and 0 8577 further se at 628 m and 2845 m is 1 462e 1 and 2 227e 1 while for 3192 m and 5231 m is 7 616e 2 and 1 224e 1 the results show a good correlation between the measured and simulated results showing a relatively high coefficient of determination and corresponding low standard error for all four river reaches the overall results show a good correlation between the measured and simulated results for r 1 1 4 conclusion hyporheic exchange is an integral part of stream dynamics which accounts for fluctuations in pollutant concentration profiles in streams streambeds typically absorb contaminants from the overflow stream and release it at a later time the exchange between the sediment water interface and the hyporheic zone is principally responsible for the long tails of btc in field tracer tests the ability to effectively simulate the patterns of pollutant concentrations in water bodies is of utmost importance to water resource managers to ensure stream water quality and safety consequently an appropriate tool to achieve this is essential in this study a hyporheic component was added to the previously developed hcis nps model adu and kumarasamy 2020b a three pronged approach was implemented to validate the model s efficiency and establish its suitability for simulation of pollutant fate and transport in natural streams and rivers with non point source pollutant inflows and hyporheic exchange processes first the model was tested using synthetic data to establish its response and performance under varying stream conditions flow pollutant loading sources and streambed porosity the performance of the hcis npshez model was also compared with the results from simulations using the ade model which is known to predict pollutants behavior in water bodies insufficiently finally the model was validated with field tracer test data extracted from literature in all cases the proposed model demonstrated its ability to adequately represent pollutant fate behaviour in natural streams and rivers as observed in field tracer tests in the present study the hcis npshez model only simulates equilibrium conditions therefore interactions between the storage zone and the overflowing stream are minimal nevertheless the proposed hcis npshez model has proven its capability to adequately capture the changes in concentration gradients along a natural river with non point source inflows and hyporheic exchange the simplicity of the model ease of computation and low data requirement make it a useful water quality tool credit authorship contribution statement joy tuoyo

non point source in flow rate and concentration values ql and cl are set as 0 016 m3 min m and 0 008 mg l a hyporheic zone depth of 0 72 m is estimated while the stream hydraulic radius is 0 53 m the set proportionality constant is 0 5 rutherford 1994 and porosity ϕ values of 0 3 and 0 0 are assumed for comparative purposes and to test the models sensitivity to varying stream bed porosity retardation factors r of 1 2 and 1 0 are calculated using eq 3 for the chosen porosity values of 0 3 and 0 0 a conservative pollutant of no specific type is assumed and the initial boundary concentration cr is set at 1 0 mg l the impulse response at the end of the first third seventh and tenth hybrid units when r 1 2 and 1 0 is produced in fig 2 the btc when r 1 0 shows steep concentration gradients and shorter tails however with r 1 2 the btc describes the curve s skewness and elongated arrival and trailing tails the first hybrid unit shows both curves arrive simultaneously from the point of pollutant injection a delay is noticed in the trailing tail for r 1 2 subsequent curves show late arrival and trailing edges for r 1 2 relative to r 1 0 r 1 0 zero porosity signifies no hyporheic exchange which reflects in the behavior of the btc the use of hypothetical data is necessary to simulate the spatio temporal variance of pollutant concentration in a natural river and validate the proposed model to establish its performance under varying stream conditions 3 2 hcis npshez in comparison with ade npshez the ade model is used to evaluate the proposed hcis nps hez model the ade model is modified to include non point source and hyporheic exchange components in line with the hcis nps hez model the numerical solution of the differential equation by explicit finite difference method yields eq 12 which is the step response function of the ade npshez model 12 c x t δ t c x t 1 2 d l δ t r δ x 2 q l ar δ t c x δ x t u δ t 2 r δ x d l δ t r δ x 2 c x

solved numerically to produce the unit impulse response of the ade npshez model downstream concentrations are simulated by numerical convolution fig 3 the btc produced shows similar trends in time to peak however an overall difference in peak concentrations is observed the first hybrid unit presents a right skewed curve however the curves tend towards a normally distributed skewness downstream bearing that the first hybrid unit represents the first pollutant injection in the control volume differences in the arrival and trailing tails as the pollutants travel downstream is evident between both models the hcis npshez model demonstrates more extended arrival and trailing tails and more rounded concentration peaks consistent with stream tracer test results 3 3 testing of the model using field data to further validate the model field data for chloride concentrations obtained from bencala et al 1990 are used the study area snake river colorado bencala et al 1990 is mountainous with unlying precambrian rocks plume granite and swandyke hornblende gneiss hornberger et al 1994 the bed s porosity is estimated to be 0 2 morin et al 1993 leeman et al 2009 simulations for 628 m 2845 m 3192 m and 5231 m before and after the snake river and deer creek confluence were performed adu and kumarasamy 2020a 2020b a retardation factor of 1 1 was applied based on the bed porosity the simulated btc was compared with actual field data from bencala et al 1990 presented in figs 4 and 5 for control purposes and to further understand the effects of hyporheic zones on contaminant fate in water bodies a retardation factor of 1 0 was used fig 4 tables 1 and 2 show the parameters used for the simulations the results show that when r 1 1 the btc of the model is similar and consistent with the field tracer test results for the four simulated points figs 4 and 5 the early arrival of the pollutant trail when r 1 0 is understandable as r 1 0 indicates the absence of porosity in the riverbed and therefore no interaction between the stream and hyporheic zone the models performance is evaluated using statistical tools and tested at a 95 percent confidence level for the coefficient of determination r2 and standard error se between the observed and simulated data r2 for river reach lengths of 628 m and 2845 m is 0 9724 and 0 8468 while for reaches 3192 and 5231 it is 0 9341 and 0 8577 further se at 628 m and 2845 m is 1 462e 1 and 2 227e 1 while for 3192 m and 5231 m is 7 616e 2 and 1 224e 1 the results show a good correlation between the measured and simulated results showing a relatively high coefficient of determination and corresponding low standard error for all four river reaches the overall results show a good correlation between the measured and simulated results for r 1 1 4 conclusion hyporheic exchange is an integral part of stream dynamics which accounts for fluctuations in pollutant concentration profiles in streams streambeds typically absorb contaminants from the overflow stream and release it at a later time the exchange between the sediment water interface and the hyporheic zone is principally responsible for the long tails of btc in field tracer tests the ability to effectively simulate the patterns of pollutant concentrations in water bodies is of utmost importance to water resource managers to ensure stream water quality and safety consequently an appropriate tool to achieve this is essential in this study a hyporheic component was added to the previously developed hcis nps model adu and kumarasamy 2020b a three pronged approach was implemented to validate the model s efficiency and establish its suitability for simulation of pollutant fate and transport in natural streams and rivers with non point source pollutant inflows and hyporheic exchange processes first the model was tested using synthetic data to establish its response and performance under varying stream conditions flow pollutant loading sources and streambed porosity the performance of the hcis npshez model was also compared with the results from simulations using the ade model which is known to predict pollutants behavior in water bodies insufficiently finally the model was validated with field tracer test data extracted from literature in all cases the proposed model demonstrated its ability to adequately represent pollutant fate behaviour in natural streams and rivers as observed in field tracer tests in the present study the hcis npshez model only simulates equilibrium conditions therefore interactions between the storage zone and the overflowing stream are minimal nevertheless the proposed hcis npshez model has proven its capability to adequately capture the changes in concentration gradients along a natural river with non point source inflows and hyporheic exchange the simplicity of the model ease of computation and low data requirement make it a useful water quality tool credit authorship contribution statement joy tuoyo

4924,a laboratory based empirical assessment of hydraulics of sand filters was carried out under the compelling practical condition of exposure to alternate cycles wet and dry spell of filtration the lab scale simulations purportedly attempted to mimic the field scale condition of sediment loading in runoff as suspended sediment the sand filters having a layer thickness of 50 cm and 30 cm with a particle size of 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm on the gravel pebble base were tested for the progressive change in hydraulic conductivity and sediment removal during the filtration event under a combination of treatments using different sediment concentrations 1 5 g l 1 2 g l 1 and 2 5 g l 1 and water heads 20 cm and 40 cm a sharp reduction in filter hydraulic conductivity was observed in the case of higher sediment concentration a filtration hiatus of 2 days between tests resulted in significant improvement in the hydraulic conductivity of the filter matrix the provisions of pre entry sedimentation trap before filtration could maintain a scaled up hydraulic conductivities for a longer duration a layer of additional reinforcement of an agro net above the filter matrix though facilitated easy cleaning after a filtration event but resulted in a scaled down hydraulic efficiency removal of the top 3 to 4 cm of the filter top could recover about 70 to 80 of the initial hydraulic conductivity after filtration of sediment equivalent to 16 1 and 17 0 kg m 2 the top deposition accounted for 72 07 and 73 12 respectively which along with the sediment entrapped in the top 5 cm accounted for more than 87 of the total sediment a steady state concentration of sediment in the filtrate in all the above combinations was found to converge asymptotically below 0 10 g l 1 which in a limited means used as a basis to custom designed field scale recharge filter using the sand as matrix filter keywords recharge filter hydraulic conductivity sediment suspension filtration infiltration 1 introduction groundwater in india is depleting at the rate of 10 25 cm per year tripathi 2018 and net annual ground water availability is estimated to be 398 billion cubic meter suhag 2016 the gross mismatch between groundwater withdrawal and recharge is indicative of a crisis like situation leaving a large number of the wells either dried or defunct in india biswas et al 2017 declining ground water level due to over exploitation warrants urgent augmentation measures such as the adoption of improved water saving technologies recharge linked withdrawal policies and incentivizing community based aquifer management practices jain 2012 national water policy 2012 agriculture consumes 60 of the total groundwater extracted and is overtly dependent on it gandhi and namboodiri 2009 siebert et al 2010 further decentralized groundwater recharge in the central part of india often thrives on the practice of diverting excess runoff from agricultural landscapes to the wells posing a serious threat to groundwater quality and eventual sealing of wells and aquifer pores edward et al 2016 nap 1994 there are several reports on the groundwater augmentation by diverting excess farmland runoff employing traditional sand and gravel filters to arrest impurities bell et al 1995 torrens et al 2009 nassar and hajjaj 2013 in those adaptations the treated filtrates were either discharged to the storm drainage system or directly to the surface water bodies whilst providing sufficient space and opportunity time for the surface runoff to pass through the filter media the filtration through a filter media is a complex trade off between filtration efficiency and filtration rate that warrants critical attention segismundo et al 2017 where extended filtration time to better filtration efficiency induces the risk of damage to the standing crop non compliance to the adequate filtration amounted to risking groundwater contamination edward et al 2016 storm runoff from the agricultural land contains higher sediment in suspension due to frequent soil disturbances kumar et al 2014 kurothe et al 2014 rendering the filter media vulnerable to clogging le coustumer and barraud 2007 the very limited scope of the provision of roughing filter in the agricultural field with standing crop further complicates the process hashimoto et al 2019 the particle size distribution of sand bedding depth of the filter s and suspended sediment load in runoff have been reported as the main factors affecting the filtration rate and purification performance of the filters torrens et al 2009 anderson et al 1985 though clogging has been reported to improve the filtration efficiency the hydraulic efficiency or the filtration rate diminished over the successive filtration cycles edward et al 2016 le coustumer and barraud 2007 dry wells have been used for stormwater management and aquifer recharge but the concern of groundwater contamination has not been attended properly edward et al 2016 systematic long term studies to characterize the effect of filtration cycles on hydraulic conductivity and its subsequent effect on filtration efficiency are obscure in the indian context and elsewhere these overarching issues at the hindsight motivated the present study in which laboratory experiments were carried out to make an empirical assessment of the hydraulic performance of recharge filters with their myriad and compelling conditions of exposure to events comprising the cycles of filtration and filtration hiatus the study also corroborated the effects on hydraulics when incorporating activities predominant to field scale implementation of the recharge filters purportedly the provision of pre entry sedimentation and scrapping of surface deposition to improve filtration efficiency the generated information on hydraulic performance was employed to evolve the field scenarios to help decision making on design dimensions of the recharge filter for efficiency and effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at icar indian institute of soil and water conservation research centre vasad gujarat india with an aim to develop a suitable filter design for augmenting groundwater recharge using dried and defunct wells in the semi arid region of central gujarat 2 1 1 laboratory setup for recharge filter laboratory setup developed for filtration test consists of three components as described below and also shown in fig 1 2 1 2 filtration unit it consists of acrylic cylinders of 300 mm diameter having heights of 80 and 120 cm that accommodates different depths of filter matrix on a perforated base sediment suspension was delivered on top of the filter material with impounding of the desired level i e 40 cm or 20 as per treatment the five combinations of filter material with two sub combinations with sediment traps given in table 1 were tested the sand filter material of desired particle size 2mm or 0 2 0 5 mm was filled up to the desired depths 50 or 30 cm in the acrylic cylinder over an 18 cm 10 cm size 20 30 mm 5 cm size 5 10 mm 3 cm 2 5 mm layer of pebbles and gravels placed over the perforated base of the filter unit in combination 2 and 3 a layer of nylon agronet 250 gsm 50 opening with 2 mm mesh size was applied on top of filter matrix along with water impounding of 40 cm and 20 cm respectively 2 1 3 sediment preparation and handling setup it comprised of a metallic cylindrical drum of 200l capacity kept at the ground for preparation of sediment suspension an overhead impounding facility of capacity 400l was created which consisted of a reservoir with six outlet valves for the continuous and regulated supply of sediment suspension to different filtration units after preparation the sediment suspension was lifted using a small sludge pump 0 5 hp to the overhead tank from where it was supplied to the filtration unit the excess solution delivered on the filtration unit gets recycled back to the sediment solution through the efflux pipe a provision to maintain constant head over the filtration unit sediment trap in the form of a similar acrylic cylinder of suitable height but with water head of 5 cm or 118 cm as per the treatment 1b and 1c respectively was placed in between the overhead tank and filtration unit in order to get removal of some of the coarser suspension from sediment solution fig 1q for other treatments no such sediment trap was used 2 1 4 filtrate collection tank it consists of a galvanized iron gi cylindrical drum of 57 cm diameter and 95 cm height that was placed beneath the filtration unit to collect the filtrate from the filtration unit the bottom of the drum was connected to a slanting glass tube gauge slanted at 600 angles from horizontal through a flexible transparent tube to record transient water level in the drum the flow chart of the procedure of filtration test with different combinations of the filter is presented in fig 2 in some of the filter setup the filtration test was repeated after a rest period of 2 days which is a practical period of hiatus of runoff events of the area during the rainy season monsoon during this hiatus the deposited material on the surface of the filtration unit was dried in situ using a ceiling fan to emulate a natural open environment condition otherwise constraint under a closed laboratory setup for analyzing the sediment deposition pattern on the top of the filter an additional setup of the sand filter of combination 1a was subjected to five cycles of filtration using 220 356 560 785 and 850 cm of sediment suspension per sq cm of filter surface after each individual test cycle the top surface was dried sediment flakes were carefully removed and the top 10 cm sand was replaced with fresh sand the time period of the individual test cycle spanned from 1 to 6 days including the overnight resting period of 12 14 hrs every day for each filtration cycle filtration was continued till the hydraulic conductivity reduced below 20 cm hr 1 hereafter referred to as unit filtration cycle 2 2 filter materials and sediment suspension filtration materials comprising of sand gravel and pebbles were collected from a nearby river mahi river a natural choice for such materials and were washed dried and sieved to prepare the desired filter matrix the materials were segregated to a size 2 mm ungraded and 0 2 to 0 5 mm the particle size distribution of sand was determined using the wet sieving method black 1965 in order to mimic naturally occurring stormwater sediment sediment loads from the abandoned experimental setup of the research farm of vasad were collected from their collection tanks at the end of the monsoon season the sediment constituents i e sand silt and clay contents were determined using the international pipette method piper 1966 tap water was used to prepare the sediment suspension of various sediment concentrations table 1 this was comparable to the field conditions except for relatively higher solute concentration in tap water 0 72 to 0 95 g l 1 as compared to natural surface runoff 0 18 to 0 27 g l 1 the mixture was continuously stirred to keep sediment in suspension various combinations of filter materials were tested for filtration rate and filtration efficiency table 1 2 3 hydraulic conductivity of the filter medium the filtration through the filter unit viz sand filter was made under constant water head hence darcy s law eq 1 may be applied suitably for the flow through filter under low water head conditions freeze and cherry 1979 hydraulic conductivity and its changing behavior with changing media properties have been used as an indicator in the present study the filtrate discharge was converted into saturated hydraulic conductivity using darcy s law equation eq 1 converting discharge into hydraulic conductivity has the advantage of scale neutrality 1 q k a δ h δ l where q is the discharge passing through the filter k is hydraulic conductivity of the media a is cross section of the filter across water flow δ h δ l is the hydraulic gradient 2 4 determination of deposited and trapped sediment at the end of the three consecutive filtration cycles of the treatment 1a table 1 each at a 2 days event hiatus period sediment deposited on the top of the second setup was dried and the dried flakes were removed carefully expecting a possible sediment deposition gradient along the flow length of the filter matrix sand layer from different depths i e 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 50 cm were removed and samples amounting to 100gm were collected from each layers the modified particle size distribution of these samples was determined using yoder s wet sieving apparatus black 1965 the samples were analyzed for particle sizes by passing it through an array of sieve having openings of size 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 2 mm and 0 1 mm sequentially samples retained on respective sieves were dried weighed and expressed as percentage the change in particle size distribution over the original was interpreted as the quantum of entrapped sediment mathematically the mass of particular size sediment entrapped in top 5 cm layer m was computed as 2 m w p n p 100 p n whereas w is the pre filtration mass of sand in top 5 cm layer p is the pre filtration percentage of sand particle of particle size 0 2 mm percentage of particle 0 1 mm and in 0 1 0 2 mm pn is the post filtration percentage of sand particle of particle size 0 2 mm illustration a supplementary file if m is the total mass of sediment used in filtration test the percentage entrapment in top 5 cm was computed as 3 entrapement m m 100 in other test setups described as 1b and 1c in table 1 a provision of a stilling reservoir was made to allow sedimentation before entry of the sediment suspension to the filter top in this case the sediment deposited in the stilling reservoir sediment trap was entirely collected dried and expressed as pre entry sedimentation percentage as 4 pre e n t r y s e d i m e n t a t i o n w vs 100 where w is the dry weight of sediment deposited in the stilling reservoir g v and s are the volume of sediment suspensions l passed the reservoir and the sediment concentrations g l 1 respectively 2 5 filtration performance the filtration efficiency fe of a filter is defined as the ratio of relative change in sediment concentration between suspension si and the filtrate so to that of the suspension si and is expressed as a percentage hutten 2016 5 filtration e f f i c i e n c y f e 1 s o s i 100 filtration efficiency fe as criteria of filter performance evaluation is often misleading because even in case of high fe there is a possibility of high sediment concentration in the filtrate which is not desired in the present study a threshold value of sediment concentration in the filtrate was suggested as a parameter for filtration performance kumar et al 2012 filtrate samples were collected periodically in graduated beakers directly from the discharge through the filter bottom samples were dried and weighed along with the equal volume of tap water in a separate beaker to make the correction for solute content assuming no alteration in solute content by filtration 3 results and discussion natural groundwater recharge in the central gujarat region accounts for about 8 of the annual rainfall of 700 to 800 mm sharda et al 2006 the agricultural land parcels in the region are fairly big and are capable of producing adequate storm runoff kumar et al 2014 to have a discernible effect on groundwater augmentation kurothe et al 2012 however with the bigger stretch of the land the runoff also carries a huge load of sediments in suspension a case study on surface water quality kumar and sena 2011 was carried out with the samples collected at the outlets of 4 different agricultural catchments having area of 0 4 to 0 9 ha from the vejalpura rampura watershed central gujarat india the samples were analyzed for potential impurities such as inorganic and organic constituents those could be potentially detrimental to groundwater a objective comparison to water samples collected from 40 wells revealed the relatively lower content of co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na in runoff samples than those from the groundwater kurothe et al 2012 further with no trace of heavy metals measured in the runoff and the least possibility of heavy metals in absence of any potential sites nearby the scoping to target the filtration candidate was limited to the suspended sediment only though the sediment concentration in runoff samples were observed in the range of 1 0 to 5 6 g l 1 for filtration test sediment concentration of 1 5 to 2 5 g l 1 were used 3 1 size distribution of filter materials and sediment suspension the natural non graded sand with particle size 2 mm referred hereafter as 2 mm and sand of particle size between 0 2 and 0 5 mm was used for filtration besides in the non graded sand particle size 2 mm a dominant proportion of the particles was found in the range of 0 2 to 0 5 mm size the sediment suspension used for the filtration test had almost all particles of size 0 2 mm fine sand was the dominant fraction in the sediment suspension used for filtration table 2 fine sand as a dominant constituent in the soil as well as in sediments from this region has been reported kumar et al 2014 kurothe et al 2014 the particle size distribution of sediment 0 2 mm in relation to changes in the particle size distribution of sand 0 2 mm was used for quantification of entrapped sediment 3 2 particle size distribution effect on hydraulic conductivity eight sets comprising different combinations of sand bed thickness pre entry sedimentation provision i e direct or through stilling basin fig 1q the particle size of the filter bed impounding depth over filtration unit different sediment concentrations and surface layers table 1 were subjected to repeated tests using the laboratory setup the hydraulic conductivities of sand layers of particle size 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm were determined using sediment free water and found in the range of 520 3 545 5 cm hr 1 and 610 5 632 1 cm hr 1 respectively these values were found in the order to confirm the practical ranges with the particle distributions mentioned freeze and cherry 1979 hwang et al 2017 and computed by the various equations wang et al 2017 relatively lower hydraulic conductivity of sand layer with particle size 2 mm may be attributed to reduced macropores due to the presence of finer particles in the sand the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity with an increasing amount of finer particles in the sand has been widely reported alakayleh et al 2018 komine 2008 sallfors and oberg hogsta 2002 3 2 1 effect of direct application of sediment suspension the sand filter comprising a 50 cm thick sand layer of particle size 0 2 mm combination 1a table 1 was subjected to a filtration test using sediment concentration of 2 g l 1 at constant head of 40 cm in this case sediment suspension from the overhead tank was directly taken to the filter top fig 1 the actual sediment concentration reaching to the filter top was also monitored and found to be in the range of 1 74 to 2 24 g l 1 fig 4 c 1a instead of the uniform rate of 2 g l 1 achieved during the complete filtration cycle a sharp reduction in the hydraulic conductivity showing asymptotic tendency with the progress of filtration was apparent and may be attributed to the sediment deposition on the top and entrapped in the filter medium in the combination 1a the hydraulic conductivity reduced from 520 4 cm hr 1 to 17 cm hr 1 with cumulative filtration of about 480 cm of sediment suspension fig 4c 1a which corresponds to a total of 680 g of sediment used in the filtration test equivalent to 0 96 g of sediment per square centimeter of filter surface fig 4c 1a the reduction in hydraulic conductivity could be better explained by the exponential relation between hydraulic conductivity and cumulative filtration or the cumulative amount of sediment fig 4 and table 3 the sediment layer observed at the filter top indicated the deposition of a majority of sediments leaving only a small portion to enter the filter body considering the size distribution of sediments in comparison to the sand particles table 2 size exclusion seems the dominant mechanism initially for surface deposition of sediments civan 2000 gao 2007 the deposited sediments on the filter top became the governing layer for any forthcoming parcel of sediment suspension and would have furthered deposition through size exclusion including straining ponding of sediment suspension over the filter would have also added to gravity settling higher with the reduction in flow through the filter to see the effect of a time break between two runoff events expected under field conditions on the hydraulic conductivity the filtration test of the combination 1a resumed after a resting period of 2 days under accelerated drying the initial hydraulic conductivity of 181 2 cm hr 1 after the resting period of 2 days as against 16 cm hr 1 the last observation of the previous filtration test indicated substantial recovery of hydraulic conductivity which may be attributed to increased porosity in sediment layer deposit on the top of the filter due to flocculation and cracking the realignment of entrapped sediment due to drying leading to increased porosity is another possibility for an increase in the hydraulic conductivity however this recovery was short lived as it reduced with progress of the filtration and fallen below the threshold level 20 cm hr 1 with cumulative filtration of about 285 cm fig 4c 1a further break of 2 days before the third filtration test cycle yielded partial recovery as the initial hydraulic conductivity was 109 cm hr 1 which shortly fallen below the 20 cm hr 1 with cumulative filtration of 66 cm the hydraulic conductivity y under various test scenarios could be better explained as the exponential function of cumulative amount of filtration x 6 y a e bx where a and b are equation parameters a indicates initial value whereas b indicates the rate of change of hydraulic conductivity the value of a and b for various conditions of filtration tests are presented in table 3 a negative value of b indicates the reduction in hydraulic conductivity with increase in cumulative filtration after three cycles of filtration test the dried and flaked top deposition was carefully removed and preserved for quantification the upper 3 4 cm of the sand layer was also removed before the resumption of the filtration test the initial hydraulic conductivity of 411 cm hr 1 about 79 of the fresh sand layer was recorded after scrapping the hydraulic conductivity further reduced sharply and found related exponentially with the amount of cumulative filtration fig 4c 1a table 3 the substantial recovery in hydraulic conductivity due to removal of top deposits and upper 3 4 cm of sand layer indicated the dominant role of top deposition and entrapment in the upper filter layer in reducing hydraulic conductivity limited invasion depths of sediment in sand filters have been reported in several studies kumar et al 2012 kambale et al 2009 van oort et al 1993 the initial hydraulic conductivity of different filter setup determined by sediment free tap water the a and b parameters of the exponential equation eq 6 explaining the change in filter hydraulic conductivity in relation to cumulative filtration and the amount of cumulative filtration by which hydraulic conductivity falls below 20 cm hr 1 for different filter combinations are presented in table 3 3 2 2 effect of stilling reservoir before filter bed entry filtration test of the filters described as a combination 1b and 1c table 1 were conducted combinations 1b and 1c are similar to the combination 1a except for the provision of sedimentation reservoir of depth 5 cm in case of 1b and of 118 cm in the case of 1c fig 1q in these cases sediment suspension from the overhead reservoir was first taken to the sedimentation reservoir and overflow from the sedimentation reservoir was taken to the filter top the combination 1b represents the condition of the filter with a raised rim whereas combination 1c represents the filter with pre entry sedimentation tank in the actual field condition in both cases hydraulic conductivity reduced with the progress of filtration but with relatively lower rate and even after cumulative filtration of 1256 cm 1b and 1420 cm 1c the hydraulic conductivity was above 90 cm hr 1 fig 4c 1b c 1c a rest period of 2 days resulted in substantial recovery of hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 47 to 53 of the initial hydraulic conductivity which further reduced with the progress of filtration table 3 after the two consecutive filtration test cycles the sediment deposited in the sedimentation reservoir acrylic cylinder having depth 5 cm 1b and 118 cm 1c were found to be 64 5 and 71 2 respectively of the total sediment used in the filtration test the lab setup having provision of sedimentation is though not a true representation of the field conditions because of the confined sedimentation area in lab testing as against the large and variable sedimentation area under field conditions constant head with runoff entry synchronized with the rate of filtration in lab condition instead of varying head under field conditions nevertheless the observations in lab testing broadly indicates the kind of processes anticipated in the field conditions provision of raised filter or sedimentation reservoir modifies the conditions and filtration starts only when the runoff level in the field exceeds the level of the filter rim filtration almost ceases when the runoff level reduces below the filter rim late start of filtration in the raised filter as compared to the field level filter was however more than compensated by the relatively higher hydraulic conductivity maintained for a longer period in the earlier case 3 2 3 filter with agronet as surface reinforcement for sand filters of combination 2 and combination 3 which were similar to combination 1a except for a nylon mesh sheet of 250 gsm thick having 50 opening with an opening size of about 2 mm on the top of the filter in case of combination 2 and 3 and a lower constant head of 20 cm in case of combination 3 table 1 sediment suspension from the overhead tank was directly taken to the filter top agronet sheet on the top of the filter resulted in a quicker reduction in hydraulic conductivity fig 4c 2 c 3 irrespective of the constant head of 40 cm combination 2 or 20 cm combination 3 blocking thus altering of pore size of the top sand layer by the agronet sheet because of misalignment and a relatively lower opening 50 would have increased size exclusion resulting in faster cake formation on the sheet faster sedimentation in case of low flow at the lower head 20 cm may be the reason of quicker reduction in hydraulic conductivity gao 2007 sansalone and ranieri 2012 the removal of agronet sheet along with the attached sediment after drying resulted in about 61 recovery of initial hydraulic conductivity in filer of combination 2 table 3 further tests after replacement of sheet resulted in sharper reduction b 0 0128 in hydraulic conductivity in combination 3 filtration test after a rest period of 2 days removal of the sheet with attached sediments and removal of top 3 4 cm of sand layer resulted in recovery of initial hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 29 55 and 70 respectively the recovery in hydraulic conductivity due to removal of the top layer was relatively lower 70 in this case as compared to the combination 1a 79 the variable amount of entrapped particle might be attributed to variation in the result the entry of a higher amount of sediments in the second filtration cycle after removal of top deposits might be the reason for lower hydraulic conductivity after scrapping the lower saturated hydraulic conductivity with a higher amount of finer particle in the sand layer has been reported alakayleh et al 2018 komine 2008 3 2 4 sand layer of particle size 0 2 0 5 mm filtration test of a sand layer of 50 cm having particle size of 0 2 to 0 5 mm described as combination 4 table 1 was conducted with a sediment concentration of 2 5 g l 1 at the constant head of 40 cm faster rate of reduction in hydraulic conductivity fig 4c 4 despite the relatively high initial hydraulic conductivity 620 3 cm hr 1 may be attributed to the fast sediment deposition on filter top due to relatively high sediment concentration moghadasi et al 2004 kumar et al 2012 removal of the top 3 4 cm sand layer along with the sediment deposited on the top resulted in substantial recovery in hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 75 of the pre filtration hydraulic conductivity table 3 the removal of top deposits and upper sand layers has been suggested as a possible and practical option for recovery of filter hydraulic conductivity weber shirk and dick 1997 le coustumer and barraud 2007 singer et al 2017 3 2 5 lower filter thickness with an aim to evaluate the performance of lower thickness filtration test of 30 cm sand layer particle size 2 mm described as combination 5 table 1 was conducted using a sediment concentration of 1 5 g l 1 at the constant head of 20 cm with the progress of filtration a reduction in hydraulic conductivity was observed which was exponentially related to cumulative filtration fig 4c 5 the rate of reduction was lower as reflected by the value of b parameter 0 0044 of the exponential function table 3 fig 4c 5 lower deposition of sediment on the filter top due to lower sediment concentration may be the reason for the lower rate of reduction in hydraulic conductivity table 3 and fig 4c 5 the resting period of 2 days between consecutive filtration test and removal of top 3 4 cm sand layer resulted in improvement in hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 32 and 71 respectively of the initial hydraulic conductivity though the lower thickness of 30 cm of sand layer was found capable in removing sediment except for the initial higher sediment in the filtrate fig 5a it reduces the scope of periodic scrapping of surface layer without re sanding under field conditions further the chance of surface disturbance in case of unregulated flow under field conditions increases the risk of using lower thickness higher layer thickness provides leverage of scrapping of upper layers for a longer period without re sanding clark et al 2012 the sharp reduction in filter hydraulic conductivity with the progress of filtration of sediment suspension was a common observation to all filtration tests more in case of higher sediment concentration and agronet sheet on the top and less in case of provision of pre entry sedimentation in almost all combinations the decrease in hydraulic conductivity during the first filtration cycle was found exponentially related to the cumulative amount of filtration the surface deposition was visible in all combinations that increased purification performance but at the cost of hydraulic conductivity a resting period of 2 days with rapid drying resulted in an increase in hydraulic conductivity provision of a pre entry sedimentation reservoir helped reduce sediment entry to the filter resulted in higher hydraulic conductivity maintained for a higher volume of filtration removal of sediment attached with agronet sheet sediment deposited on the top and removal of top 3 4 cm of sand layer resulted in substantial recovery in hydraulic conductivity but always less than the initial hydraulic conductivity of fresh sand layer entry and entrapment of finer particles in the sand layer were responsible for almost a permanent partial reduction in hydraulic conductivity which could not be recovered by removal of upper layer 3 3 deposition entrapment and sedimentation all combinations table 1 of filters were found prone to frequent clogging due to sediment deposition on the top and entrapment in the upper layer of the filter system filter performance is though specific to the nature of filter media the fluid used and flow rates mays and hunt 2005 changhong 2008 clogging of gravel and sand filter has been reported as a common major factor that limits filter performance segismundo et al 2017 siriwardene et al 2007 hatt et al 2007 the sediment suspension used for the filtration test has almost all particles of size 0 2 mm table 2 therefore change in particle composition of the sand layer due to sediment entrapment is expected only in the size of 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm percent change in other size fractions of sand are therefore only a relative change because of the actual change in the particles of size 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm careful removal of sediment deposited on the top of the filter combination 1a after 3 filtration cycles table 3 using a total sediment suspension of 805 cm depth 455 285 65 corresponds to a total of 1 168 kg of sediment equivalent to 1 16 g of sediment per square centimeter of filter surface accounted for 72 of total sediment used the comparison of pre and post filtration particle size composition of filter media indicates an increase in particles in the size range 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm higher in the top 5 cm sand layer table 5 the change in particle size composition and the initial weight of sand in the layer were used for computation of sediment entrapment sediment entrapped in the top 5 cm including top deposition accounted for 87 5 of the total sediment similarly in the replicate setup sediment deposition on the filter top after filtration of 850 cm along with sediment entrapment in the top 5 cm accounted for 89 5 of the total sediment used in the filtration test the sediment entrapment in top 10 cm has been reported to be 80 to 90 sharma et al 2017 kumar et al 2012 analysis of data from table 4 using equations 2 and 3 for particular size ranges 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm indicates 14 6 of the total sediment entrapped in top 5 cm out of which 67 4 are of the size 0 1 mm sediment entrapment in top 5 cm accounted for about 65 of total sediment entrapped in the filter for understanding the sediment deposition pattern 5 additional cycles of filtration test were conducted on the filter of combination 1a using five different amounts of sediment suspension the top 10 cm of the sand layer was removed and re sanded after each filtration cycle the result presented in fig 6 indicates the increasing percentage of deposition with an increasing amount of sediment suspension a sharp increase in marginal additional deposition per unit of additional sediment used sediment deposition showing asymptotic tendency was observed fig 6 during the initial stage of filtration some finer sediment enters the sand layer depending on the relative size of pores however a substantial amount of larger particles get deposited on the surface which results in the formation of a thin layer of sediment on the top of the filter once a sediment layer developed on the top this acts as a governing layer for the next parcel of sediment suspension due to very less macroporosity and similar particle size the majority of the forthcoming sediments get excluded and thus deposited on the surface the external cake formation and sediment invasion of shorter distance partly support the 1 3 1 7 thumb rule abrams 1977 and 1 3 1 14 rule van oort et al 1993 in which external bridging is possible in case particle size is larger than the 1 3rd of the pore diameter and can pass through if the diameter is smaller than the 1 7 or 1 14th of the pore diameter in the present study though the pore diameters were not measured but the relative particle size of sediments in comparison to the filter medium table 2 indicates a relatively larger size of sediment as compared to the probable pore sizes enabling quicker surface deposition due to size straining the provision of sedimentation before the entry of sediment suspension to the filter unit combination 1b and 1c table 1 could reduce sediment entry to the main filter body thus helped maintain higher conductivity of the filter media the sediment deposited in sedimentation tank of 0 05 m and 1 18 m depth accounts of 64 5 and 71 4 of the total sediment used in the filtration test respectively the textural analysis of the sediment deposited in the sedimentation tank reveals the 76 3 of sand 17 2 of silt and 6 5 clay indicating preferential deposition of the coarser fraction 3 4 filtration performance higher amount of sediments were passing through filter body during the initial stage of filtration in all the combinations comprising different filter thickness hydraulic heads particle sizes of the sand and the sediment concentrations fig 5a the sediment concentration in the filtrate reduced with progressing filtration and it became lower than 0 1 g l 1 in all cases once reduced below the critical limit the sediment concentration was maintained well below the critical limit of 0 1 g l 1 with slight fluctuations when the hydraulic conductivity reduced to about 1 3rd of the initial value with the progress of filtration the sediment concentration in filtrate came down to less than or about 0 10 g l 1 which may be explained by the reduced macro porosity due to sediment deposition at the top and entrapment in the upper layer of the filter the transitory increase of sediment concentration in the filtrate after scrapping of top 3 4 cm fig 5b and further reduction with the progress of filtration also corroborates the dominant role of top deposits in improving filtration performance the slight fluctuation though within the overall limit 0 1 g l 1 indicates the release of some of the entrapped fine particle during the filtration process qualitative assessment of settling time of sediments in the filtrate indicates the presence of only clay size particles due to more number of macropores in the fresh sand layer some fine size particle would pass through but with the progress of filtration it gets reduced because of top deposition and entrapment resulting in reduced macroporosity relatively a higher amount of sediment was found passing through the filter having particles of size 0 2 0 5 mm and also through the filter with a lower thickness 30 cm initially that quickly attenuated and fallen below the defined threshold level with the progress of filtration though the 30 cm thick sand layer was found sufficient enough to reduce sediment concentration below the threshold level under laboratory condition of regulated flow however the lower thickness which further reduces after scrapping of top 3 4 cm render it vulnerable to surface disturbance under field conditions of unregulated flow the sediment concentration observed across the different combinations of the filter was found linearly and positively related to the hydraulic conductivity fig 5c which corroborates the expected and the observed behavior reported elsewhere edward et al 2016 chen et al 2007 3 5 application of test results development of field scale scenarios the artificial groundwater recharge is being promoted at the national level in india and direct well recharge using dead and defunct wells is being seen as a promising practical option laboratory based filtration test of various combination of sand gravel filters provided insights into the appropriate thickness of sand layer considering hydraulic conductivity dynamics sediment deposition pattern provision of sedimentation and practice of removal of the top sand layer however for field adoption the decision on the dimension of filter targeting a defined amount of filtration considering field conditions and prevailing rainfall has to be made to help decision making for field adoption field scenarios using laboratory based results were generated in addition to the targeted amount of filtration the time spell of filtration and infiltration is also important a longer duration may be detrimental to the standing crop the result of filtration dynamics obtained was used for generating field scenario of natural infiltration filtration and excess runoff for defined field conditions rainfall events filter dimensions and sediment concentrations the following two designs were considered for this purpose design a filter with a sand layer thickness of 50 cm mounted on the gravel and pebble base of 18 cm filter top at the adjoining field level design b same as filter a except for the filter rim raised by 0 05 m from the adjoining surface and top of the sand layer of the filter is 0 15 m below the rim fig 3 the simulation considers runoff parcel spread near the bund every minute once the height exceeds the filter rim runoff enters the filter and filtration started when runoff height exceeds bunds height i e 0 25 m excess runoff goes out of the field different field dimension at a slope of 2 with an infiltration rate of 10 mm hr 1 daily rainfall with a uniform intensity of 30 mm hr 1 were considered for every minute computation off runoff ponded area natural infiltration filtration and excess runoff going out of the field table 5 total runoff for the given rainfall was estimated using soil conservation service curve number scs cn method the time of concentration for overland flow was computed using kerby method for overland flow kerby 1959 7 t c 1 44 l 0 n s 0 5 0 467 where t c is the time of concentration in minutes l 0 is the length of the overland flow m n is the roughness coefficient and s is the slope fraction m m 1 peak runoff was computed using rational formula sharda et al 2007 dhruvanarayana 1993 8 q p cia 360 where q p is peak runoff rate m3 s 1 c is the runoff coefficient i is the rainfall intensity mm hr 1 and a is the area hectare once the peak rate is attained a uniform peak rate was assumed for the entire period of the rainfall event before the peak rate is attained a linear increase from zero runoff to peak rate was assumed this assumption is in corroboration with the modified rational method approach viessman and lewis 2003 runoff generated natural infiltration from the ponded area filtration and excess runoff were computed every minute in both the designs natural infiltration begins with the first parcel of runoff generated and it continues till any runoff is left in the field in leveled filter type a the filtration also takes place simultaneously with infiltration whereas in the case of raised filter type b filtration starts only when the runoff impoundment height exceeds the rim height of the filter the modification in curve number due to water storage and spread which is expected to increase overall runoff was ignored for computational simplicity moreover the increased unaccounted infiltration due to higher heads would have partially compensated for the extra runoff due to modified surface conditions an excel based program using lab based result scs curve number method for estimation of runoff the rational formula for peak runoff rate was developed for simulation of the parcel of runoff infiltration filtration and excess runoff every minute the time of concentration peak runoff rate and amount of runoff generated for the plot size of 100 m 100 m and 100 m 50 m were 15 4 and 17 2 min 0 017 m3 s 1 and 0 033 m3 s 1 411 4 m3 and 205 7 m3 respectively for the rainfall of 100 mm at a uniform intensity of 30 mm hr 1 the runoffs for 50 mm rainfall for the same conditions were 92 87 m3 and 46 43 m3 respectively table 5 for a field level filter without provision of sedimentation resembling the filter described as combination 1a table 1 the infiltration and filtration begin simultaneously infiltration volume per minute increases with increasing runoff spread area it reaches the maximum conditioned by either maximum runoff volume or field bund height in case runoff impoundment height reaches exceeds the bund height 0 25 m infiltration volume per minute attains peak and remains constant at peak till the runoff generation continues because of the constant runoff spread area maintained during this period fig 7a once the runoff generation stops the runoff spread area starts reducing due to filtration and infiltration till no runoff remains in the field out of 205 7 m3 runoff produced from the field of 100 m 50 m for the rainfall of 100 mm the cumulative infiltration cumulative filtration filter dimension 9m2 and excess runoff were 73 1 m3 60 1 m3 and 72 4 m3 respectively table 5 and fig 7a in this case the infiltration and filtration continued for the duration of 1246 min fig 7a runoff generated with 50 mm rainfall for the same plot size was 46 4 m3 out of which 7 9 m3 were infiltrated and rest got filtered table 5 leaving no excess runoff for different plot sizes rainfall and filter dimensions the infiltrated filtered and excess runoff volumes are presented in table 5 a large proportion of excess runoff going out of 100 m 100 m field for 100 mm rainfall and longer duration of filtration indicates the inappropriateness of the filter dimension of 9 m2 filter with raised rim in the case of raised filter rim resembling the filter described as combination 1b table 1 the reduction in hydraulic conductivity was though apparent but at a relatively lower rate which may be attributed to a less sediment entry to the main filter out of the 46 4 m3 runoff simulated from a rainfall of 50 mm in a plot of 100 m 50 m 39 1 m3 got filtered through a 6 m2 filter the rest of the runoff 7 3 m3 got infiltrated leaving no excess runoff going out of the plot from the same setup cumulative infiltration cumulative filtration and cumulative excess runoff were 50 3 109 4 and 46 1 m3 out of 205 7 m3 runoff simulated for a rainfall of 100 mm infiltration continued for 0 to 996 min filtration started at 10 min after the beginning of infiltration and continued till 721 min whereas excess runoff started at 147 min and continue till 213 min fig 7b and table 5 the infiltration filtration and excess runoff from different combinations of plot sizes rainfall and filter sizes presented in table 4 reveals the relatively longer filtration life of raised filter which is mainly due to the provision of sedimentation before the entry of runoff to the main filter body the developed excel based program can be used for the generation of field scenarios for the various conditions helpful in deciding the dimension of filter however final decision of adoption must be made considering various factors including pollutants load in runoff space requirement availability and distance of dead and defunct wells conducive geologic conditions for recharge provision of maintenance scrapping and re sanding and the cost of installation assuming all the filtered runoff put to dry wells eventually reaches the aquifer the additional recharge was computed to be in the range of 70 to more than 350 of the natural recharge of about 8 of the rainfall reported by sharda et al 2006 the additional recharge may be higher in the case of poor infiltration rate 4 conclusions direct well recharge may be a promising option of artificial groundwater recharge in water scarce semiarid and arid regions provided the quality of runoff is sufficiently improved by means of a filter the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of fresh sand materials was found exponentially related with the cumulative amount of sediment suspension used for filtration faster reduction with high sediment concentration and agro net sheet on the top the rest period between consecutive filtration cycles though resulted in partial recovery of hydraulic conductivity but cannot be considered as maintenance options in field adoption because of its transitory and small impact a sharp reduction in conductivity with the progress of filtration mainly due to clogging of the top surface and significant recovery after removal of top 3 4 cm of layer indicates the possibility to periodic scraping off as a practical maintenance option the effectiveness of the provision of sedimentation before the entry of sediment suspension to the filter in reducing sediment entry to the filter unit which helped maintain better hydraulic conductivity indicates the importance of raised rim of the filter and sedimentation tank putting agro net on the top of the filter though initially added to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity but improved ease of cleaning and can be adopted in a situation where frequent removal and cleaning of the sheet is possible the sediment deposition on the filter top 72 and entrapment in the top 5 cm accounted for more than 87 5 of the total sediment equivalent to 1 61 g cm 2 used in the filtration test an inverse relation between hydraulic conductivity and sediment removal efficiency was apparent the average sediment concentration in the filtrate for the entire filtration cycle was 0 1 g l 1 lower in case of a higher thickness of the sand layer the developed excel based program can be used for simulating runoff infiltration filtration and excess runoff under a variety of conditions to help decision making with the provision of scrapping off top 3 4 cm before the beginning of each rainy season or after the cumulative filtration of about 500 m3 of runoff sand filter with dimension 9m2with raised rim by 5 8 cm seems appropriate for 0 5 ha of agricultural catchment in the semiarid regions of india however other factors including the chemical content of runoff conducive geologic conditions and the cost of installation must be considered before field adoption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

4924,a laboratory based empirical assessment of hydraulics of sand filters was carried out under the compelling practical condition of exposure to alternate cycles wet and dry spell of filtration the lab scale simulations purportedly attempted to mimic the field scale condition of sediment loading in runoff as suspended sediment the sand filters having a layer thickness of 50 cm and 30 cm with a particle size of 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm on the gravel pebble base were tested for the progressive change in hydraulic conductivity and sediment removal during the filtration event under a combination of treatments using different sediment concentrations 1 5 g l 1 2 g l 1 and 2 5 g l 1 and water heads 20 cm and 40 cm a sharp reduction in filter hydraulic conductivity was observed in the case of higher sediment concentration a filtration hiatus of 2 days between tests resulted in significant improvement in the hydraulic conductivity of the filter matrix the provisions of pre entry sedimentation trap before filtration could maintain a scaled up hydraulic conductivities for a longer duration a layer of additional reinforcement of an agro net above the filter matrix though facilitated easy cleaning after a filtration event but resulted in a scaled down hydraulic efficiency removal of the top 3 to 4 cm of the filter top could recover about 70 to 80 of the initial hydraulic conductivity after filtration of sediment equivalent to 16 1 and 17 0 kg m 2 the top deposition accounted for 72 07 and 73 12 respectively which along with the sediment entrapped in the top 5 cm accounted for more than 87 of the total sediment a steady state concentration of sediment in the filtrate in all the above combinations was found to converge asymptotically below 0 10 g l 1 which in a limited means used as a basis to custom designed field scale recharge filter using the sand as matrix filter keywords recharge filter hydraulic conductivity sediment suspension filtration infiltration 1 introduction groundwater in india is depleting at the rate of 10 25 cm per year tripathi 2018 and net annual ground water availability is estimated to be 398 billion cubic meter suhag 2016 the gross mismatch between groundwater withdrawal and recharge is indicative of a crisis like situation leaving a large number of the wells either dried or defunct in india biswas et al 2017 declining ground water level due to over exploitation warrants urgent augmentation measures such as the adoption of improved water saving technologies recharge linked withdrawal policies and incentivizing community based aquifer management practices jain 2012 national water policy 2012 agriculture consumes 60 of the total groundwater extracted and is overtly dependent on it gandhi and namboodiri 2009 siebert et al 2010 further decentralized groundwater recharge in the central part of india often thrives on the practice of diverting excess runoff from agricultural landscapes to the wells posing a serious threat to groundwater quality and eventual sealing of wells and aquifer pores edward et al 2016 nap 1994 there are several reports on the groundwater augmentation by diverting excess farmland runoff employing traditional sand and gravel filters to arrest impurities bell et al 1995 torrens et al 2009 nassar and hajjaj 2013 in those adaptations the treated filtrates were either discharged to the storm drainage system or directly to the surface water bodies whilst providing sufficient space and opportunity time for the surface runoff to pass through the filter media the filtration through a filter media is a complex trade off between filtration efficiency and filtration rate that warrants critical attention segismundo et al 2017 where extended filtration time to better filtration efficiency induces the risk of damage to the standing crop non compliance to the adequate filtration amounted to risking groundwater contamination edward et al 2016 storm runoff from the agricultural land contains higher sediment in suspension due to frequent soil disturbances kumar et al 2014 kurothe et al 2014 rendering the filter media vulnerable to clogging le coustumer and barraud 2007 the very limited scope of the provision of roughing filter in the agricultural field with standing crop further complicates the process hashimoto et al 2019 the particle size distribution of sand bedding depth of the filter s and suspended sediment load in runoff have been reported as the main factors affecting the filtration rate and purification performance of the filters torrens et al 2009 anderson et al 1985 though clogging has been reported to improve the filtration efficiency the hydraulic efficiency or the filtration rate diminished over the successive filtration cycles edward et al 2016 le coustumer and barraud 2007 dry wells have been used for stormwater management and aquifer recharge but the concern of groundwater contamination has not been attended properly edward et al 2016 systematic long term studies to characterize the effect of filtration cycles on hydraulic conductivity and its subsequent effect on filtration efficiency are obscure in the indian context and elsewhere these overarching issues at the hindsight motivated the present study in which laboratory experiments were carried out to make an empirical assessment of the hydraulic performance of recharge filters with their myriad and compelling conditions of exposure to events comprising the cycles of filtration and filtration hiatus the study also corroborated the effects on hydraulics when incorporating activities predominant to field scale implementation of the recharge filters purportedly the provision of pre entry sedimentation and scrapping of surface deposition to improve filtration efficiency the generated information on hydraulic performance was employed to evolve the field scenarios to help decision making on design dimensions of the recharge filter for efficiency and effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at icar indian institute of soil and water conservation research centre vasad gujarat india with an aim to develop a suitable filter design for augmenting groundwater recharge using dried and defunct wells in the semi arid region of central gujarat 2 1 1 laboratory setup for recharge filter laboratory setup developed for filtration test consists of three components as described below and also shown in fig 1 2 1 2 filtration unit it consists of acrylic cylinders of 300 mm diameter having heights of 80 and 120 cm that accommodates different depths of filter matrix on a perforated base sediment suspension was delivered on top of the filter material with impounding of the desired level i e 40 cm or 20 as per treatment the five combinations of filter material with two sub combinations with sediment traps given in table 1 were tested the sand filter material of desired particle size 2mm or 0 2 0 5 mm was filled up to the desired depths 50 or 30 cm in the acrylic cylinder over an 18 cm 10 cm size 20 30 mm 5 cm size 5 10 mm 3 cm 2 5 mm layer of pebbles and gravels placed over the perforated base of the filter unit in combination 2 and 3 a layer of nylon agronet 250 gsm 50 opening with 2 mm mesh size was applied on top of filter matrix along with water impounding of 40 cm and 20 cm respectively 2 1 3 sediment preparation and handling setup it comprised of a metallic cylindrical drum of 200l capacity kept at the ground for preparation of sediment suspension an overhead impounding facility of capacity 400l was created which consisted of a reservoir with six outlet valves for the continuous and regulated supply of sediment suspension to different filtration units after preparation the sediment suspension was lifted using a small sludge pump 0 5 hp to the overhead tank from where it was supplied to the filtration unit the excess solution delivered on the filtration unit gets recycled back to the sediment solution through the efflux pipe a provision to maintain constant head over the filtration unit sediment trap in the form of a similar acrylic cylinder of suitable height but with water head of 5 cm or 118 cm as per the treatment 1b and 1c respectively was placed in between the overhead tank and filtration unit in order to get removal of some of the coarser suspension from sediment solution fig 1q for other treatments no such sediment trap was used 2 1 4 filtrate collection tank it consists of a galvanized iron gi cylindrical drum of 57 cm diameter and 95 cm height that was placed beneath the filtration unit to collect the filtrate from the filtration unit the bottom of the drum was connected to a slanting glass tube gauge slanted at 600 angles from horizontal through a flexible transparent tube to record transient water level in the drum the flow chart of the procedure of filtration test with different combinations of the filter is presented in fig 2 in some of the filter setup the filtration test was repeated after a rest period of 2 days which is a practical period of hiatus of runoff events of the area during the rainy season monsoon during this hiatus the deposited material on the surface of the filtration unit was dried in situ using a ceiling fan to emulate a natural open environment condition otherwise constraint under a closed laboratory setup for analyzing the sediment deposition pattern on the top of the filter an additional setup of the sand filter of combination 1a was subjected to five cycles of filtration using 220 356 560 785 and 850 cm of sediment suspension per sq cm of filter surface after each individual test cycle the top surface was dried sediment flakes were carefully removed and the top 10 cm sand was replaced with fresh sand the time period of the individual test cycle spanned from 1 to 6 days including the overnight resting period of 12 14 hrs every day for each filtration cycle filtration was continued till the hydraulic conductivity reduced below 20 cm hr 1 hereafter referred to as unit filtration cycle 2 2 filter materials and sediment suspension filtration materials comprising of sand gravel and pebbles were collected from a nearby river mahi river a natural choice for such materials and were washed dried and sieved to prepare the desired filter matrix the materials were segregated to a size 2 mm ungraded and 0 2 to 0 5 mm the particle size distribution of sand was determined using the wet sieving method black 1965 in order to mimic naturally occurring stormwater sediment sediment loads from the abandoned experimental setup of the research farm of vasad were collected from their collection tanks at the end of the monsoon season the sediment constituents i e sand silt and clay contents were determined using the international pipette method piper 1966 tap water was used to prepare the sediment suspension of various sediment concentrations table 1 this was comparable to the field conditions except for relatively higher solute concentration in tap water 0 72 to 0 95 g l 1 as compared to natural surface runoff 0 18 to 0 27 g l 1 the mixture was continuously stirred to keep sediment in suspension various combinations of filter materials were tested for filtration rate and filtration efficiency table 1 2 3 hydraulic conductivity of the filter medium the filtration through the filter unit viz sand filter was made under constant water head hence darcy s law eq 1 may be applied suitably for the flow through filter under low water head conditions freeze and cherry 1979 hydraulic conductivity and its changing behavior with changing media properties have been used as an indicator in the present study the filtrate discharge was converted into saturated hydraulic conductivity using darcy s law equation eq 1 converting discharge into hydraulic conductivity has the advantage of scale neutrality 1 q k a δ h δ l where q is the discharge passing through the filter k is hydraulic conductivity of the media a is cross section of the filter across water flow δ h δ l is the hydraulic gradient 2 4 determination of deposited and trapped sediment at the end of the three consecutive filtration cycles of the treatment 1a table 1 each at a 2 days event hiatus period sediment deposited on the top of the second setup was dried and the dried flakes were removed carefully expecting a possible sediment deposition gradient along the flow length of the filter matrix sand layer from different depths i e 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 50 cm were removed and samples amounting to 100gm were collected from each layers the modified particle size distribution of these samples was determined using yoder s wet sieving apparatus black 1965 the samples were analyzed for particle sizes by passing it through an array of sieve having openings of size 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 2 mm and 0 1 mm sequentially samples retained on respective sieves were dried weighed and expressed as percentage the change in particle size distribution over the original was interpreted as the quantum of entrapped sediment mathematically the mass of particular size sediment entrapped in top 5 cm layer m was computed as 2 m w p n p 100 p n whereas w is the pre filtration mass of sand in top 5 cm layer p is the pre filtration percentage of sand particle of particle size 0 2 mm percentage of particle 0 1 mm and in 0 1 0 2 mm pn is the post filtration percentage of sand particle of particle size 0 2 mm illustration a supplementary file if m is the total mass of sediment used in filtration test the percentage entrapment in top 5 cm was computed as 3 entrapement m m 100 in other test setups described as 1b and 1c in table 1 a provision of a stilling reservoir was made to allow sedimentation before entry of the sediment suspension to the filter top in this case the sediment deposited in the stilling reservoir sediment trap was entirely collected dried and expressed as pre entry sedimentation percentage as 4 pre e n t r y s e d i m e n t a t i o n w vs 100 where w is the dry weight of sediment deposited in the stilling reservoir g v and s are the volume of sediment suspensions l passed the reservoir and the sediment concentrations g l 1 respectively 2 5 filtration performance the filtration efficiency fe of a filter is defined as the ratio of relative change in sediment concentration between suspension si and the filtrate so to that of the suspension si and is expressed as a percentage hutten 2016 5 filtration e f f i c i e n c y f e 1 s o s i 100 filtration efficiency fe as criteria of filter performance evaluation is often misleading because even in case of high fe there is a possibility of high sediment concentration in the filtrate which is not desired in the present study a threshold value of sediment concentration in the filtrate was suggested as a parameter for filtration performance kumar et al 2012 filtrate samples were collected periodically in graduated beakers directly from the discharge through the filter bottom samples were dried and weighed along with the equal volume of tap water in a separate beaker to make the correction for solute content assuming no alteration in solute content by filtration 3 results and discussion natural groundwater recharge in the central gujarat region accounts for about 8 of the annual rainfall of 700 to 800 mm sharda et al 2006 the agricultural land parcels in the region are fairly big and are capable of producing adequate storm runoff kumar et al 2014 to have a discernible effect on groundwater augmentation kurothe et al 2012 however with the bigger stretch of the land the runoff also carries a huge load of sediments in suspension a case study on surface water quality kumar and sena 2011 was carried out with the samples collected at the outlets of 4 different agricultural catchments having area of 0 4 to 0 9 ha from the vejalpura rampura watershed central gujarat india the samples were analyzed for potential impurities such as inorganic and organic constituents those could be potentially detrimental to groundwater a objective comparison to water samples collected from 40 wells revealed the relatively lower content of co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na in runoff samples than those from the groundwater kurothe et al 2012 further with no trace of heavy metals measured in the runoff and the least possibility of heavy metals in absence of any potential sites nearby the scoping to target the filtration candidate was limited to the suspended sediment only though the sediment concentration in runoff samples were observed in the range of 1 0 to 5 6 g l 1 for filtration test sediment concentration of 1 5 to 2 5 g l 1 were used 3 1 size distribution of filter materials and sediment suspension the natural non graded sand with particle size 2 mm referred hereafter as 2 mm and sand of particle size between 0 2 and 0 5 mm was used for filtration besides in the non graded sand particle size 2 mm a dominant proportion of the particles was found in the range of 0 2 to 0 5 mm size the sediment suspension used for the filtration test had almost all particles of size 0 2 mm fine sand was the dominant fraction in the sediment suspension used for filtration table 2 fine sand as a dominant constituent in the soil as well as in sediments from this region has been reported kumar et al 2014 kurothe et al 2014 the particle size distribution of sediment 0 2 mm in relation to changes in the particle size distribution of sand 0 2 mm was used for quantification of entrapped sediment 3 2 particle size distribution effect on hydraulic conductivity eight sets comprising different combinations of sand bed thickness pre entry sedimentation provision i e direct or through stilling basin fig 1q the particle size of the filter bed impounding depth over filtration unit different sediment concentrations and surface layers table 1 were subjected to repeated tests using the laboratory setup the hydraulic conductivities of sand layers of particle size 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm were determined using sediment free water and found in the range of 520 3 545 5 cm hr 1 and 610 5 632 1 cm hr 1 respectively these values were found in the order to confirm the practical ranges with the particle distributions mentioned freeze and cherry 1979 hwang et al 2017 and computed by the various equations wang et al 2017 relatively lower hydraulic conductivity of sand layer with particle size 2 mm may be attributed to reduced macropores due to the presence of finer particles in the sand the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity with an increasing amount of finer particles in the sand has been widely reported alakayleh et al 2018 komine 2008 sallfors and oberg hogsta 2002 3 2 1 effect of direct application of sediment suspension the sand filter comprising a 50 cm thick sand layer of particle size 0 2 mm combination 1a table 1 was subjected to a filtration test using sediment concentration of 2 g l 1 at constant head of 40 cm in this case sediment suspension from the overhead tank was directly taken to the filter top fig 1 the actual sediment concentration reaching to the filter top was also monitored and found to be in the range of 1 74 to 2 24 g l 1 fig 4 c 1a instead of the uniform rate of 2 g l 1 achieved during the complete filtration cycle a sharp reduction in the hydraulic conductivity showing asymptotic tendency with the progress of filtration was apparent and may be attributed to the sediment deposition on the top and entrapped in the filter medium in the combination 1a the hydraulic conductivity reduced from 520 4 cm hr 1 to 17 cm hr 1 with cumulative filtration of about 480 cm of sediment suspension fig 4c 1a which corresponds to a total of 680 g of sediment used in the filtration test equivalent to 0 96 g of sediment per square centimeter of filter surface fig 4c 1a the reduction in hydraulic conductivity could be better explained by the exponential relation between hydraulic conductivity and cumulative filtration or the cumulative amount of sediment fig 4 and table 3 the sediment layer observed at the filter top indicated the deposition of a majority of sediments leaving only a small portion to enter the filter body considering the size distribution of sediments in comparison to the sand particles table 2 size exclusion seems the dominant mechanism initially for surface deposition of sediments civan 2000 gao 2007 the deposited sediments on the filter top became the governing layer for any forthcoming parcel of sediment suspension and would have furthered deposition through size exclusion including straining ponding of sediment suspension over the filter would have also added to gravity settling higher with the reduction in flow through the filter to see the effect of a time break between two runoff events expected under field conditions on the hydraulic conductivity the filtration test of the combination 1a resumed after a resting period of 2 days under accelerated drying the initial hydraulic conductivity of 181 2 cm hr 1 after the resting period of 2 days as against 16 cm hr 1 the last observation of the previous filtration test indicated substantial recovery of hydraulic conductivity which may be attributed to increased porosity in sediment layer deposit on the top of the filter due to flocculation and cracking the realignment of entrapped sediment due to drying leading to increased porosity is another possibility for an increase in the hydraulic conductivity however this recovery was short lived as it reduced with progress of the filtration and fallen below the threshold level 20 cm hr 1 with cumulative filtration of about 285 cm fig 4c 1a further break of 2 days before the third filtration test cycle yielded partial recovery as the initial hydraulic conductivity was 109 cm hr 1 which shortly fallen below the 20 cm hr 1 with cumulative filtration of 66 cm the hydraulic conductivity y under various test scenarios could be better explained as the exponential function of cumulative amount of filtration x 6 y a e bx where a and b are equation parameters a indicates initial value whereas b indicates the rate of change of hydraulic conductivity the value of a and b for various conditions of filtration tests are presented in table 3 a negative value of b indicates the reduction in hydraulic conductivity with increase in cumulative filtration after three cycles of filtration test the dried and flaked top deposition was carefully removed and preserved for quantification the upper 3 4 cm of the sand layer was also removed before the resumption of the filtration test the initial hydraulic conductivity of 411 cm hr 1 about 79 of the fresh sand layer was recorded after scrapping the hydraulic conductivity further reduced sharply and found related exponentially with the amount of cumulative filtration fig 4c 1a table 3 the substantial recovery in hydraulic conductivity due to removal of top deposits and upper 3 4 cm of sand layer indicated the dominant role of top deposition and entrapment in the upper filter layer in reducing hydraulic conductivity limited invasion depths of sediment in sand filters have been reported in several studies kumar et al 2012 kambale et al 2009 van oort et al 1993 the initial hydraulic conductivity of different filter setup determined by sediment free tap water the a and b parameters of the exponential equation eq 6 explaining the change in filter hydraulic conductivity in relation to cumulative filtration and the amount of cumulative filtration by which hydraulic conductivity falls below 20 cm hr 1 for different filter combinations are presented in table 3 3 2 2 effect of stilling reservoir before filter bed entry filtration test of the filters described as a combination 1b and 1c table 1 were conducted combinations 1b and 1c are similar to the combination 1a except for the provision of sedimentation reservoir of depth 5 cm in case of 1b and of 118 cm in the case of 1c fig 1q in these cases sediment suspension from the overhead reservoir was first taken to the sedimentation reservoir and overflow from the sedimentation reservoir was taken to the filter top the combination 1b represents the condition of the filter with a raised rim whereas combination 1c represents the filter with pre entry sedimentation tank in the actual field condition in both cases hydraulic conductivity reduced with the progress of filtration but with relatively lower rate and even after cumulative filtration of 1256 cm 1b and 1420 cm 1c the hydraulic conductivity was above 90 cm hr 1 fig 4c 1b c 1c a rest period of 2 days resulted in substantial recovery of hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 47 to 53 of the initial hydraulic conductivity which further reduced with the progress of filtration table 3 after the two consecutive filtration test cycles the sediment deposited in the sedimentation reservoir acrylic cylinder having depth 5 cm 1b and 118 cm 1c were found to be 64 5 and 71 2 respectively of the total sediment used in the filtration test the lab setup having provision of sedimentation is though not a true representation of the field conditions because of the confined sedimentation area in lab testing as against the large and variable sedimentation area under field conditions constant head with runoff entry synchronized with the rate of filtration in lab condition instead of varying head under field conditions nevertheless the observations in lab testing broadly indicates the kind of processes anticipated in the field conditions provision of raised filter or sedimentation reservoir modifies the conditions and filtration starts only when the runoff level in the field exceeds the level of the filter rim filtration almost ceases when the runoff level reduces below the filter rim late start of filtration in the raised filter as compared to the field level filter was however more than compensated by the relatively higher hydraulic conductivity maintained for a longer period in the earlier case 3 2 3 filter with agronet as surface reinforcement for sand filters of combination 2 and combination 3 which were similar to combination 1a except for a nylon mesh sheet of 250 gsm thick having 50 opening with an opening size of about 2 mm on the top of the filter in case of combination 2 and 3 and a lower constant head of 20 cm in case of combination 3 table 1 sediment suspension from the overhead tank was directly taken to the filter top agronet sheet on the top of the filter resulted in a quicker reduction in hydraulic conductivity fig 4c 2 c 3 irrespective of the constant head of 40 cm combination 2 or 20 cm combination 3 blocking thus altering of pore size of the top sand layer by the agronet sheet because of misalignment and a relatively lower opening 50 would have increased size exclusion resulting in faster cake formation on the sheet faster sedimentation in case of low flow at the lower head 20 cm may be the reason of quicker reduction in hydraulic conductivity gao 2007 sansalone and ranieri 2012 the removal of agronet sheet along with the attached sediment after drying resulted in about 61 recovery of initial hydraulic conductivity in filer of combination 2 table 3 further tests after replacement of sheet resulted in sharper reduction b 0 0128 in hydraulic conductivity in combination 3 filtration test after a rest period of 2 days removal of the sheet with attached sediments and removal of top 3 4 cm of sand layer resulted in recovery of initial hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 29 55 and 70 respectively the recovery in hydraulic conductivity due to removal of the top layer was relatively lower 70 in this case as compared to the combination 1a 79 the variable amount of entrapped particle might be attributed to variation in the result the entry of a higher amount of sediments in the second filtration cycle after removal of top deposits might be the reason for lower hydraulic conductivity after scrapping the lower saturated hydraulic conductivity with a higher amount of finer particle in the sand layer has been reported alakayleh et al 2018 komine 2008 3 2 4 sand layer of particle size 0 2 0 5 mm filtration test of a sand layer of 50 cm having particle size of 0 2 to 0 5 mm described as combination 4 table 1 was conducted with a sediment concentration of 2 5 g l 1 at the constant head of 40 cm faster rate of reduction in hydraulic conductivity fig 4c 4 despite the relatively high initial hydraulic conductivity 620 3 cm hr 1 may be attributed to the fast sediment deposition on filter top due to relatively high sediment concentration moghadasi et al 2004 kumar et al 2012 removal of the top 3 4 cm sand layer along with the sediment deposited on the top resulted in substantial recovery in hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 75 of the pre filtration hydraulic conductivity table 3 the removal of top deposits and upper sand layers has been suggested as a possible and practical option for recovery of filter hydraulic conductivity weber shirk and dick 1997 le coustumer and barraud 2007 singer et al 2017 3 2 5 lower filter thickness with an aim to evaluate the performance of lower thickness filtration test of 30 cm sand layer particle size 2 mm described as combination 5 table 1 was conducted using a sediment concentration of 1 5 g l 1 at the constant head of 20 cm with the progress of filtration a reduction in hydraulic conductivity was observed which was exponentially related to cumulative filtration fig 4c 5 the rate of reduction was lower as reflected by the value of b parameter 0 0044 of the exponential function table 3 fig 4c 5 lower deposition of sediment on the filter top due to lower sediment concentration may be the reason for the lower rate of reduction in hydraulic conductivity table 3 and fig 4c 5 the resting period of 2 days between consecutive filtration test and removal of top 3 4 cm sand layer resulted in improvement in hydraulic conductivity to the tune of 32 and 71 respectively of the initial hydraulic conductivity though the lower thickness of 30 cm of sand layer was found capable in removing sediment except for the initial higher sediment in the filtrate fig 5a it reduces the scope of periodic scrapping of surface layer without re sanding under field conditions further the chance of surface disturbance in case of unregulated flow under field conditions increases the risk of using lower thickness higher layer thickness provides leverage of scrapping of upper layers for a longer period without re sanding clark et al 2012 the sharp reduction in filter hydraulic conductivity with the progress of filtration of sediment suspension was a common observation to all filtration tests more in case of higher sediment concentration and agronet sheet on the top and less in case of provision of pre entry sedimentation in almost all combinations the decrease in hydraulic conductivity during the first filtration cycle was found exponentially related to the cumulative amount of filtration the surface deposition was visible in all combinations that increased purification performance but at the cost of hydraulic conductivity a resting period of 2 days with rapid drying resulted in an increase in hydraulic conductivity provision of a pre entry sedimentation reservoir helped reduce sediment entry to the filter resulted in higher hydraulic conductivity maintained for a higher volume of filtration removal of sediment attached with agronet sheet sediment deposited on the top and removal of top 3 4 cm of sand layer resulted in substantial recovery in hydraulic conductivity but always less than the initial hydraulic conductivity of fresh sand layer entry and entrapment of finer particles in the sand layer were responsible for almost a permanent partial reduction in hydraulic conductivity which could not be recovered by removal of upper layer 3 3 deposition entrapment and sedimentation all combinations table 1 of filters were found prone to frequent clogging due to sediment deposition on the top and entrapment in the upper layer of the filter system filter performance is though specific to the nature of filter media the fluid used and flow rates mays and hunt 2005 changhong 2008 clogging of gravel and sand filter has been reported as a common major factor that limits filter performance segismundo et al 2017 siriwardene et al 2007 hatt et al 2007 the sediment suspension used for the filtration test has almost all particles of size 0 2 mm table 2 therefore change in particle composition of the sand layer due to sediment entrapment is expected only in the size of 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm percent change in other size fractions of sand are therefore only a relative change because of the actual change in the particles of size 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm careful removal of sediment deposited on the top of the filter combination 1a after 3 filtration cycles table 3 using a total sediment suspension of 805 cm depth 455 285 65 corresponds to a total of 1 168 kg of sediment equivalent to 1 16 g of sediment per square centimeter of filter surface accounted for 72 of total sediment used the comparison of pre and post filtration particle size composition of filter media indicates an increase in particles in the size range 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm higher in the top 5 cm sand layer table 5 the change in particle size composition and the initial weight of sand in the layer were used for computation of sediment entrapment sediment entrapped in the top 5 cm including top deposition accounted for 87 5 of the total sediment similarly in the replicate setup sediment deposition on the filter top after filtration of 850 cm along with sediment entrapment in the top 5 cm accounted for 89 5 of the total sediment used in the filtration test the sediment entrapment in top 10 cm has been reported to be 80 to 90 sharma et al 2017 kumar et al 2012 analysis of data from table 4 using equations 2 and 3 for particular size ranges 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 2 mm indicates 14 6 of the total sediment entrapped in top 5 cm out of which 67 4 are of the size 0 1 mm sediment entrapment in top 5 cm accounted for about 65 of total sediment entrapped in the filter for understanding the sediment deposition pattern 5 additional cycles of filtration test were conducted on the filter of combination 1a using five different amounts of sediment suspension the top 10 cm of the sand layer was removed and re sanded after each filtration cycle the result presented in fig 6 indicates the increasing percentage of deposition with an increasing amount of sediment suspension a sharp increase in marginal additional deposition per unit of additional sediment used sediment deposition showing asymptotic tendency was observed fig 6 during the initial stage of filtration some finer sediment enters the sand layer depending on the relative size of pores however a substantial amount of larger particles get deposited on the surface which results in the formation of a thin layer of sediment on the top of the filter once a sediment layer developed on the top this acts as a governing layer for the next parcel of sediment suspension due to very less macroporosity and similar particle size the majority of the forthcoming sediments get excluded and thus deposited on the surface the external cake formation and sediment invasion of shorter distance partly support the 1 3 1 7 thumb rule abrams 1977 and 1 3 1 14 rule van oort et al 1993 in which external bridging is possible in case particle size is larger than the 1 3rd of the pore diameter and can pass through if the diameter is smaller than the 1 7 or 1 14th of the pore diameter in the present study though the pore diameters were not measured but the relative particle size of sediments in comparison to the filter medium table 2 indicates a relatively larger size of sediment as compared to the probable pore sizes enabling quicker surface deposition due to size straining the provision of sedimentation before the entry of sediment suspension to the filter unit combination 1b and 1c table 1 could reduce sediment entry to the main filter body thus helped maintain higher conductivity of the filter media the sediment deposited in sedimentation tank of 0 05 m and 1 18 m depth accounts of 64 5 and 71 4 of the total sediment used in the filtration test respectively the textural analysis of the sediment deposited in the sedimentation tank reveals the 76 3 of sand 17 2 of silt and 6 5 clay indicating preferential deposition of the coarser fraction 3 4 filtration performance higher amount of sediments were passing through filter body during the initial stage of filtration in all the combinations comprising different filter thickness hydraulic heads particle sizes of the sand and the sediment concentrations fig 5a the sediment concentration in the filtrate reduced with progressing filtration and it became lower than 0 1 g l 1 in all cases once reduced below the critical limit the sediment concentration was maintained well below the critical limit of 0 1 g l 1 with slight fluctuations when the hydraulic conductivity reduced to about 1 3rd of the initial value with the progress of filtration the sediment concentration in filtrate came down to less than or about 0 10 g l 1 which may be explained by the reduced macro porosity due to sediment deposition at the top and entrapment in the upper layer of the filter the transitory increase of sediment concentration in the filtrate after scrapping of top 3 4 cm fig 5b and further reduction with the progress of filtration also corroborates the dominant role of top deposits in improving filtration performance the slight fluctuation though within the overall limit 0 1 g l 1 indicates the release of some of the entrapped fine particle during the filtration process qualitative assessment of settling time of sediments in the filtrate indicates the presence of only clay size particles due to more number of macropores in the fresh sand layer some fine size particle would pass through but with the progress of filtration it gets reduced because of top deposition and entrapment resulting in reduced macroporosity relatively a higher amount of sediment was found passing through the filter having particles of size 0 2 0 5 mm and also through the filter with a lower thickness 30 cm initially that quickly attenuated and fallen below the defined threshold level with the progress of filtration though the 30 cm thick sand layer was found sufficient enough to reduce sediment concentration below the threshold level under laboratory condition of regulated flow however the lower thickness which further reduces after scrapping of top 3 4 cm render it vulnerable to surface disturbance under field conditions of unregulated flow the sediment concentration observed across the different combinations of the filter was found linearly and positively related to the hydraulic conductivity fig 5c which corroborates the expected and the observed behavior reported elsewhere edward et al 2016 chen et al 2007 3 5 application of test results development of field scale scenarios the artificial groundwater recharge is being promoted at the national level in india and direct well recharge using dead and defunct wells is being seen as a promising practical option laboratory based filtration test of various combination of sand gravel filters provided insights into the appropriate thickness of sand layer considering hydraulic conductivity dynamics sediment deposition pattern provision of sedimentation and practice of removal of the top sand layer however for field adoption the decision on the dimension of filter targeting a defined amount of filtration considering field conditions and prevailing rainfall has to be made to help decision making for field adoption field scenarios using laboratory based results were generated in addition to the targeted amount of filtration the time spell of filtration and infiltration is also important a longer duration may be detrimental to the standing crop the result of filtration dynamics obtained was used for generating field scenario of natural infiltration filtration and excess runoff for defined field conditions rainfall events filter dimensions and sediment concentrations the following two designs were considered for this purpose design a filter with a sand layer thickness of 50 cm mounted on the gravel and pebble base of 18 cm filter top at the adjoining field level design b same as filter a except for the filter rim raised by 0 05 m from the adjoining surface and top of the sand layer of the filter is 0 15 m below the rim fig 3 the simulation considers runoff parcel spread near the bund every minute once the height exceeds the filter rim runoff enters the filter and filtration started when runoff height exceeds bunds height i e 0 25 m excess runoff goes out of the field different field dimension at a slope of 2 with an infiltration rate of 10 mm hr 1 daily rainfall with a uniform intensity of 30 mm hr 1 were considered for every minute computation off runoff ponded area natural infiltration filtration and excess runoff going out of the field table 5 total runoff for the given rainfall was estimated using soil conservation service curve number scs cn method the time of concentration for overland flow was computed using kerby method for overland flow kerby 1959 7 t c 1 44 l 0 n s 0 5 0 467 where t c is the time of concentration in minutes l 0 is the length of the overland flow m n is the roughness coefficient and s is the slope fraction m m 1 peak runoff was computed using rational formula sharda et al 2007 dhruvanarayana 1993 8 q p cia 360 where q p is peak runoff rate m3 s 1 c is the runoff coefficient i is the rainfall intensity mm hr 1 and a is the area hectare once the peak rate is attained a uniform peak rate was assumed for the entire period of the rainfall event before the peak rate is attained a linear increase from zero runoff to peak rate was assumed this assumption is in corroboration with the modified rational method approach viessman and lewis 2003 runoff generated natural infiltration from the ponded area filtration and excess runoff were computed every minute in both the designs natural infiltration begins with the first parcel of runoff generated and it continues till any runoff is left in the field in leveled filter type a the filtration also takes place simultaneously with infiltration whereas in the case of raised filter type b filtration starts only when the runoff impoundment height exceeds the rim height of the filter the modification in curve number due to water storage and spread which is expected to increase overall runoff was ignored for computational simplicity moreover the increased unaccounted infiltration due to higher heads would have partially compensated for the extra runoff due to modified surface conditions an excel based program using lab based result scs curve number method for estimation of runoff the rational formula for peak runoff rate was developed for simulation of the parcel of runoff infiltration filtration and excess runoff every minute the time of concentration peak runoff rate and amount of runoff generated for the plot size of 100 m 100 m and 100 m 50 m were 15 4 and 17 2 min 0 017 m3 s 1 and 0 033 m3 s 1 411 4 m3 and 205 7 m3 respectively for the rainfall of 100 mm at a uniform intensity of 30 mm hr 1 the runoffs for 50 mm rainfall for the same conditions were 92 87 m3 and 46 43 m3 respectively table 5 for a field level filter without provision of sedimentation resembling the filter described as combination 1a table 1 the infiltration and filtration begin simultaneously infiltration volume per minute increases with increasing runoff spread area it reaches the maximum conditioned by either maximum runoff volume or field bund height in case runoff impoundment height reaches exceeds the bund height 0 25 m infiltration volume per minute attains peak and remains constant at peak till the runoff generation continues because of the constant runoff spread area maintained during this period fig 7a once the runoff generation stops the runoff spread area starts reducing due to filtration and infiltration till no runoff remains in the field out of 205 7 m3 runoff produced from the field of 100 m 50 m for the rainfall of 100 mm the cumulative infiltration cumulative filtration filter dimension 9m2 and excess runoff were 73 1 m3 60 1 m3 and 72 4 m3 respectively table 5 and fig 7a in this case the infiltration and filtration continued for the duration of 1246 min fig 7a runoff generated with 50 mm rainfall for the same plot size was 46 4 m3 out of which 7 9 m3 were infiltrated and rest got filtered table 5 leaving no excess runoff for different plot sizes rainfall and filter dimensions the infiltrated filtered and excess runoff volumes are presented in table 5 a large proportion of excess runoff going out of 100 m 100 m field for 100 mm rainfall and longer duration of filtration indicates the inappropriateness of the filter dimension of 9 m2 filter with raised rim in the case of raised filter rim resembling the filter described as combination 1b table 1 the reduction in hydraulic conductivity was though apparent but at a relatively lower rate which may be attributed to a less sediment entry to the main filter out of the 46 4 m3 runoff simulated from a rainfall of 50 mm in a plot of 100 m 50 m 39 1 m3 got filtered through a 6 m2 filter the rest of the runoff 7 3 m3 got infiltrated leaving no excess runoff going out of the plot from the same setup cumulative infiltration cumulative filtration and cumulative excess runoff were 50 3 109 4 and 46 1 m3 out of 205 7 m3 runoff simulated for a rainfall of 100 mm infiltration continued for 0 to 996 min filtration started at 10 min after the beginning of infiltration and continued till 721 min whereas excess runoff started at 147 min and continue till 213 min fig 7b and table 5 the infiltration filtration and excess runoff from different combinations of plot sizes rainfall and filter sizes presented in table 4 reveals the relatively longer filtration life of raised filter which is mainly due to the provision of sedimentation before the entry of runoff to the main filter body the developed excel based program can be used for the generation of field scenarios for the various conditions helpful in deciding the dimension of filter however final decision of adoption must be made considering various factors including pollutants load in runoff space requirement availability and distance of dead and defunct wells conducive geologic conditions for recharge provision of maintenance scrapping and re sanding and the cost of installation assuming all the filtered runoff put to dry wells eventually reaches the aquifer the additional recharge was computed to be in the range of 70 to more than 350 of the natural recharge of about 8 of the rainfall reported by sharda et al 2006 the additional recharge may be higher in the case of poor infiltration rate 4 conclusions direct well recharge may be a promising option of artificial groundwater recharge in water scarce semiarid and arid regions provided the quality of runoff is sufficiently improved by means of a filter the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of fresh sand materials was found exponentially related with the cumulative amount of sediment suspension used for filtration faster reduction with high sediment concentration and agro net sheet on the top the rest period between consecutive filtration cycles though resulted in partial recovery of hydraulic conductivity but cannot be considered as maintenance options in field adoption because of its transitory and small impact a sharp reduction in conductivity with the progress of filtration mainly due to clogging of the top surface and significant recovery after removal of top 3 4 cm of layer indicates the possibility to periodic scraping off as a practical maintenance option the effectiveness of the provision of sedimentation before the entry of sediment suspension to the filter in reducing sediment entry to the filter unit which helped maintain better hydraulic conductivity indicates the importance of raised rim of the filter and sedimentation tank putting agro net on the top of the filter though initially added to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity but improved ease of cleaning and can be adopted in a situation where frequent removal and cleaning of the sheet is possible the sediment deposition on the filter top 72 and entrapment in the top 5 cm accounted for more than 87 5 of the total sediment equivalent to 1 61 g cm 2 used in the filtration test an inverse relation between hydraulic conductivity and sediment removal efficiency was apparent the average sediment concentration in the filtrate for the entire filtration cycle was 0 1 g l 1 lower in case of a higher thickness of the sand layer the developed excel based program can be used for simulating runoff infiltration filtration and excess runoff under a variety of conditions to help decision making with the provision of scrapping off top 3 4 cm before the beginning of each rainy season or after the cumulative filtration of about 500 m3 of runoff sand filter with dimension 9m2with raised rim by 5 8 cm seems appropriate for 0 5 ha of agricultural catchment in the semiarid regions of india however other factors including the chemical content of runoff conducive geologic conditions and the cost of installation must be considered before field adoption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
