11380,the annual water loss through evapotranspiration et is an uncertain but significant component of india s water budget the present study generated independent estimates of baseline annual et calibrated with in situ micrometeorological data over indian sub continent using surface energy balance framework and satellite based long term thermal remote sensing visible and near infrared observations as the primary data sources thirty years 1981 2010 of satellite based et estimates at 0 08 grid resolution were used to assess trend in regional et to find out change hot spots and probable causes long term collateral data influencing et such as gridded 0 5 0 5 annual rainfall rf annual mean surface soil moisture ssm at 25 km resolution from esa scatterometers and annual mean incoming shortwave radiation from merra 2d reanalysis were also analyzed mean annual et loss was found to be the highest for indian cropland 890 cubic km than forest 575 cubic km annual water consumption pattern over vegetation systems showed declining et trend at the rate of 16 cubic km yr 1 upto 1995 during 30 years which might be due to declining rainfall and solar dimming this was followed by increasing et trend 34 cubic km yr 1 during 2001 2010 irrigated cropland showed a steep increase in water consumption pattern with an average rate of 4 cubic km yr 1 while grassland and forest showed declining consumption patterns since 2003 and 2007 respectively thus showing crossover points of their consumption patterns with irrigated cropland four agriculturally important indian eastern central western and southern states showed significantly increasing et trend with s score of 15 25 and z score of 1 09 2 9 during this period increasing et in western and southern states was found to be coupled with increase in annual rainfall and ssm but in eastern and central states no significant trend in rainfall was observed though significant increase in et was noticed region specific correlation of annual et with natural forcing variables was higher for incoming shortwave radiation as compared to rainfall the increase in et over irrigated croplands as well as over some of the indian states could be due to increase in anthropogenic factors which need more detailed investigations in future abbreviations noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration pal pathfinder

balance thermal remote sensing 1 introduction evapotranspiration et provides a link between energy and water budget in hydrological cycle estimation of large scale et using space based observations has gained popularity with the advancement in optical and thermal remote sensing the long term trends of et and its forcing factors need to be understood and quantified under changing climatic conditions to address water security issues related to water rights water allocation crop water use efficiency human consumption and industrial water use several researchers have studied the impact of et under various climatic settings zeng et al 2012 estimated annual et over 59 major river basins for 2003 2009 using water balance approach where globally averaged land et was noticed to be about 604 mm yr 1with a range of 558 4650 mm yr 1 non significant trend in global land et over the last decade were the outcome of this study liu et al 2013 used dynamic land ecosystem model dlem to simulate et over a period of 1901 2008 and observed significant decrease in et over parts of basins of the gulf of mexico generally et decreased in western arid area while increase was observed in eastern part of their study area during the past 108 years long term et was characterized by gao et al 2012 over the haihe river basin in china for the period of 1960 2002 using the complementary relationship and the thornthwaite water balance wb approaches the annual et was found to exhibit decreasing trends in most parts of the haihe river basin increasing et over the past 50 years was reported walter et al 2004 for several large basins across the conterminous united states though global et showed an increasing trend in last two decades and no trend in the recent decade contrasting trends were reported over different countries river basins or even over different regions within a country moreover most of the above studies have used water balance methods to estimate et as residual of water budgeting and also the scale of et estimates through this approach was coarser in nature specific to indian sub tropics there is a knowledge gap in having long term trend on country scale and region specific finer resolution large scale et from surface energy balance and thermal remote sensing the proper attention has not been paid by water resource managers to bring out independent and reliable estimates of baseline climatic annual et over india s vegetated landmass using surface energy balance modeling narasimhan 2008 goroshi et al 2017 brought out inter seasonal and inter annual variability over india through trend analysis of monthly et data generated by zhang et al 2010 using only 24 years of noaa monthly ndvi data giims global inventory modelling and mapping studies computed from avhrr observations in optical remote sensing the et data were reported to be validated with 48 lysimeter stations of india meteorological department though monthly plots were shown for six stations only the study has certain lacunae which are following i thermal remote sensing has been found to be superior than optical remote sensing to estimate et anderson et al 2012 their study did not use any thermal remote sensing data ii the study did not make use of a complete climate series of 30 years satellite observations iii imd s lysimeter stations are reported to be 40 32 gravimetric and 8 volumetric types with lot of data discontinuity imd personal communication it was not clear how data gaps have been fulfilled iv several factors such as differences in height growth and density of vegetation between the lysimeter and outside vegetation interruption of deep percolation and horizontal flow components in soil within lysimeter tank heat flux distortion caused by highly conducive steel walls heavy rusting and corrosion in tanks due to exposure to soil water and weather for long period of time can severely affect et measurements farahani et al 2007 using lysimeters on the other hand the tower based et flux measurements represent larger foot print through surface energy balance measurements based on micrometeorological principles depending on the fetch ratios the above study did not try to use any such micrometeorological measurements available over india v the above study did not involve any new modelling approaches within surface energy balance framework with respect to net radiation soil heat flux evaporative fraction specific to indian sub tropics vi though it showed et variability and trend over major land cover types inter play of natural and anthropogenic influences on et as well as et trend explicitly over irrigated cropland were not highlighted even model simulated soil moisture data were used instead of climatic series of satellite based esa scatterometers surface soil moisture data vii all these resulted into large validation error of 38 on seasonal and 17 on annual scale with respect to lysimeter stations no bias correction was made on satellite based estimates before showing mean from long term satellite based et estimates viii moreover the study did not bring out the trend in volume of water consumption pattern in different cover types space applications centre of indian space research organization isro established a network of 23 micrometeorological towers of 10 m height during the years 2008 to 2011 with on field data transmission facility through yagi antenna to insat data relay transponder drt and subsequent reception at an earth station bhattacharya et al 2009 singh et al 2014 eswar et al 2013 these towers have multi height sensors for recording air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and direction four component net radiation two depth soil heat flux and three depth soil temperature rainfall with a sampling frequency of 5 min and averaged over 30 min these towers were located over cropland grassland shrubland and young forest spread over northern southern eastern western and central parts of india including north eastern hill region thar desert and andaman and nicobar islands with a fetch ratio varying from 1 50 to 1 100 the surface energy balance data from these towers provided unique opportunity to characterize et behavior and develop scaling functions bhattacharya et al 2013 for net longwave radiation bias correction of incoming shortwave radiation flux soil heat fluxes with respect to satellite based thermal remote sensing data in the present study these in conjunction with long term satellite thermal remote sensing data enabled to estimate evapotranspiration at 0 08 grid resolution through simplified model of surface energy balance whose accuracy has already been evaluated through separate studies mallick et al 2009 the country scale et data at 0 08 grid resolution were generated through a combination of micro metrological measurements scaling functions optical and thermal remote sensing observations from noaa series of satellites during 1981 to 2000 and bias corrected modis et product for the period 2001 to 2010 to complete a climatic series of 30 years the objectives of the present study are i to characterize baseline annual climatic et over indian sub tropical vegetation ii to evaluate the volumetric annual water consumption rates over major land cover types in the sub tropics over three decades with special emphasis on irrigated cropland in the last decade and iii to assess long term et trend to detect change hot spots and regions of influence of natural and anthropogenic forcing factors 2 study area climatic conditions of india are marked by tropical rainy season in its southern and temperate in the northern part it is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the north towards himalaya where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall the nation s climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert strong temperature variations in different seasons and south west monsoon are one of the most important characteristic of indian climate variability in the onset withdrawal and quantum of rainfall during the monsoon season has also profound impacts on water resources power generation agriculture economics and ecosystems in the country temperature ranges from about 10 c in winter to about 32 c in summer season attri and tyagi 2010 for this study the indian landmass extending from 5 to 38 n and 68 to 100 e has been considered as shown in fig 1 3 data used 3 1 satellite based evapotranspiration et 3 1 1 et from noaa avhrr for 1981 2000 monthly et was estimated at 0 08 spatial resolution in terms of latent heat flux as a residual of single source energy balance approach here evaporative fraction and net surface available energy mallick et al 2009 determined from optical and thermal remote sensing data in terms of noaa pathfinder avhrr land pal data were used the cloud gaps were filled through harmonic analysis of land surface variables such as ndvi surface albedo and land surface temprature lst it also used bias corrected shortwave radiation flux reanalysis field and linear and nonlinear scaling functions bhattacharya et al 2013 for net long wave radiation and soil heat fluxes 3 1 2 modis et data for 2001 2010 the modis et product commonly known as mod 16 et product was used here having temporal resolution of eight days and spatial resolution of 1 km the detail description of modis et generation is mentioned by mu et al 2007and 2011 and cleugh et al 2007 study annual et over indian landmass for the period of 2001 2010 were generated through eight day et product this annual et was further resampled to 0 08 grid resolution before using in this study 3 2 gridded rainfall the daily measured rainfall records converted into gridded rainfall at 0 5 x 0 5 grid resolution were used for this study the gridded data were generated by rajeevan et al 2006 using shepard interpolation method where measured rainfall data were from 1803 rain gauge stations of india meteorological department imd the daily gridded rainfall data were further summed up to compute annual rainfall these gridded daily rainfall data were averaged for the period of 1981 2010 3 3 satellite based surface soil moisture ssm data the global product of daily volumetric surface 0 5 cm soil moisture ssm at 25 km spatial resolution has been used here for the period of 1981 2010 this is a merged product from the observations of series of esa scatterometers and in situ moisture measurements of global soil moisture data bank http climate envsci rutgers edu soilmoisture the data were obtained from esa http www esa sm cci org the annual mean ssm of esa was computed from daily soil moisture data over indian landmass during the above mentioned period 3 4 reanalysis data the reanalysis data field from merra 2d on surface incident shortwave flux swf was used for the current study the spatial resolution of merra 2d is 2 3 longitude x 1 2 latitude the monthly incoming shortwave radiation data were converted to annual scale for the period of 1981 to 2010 4 land use land cover map of india the land use land cover lulc maps of india at 100 m spatial resolution produced through international geosphere biosphere programme igbp for 1985 1995 and 2005 https daac ornl gov were used for three decades 1981 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively details of the product are given in meiyappan et al 2017 and roy et al 2016 these were resampled to 0 08 grid resolution out of 19 classes five broad vegetation classes fig 2 a of cropland forest including all its sub types shrubland grassland and plantation were used for trend analysis however igbp lulc does not contain classes for irrigated and rainfed cropland therefore the lulc derived from spot vgt data agrawal et al 2003 at 1 km spatial resolution containing irrigated and rainfed cropland classes fig 2b has been used for the analysis for the period 2000 2010 for the comparison of noaa and modis et as well as et trend analysis over irrigated cropland and its comparison with respect to rainfed cropland grassland and forestland spot vgt based lulc was resampled to 0 08 grid resolution 5 methodology 5 1 regional land et model actual evapo transpiration aet here after referred as et was estimated from latent heat fluxes λ e o r l e and latent heat l of evaporation brutsaert and chen 1996 latent heat flux λe is generally computed as a residual of surface energy balance kustas et al 1994 moran et al 1994 mallick et al 2007 a single soil vegetation complex as single unit source surface energy balance can be written as 1 r n h g λ e m the energy component for metabolic activities m isverysmall samson and lemeur 2001 and hence can be neglected the eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 λ e r n g h r n net radiation wm 2 h sensible heat flux wm 2 g ground heat flux wm 2 r n g net available energy q in wm 2 assuming energy balance closure at any instance during a day eq 2 can be written as 3 λ e q λ r n g λ the λ n o o n was estimated at regional scale from two dimensional scatter of noontime lst and albedo roerink et al 2000 and verstraeten et al 2005 using noaa pal ten day in the present study noon time evaporative fraction λ n o o n was determined from noon time lst and albedo this was used as daily equivalent λ 24 based on the findings of mallick et al 2009 regarding invariant evaporative fraction during major portion of daytime hours which largely ifluence daily average latent heat fluxes or evapotranspiration the formulation of evaporative fraction from lst albedo 2d scatter is given as 4 λ n o o n l e h l e t h t s t h t λ e here th is maximum lst ts on dry edge i e radiation control branch computed as a linear function of surface albedo tλe is the minimum ts on wet edge or evaporation control branch computed as a linear function of surface albedo 5 2 adaptation with noaa pal reanalysis data and scaling functions monthly mean evaporative fraction was obtained from temporally smoothened ten day or eight day time composites of noontime lst and albedo temporaly smoothning of noontime lst has been carried out using hants algorithm roerink et al 2000 zhou et al 2015 noaa pal three 10 day evaporative fraction data in a given region were used to compute mean monthly evaporative fraction net radiation r n d is composed of net shortwave r n s d and net longwave r n l d components daytime net shortwave radiation was computed from monthly bias corrected reanalysis monthly surface insolation data from meera 2d and satellite based monthly surface albedo the bias correction model was developed from ams measurements during 2011 the monthly mean albedo were computed from days time composite albedo for noaa pal three composites were used to compute monthly average surface daytime net longwave radiation generally requires day time monthly mean of lst air temperature and precise determination of surface emissivity and air emissivity the day time mean of lst is possible if all sky clear and cloudy skyboth lst is available diurnally noaa avhrr provides single noon time lst per day therefore daytime net longwave radiation rnld was determined as a function of net shortwave radiation iziomon et al 2000and bhattacharya et al 2013 the coefficient a and b were found to vary from 0 124 to 0 245 and 0 243 to 16 25 respectively for different seasons bhattacharya et al 2013 r n l d α r n s d b soil heat flux depends on soil temperature gradient and soil thermal conductivity which are hard to determine using thermal remote sensing data however the fraction of soilheat flux to net radiation varies from 0 1 to 0 3 from well vegetated land to bare soil conditions a host of empirical soil heat flux models sun et al 2013 are available using lst albedo ndvi developed elsewhere in the present study empirical logarithmic function y 12 5 loge x 1 317 y monthly ratio of soil heat flux and net radiation x monthly ndvi was developed between ratio of monthly average of day time soil heat flux and net radiation monthly 1 km resolution ndvi data from bhattacharya et al 2013 having noaa pal eqivalent spatial resolutions thus the monthly mean net available energy and monthly evaporative fraction were used to estimate regional day time monthly mean latent heat fluxes regional monthly mean and annual et loss 5 3 et modellling approach using modis data the mod16 global et product mu et al 2011 at 1 km spatial resolution provided by earth observing system of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa eos as part of global et project http www ntsg umt edu project mod16 were used in the present study for this et data from modis aqua for the years 2001 to 2010 were used the mod16 et product was based on the penman monteith formulation monteith 1965 that used modis biophysical and geophysical products such as i global collection 4 land cover type 2 mod12q1 friedl et al 2002 ii collection 5fpar lai mod15a2 myneni et al 2002 iii collection 5 mcd43b2 and mcd43b3 albedo liang et al 2003and lucht et al 2000 iv collection 4 land cover types and nasa s merra gmao daily meteorological reanalysis fields at 2 3 x 1 2 grid resolution though the mod16 algorithm mu et al 2011 is an improved version of a previous version mu et al 2007 it does not use any thermal remote sensing data for solving energy balance the improvement made in mu et al 2007 by mu et al 2011 is as follows the improvements included 1 simplification of the calculation of vegetation cover fraction 2 calculation of et as the sum of daytime and nighttime components and soil heat fluxes 4 improvement in the methods to estimate stomatal conductance aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance 5 separation of dry canopy surface from the wet and hence canopy water loss includes evaporation from the wet canopy surface and transpiration from the dry surface and 6 division of soil surface into saturated wet surface and moisture surface soil evaporation includes potential evaporation from the saturated wet surface and actual evaporation from the moist surface the annual modis et for the period of year 2000 to 2010 over indian landmass at 1 km spatial resolution were resampled to 0 08 grid resolution and were subsequently used in this study 5 4 generation of regional trend statistics the rank based mann 1945 and kendall 1975 method is a non parametric approach to assess the significance of monotonic trends in hydro meteorological time series burn and hesch 2007 parametric methods require the data to be independent and normally distributed but for smaller departures from normality non parametric methods are sometimes better than parametric methods hirsch et al 1991 in the present study one of the most widely used non parametric mann kendall tests methods was applied with time series data of annual et rainfall annual mean of ssm and surface insolation for the recent decade 2001 2010 to find out trend significance over major land cover types in the indian sub tropics let x1 x2 x3 represent n data points where xj represents the data point at time j then the mann kendall statistic s is given by s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k where s i g n x j x k 1 i f x j x k 0 0 i f x j x k 0 1 i f x j x k 0 a very high positive value of s is an indicator of an increasing trend very low negative value indicates a decreasing trend then variance of s var s was calculated by the following equation 5 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where n is the number of data points g is the number of tied groups a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value and tp is the number of data points in the pth group then a z statistic was computed as follows 6 z s 1 v a r s 1 2 i f s 0 7 0 i f s 0 8 s 1 v a r s 1 2 i f s 0 here mann kendall tests are used to demonstrate any presence of possible trends against the null hypothesis of having no trends where the tabulated and calculated z statistics were compared at 95 and 90 p 0 05 p 0 1 level of significances the trend is said to be significantly decreasing if sample z is negative and absolute z is greater than the tabulated value at a given level of significance the trend is said to be increasing significant if the sample z is positive and is greater than the level of significance if the computed z is less than the level of significance the trend is not significant 6 results and discussion 6 1 inter comparison of annual et from noaa and modis the generated climatology of the present work is a combination of 30 years et 1981 2010 where the initial 20 years 1981 2000 et was derived from noaa pal data based on lst albedo evaporative fraction and surface energy balance and the last 10 years 2001 2010 et was of modis based on p m approach the noaa pal et has been generated taking into account single source energy balance approach mallick et al 2009 which was validated with micrometeorological measurements of laspex land surface processes experiment over anand region of gujarat india for noontime and daytime the rmse of latent heat flux over laspex sites was found to be 22 of measured mean for noon time and 15 of measured mean for day time average with correlation coefficients r of 0 66 and 0 82 respectively between noaa estimates and micrometeorological measurements the annual modis et for the year 2010 was compared with et computed from in situ micro meteorological measurements from india for eight different ams agro met station locations table 1 the annual modis et showed rmse of 0 29 mm d 1 and a mean bias of 6 4 with correlation coefficient of 0 68 modis et was found to have lower values when compared to those derived from majority of ams stations the footprint mismatch of modis observations and ams measurements is one of the major sources of underestimates in agricultural systems advection from surrounding fields influence turbulent heat fluxes such as sensible and latent heat fluxes within surface layer of atmospheric boundary layer abl these might influence the bowen ratio and evapotranspiration estimation through micrometeorological measurements in current agro met stations ams the modis et algorithm does not correct for micro advection this difference might also lead to the deviation between modis and ams et the annual et from noaa pal was compared with annual modis et for an overlapping year of 2000 over different land cover types fig 3 and states of india fig 4 before comparison modis and noaa et estimates were corrected for bias for cropland obtained through in situ measurements with respect to ams and laspex experiments as reported above the correlation cofficient over land cover types and indian states were 0 98 and 0 93 respectively the mean deviation of modis et as compared to noaa pal et was found to be 7 3 across different cover types and 1 5 over across different indian states irrigated cropland showed over estimates of et from modis as compared to noaa of the order 16 7 fig 3 in the year 2000 in contrast rainfed cropland showed underestimates in et from modis as compared to noaa of the order of 17 6 in modis et no thermal remote sensing data were used noaa et has been derived using thermal remote sensing it has been reported that thermal remote sensing has higher sensitivity for et estimation where surface temperature and albedo fluctuations were largely governed by irrigation water management irrespective of lai development in rainfed agriculture water is ill managed and et variability largely follows lai variability these contrast in water supply and utilization situation might cause differences in responses to different et estrimation approaches this might bring similar but opposite differences between modis and noaa et in irrigated and rainfed croplands however there is little difference 1 in general between two sources of et over cropland since there is a fair correlation and less negative percent deviation in annual et data of modis with respect to noaa et data over different cover types and geographic regions the et data from modis for 2001 2010 was used seemlessly alongwith noaa et data for the period 1981 2000 to carry out time series analysis using igbp lulc however the recent trend in et over irrigated cropland was compared with et trend over rainfed grassland and forest using spot vgt lulc for the period of 2001 2010 6 2 baseline climatic et over indian sub tropical vegetation the climatic mean of thirty 30 years annual et at 0 08 resolution showed a wide spatial variation from 100 to 1300 mm depth of water over indian vegetated surface with cropland et ranging from 100 to 1000 mm fig 5 a and forest et ranging from 500 to 1300 mm fig 5b the plot fig 6 of year to year variation of annual et from vegetated area of indian sub tropics showed a sharp declining trend during 1981 to 1995 with intermittent rise and fall this could be associated with either rainfall or solar dimming the solar dimming has been noticed over major parts of india owing to rise in aerosol load and cloudiness padma kumari and goswami 2010 decrease in et was observed at the rate of 16 cubic km yr 1 till 1994 however after 1995 an increasing trend in et was observed with a rate of 34 cubic kmyr 1 further the intermittent decline in et was noticed coincident to intermittent drought years of 2000 2002 and 2009 the overall et trend contradicts the ipcc inter governmental panel for climate change climate change prediction ipcc 2000 of accelerated water cycle from model simulations due to global warming the spatial distribution of monthly climatic et fig 7 showed a large variation up to 223 mm yr 1 monthly et generally increases from june with the onset of south west monsoon rainfall reaches a peak during september followed by a decline during october and november again it starts increasing from december and peaks in march especially over indo gangetic plain south east southern plains and part of western plain where irrigation is practiced this showed that monthly et dynamics could capture the impact of rainfall and irrigation in two consecutive growing seasons which start in june over indian sub tropics the decadal 10 year mean also showed a decline in et over vegetated surface from 1114 cubic km during 1981 1990 to 1013 cubic km during 1991 2000 followed by an increase to 1236 cubic km during 2001 2010 fig 8 the synoptic and systematic et data using time series observations from satellite platform seem to be influenced by the impacts of both natural e g rainfall solar radiation temperature etc and anthropogenic forcing factors e g irrigation change in pattern of cover types over vegetated surface but present state of art climate prediction models rarely incorporate any anthropogenic factors to project real life impacts 6 3 annual water consumption pattern by major land cover types of indian sub tropics the annual loss of water through et is generally considered as consumptive water use by vegetative systems the man kendall trend statistics of annual water consumption patterns of major indian land cover types during the years 1981 2010 are presented in table 2 the trends were significant and negative for 1981 1990 over cropland forest and shrubland followed by no trend in 1991 2000 and positive trend during 2001 2010 the z scores were found to range from 1 52 to 2 41 and 1 43 to 1 96 during 1981 1990 and 2001 to 2010 respectively over the above land cover types positive and negative trends were found for grassland and plantation respectively during 1981 1990 followed by no trends during 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 the annual water consumption averaged over this period from indian cropland was found to be the highest 890 cubic km followed by the indian forest ecosystem 575 cubic km annual water consumption trend over irrigated cropland is shown in fig 9 and it was compared with other rainfed vegetative systems such as grassland rainfed cropland and forest as shown in fig 9a b and c significant positive consumption trend is noticed in irrigated cropland with r2 0 62 between 470 and 510 cubic km with an average rate of increase of 4 cubic km yr 1 this might be due to increase in cropping intensity better crop management practices and change in cropping patterns milesi et al 2010 such as multiple cropping in a year raghuvanshi 1995 instead of mono crop and cultivation of horticulture cash crops instead of field crops change in irrigation sources gandhi and namboodiri 2009 suhag 2016 contributing more towards productivity of agricultural field can also be a cause of increasing water consumption in irrigated land rainfed cropland did not show any significant trend in water consumption pattern on the other hand steady decline in water consumption trend is noticed for grassland and forest after 2003 and 2006 respectively with average rates of 0 3 cubic km yr 1 and 3 7 cubic km yr 1 respectively crossover points were noticed between water consumption trend over irrigated cropland and grassland and between irrigated cropland and forest during 2005 and 2007 respectively this might be due to increasing water consumption over irrigated croplands surrounding forest watershed at the cost of water yield from grassland and forest watersheds 6 4 decadal et trend in relation to forcing variables decadal trends of annual et within 30 years period over different indian states and its natural forcing factors such as rainfall and surface insolation incident radiation flux or incident shortwave radiation flux swf alongwith trend in surface soil moisture ssm have been depicted in fig 10 it may be mentioned that surface moisture variability occurs due to rainfall variability as well as man made changes so called anthropogenic forcings in water allocation and application patterns through new canal command area ground water pumping tank based and sprinkler drip irrigation etc during 1981 1990 significant negative trend in et was observed over majority region covering 89 of indian states this can be attributed to significant reduction in annual rainfall insolation surface soil moisture over south eastern eastern part of central and western india there was significant increase in annual rainfall over north western india however the increase could not trigger the increase in et by offsetting the solar dimming effect in this region during 1991 2000 largely no trend in annual et was noticed over majority 89 of indian states significant increase in annual rainfall over indo gangetic plain and surface soil moisture over rest part of india were noticed while solar dimming prevailed during period over majority of indian landmass both positive and negative forcings balanced each other to result into largely no trend in annual et but in the recent and last decade 2001 2010 significant increase in annual et was noticed over 29 of the indian states with largely no trend over rest of india the trend analysis of et with respect to forcing variables in the recent decade is described below a summary of significant et trend during 2001 2010 and man kendall test statistics in different indian states is given in table 3 the plain and plateau lands comprising states such as bihar madhya pradesh maharashtra tamil nadu showed significantly increasing et trend among pre dominantly hilly states two north eastern states such as tripura and mizoram showed significantly decreasing annual et trends however northern hill state such as himachal pradesh showed significantly increasing et among the four arable states two states such as maharashtra and tamil nadu showed significantly increasing et with s 15 and 25 and with z 1 1 and 1 9 respectively along with significant increase in annual rainfall s 13 and 7 z 1 8 and 0 9 and ssm s 17 and 27 z 1 4 and 2 3 though significantly increased et trend was observed in other two states such as bihar s 15 z 1 09 and madhya pradesh s 24 z 1 8 no significant trend in rainfall was observed for both of these states however significant increase in ssm s 27 z 2 3 was noticed in madhya pradesh m p hereafter but not in bihar increasing et trend for the two states m p and bihar without being impacted by natural forcing might be attributed due to developments in agricultural practices such as increase in irrigated area under canal command increased frequency and amount of irrigation increased ground water pumping increase in cropping intensity and change in cultivars gholkar et al 2014 but these contrasting situations need thorough investigation at finer scales with more statistics on crops irrigation and intensification in contrast there was significant increase in annual et s 13 z 09 over northern hilly state such as himachal pradesh along with significant increase in annual rainfall s 7 z 0 9 there were no significant trends in surface insolation also in all the three states indicating that there was no possibility that increased cloud cover is reducing et fig 11 the major possible factor of decreasing et s 16 and 29 z 2 2 and 1 2 under increasing rainfall in these two north eastern hilly states could be due to shifting cultivation which is still practiced in some north eastern states leading to significant change in land cover anonymous 1999 as mentioned by silva et al 2011 that due to jhum cultivation not only soil quality but productivity of cereals crops and vegetables may also decrease in spite of increasing rainfall along with emission of such gases co2 ch4 co n2o and nox which contribute for changing climatic condition of this area region specific correlation between annual et and swf was found to have highest range 0 1 0 75 followed by ranges of 0 1 0 6 and of 0 05 0 35 between et and ssf and between et and rainfall respectively a moderate to low correlation could be due to differences in native spatial resolution between et and other forcing variables the gridded rainfall generated from in situ gauge measurements of sparse network through interpolation might lead to low correlation scatterometer has sensitivity to surface soil moisture under low vegetation cover only this led to moderate range of correlation with et the swf is reanalysis data synthesized from model simulation satellite observations and in situ measurements this could lead to higher correlation range with et 7 conclusion the results of the analysis are useful to understand monthly et dynamics climatic pattern of annual et over different land cover types alongwith its relationship with various climatic parameters this study brought out climatology 1981 2010 of annual loss of water through et from indian vegetation with 30 years of satellite data at a spatial resolution finer than existing climatic et generated at global scale this has been accomplished using simplified single source energy balance tower based india specific scaling functions and time series optical thermal remote sensing data from noaa and modis corrected with respect to in situ micrometeorological measurements both modis and noaa et data have been compared for a common year and mean deviations were found to be less than 8 with less than 2 deviation over cropland water consumption patterns of major vegetation land cover types have also been identified for whole indian region especially consumption patterns over irrigated and rainfed cropland separately in the recent decade the climatology of annual et over major land cover types showed lowest over grassland and highest over cropland the declining et trend up to 1995 followed by increase contradicts the accelerated water cycle predicted from climate models the natural forcing factors such as rainfall and solar dimming could be responsible for declining et trend upto 1995 irrigated croplands showed steep increase trend in water consumption pattern during 2001 2010 while rainfed cropland systems showed no significant trend crossover points were noticed between increasing water consumption pattern of irrigated cropland and declining water consumtion patterns of grassland and forest at the later part of 2001 2010 the analysis of region specific annual et showed significant trends in seven states positive trend for bihar madhya pradesh maharashtra tamil nadu and himachal pradeshand negative trend for tripura and mizoram the increasing et trend is in line with increasing rainfall and ssm trends in maharashtra and tamil nadu while increasing et was noticed in bihar and madhya pradesh without significant trend in rainfall decreasing et trend in two hilly ne states are opposite to rainfall trend no significant trend was noticed over those states for surface insolation the anomalous et trend pattern with respect to natural water supply factors triggered the need for detailed investigation of the role of anthropogenic factors on land et over indian sub tropics shortwave radiation flux showed higher range of correlation with region specific annual et followed by surface soil moisture and rainfall with et acknowledgements

11380,the annual water loss through evapotranspiration et is an uncertain but significant component of india s water budget the present study generated independent estimates of baseline annual et calibrated with in situ micrometeorological data over indian sub continent using surface energy balance framework and satellite based long term thermal remote sensing visible and near infrared observations as the primary data sources thirty years 1981 2010 of satellite based et estimates at 0 08 grid resolution were used to assess trend in regional et to find out change hot spots and probable causes long term collateral data influencing et such as gridded 0 5 0 5 annual rainfall rf annual mean surface soil moisture ssm at 25 km resolution from esa scatterometers and annual mean incoming shortwave radiation from merra 2d reanalysis were also analyzed mean annual et loss was found to be the highest for indian cropland 890 cubic km than forest 575 cubic km annual water consumption pattern over vegetation systems showed declining et trend at the rate of 16 cubic km yr 1 upto 1995 during 30 years which might be due to declining rainfall and solar dimming this was followed by increasing et trend 34 cubic km yr 1 during 2001 2010 irrigated cropland showed a steep increase in water consumption pattern with an average rate of 4 cubic km yr 1 while grassland and forest showed declining consumption patterns since 2003 and 2007 respectively thus showing crossover points of their consumption patterns with irrigated cropland four agriculturally important indian eastern central western and southern states showed significantly increasing et trend with s score of 15 25 and z score of 1 09 2 9 during this period increasing et in western and southern states was found to be coupled with increase in annual rainfall and ssm but in eastern and central states no significant trend in rainfall was observed though significant increase in et was noticed region specific correlation of annual et with natural forcing variables was higher for incoming shortwave radiation as compared to rainfall the increase in et over irrigated croplands as well as over some of the indian states could be due to increase in anthropogenic factors which need more detailed investigations in future abbreviations noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration pal pathfinder

balance thermal remote sensing 1 introduction evapotranspiration et provides a link between energy and water budget in hydrological cycle estimation of large scale et using space based observations has gained popularity with the advancement in optical and thermal remote sensing the long term trends of et and its forcing factors need to be understood and quantified under changing climatic conditions to address water security issues related to water rights water allocation crop water use efficiency human consumption and industrial water use several researchers have studied the impact of et under various climatic settings zeng et al 2012 estimated annual et over 59 major river basins for 2003 2009 using water balance approach where globally averaged land et was noticed to be about 604 mm yr 1with a range of 558 4650 mm yr 1 non significant trend in global land et over the last decade were the outcome of this study liu et al 2013 used dynamic land ecosystem model dlem to simulate et over a period of 1901 2008 and observed significant decrease in et over parts of basins of the gulf of mexico generally et decreased in western arid area while increase was observed in eastern part of their study area during the past 108 years long term et was characterized by gao et al 2012 over the haihe river basin in china for the period of 1960 2002 using the complementary relationship and the thornthwaite water balance wb approaches the annual et was found to exhibit decreasing trends in most parts of the haihe river basin increasing et over the past 50 years was reported walter et al 2004 for several large basins across the conterminous united states though global et showed an increasing trend in last two decades and no trend in the recent decade contrasting trends were reported over different countries river basins or even over different regions within a country moreover most of the above studies have used water balance methods to estimate et as residual of water budgeting and also the scale of et estimates through this approach was coarser in nature specific to indian sub tropics there is a knowledge gap in having long term trend on country scale and region specific finer resolution large scale et from surface energy balance and thermal remote sensing the proper attention has not been paid by water resource managers to bring out independent and reliable estimates of baseline climatic annual et over india s vegetated landmass using surface energy balance modeling narasimhan 2008 goroshi et al 2017 brought out inter seasonal and inter annual variability over india through trend analysis of monthly et data generated by zhang et al 2010 using only 24 years of noaa monthly ndvi data giims global inventory modelling and mapping studies computed from avhrr observations in optical remote sensing the et data were reported to be validated with 48 lysimeter stations of india meteorological department though monthly plots were shown for six stations only the study has certain lacunae which are following i thermal remote sensing has been found to be superior than optical remote sensing to estimate et anderson et al 2012 their study did not use any thermal remote sensing data ii the study did not make use of a complete climate series of 30 years satellite observations iii imd s lysimeter stations are reported to be 40 32 gravimetric and 8 volumetric types with lot of data discontinuity imd personal communication it was not clear how data gaps have been fulfilled iv several factors such as differences in height growth and density of vegetation between the lysimeter and outside vegetation interruption of deep percolation and horizontal flow components in soil within lysimeter tank heat flux distortion caused by highly conducive steel walls heavy rusting and corrosion in tanks due to exposure to soil water and weather for long period of time can severely affect et measurements farahani et al 2007 using lysimeters on the other hand the tower based et flux measurements represent larger foot print through surface energy balance measurements based on micrometeorological principles depending on the fetch ratios the above study did not try to use any such micrometeorological measurements available over india v the above study did not involve any new modelling approaches within surface energy balance framework with respect to net radiation soil heat flux evaporative fraction specific to indian sub tropics vi though it showed et variability and trend over major land cover types inter play of natural and anthropogenic influences on et as well as et trend explicitly over irrigated cropland were not highlighted even model simulated soil moisture data were used instead of climatic series of satellite based esa scatterometers surface soil moisture data vii all these resulted into large validation error of 38 on seasonal and 17 on annual scale with respect to lysimeter stations no bias correction was made on satellite based estimates before showing mean from long term satellite based et estimates viii moreover the study did not bring out the trend in volume of water consumption pattern in different cover types space applications centre of indian space research organization isro established a network of 23 micrometeorological towers of 10 m height during the years 2008 to 2011 with on field data transmission facility through yagi antenna to insat data relay transponder drt and subsequent reception at an earth station bhattacharya et al 2009 singh et al 2014 eswar et al 2013 these towers have multi height sensors for recording air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and direction four component net radiation two depth soil heat flux and three depth soil temperature rainfall with a sampling frequency of 5 min and averaged over 30 min these towers were located over cropland grassland shrubland and young forest spread over northern southern eastern western and central parts of india including north eastern hill region thar desert and andaman and nicobar islands with a fetch ratio varying from 1 50 to 1 100 the surface energy balance data from these towers provided unique opportunity to characterize et behavior and develop scaling functions bhattacharya et al 2013 for net longwave radiation bias correction of incoming shortwave radiation flux soil heat fluxes with respect to satellite based thermal remote sensing data in the present study these in conjunction with long term satellite thermal remote sensing data enabled to estimate evapotranspiration at 0 08 grid resolution through simplified model of surface energy balance whose accuracy has already been evaluated through separate studies mallick et al 2009 the country scale et data at 0 08 grid resolution were generated through a combination of micro metrological measurements scaling functions optical and thermal remote sensing observations from noaa series of satellites during 1981 to 2000 and bias corrected modis et product for the period 2001 to 2010 to complete a climatic series of 30 years the objectives of the present study are i to characterize baseline annual climatic et over indian sub tropical vegetation ii to evaluate the volumetric annual water consumption rates over major land cover types in the sub tropics over three decades with special emphasis on irrigated cropland in the last decade and iii to assess long term et trend to detect change hot spots and regions of influence of natural and anthropogenic forcing factors 2 study area climatic conditions of india are marked by tropical rainy season in its southern and temperate in the northern part it is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the north towards himalaya where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall the nation s climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert strong temperature variations in different seasons and south west monsoon are one of the most important characteristic of indian climate variability in the onset withdrawal and quantum of rainfall during the monsoon season has also profound impacts on water resources power generation agriculture economics and ecosystems in the country temperature ranges from about 10 c in winter to about 32 c in summer season attri and tyagi 2010 for this study the indian landmass extending from 5 to 38 n and 68 to 100 e has been considered as shown in fig 1 3 data used 3 1 satellite based evapotranspiration et 3 1 1 et from noaa avhrr for 1981 2000 monthly et was estimated at 0 08 spatial resolution in terms of latent heat flux as a residual of single source energy balance approach here evaporative fraction and net surface available energy mallick et al 2009 determined from optical and thermal remote sensing data in terms of noaa pathfinder avhrr land pal data were used the cloud gaps were filled through harmonic analysis of land surface variables such as ndvi surface albedo and land surface temprature lst it also used bias corrected shortwave radiation flux reanalysis field and linear and nonlinear scaling functions bhattacharya et al 2013 for net long wave radiation and soil heat fluxes 3 1 2 modis et data for 2001 2010 the modis et product commonly known as mod 16 et product was used here having temporal resolution of eight days and spatial resolution of 1 km the detail description of modis et generation is mentioned by mu et al 2007and 2011 and cleugh et al 2007 study annual et over indian landmass for the period of 2001 2010 were generated through eight day et product this annual et was further resampled to 0 08 grid resolution before using in this study 3 2 gridded rainfall the daily measured rainfall records converted into gridded rainfall at 0 5 x 0 5 grid resolution were used for this study the gridded data were generated by rajeevan et al 2006 using shepard interpolation method where measured rainfall data were from 1803 rain gauge stations of india meteorological department imd the daily gridded rainfall data were further summed up to compute annual rainfall these gridded daily rainfall data were averaged for the period of 1981 2010 3 3 satellite based surface soil moisture ssm data the global product of daily volumetric surface 0 5 cm soil moisture ssm at 25 km spatial resolution has been used here for the period of 1981 2010 this is a merged product from the observations of series of esa scatterometers and in situ moisture measurements of global soil moisture data bank http climate envsci rutgers edu soilmoisture the data were obtained from esa http www esa sm cci org the annual mean ssm of esa was computed from daily soil moisture data over indian landmass during the above mentioned period 3 4 reanalysis data the reanalysis data field from merra 2d on surface incident shortwave flux swf was used for the current study the spatial resolution of merra 2d is 2 3 longitude x 1 2 latitude the monthly incoming shortwave radiation data were converted to annual scale for the period of 1981 to 2010 4 land use land cover map of india the land use land cover lulc maps of india at 100 m spatial resolution produced through international geosphere biosphere programme igbp for 1985 1995 and 2005 https daac ornl gov were used for three decades 1981 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively details of the product are given in meiyappan et al 2017 and roy et al 2016 these were resampled to 0 08 grid resolution out of 19 classes five broad vegetation classes fig 2 a of cropland forest including all its sub types shrubland grassland and plantation were used for trend analysis however igbp lulc does not contain classes for irrigated and rainfed cropland therefore the lulc derived from spot vgt data agrawal et al 2003 at 1 km spatial resolution containing irrigated and rainfed cropland classes fig 2b has been used for the analysis for the period 2000 2010 for the comparison of noaa and modis et as well as et trend analysis over irrigated cropland and its comparison with respect to rainfed cropland grassland and forestland spot vgt based lulc was resampled to 0 08 grid resolution 5 methodology 5 1 regional land et model actual evapo transpiration aet here after referred as et was estimated from latent heat fluxes λ e o r l e and latent heat l of evaporation brutsaert and chen 1996 latent heat flux λe is generally computed as a residual of surface energy balance kustas et al 1994 moran et al 1994 mallick et al 2007 a single soil vegetation complex as single unit source surface energy balance can be written as 1 r n h g λ e m the energy component for metabolic activities m isverysmall samson and lemeur 2001 and hence can be neglected the eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 λ e r n g h r n net radiation wm 2 h sensible heat flux wm 2 g ground heat flux wm 2 r n g net available energy q in wm 2 assuming energy balance closure at any instance during a day eq 2 can be written as 3 λ e q λ r n g λ the λ n o o n was estimated at regional scale from two dimensional scatter of noontime lst and albedo roerink et al 2000 and verstraeten et al 2005 using noaa pal ten day in the present study noon time evaporative fraction λ n o o n was determined from noon time lst and albedo this was used as daily equivalent λ 24 based on the findings of mallick et al 2009 regarding invariant evaporative fraction during major portion of daytime hours which largely ifluence daily average latent heat fluxes or evapotranspiration the formulation of evaporative fraction from lst albedo 2d scatter is given as 4 λ n o o n l e h l e t h t s t h t λ e here th is maximum lst ts on dry edge i e radiation control branch computed as a linear function of surface albedo tλe is the minimum ts on wet edge or evaporation control branch computed as a linear function of surface albedo 5 2 adaptation with noaa pal reanalysis data and scaling functions monthly mean evaporative fraction was obtained from temporally smoothened ten day or eight day time composites of noontime lst and albedo temporaly smoothning of noontime lst has been carried out using hants algorithm roerink et al 2000 zhou et al 2015 noaa pal three 10 day evaporative fraction data in a given region were used to compute mean monthly evaporative fraction net radiation r n d is composed of net shortwave r n s d and net longwave r n l d components daytime net shortwave radiation was computed from monthly bias corrected reanalysis monthly surface insolation data from meera 2d and satellite based monthly surface albedo the bias correction model was developed from ams measurements during 2011 the monthly mean albedo were computed from days time composite albedo for noaa pal three composites were used to compute monthly average surface daytime net longwave radiation generally requires day time monthly mean of lst air temperature and precise determination of surface emissivity and air emissivity the day time mean of lst is possible if all sky clear and cloudy skyboth lst is available diurnally noaa avhrr provides single noon time lst per day therefore daytime net longwave radiation rnld was determined as a function of net shortwave radiation iziomon et al 2000and bhattacharya et al 2013 the coefficient a and b were found to vary from 0 124 to 0 245 and 0 243 to 16 25 respectively for different seasons bhattacharya et al 2013 r n l d α r n s d b soil heat flux depends on soil temperature gradient and soil thermal conductivity which are hard to determine using thermal remote sensing data however the fraction of soilheat flux to net radiation varies from 0 1 to 0 3 from well vegetated land to bare soil conditions a host of empirical soil heat flux models sun et al 2013 are available using lst albedo ndvi developed elsewhere in the present study empirical logarithmic function y 12 5 loge x 1 317 y monthly ratio of soil heat flux and net radiation x monthly ndvi was developed between ratio of monthly average of day time soil heat flux and net radiation monthly 1 km resolution ndvi data from bhattacharya et al 2013 having noaa pal eqivalent spatial resolutions thus the monthly mean net available energy and monthly evaporative fraction were used to estimate regional day time monthly mean latent heat fluxes regional monthly mean and annual et loss 5 3 et modellling approach using modis data the mod16 global et product mu et al 2011 at 1 km spatial resolution provided by earth observing system of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa eos as part of global et project http www ntsg umt edu project mod16 were used in the present study for this et data from modis aqua for the years 2001 to 2010 were used the mod16 et product was based on the penman monteith formulation monteith 1965 that used modis biophysical and geophysical products such as i global collection 4 land cover type 2 mod12q1 friedl et al 2002 ii collection 5fpar lai mod15a2 myneni et al 2002 iii collection 5 mcd43b2 and mcd43b3 albedo liang et al 2003and lucht et al 2000 iv collection 4 land cover types and nasa s merra gmao daily meteorological reanalysis fields at 2 3 x 1 2 grid resolution though the mod16 algorithm mu et al 2011 is an improved version of a previous version mu et al 2007 it does not use any thermal remote sensing data for solving energy balance the improvement made in mu et al 2007 by mu et al 2011 is as follows the improvements included 1 simplification of the calculation of vegetation cover fraction 2 calculation of et as the sum of daytime and nighttime components and soil heat fluxes 4 improvement in the methods to estimate stomatal conductance aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance 5 separation of dry canopy surface from the wet and hence canopy water loss includes evaporation from the wet canopy surface and transpiration from the dry surface and 6 division of soil surface into saturated wet surface and moisture surface soil evaporation includes potential evaporation from the saturated wet surface and actual evaporation from the moist surface the annual modis et for the period of year 2000 to 2010 over indian landmass at 1 km spatial resolution were resampled to 0 08 grid resolution and were subsequently used in this study 5 4 generation of regional trend statistics the rank based mann 1945 and kendall 1975 method is a non parametric approach to assess the significance of monotonic trends in hydro meteorological time series burn and hesch 2007 parametric methods require the data to be independent and normally distributed but for smaller departures from normality non parametric methods are sometimes better than parametric methods hirsch et al 1991 in the present study one of the most widely used non parametric mann kendall tests methods was applied with time series data of annual et rainfall annual mean of ssm and surface insolation for the recent decade 2001 2010 to find out trend significance over major land cover types in the indian sub tropics let x1 x2 x3 represent n data points where xj represents the data point at time j then the mann kendall statistic s is given by s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k where s i g n x j x k 1 i f x j x k 0 0 i f x j x k 0 1 i f x j x k 0 a very high positive value of s is an indicator of an increasing trend very low negative value indicates a decreasing trend then variance of s var s was calculated by the following equation 5 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where n is the number of data points g is the number of tied groups a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value and tp is the number of data points in the pth group then a z statistic was computed as follows 6 z s 1 v a r s 1 2 i f s 0 7 0 i f s 0 8 s 1 v a r s 1 2 i f s 0 here mann kendall tests are used to demonstrate any presence of possible trends against the null hypothesis of having no trends where the tabulated and calculated z statistics were compared at 95 and 90 p 0 05 p 0 1 level of significances the trend is said to be significantly decreasing if sample z is negative and absolute z is greater than the tabulated value at a given level of significance the trend is said to be increasing significant if the sample z is positive and is greater than the level of significance if the computed z is less than the level of significance the trend is not significant 6 results and discussion 6 1 inter comparison of annual et from noaa and modis the generated climatology of the present work is a combination of 30 years et 1981 2010 where the initial 20 years 1981 2000 et was derived from noaa pal data based on lst albedo evaporative fraction and surface energy balance and the last 10 years 2001 2010 et was of modis based on p m approach the noaa pal et has been generated taking into account single source energy balance approach mallick et al 2009 which was validated with micrometeorological measurements of laspex land surface processes experiment over anand region of gujarat india for noontime and daytime the rmse of latent heat flux over laspex sites was found to be 22 of measured mean for noon time and 15 of measured mean for day time average with correlation coefficients r of 0 66 and 0 82 respectively between noaa estimates and micrometeorological measurements the annual modis et for the year 2010 was compared with et computed from in situ micro meteorological measurements from india for eight different ams agro met station locations table 1 the annual modis et showed rmse of 0 29 mm d 1 and a mean bias of 6 4 with correlation coefficient of 0 68 modis et was found to have lower values when compared to those derived from majority of ams stations the footprint mismatch of modis observations and ams measurements is one of the major sources of underestimates in agricultural systems advection from surrounding fields influence turbulent heat fluxes such as sensible and latent heat fluxes within surface layer of atmospheric boundary layer abl these might influence the bowen ratio and evapotranspiration estimation through micrometeorological measurements in current agro met stations ams the modis et algorithm does not correct for micro advection this difference might also lead to the deviation between modis and ams et the annual et from noaa pal was compared with annual modis et for an overlapping year of 2000 over different land cover types fig 3 and states of india fig 4 before comparison modis and noaa et estimates were corrected for bias for cropland obtained through in situ measurements with respect to ams and laspex experiments as reported above the correlation cofficient over land cover types and indian states were 0 98 and 0 93 respectively the mean deviation of modis et as compared to noaa pal et was found to be 7 3 across different cover types and 1 5 over across different indian states irrigated cropland showed over estimates of et from modis as compared to noaa of the order 16 7 fig 3 in the year 2000 in contrast rainfed cropland showed underestimates in et from modis as compared to noaa of the order of 17 6 in modis et no thermal remote sensing data were used noaa et has been derived using thermal remote sensing it has been reported that thermal remote sensing has higher sensitivity for et estimation where surface temperature and albedo fluctuations were largely governed by irrigation water management irrespective of lai development in rainfed agriculture water is ill managed and et variability largely follows lai variability these contrast in water supply and utilization situation might cause differences in responses to different et estrimation approaches this might bring similar but opposite differences between modis and noaa et in irrigated and rainfed croplands however there is little difference 1 in general between two sources of et over cropland since there is a fair correlation and less negative percent deviation in annual et data of modis with respect to noaa et data over different cover types and geographic regions the et data from modis for 2001 2010 was used seemlessly alongwith noaa et data for the period 1981 2000 to carry out time series analysis using igbp lulc however the recent trend in et over irrigated cropland was compared with et trend over rainfed grassland and forest using spot vgt lulc for the period of 2001 2010 6 2 baseline climatic et over indian sub tropical vegetation the climatic mean of thirty 30 years annual et at 0 08 resolution showed a wide spatial variation from 100 to 1300 mm depth of water over indian vegetated surface with cropland et ranging from 100 to 1000 mm fig 5 a and forest et ranging from 500 to 1300 mm fig 5b the plot fig 6 of year to year variation of annual et from vegetated area of indian sub tropics showed a sharp declining trend during 1981 to 1995 with intermittent rise and fall this could be associated with either rainfall or solar dimming the solar dimming has been noticed over major parts of india owing to rise in aerosol load and cloudiness padma kumari and goswami 2010 decrease in et was observed at the rate of 16 cubic km yr 1 till 1994 however after 1995 an increasing trend in et was observed with a rate of 34 cubic kmyr 1 further the intermittent decline in et was noticed coincident to intermittent drought years of 2000 2002 and 2009 the overall et trend contradicts the ipcc inter governmental panel for climate change climate change prediction ipcc 2000 of accelerated water cycle from model simulations due to global warming the spatial distribution of monthly climatic et fig 7 showed a large variation up to 223 mm yr 1 monthly et generally increases from june with the onset of south west monsoon rainfall reaches a peak during september followed by a decline during october and november again it starts increasing from december and peaks in march especially over indo gangetic plain south east southern plains and part of western plain where irrigation is practiced this showed that monthly et dynamics could capture the impact of rainfall and irrigation in two consecutive growing seasons which start in june over indian sub tropics the decadal 10 year mean also showed a decline in et over vegetated surface from 1114 cubic km during 1981 1990 to 1013 cubic km during 1991 2000 followed by an increase to 1236 cubic km during 2001 2010 fig 8 the synoptic and systematic et data using time series observations from satellite platform seem to be influenced by the impacts of both natural e g rainfall solar radiation temperature etc and anthropogenic forcing factors e g irrigation change in pattern of cover types over vegetated surface but present state of art climate prediction models rarely incorporate any anthropogenic factors to project real life impacts 6 3 annual water consumption pattern by major land cover types of indian sub tropics the annual loss of water through et is generally considered as consumptive water use by vegetative systems the man kendall trend statistics of annual water consumption patterns of major indian land cover types during the years 1981 2010 are presented in table 2 the trends were significant and negative for 1981 1990 over cropland forest and shrubland followed by no trend in 1991 2000 and positive trend during 2001 2010 the z scores were found to range from 1 52 to 2 41 and 1 43 to 1 96 during 1981 1990 and 2001 to 2010 respectively over the above land cover types positive and negative trends were found for grassland and plantation respectively during 1981 1990 followed by no trends during 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 the annual water consumption averaged over this period from indian cropland was found to be the highest 890 cubic km followed by the indian forest ecosystem 575 cubic km annual water consumption trend over irrigated cropland is shown in fig 9 and it was compared with other rainfed vegetative systems such as grassland rainfed cropland and forest as shown in fig 9a b and c significant positive consumption trend is noticed in irrigated cropland with r2 0 62 between 470 and 510 cubic km with an average rate of increase of 4 cubic km yr 1 this might be due to increase in cropping intensity better crop management practices and change in cropping patterns milesi et al 2010 such as multiple cropping in a year raghuvanshi 1995 instead of mono crop and cultivation of horticulture cash crops instead of field crops change in irrigation sources gandhi and namboodiri 2009 suhag 2016 contributing more towards productivity of agricultural field can also be a cause of increasing water consumption in irrigated land rainfed cropland did not show any significant trend in water consumption pattern on the other hand steady decline in water consumption trend is noticed for grassland and forest after 2003 and 2006 respectively with average rates of 0 3 cubic km yr 1 and 3 7 cubic km yr 1 respectively crossover points were noticed between water consumption trend over irrigated cropland and grassland and between irrigated cropland and forest during 2005 and 2007 respectively this might be due to increasing water consumption over irrigated croplands surrounding forest watershed at the cost of water yield from grassland and forest watersheds 6 4 decadal et trend in relation to forcing variables decadal trends of annual et within 30 years period over different indian states and its natural forcing factors such as rainfall and surface insolation incident radiation flux or incident shortwave radiation flux swf alongwith trend in surface soil moisture ssm have been depicted in fig 10 it may be mentioned that surface moisture variability occurs due to rainfall variability as well as man made changes so called anthropogenic forcings in water allocation and application patterns through new canal command area ground water pumping tank based and sprinkler drip irrigation etc during 1981 1990 significant negative trend in et was observed over majority region covering 89 of indian states this can be attributed to significant reduction in annual rainfall insolation surface soil moisture over south eastern eastern part of central and western india there was significant increase in annual rainfall over north western india however the increase could not trigger the increase in et by offsetting the solar dimming effect in this region during 1991 2000 largely no trend in annual et was noticed over majority 89 of indian states significant increase in annual rainfall over indo gangetic plain and surface soil moisture over rest part of india were noticed while solar dimming prevailed during period over majority of indian landmass both positive and negative forcings balanced each other to result into largely no trend in annual et but in the recent and last decade 2001 2010 significant increase in annual et was noticed over 29 of the indian states with largely no trend over rest of india the trend analysis of et with respect to forcing variables in the recent decade is described below a summary of significant et trend during 2001 2010 and man kendall test statistics in different indian states is given in table 3 the plain and plateau lands comprising states such as bihar madhya pradesh maharashtra tamil nadu showed significantly increasing et trend among pre dominantly hilly states two north eastern states such as tripura and mizoram showed significantly decreasing annual et trends however northern hill state such as himachal pradesh showed significantly increasing et among the four arable states two states such as maharashtra and tamil nadu showed significantly increasing et with s 15 and 25 and with z 1 1 and 1 9 respectively along with significant increase in annual rainfall s 13 and 7 z 1 8 and 0 9 and ssm s 17 and 27 z 1 4 and 2 3 though significantly increased et trend was observed in other two states such as bihar s 15 z 1 09 and madhya pradesh s 24 z 1 8 no significant trend in rainfall was observed for both of these states however significant increase in ssm s 27 z 2 3 was noticed in madhya pradesh m p hereafter but not in bihar increasing et trend for the two states m p and bihar without being impacted by natural forcing might be attributed due to developments in agricultural practices such as increase in irrigated area under canal command increased frequency and amount of irrigation increased ground water pumping increase in cropping intensity and change in cultivars gholkar et al 2014 but these contrasting situations need thorough investigation at finer scales with more statistics on crops irrigation and intensification in contrast there was significant increase in annual et s 13 z 09 over northern hilly state such as himachal pradesh along with significant increase in annual rainfall s 7 z 0 9 there were no significant trends in surface insolation also in all the three states indicating that there was no possibility that increased cloud cover is reducing et fig 11 the major possible factor of decreasing et s 16 and 29 z 2 2 and 1 2 under increasing rainfall in these two north eastern hilly states could be due to shifting cultivation which is still practiced in some north eastern states leading to significant change in land cover anonymous 1999 as mentioned by silva et al 2011 that due to jhum cultivation not only soil quality but productivity of cereals crops and vegetables may also decrease in spite of increasing rainfall along with emission of such gases co2 ch4 co n2o and nox which contribute for changing climatic condition of this area region specific correlation between annual et and swf was found to have highest range 0 1 0 75 followed by ranges of 0 1 0 6 and of 0 05 0 35 between et and ssf and between et and rainfall respectively a moderate to low correlation could be due to differences in native spatial resolution between et and other forcing variables the gridded rainfall generated from in situ gauge measurements of sparse network through interpolation might lead to low correlation scatterometer has sensitivity to surface soil moisture under low vegetation cover only this led to moderate range of correlation with et the swf is reanalysis data synthesized from model simulation satellite observations and in situ measurements this could lead to higher correlation range with et 7 conclusion the results of the analysis are useful to understand monthly et dynamics climatic pattern of annual et over different land cover types alongwith its relationship with various climatic parameters this study brought out climatology 1981 2010 of annual loss of water through et from indian vegetation with 30 years of satellite data at a spatial resolution finer than existing climatic et generated at global scale this has been accomplished using simplified single source energy balance tower based india specific scaling functions and time series optical thermal remote sensing data from noaa and modis corrected with respect to in situ micrometeorological measurements both modis and noaa et data have been compared for a common year and mean deviations were found to be less than 8 with less than 2 deviation over cropland water consumption patterns of major vegetation land cover types have also been identified for whole indian region especially consumption patterns over irrigated and rainfed cropland separately in the recent decade the climatology of annual et over major land cover types showed lowest over grassland and highest over cropland the declining et trend up to 1995 followed by increase contradicts the accelerated water cycle predicted from climate models the natural forcing factors such as rainfall and solar dimming could be responsible for declining et trend upto 1995 irrigated croplands showed steep increase trend in water consumption pattern during 2001 2010 while rainfed cropland systems showed no significant trend crossover points were noticed between increasing water consumption pattern of irrigated cropland and declining water consumtion patterns of grassland and forest at the later part of 2001 2010 the analysis of region specific annual et showed significant trends in seven states positive trend for bihar madhya pradesh maharashtra tamil nadu and himachal pradeshand negative trend for tripura and mizoram the increasing et trend is in line with increasing rainfall and ssm trends in maharashtra and tamil nadu while increasing et was noticed in bihar and madhya pradesh without significant trend in rainfall decreasing et trend in two hilly ne states are opposite to rainfall trend no significant trend was noticed over those states for surface insolation the anomalous et trend pattern with respect to natural water supply factors triggered the need for detailed investigation of the role of anthropogenic factors on land et over indian sub tropics shortwave radiation flux showed higher range of correlation with region specific annual et followed by surface soil moisture and rainfall with et acknowledgements

11381,reliable estimation of et is especially important in semi arid conditions where et prediction is instrumental in cost effective management of scarce water resources and crop production in addition to the role of climate variables and soil characteristics the actual et is influenced by dynamic crop characteristics during the growing season therefore accounting for the interaction between crop growth and actual et can significantly improve the performance of models in this study an efficient approach is presented for simultaneous calibration of et and crop growth parameters for the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model for daily weekly and monthly et the proposed approach involves the development of an objective function based on a compounded time series comprising of scaled annual et and crop yield data an efficient search algorithm based on the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm was implemented in r language to find the parameter values that minimizes the defined objective function the simultaneous calibration approach which utilized annual data improved et prediction for annual and finer time scales 25 in rmse reduction for 3 month 18 for monthly 17 for 2 week 19 for weekly 17 for 3 day and 13 for daily time scales the average of absolute relative error for crop yield predictions was also reduced from 43 to 16 for the calibrated model the simulated leaf area index lai for the calibrated model i e calibrated using annual et and crop yield data was also consistent with the measured lai values confirming the validity of the calibrated parameter values keywords automatic calibration dryland multi objective optimization sensitivity analysis 1 introduction mechanistic modeling of an agronomic system entails proper calculation of the various water balance components in hydrologic modeling changes in the system water storage are calculated by subtracting outgoing sources of water e g evapotranspiration et infiltration surface and subsurface flows from the water inputs e g precipitation or irrigation at each time step among the different outgoing sources of water et is usually the main process through which water is removed from a watershed neitsch et al 2011 et estimation in a watershed is a complicated task due to the spatial and temporal variability of several weather variables as well as soil and land use characteristics a practical approach that is adopted by comprehensive hydrologic models like the soil and water assessment tool swat is based on the calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet as a function of several weather variables the actual et consisting of evaporation from soil and plants is calculated considering pet soil characteristics and leaf area index lai neitsch et al 2011 the same approach is used in the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model williams et al 2008 to estimate actual et the apex model was developed to evaluate the effects of different management strategies at farm to small watershed scales on water availability soil and water quality crop production and economics williams et al 2008 cavero et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 some researchers have used apex in conjunction with swat for analyzing the impact of field scale management practices on large watersheds saleh 2004 gassman et al 2001 clarke et al 2017 one of the main features of the apex model is its crop growth module that is capable of simulating over 100 crop types including both annual and perennial crops it also considers the effect of different types of plant growth stresses that impact crop yield williams et al 2008 considering the effect of water stress on plant growth and crop yield accurate estimation of et becomes very important especially in semi arid regions where et could be many times larger than precipitation and optimal application of scarce water resources could significantly impact crop production costs oweis and hachum 2006 garcía vila and fereres 2012 marek et al 2016 on the other hand the changes in plant morphology during the growing season affect evaporation from soil surface i e the shade provided by plant canopy reduces evaporation from soil surface as well as transpiration from plants therefore plant growth and et are two processes that interact with each other and the result of this interaction impacts both et and crop yield despite the importance of et estimations et model parameters are usually calibrated using other water balance components such as observed flow senaviratne et al 2014 wang et al 2014 this approach has a major shortcoming in that it provides no way of determining if the different processes whose compounded effects are reflected in the measured flow data are properly accounted for the most accurate estimation of et is its direct measurement using a lysimeter however lysimeter measured data are usually not available for many regions for calibration of et model parameters and validation of the apex model performance for the current study a research field equipped with a large weighing lysimeter at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory in bushland texas was selected as the study area howell et al 1997 availability of daily lysimeter measured et and crop yield data for 10 years provides a unique opportunity for simultaneous calibration and validation of apex model using measured et and crop data the outcome of this study can shed light on the performance of the apex model in simulating et and crop yield for different crop types in a rainfed field under semiarid conditions the main objectives of the current study are 1 using sensitivity analysis to identify apex model parameters affecting et simulation 2 development of an auto calibration procedure for simultaneous calibration of apex using annual et and crop yield data and 3 assessing the performance of the calibrated model at different time scales and dynamics of et and plant development 2 methodology 2 1 apex et and crop growth models apex provides five different options for estimating pet ranging from the more data demanding methods like penman and penman monteith monteith 1965 to hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 or baier robertson baier and robertson 1965 methods that require only temperature and radiation inputs the estimated pet serves as an input for calculating the actual evaporation from soil and plants based on the method described by ritchie 1972 in this study the penman monteith monteith 1965 method was selected due to its suitability in predicting et in semi arid climate conditions marek et al 2016 in addition it takes into account four weather variables including solar radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity for calculating potential evaporation compared to other methods that consider only temperature and solar radiation in their calculations apex uses the plant growth model proposed by monteith and moss 1977 to estimate the potential increase in biomass for different crops it supports multi plant growth simulations at the same time and space up to ten plant species considering plant competition for light water and nutrients kiniry et al 1992 williams et al 2008 potential crop growth may further be adjusted to take into account the effect of different plant growth stress types including temperature stress nutrient stress aeration stress and water stress that may affect plant growth development and crop yield williams et al 2008 2 2 global sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis was performed for detecting sensitive parameters that affect et simulations a range of uncertainty based on the recommended ranges of values in steglich and williams 2013 were assigned to apex parameters the morris sensitivity analysis method morris 1991 was implemented for short listing the number of sensitive parameters then an improved version of the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast known as extended fast saltelli et al 1999 was used to rank sensitive parameters in terms of their total sensitivity indices the adopted procedure has the advantage of reducing the number of model evaluations required by reducing the number of parameters that are used by a more computation intensive variance based method such as the fast method saltelli et al 2008 the sensitivity analysis methods were implemented using the apex sensun package in r talebizadeh et al 2017 2 3 auto calibration framework calibration of hydrologic models involves definition of an objective function that is optimized through a search algorithm in this study the apex model was calibrated using two different optimization schemes the first scheme scheme1 calibrates the model for annual et only and the second scheme scheme2 uses both annual et and crop yield simultaneously for calibration in order to simultaneously include the annual time series of et and crop yield in the apex calibration the two time series were scaled using their corresponding observed minimum and maximum values eq 1 indicates the scaling formulation where s t is the scaled variable x t is the original variable and x m i n and x m a x are the minimum and maximum observed values respectively 1 s t x t x m i n x m a x x m i n scaling of the simulated et and crop values allowed formation of a compounded single time series containing dimensionless values for scaled annual et and crop yield values the objective function used for optimizations was the sum of squared residuals ssr given in eq 2 where s i o b s and s i s i m and represents the scaled compounded time series of observed and simulated values respectively 2 s s r i 1 n s i o b s s i s i m 2 a script was developed in the r environment to optimize the srr objective function based on the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm vrugt et al 2009a the dream algorithm provides an efficient search method for exploring parameter space by launching a set of interacting chains that explore different parts of the parameter space it was selected based on its successful application to hydrologic model calibrations and its superior efficiency in finding global optimum values in highly non linear objective functions with high dimension of parameter space vrugt et al 2009b talebizadeh et al 2016 the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values were calculated and used to compare the quality of the two calibration schemes eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 4 n s e 1 i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 i 1 n y i o b s y m e a n 2 in the above equations y i o b s and y i s i m are the observed and simulated monthly et values respectively and y m e a n represents the mean of observed et 3 data and study area the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory cprl evapotranspiration research facility located at bushland texas 35 19 n 102 10 w and 1170 m elevation was used as the study area it consists of four fields each having an area of approximately 4 7 ha and each equipped with a large weighing lysimeter located at its center and an associated weather station fig 1 the soil type is mainly well drained pullman silty clay loam soil marek et al 2016 and the local climate is classified as semiarid with large diurnal and day to day temperature variations the eastern fields of the research area ne and se in fig 1 were managed as irrigated fields whereas the western fields nw and sw in fig 1 were often managed under dryland conditions marek et al 2016 the nw field was selected for the current study and its apex model based on apex0806 version was created using the web interface for apex nutrient tracking tool ntt saleh et al 2011 the measured weather data used for simulation precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation covering the period of 2000 2010 were collected from a station located near the study area table 1 provides a summary of the crops cultivated during 2001 2010 in the nw field marek et al 2016 the soil and land use information were derived from internal ntt databases that are built on the soil survey geographic ssurgo and national agricultural statistics service cropland data layer nass cdl data respectively year 2000 was selected for model warm up and the periods of 2001 2006 and 2007 2010 were selected as calibration and validation periods respectively the adopted division of years was based on the study of marek et al 2016 in the same field and includes at least two years with cotton and sorghum crops in calibration period i e 2001 and 2004 for cotton and 2003 and 2006 for grain sorghum 4 results and discussion fig 2 illustrates the sensitivity results for the most sensitive parameters with total indices above 0 05 as indicated soil evap plant cover a parameter that accounts for the effect of plant cover on reduced evaporation from soil surface is the most sensitive parameter root growth soil affects et simulation by accounting for the constraining effect of soil characteristics i e soil bulk density texture and water content on root growth which in turn affects et apex adjusts the simulated et values for rainfall interception and litter storage therefore microbial top soil coeff and max rain intercept parameters that respectively affect transformation of litter on the soil surface and amount of intercepted rainfall were among the top 4 sensitive parameters however they were not included among calibration parameters because they did not have a major impact on the simulated et compared to the soil evap plant cover and root growth soil soil evap plant cover and root growth soil were selected as calibration parameters and their optimum values corresponding to the minimization of the ssr for annual et values were calculated fig 3 illustrates monthly average values for the predicted and observed et for the entire simulation period 2001 2010 as indicated in fig 3 the monthly average of simulated et values corresponded well with the observed data 0 65 nse 0 75 which corresponds to good category of model performance according to moriasi et al 2007 however the simulated crop yield largely did not capture the observed magnitudes and dynamics of the observed values as illustrated in fig 4 the crop yield for cotton in year 2001 is over predicted by 67 relative to the observed crop values grain sorghum was over predicted by 91 in year 2003 the over prediction of crop yield is repeated during years 2004 and 2006 by 20 and 47 for cotton and grain sorghum respectively the predictions of crop yield are more reasonable for years 2007 and 2008 with relative errors of 27 and 9 for grain sorghum and cotton respectively the result of et calibration indicated that apex can have a good model performance for et prediction even when the predicted crop yield values are significantly different from the observed in other words having a good performance for et simulation which is the result of both climate and crop characteristics as simulated in apex does not necessarily imply accurate crop growth simulation which itself affects et and crop yield therefore it is important to check the consistency of the predicted crop yield values with available data or information even if the model produces seemingly good results for et simulations the second calibration scheme which involved both the parameters used in the first calibration scheme and crop growth parameters was implemented to perform a simultaneous calibration of apex for annual et and crop yield table 2 presents the selected parameters as well as their corresponding ranges of values which were determined based on a recent study by marek et al 2016 on the same study area and the parameter values used by apex and swat models steglich and williams 2013 arnold et al 2012 fig 5 illustrates the observed and simulated time series of et calibrated for both annual et and crop yield values the rmse was reduced by 19 and the nse value was enhanced by 12 compared to the first calibration scheme improving the quality of et calibration to very good category i e nse 0 75 according to moriasi et al 2007 the comparison of nse and rmse for et values corresponding to scheme1 and scheme2 figs 3 and 5 calibrations confirms the role of plant development parameters on the accuracy of predicted et values the performance measures were also calculated for different time scales to illustrate the impact of model calibration using scheme1 on the improvement of et predictions at different time scales and were evaluated for calibration validation and the entire simulation periods fig 6 as indicated in fig 6a the model performance measures tend to degrade for finer time scales as the difference between simulated and observed values are mitigated by averaging of compensating error terms i e overestimation of values compensated by underestimation of others according to fig 6b scheme2 calibration resulted only in approximately 5 reduction in rmse at the annual scales relative to rmse resulted from scheme1 however this improvement translated to 25 reduction in rmse on 3 month time scales and 13 to 19 reduction for other time scales in fig 6b the most pronounced improvement in apex output was observed in crop yield simulation fig 7 in contrast to scheme1 in which simulated crop yield values were grossly overestimated e g 67 and 91 overestimation of cottons and grain sorghum respectively the error for simulated values resulting from scheme2 calibrations are within 25 of their corresponding observed values the results in fig 6 highlight the utility of observed annual crop yield data in improving model performance in et prediction for different time scales in addition annual crop yield data led to finding proper crop growth parameters that are consistent with site specific conditions and result in more accurate crop yield predictions fig 7 compared to those that are based on parameter values available in the apex crop database the effect of finding representative crop growth parameters through scheme2 calibration procedure was also reflected in more accurate lai predictions compared to those obtained using scheme1 fig 8 the observed lai in fig 8 represent the mean of a few measured lai data that were collected during the simulation years as indicated the lai simulated using scheme1 calibration was largely overestimated for both cotton and sorghum for years 2003 2004 and 2008 the consistency between the simulated and observed lai values corroborates the validity of the crop growth parameters that were estimated through the proposed calibration framework utilizing both annual et and crop yield data it should be noted that the lai measured data were not used for model calibration and that accuracy of their prediction is based on the result of the apex calibration using annual et and crop yield data 5 conclusion in this study a calibration procedure was proposed and tested for simultaneous calibration of agricultural policy environmental extender apex model for annual evapotranspiration et and crop yield using observed data from a study area in bushland texas the annual time series of et and crop yield data were scaled to form a compounded time series a script in the r environment was developed to automate the calibration of apex model by optimizing the sum of squared residuals of the compounded time series through the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm the search space for parameters was constrained by assigning ranges of values that were consistent with previous studies in the region and reported values in the literature two calibration schemes i e scheme1 and scheme2 utilizing annual et only and annual et and crop yield data respectively were performed to assess the impact of utilizing crop yield data on model performance related to et and crop yield predictions apex calibration using scheme2 resulted in a 5 reduction in the root mean square error rmse performance measure relative to the value for scheme1 this improvement in annual et predictions translated into a 25 rmse reduction for 3 month and reductions of 18 for monthly 17 for 2 week 19 for weekly 17 for 3 day and 13 for daily time scales scheme2 calibration substantially improved the crop yield predictions as the predicted values for both cotton and grain sorghum were within 25 of observed values according to results the annual et data and annual crop data were shown to contain sufficient information for estimating model parameters that are conducive to improved prediction at finer temporal time scales in addition simultaneous consideration of both et and crop yield in calibration which was achieved through scheme2 calibration ensured that the calibrated parameters are not over fitted to produce improved predictions for one output at the cost of a degraded prediction quality for another the improved simulation of crop growth processes that resulted in better predictions for annual crop yield were validated using measured leaf area index lai data which were not used for calibration the simulated lai values obtained using scheme2 led to improved simulation of lai dynamics compared to scheme1 predictions where lai values were largely overestimated overall the proposed calibration strategy provided an efficient and objective method for utilizing the annual et and crop yield data for finding representative parameter values that are conducive to improved simulation of et at different time scales as well as crop growth and production

where s t is the scaled variable x t is the original variable and x m i n and x m a x are the minimum and maximum observed values respectively 1 s t x t x m i n x m a x x m i n scaling of the simulated et and crop values allowed formation of a compounded single time series containing dimensionless values for scaled annual et and crop yield values the objective function used for optimizations was the sum of squared residuals ssr given in eq 2 where s i o b s and s i s i m and represents the scaled compounded time series of observed and simulated values respectively 2 s s r i 1 n s i o b s s i s i m 2 a script was developed in the r environment to optimize the srr objective function based on the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm vrugt et al 2009a the dream algorithm provides an efficient search method for exploring parameter space by launching a set of interacting chains that explore different parts of the parameter space it was selected based on its successful application to hydrologic model calibrations and its superior efficiency in finding global optimum values in highly non linear objective functions with high dimension of parameter space vrugt et al 2009b talebizadeh et al 2016 the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values were calculated and used to compare the quality of the two calibration

evapotranspiration research facility located at bushland texas 35 19 n 102 10 w and 1170 m elevation was used as the study area it consists of four fields each having an area of approximately 4 7 ha and each equipped with a large weighing lysimeter located at its center and an associated weather station fig 1 the soil type is mainly well drained pullman silty clay loam soil marek et al 2016 and the local climate is classified as semiarid with large diurnal and day to day temperature variations the eastern fields of the research area ne and se in fig 1 were managed as irrigated fields whereas the western fields nw and sw in fig 1 were often managed under dryland conditions marek et al 2016 the nw field was selected for the current study and its apex model based on apex0806 version was created using the web interface for apex nutrient tracking tool ntt saleh et al 2011 the measured weather data used for simulation precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation covering the period of 2000 2010 were collected from a station located near the study area table 1 provides a summary of the crops cultivated during 2001 2010 in the nw field marek et al 2016 the soil and land use information were derived from internal ntt databases that are built on the soil survey geographic ssurgo and national agricultural statistics service cropland data layer nass cdl data respectively year 2000 was selected for model warm up and the periods of 2001 2006 and 2007 2010 were selected as calibration and validation periods respectively the adopted division of years was based on the study of marek et al 2016 in the same field and includes at least two years with cotton and sorghum crops in calibration period i e 2001 and 2004 for cotton and 2003 and 2006 for grain sorghum 4 results and discussion fig 2 illustrates the sensitivity results for the most sensitive parameters with total indices above 0 05 as indicated soil evap plant cover a parameter that accounts for the effect of plant cover on reduced evaporation from soil surface is the most sensitive parameter root growth soil affects et simulation by accounting for the constraining effect of soil characteristics i e soil bulk density texture and water content on root growth which in turn affects et apex adjusts the simulated et values for rainfall interception and litter storage therefore microbial top soil coeff and max rain intercept parameters that respectively affect transformation of litter on the soil surface and amount of intercepted rainfall were among the top 4 sensitive parameters however they were not included among calibration parameters because they did not have a major impact on the simulated et compared to the soil evap plant cover and root growth soil soil evap plant cover and root growth soil were selected as calibration parameters and their optimum values corresponding to the minimization of the ssr for annual et values were calculated fig 3 illustrates monthly average values for the predicted and observed et for the entire simulation period 2001 2010 as indicated in fig 3 the monthly average of simulated et values corresponded well with the observed data 0 65 nse 0 75 which corresponds to good category of model performance according to moriasi et al 2007 however the simulated crop yield largely did not capture the observed magnitudes and dynamics of the observed values as illustrated in fig 4 the crop yield for cotton in year 2001 is over predicted by 67 relative to the observed crop values grain sorghum was over predicted by 91 in year 2003 the over prediction of crop yield is repeated during years 2004 and 2006 by 20 and 47 for cotton and grain sorghum respectively the predictions of crop yield are more reasonable for years 2007 and 2008 with relative errors of 27 and 9 for grain sorghum and cotton respectively the result of et calibration indicated that apex can have a good model performance for et prediction even when the predicted crop yield values are significantly different from the observed in other words having a good performance for et simulation which is the result of both climate and crop characteristics as simulated in apex does not necessarily imply accurate crop growth simulation which itself affects et and crop yield therefore it is important to check the consistency of the predicted crop yield values with available data or information even if the model produces seemingly good results for et simulations the second calibration scheme which involved both the parameters used in the first calibration scheme and crop growth parameters was implemented to perform a simultaneous calibration of apex for annual et and crop yield table 2 presents the selected parameters as well as their corresponding ranges of values which were determined based on a recent study by marek et al 2016 on the same study area and the parameter values used by apex and swat models steglich and williams 2013 arnold et al 2012 fig 5 illustrates the observed and simulated time series of et calibrated for both annual et and crop yield values the rmse was reduced by 19 and the nse value was enhanced by 12 compared to the first calibration scheme improving the quality of et calibration to very good category i e nse 0 75 according to moriasi et al 2007 the comparison of nse and rmse for et values corresponding to scheme1 and scheme2 figs 3 and 5 calibrations confirms the role of plant development parameters on the accuracy of predicted et values the performance measures were also calculated for different time scales to illustrate the impact of model calibration using scheme1 on the improvement of et predictions at different time scales and were evaluated for calibration validation and the entire simulation periods fig 6 as indicated in fig 6a the model performance measures tend to degrade for finer time scales as the difference between simulated and observed values are mitigated by averaging of compensating error terms i e overestimation of values compensated by underestimation of others according to fig 6b scheme2 calibration resulted only in approximately 5 reduction in rmse at the annual scales relative to rmse resulted from scheme1 however this improvement translated to 25 reduction in rmse on 3 month time scales and 13 to 19 reduction for other time scales in fig 6b the most pronounced improvement in apex output was observed in crop yield simulation fig 7 in contrast to scheme1 in which simulated crop yield values were grossly overestimated e g 67 and 91 overestimation of cottons and grain sorghum respectively the error for simulated values resulting from scheme2 calibrations are within 25 of their corresponding observed values the results in fig 6 highlight the utility of observed annual crop yield data in improving model performance in et prediction for different time scales in addition annual crop yield data led to finding proper crop growth parameters that are consistent with site specific conditions and result in more accurate crop yield predictions fig 7 compared to those that are based on parameter values available in the apex crop database the effect of finding representative crop growth parameters through scheme2 calibration procedure was also reflected in more accurate lai predictions compared to those obtained using scheme1 fig 8 the observed lai in fig 8 represent the mean of a few measured lai data that were collected during the simulation years as indicated the lai simulated using scheme1 calibration was largely overestimated for both cotton and sorghum for years 2003 2004 and 2008 the consistency between the simulated and observed lai values corroborates the validity of the crop growth parameters that were estimated through the proposed calibration framework utilizing both annual et and crop yield data it should be noted that the lai measured data were not used for model calibration and that accuracy of their prediction is based on the result of the apex calibration using annual et and crop yield data 5 conclusion in this study a calibration procedure was proposed and tested for simultaneous calibration of agricultural policy environmental extender apex model for annual evapotranspiration et and crop yield using observed data from a study area in bushland texas the annual time series of et and crop yield data were scaled to form a compounded time series a script in the r environment was developed to automate the calibration of apex model by optimizing the sum of squared residuals of the compounded time series through the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm the search space for parameters was constrained by assigning ranges of values that were consistent with previous studies in the region and reported values in the literature two calibration schemes i e scheme1 and scheme2 utilizing annual et only and annual et and crop yield data respectively were performed to assess the impact of utilizing crop yield data on model performance related to et and crop yield predictions apex calibration using scheme2 resulted in a 5 reduction in the root mean square error rmse performance measure relative to the value for scheme1 this improvement in annual et predictions translated into a 25 rmse reduction for 3 month and reductions of 18 for monthly 17 for 2 week 19 for weekly 17 for 3 day and 13 for daily time scales scheme2 calibration substantially improved the crop yield predictions as the predicted values for both cotton and grain sorghum were within 25 of observed values according to results the annual et data and annual crop data were shown to contain sufficient information for estimating model parameters that are conducive to improved prediction at finer temporal time scales in addition simultaneous consideration of both et and crop yield in calibration which was achieved through scheme2 calibration ensured that the calibrated parameters are not over fitted to produce improved predictions for one output at the cost of a degraded prediction quality for another the improved simulation of crop growth processes that resulted in better predictions for annual crop yield were validated using measured leaf area index lai data which were not used for calibration the simulated lai values obtained using scheme2 led to improved simulation of lai dynamics compared to scheme1 predictions where lai values were largely overestimated overall the proposed calibration strategy provided an efficient and objective method for utilizing the annual et and crop yield data for finding representative parameter values that are conducive to improved simulation of et at different time scales as well as crop growth and production

fertilization level on soil properties enzyme activities and wheat yield experiments were carried out in micro lysimeters at the groundwater depths of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 m under low normal and high fertilization levels in the winter wheat growth season from oct 2015 to may 2016 soil water content ph organic matter content total n available p available k as well as sucrase urease and phosphatase activities were measured in various growth stages of winter wheat and yield component and grain yield were also measured after its harvest results indicated that soil water content and ph

stage and phosphatase activities increased significantly with the increased groundwater depth grain yield increased with groundwater depth to its maximum or approximate steady value total n and available p contents and urease activity appeared to increase with fertilizer application rate but available k content showed a contrary tendency grain yield increased with fertilizer application rate but the effect of fertilization level on grain yield was lower than that of groundwater depth a significant interaction between groundwater depth and fertilization level on grain yield existed soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with available p content and phosphatase activity was correlated with soil water ph organic matter total n and available k contents it can be concluded that controlling groundwater depth and appropriate fertilizer application level can improve crop growth environment and promote winter wheat growth and its grain yield keywords correlation fertilizer

but this region frequently suffers waterlogging disasters because of high intensity rainfall during the wheat growing season and poor drainage conditions ren et al 2016 as a major abiotic stress affecting crop productivity bansal and srivastava 2015 about 10 15 million hectares of the world s wheat growing acreage are affected by waterlogging each year and subsequently results in a 20 50 reduction on winter wheat yields yu and chen 2013 groundwater table as an index to distinguish the oxygenated soil layer and the water saturated aquifer below is important to soil physico chemical properties soil fertility and subsequent crop growth pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 excessive rain under a shallow groundwater table condition results in waterlogging problems and hence aggravates oxygen supply which adversely affects photosynthesis due to low oxygen stress on roots yang et al 2013 bansal and srivastava 2015 najeeb et al 2015 ghobadi et al 2017 enzyme activity and plant growth pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 in addition a shallow groundwater table is more likely to result in secondary soil salinization or sodification if excessive salt exists in the groundwater or soil xu et al 2013 abliz et al 2016 however on the other hand groundwater is an important water source for plant growth and a deep groundwater table is a disadvantage to plant water replenishment from groundwater zimmermann et al 2017 excessively deep groundwater worsens plant growth environment and decreases crop yield as a result of the shortage of water supplies trillo and fernández 2005 and hence increases agricultural production costs scheumann 1997 soil fertility is closely related to groundwater table depth zimmermann et al 2017 groundwater depth affects soil moisture and in turn controls soil aerobic microbe activity and subsequently organic matter mineralization and either high or low soil water content is disadvantageous for soil fertility and crop growth guan 1986 adiku et al 2008 ren et al 2016 as compared to continuous wet soil under a high groundwater level soil drying stimulates n mineralization and reduces its denitrification with both effects leading to an increase of n availability venterink et al 2002 furthermore drying soil also increases k release from the soil venterink et al 2002 as an important index on the health status of soil fertility and soil productivity xiao et al 2016 soil enzymes that are closely related to microbial activity can catalyze some important reactions of soil nutrient cycling and control its cycling rate yang et al 2014 chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 pascazio et al 2018 sucrase hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose to provide energy for the growth of crop roots and microorganisms guan 1986 kang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 urease accelerates the hydrolysis of nitrogen to ammonia and phosphatase improves the rate of dephosphorization where organic phosphorus is decomposed into inorganic phosphorus guan 1986 hu et al 2014 lots of research results indicate that soil sucrase urease and phosphatase activities correlate with total c and n due to higher microbial biomass and greater stabilization nannipieri et al 2012 kang et al 2013 soil enzyme activity is also affected by soil nutrition status as an inhibiting promoting factor or metabolic product soil ph metal or non metallic ions and compounds are common inhibitors for enzyme activity guan 1986 hu et al 2014 sucrase activity would be enhanced with a little sugar in the soil and urease activity is stimulated by amino acid guan 1986 phosphatase activity is inhibited by high p availability olander and vitouser 2000 the mineralization of p in excess of demand would rapidly result in a negative feedback that represses phosphatase production and maintains p level below or near its threshold level for inhibition to occur olander and vitouser 2000 present studies about enzyme activity mainly focus on the relationship among soil physico chemical properties and its response to irrigation measures fertilizer application cultivation methods and edaphic conditions etc kang et al 2009 han et al 2012 wei et al 2012 yang et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 crop growth crop yield and soil nutrient transformation under a shallow groundwater table are mostly affected by hypoxia inhibition and water stress on root growth as well as microbial activity anuradha et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 however the effects of the groundwater table depth on soil physico chemical properties enzyme activity and crop growth have not been widely investigated by adjusting the groundwater table the relations among soil physico chemical properties enzyme activity and crop growth can be best managed and hence alleviate waterlogging hazards on crop growth li et al 2015 si et al 2018 and this is important to improve the crop growth environment and to utilize groundwater more efficiently therefore the objective of this research is to assess the effects of a shallow groundwater table and fertilization levels on soil physico chemical properties soil enzyme activity and winter wheat yield so as to explore the optimal growth environments of winter wheat under a shallow groundwater table 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental treatments the experimental site is located at the experimental station of

radius from oct 2015 to may 2016 the micro lysimeters were evenly filled layer by layer with soil collected from a local farm field at the bulk density of 1 27 g cm 3 the groundwater level in the micro lysimeters was controlled at the constant depths of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 m from the soil surface by water inlet and outlet appratus and excess water was drained out of micro lysimeters

than 5 0 m experimental arrangement for different treatments was shown in fig 2 winter wheat triticum aestivum l was sowed on 28 oct 2015 at a density of 210 plants m 2 and harvested on 4 may of the following year during the wheat growth period compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o of 14 16 15 and urea were applied at three times before sowing at the seedling stage and then again at the jointing stage and their proportion for the three times was 7 1 2 according to the habits of local farmers n p and k application rates in the whole growth period of winter wheat respectively were 180 65 and 60 kg ha

experimental treatmeats contained five groundwater depths of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 m and three fertilization levels of low normal and high fertilizer application rates table 1 the application rates of compound fertilizer for the low fertilization level and the high fertilization level were 75 75 nf and 125 125 nf of the normal fertilizer application rate nf treatment respectively all experimental treatments in the study were replicated three times 2 2 monitoring items and measurement methods daily rainfall and air temperature were obtained from a standard automatic weather station located in the experimental station fig 3 the data of monthly rainfall from 1952 to 2016 obtained from national science technology intertructure of china were used to calculate drought index for

was tested by one way analysis of variance anova using spss 21 0 spss inc chicago usa when the f value in the anova was statistically significant a least significant difference test significance level of p 0 05 was used for seperation of the means partial correlation analysis with a two tailed method and multiple linear regression glm repeated measures were applied to analyze the relationship among wheat grain yield with soil physico chemical properties nutrients and enzyme activities and the level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 when using the pearson correlation 3 results 3 1 rainfall year type in the experimental period the rainfall was 388 0 mm in the winter wheat growth period of 2015 2016 which corresponds to the rainfall at 29 2 of multi year average rainfall probability in this region the calculation results showed that the drought index for rainfall was 0 05 and 0 34 respectively in 2016 and during the winter wheat growth period the mean daily air temperature was 12 2 c during the experimental period which was close to the multi year mean temperature 12 4 c of 65 years 1952 2016 therefore the weather condition in the experimental period generally represented a normal rainfall year 3 2 soil water content ph and organic matter content the variation of soil water content with groundwater depth in different winter wheat growth stages was shown in fig 4 for three fertilization levels soil water content generally decreased with the increased groundwater depth in various wheat growth stages due to weakened soil capillary effect and it also decreased significantly with growth time possibly as a result of increasing crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates fig 4 fertilizer application rate did not obviously affect soil water content fig 4 soil ph generally decreased with groundwater depth due to decreased groundwater evaporation and it also decreased with wheat growth time as a result of more rainfall in the late period of winter wheat growth fig 5 soil ph lowered from 7 84 0 20 to 7 63 0 17 when groundwater depth increased from 0 2 to 0 8 m and from 7 83 0 14 to 7 61 0 11 from the wintering stage to the filling stage on average for all three fertilization levels soil ph was obviously affected by fertilization level and the ph decreased with the increase of fertilizer application rate fig 5 the tested soil was generally neutral or weakly alkaline and soil secondary salinization or sodification was not found in this region due to the good quality of the groundwater and frequent rainfall leaching scanlon et al 2010 xu et al 2013 abliz et al 2016 soil organic matter content generally showed a tendency of first decreasing and then increasing with the increased groundwater depth which displayed the lowest level near the groundwater depth of 0 5 0 6 m fig 6 soil organic matter content increased with wheat growth time due to the combined effects of the increasing fine roots and strengthening microbial activity esmaeilzadeh and ahangar 2014 chandra et al 2016 the fertilizer application rate did not show an obvious influence on soil organic matter content average soil organic matter cotent was 9 40 0 73 10 01 0 76 9 79 0 80 and 10 16 0 76 g kg 1 respectively for the wintering jointing heading and filling growth stages of winter wheat under different experimental conditions soil organic matter content is affected by many environmental factors esmaeilzadeh and ahangar 2014 paul 2016 soil air permability soil water status microbe species and its activity intensity etc which are determined by the groundwater table depth under experimental conditions affect organic matter decomposition rate and its formation esmaeilzadeh and ahangar 2014 chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however crop root system growth and incompletely decomposed hairy root removal would result in a great variation on the measured organic matter content hu et al 2013 hobley et al 2015 which may be the reason for the insignificant influence of groundwater depth on soil organic matter content fig 6 3 3 nitrogen phosphorus and potassium contents in soil total n content in soil generally decreased at first and then slightly increased with an increased groundwater depth with the lowest content at the groundwater depth of about 0 6 m data not shown the total n content appeared to show a decreasing tendency with wheat growth time because of more absorption by crops but an increasing tendency with fertilizer application rate the total n content of 1 19 0 09 1 23 0 09 and 1 26 0 10 g kg 1 respectively at low normal and high fertilizer application rates in tested soil was within its normal range of the cultivated farmland soil in this region liu 2011 the variation tendency of available p content in soil with groundwater depth was similar to the soil s total n content fig 7 soil available p content decreased with wheat growth time respectively from the wintering to jointing stages and from the heading to filling stages due to crop absorption and utilization and the higher available p contents in the heading and filling stages than that in the wintering and jointing stages were the result of supplementary fertilizer application after sampling in the jointing stage the available p content in soil in the jointing stage was 13 70 3 83 14 93 3 13 and 17 59 5 12 mg kg 1 respectively at low normal and high fertilizer application rates which was significantly lower than that in the other growth stages under the same fertilizer rate and groundwater depth conditions fig 7 this may indicate the p status in the jointing stage was at a serious deficit for the wheat growth requirement with a normal soil availability p level of 16 25 mg kg 1 zhan et al 2015 the available p content in soil increased with the increased fertilizer application rate fig 7 available k content in soil showed a significant decrease at first and then an increase tendency with the increasing groundwater depth and the lowest available k level also appeared at the groundwater depth of 0 5 0 6 m fig 8 the available k content under a high fertilizer application rate decreased with wheat growth time and it also significantly decreased with the fertilizer application rate fig 8 which possibly means more k is adsorbed and utilized by wheat due to more vigorous growth under a good nutrient status venterink et al 2002 steffens et al 2005 as compared with a balanced status of n p k mineral nutrients available k content is usually higher under an n or p deficiency shang et al 2014 3 4 soil sucrase urease and phosphatase activities the effect of groundwater depth on sucrase activity depended on wheat growth stages fig 9 sucrase activity did not show an obvious variation with groundwater depth in the wintering and jointing stages sucrase activity increased significantly with groundwater depth in the heading stage however it increased initially and then decreased with groundwater depth in the filling stage and its peak value appeared at the groundwater depth of about 0 5 m fig 9 sucrase activity generally decreased with wheat growth time except in the heading stage and the sucrase activity in the heading stage was significantly higher than the other growth stages especially at a deep groundwater table which is related to vigorous growth roots in this growth stage yang et al 2013 chandra et al 2016 liang et al 2018 the sucrase activity was not affected significantly by fertilizer application rate and it was 1 10 0 28 1 17 0 26 and 1 12 0 33 mg glucose g soil 24 h 1 on average over the whole growth period respectively for low normal and high fertilization levels the variation tendency of urease activity with groundwater depth was different in various growth stages of winter wheat fig 10 urease activity increased significantly with groundwater depth in the jointing stage and it did not obviously change with groundwater depth in the other growth stages fig 10 urease activity was higher in the jointing stage but lower in the other growth stages except the wintering stage under a high level of fertilization treatment the reason for higher urease activity in the wintering stage under the high level of fertilization treatment was not clear fig 10 urease activity significantly increased with the increased fertilizer application rate and the average urease activity in the whole wheat growth period under different groundwater depths was 0 13 0 05 0 13 0 04 and 0 16 0 05 mg nh4 n g soil 24 h 1 respectively for low normal and high fertilizer application rates in general phosphatase activity increased significantly with groundwater depth and wheat growth time fig 11 the phosphatase activity level in the wintering growth stage was significantly lower than that in the other growth stages which possibly was related with the more available p in soil in this stage fig 7 olander and vitouser 2000 the phosphatase activity in the jointing heading and filling stages was 2 6 9 5 8 8 11 8 and 6 3 12 9 times higher than that in the wintering stage respectively for low normal and high fertilization levels which is similar to the conclusion of hu et al 2014 that phosphatase activity in the filling stage was at its highest over the whole growth period of wheat soil phosphatase activity was greater in the normal fertilizer application rate than that in the low and high application rates fig 11 with the mean values of 0 80 0 57 1 09 0 62 and 1 02 0 66 mg phenol g soil 24 h 1 respectively for low normal and high fertilizer application rates 3 5 wheat yield and its components crop height the number of spikes per unit area and ear length monotonously increased with groundwater depth significantly table 2 which means that a deep groundwater table is suitable to winter wheat tillering and plant growth however the number of spikelets per spike significantly increased at first and then decreased with groundwater depth and reached a maximum at the groundwater depth of 0 5 0 6 m and the number of infertility spikelets per spike showed a contrary tendency as spikelets per spike did grain number per ear and 1000 grain weight also showed a tendency of firstly increase and then decrease with groundwater depth and the maximum appeared as groundwater depth was 0 5 0 6 m these results indicate that deep groundwater table is not suitable to wheat grain formation possibly due to an insufficient water supply fig 4 and disadvantageous nutrient utilization figs 7 and 8 wheat grain yield significantly increased with groundwater depth as an s type curve relation and the optimal groundwater depth that appeared an approximate steady or maximum yield was about 0 6 m table 2 the optimal groundwater increased with fertilizer application rate because a high fertilization level promotes wheat growth and root system into a deeper soil layer and hence facilitates the absorption and utilization of water from the deep soil table 2 which may indicate an interaction between groundwater depth and fertilization level on wheat yield generally fertilizer application was beneficial to the increase of crop height spike number grain number per ear 1000 grain weight and grain yield and to the decrease of spikelet number per spike and infertility spikelet number per spike table 2 however the effects of fertilizer application rate on them were small and statistically insignificant 4 discussion and analyses the effect of rainfall on wheat growth status was weaken as a result of intense capillary rise under shallow and constant groundwater level in addition the experiment was conducted in a normal rainfall year compared with weather data in 56 years therefore the experiment results represented the winter wheat growth status of a normal rainfall condition in this region 4 1 effects of groundwater depth the anova test results showed that groundwater depth significantly affected soil physico chemical properties soil nutrient contents soil phosphatase activity and wheat grain yield at a p 0 05 probability level table 3 with the increase of groundwater depth soil capillary function is weakened liu et al 2015 najeeb et al 2015 ghobadi et al 2017 and soil water content was decreased fig 4 meanwhile less groundwater is evaporated and subsequently less salt is accumulated on surface soil xu et al 2013 abliz et al 2016 haddadi et al 2016 and hence resulted in a lower soil ph fig 5 both excessive high and too low soil water contents depress soil organic matter decomposition and wheat growth guan 1986 adiku et al 2008 which resulted in soil organic matter content decreasing initially and then increasing with the increased groundwater depth fig 6 soil waterlogging is alleviated and crop growth status is improved following an appropriate increased groundwater depth anuradha et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 and hence crops can grow more vigorously more nutrient ions in the soil are absorbed and utilized by the crops yang et al 2013 which resulted in the decrease of total n available p and available k contents in soil with the increased groundwater depth figs 7 and 8 however an excessive lowering of the groundwater table necessarily increases the difficulty of water absorption from groundwater and decreases water utilization by the crops which adversely affects crop growth and its nutrient absorption from soil trillo and fernández 2005 yang et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2017 and in turn resulted in an increased tendency of soil nutrient contents as the groundwater depth was greater than a critical value figs 7 and 8 soil microorganisms and plant roots are the main sources of soil enzymes yang et al 2014 chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 increased groundwater depth improves the soil s aerobic environment soil microbial biological activity and root cell viability anuradha et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 and hence increases hydrolase activities guan 1986 our experimental data confirmed that the soil phosphatase activity generally increased with the lowered groundwater table fig 11 but the effects of the groundwater depth on sucrase and urease activities were not significant table 3 other factors except groundwater depth such as soil temperature substrate concentrations growth stage etc may individually and or interactively affect soil enzyme activities as well guan 1986 kang et al 2009 nannipieri et al 2012 liang et al 2018 the effect of groundwater depth on wheat grain yield mainly is through a tradeoff between the water supply from groundwater and the wheat growth environment liu et al 2015 a shallow groundwater table can supply more water from groundwater to wheat growth but meanwhile it may also deteriorate some soil microorganisms and the wheat growth environment due to poor soil aeration excessive soil water content decreases dry matter accumulation the redistribution of stored photosynthate to the grain and the conversion capacity from carbohydrate to starch in grain jiang et al 2008 ren et al 2016 and hence results in the reduction of 1000 grain weight and grain yield table 2 under a shallow groundwater table ghobadi et al 2017 the response of wheat yield to groundwater depth depends on which of the water deficit level and growth environment is more important for its growth zimmermann et al 2017 a groundwater depth that is as shallow as possible but at the same time can maintain sufficient soil aeration is beneficial to wheat grain formation and its yield zimmermann et al 2017 4 2 effects of fertilizer application rate fertilizer application rate significantly affacted total n and available k contents in soil soil enzyme activities and wheat grain yield at a p 0 05 statistical level table 3 fertilizer application increased available n and p nutrients in soil fig 7 and hence resulted in more vigorous wheat growth and more k absorption and utilization by wheat steffens et al 2005 shang et al 2014 which possibly is the cause on the reduction of available k content in soil when the fertilizer application rate increased fig 8 generally n and p fertilizer application can promote microbial growth and enzyme activities nannipieri et al 2012 kang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 however sucrase and phosphatase activities were slightly higher in the normal fertilization level than that in the other two fertilizer application treatments figs 9 and 11 as suggested by guan 1986 an overdosed urea and phosphate application can inhibit urease phosphatase and other soil enzyme activities nutrient addition into soil acts as a selective pressure on bacterial community han et al 2012 and the increased soil nutrient following fertilizer application produces an increase in enzyme decomposition and hence results in an opposite effect on enzyme activities kang et al 2009 in this study an obvious inhibitory effect of fertilizer application on urease activity didn t occur fig 10 which may be due to the fact that its dosage level under the high fertilizer application rate was not enough to suppress urease activity guan 1986 fertilizer application increases the amount of soil nutrient and hence improves photosynthetic activity and its efficiency promotes aboveground dry mass accumulation and partitioning towards reproductive organs and consequently improves winter wheat yield jiang et al 2008 ierna and mauromicale 2018 however the effect of fertilizer application on wheat grain yield p 0 01 was less than that of groundwater depth p 0 001 under experimental conditions table 3 which indicates that crop growth is largely determined by soil water content yang et al 2013 this possibly is because shallow groundwater depth alters nutrient availability to plants the significant interaction p 0 001 between the groundwater depth and fertilizer application rate on soil available k content and wheat grain yield shown in table 3 confirmed this inference yang et al 2013 4 3 correlation between soil physico chemical properties and enzyme activities soil total n and available k contents were positively correlated with soil water content and soil ph significantly at a p 0 05 probability level table 4 which indicates their availability to wheat were inhibited and more n and k nutrients were left in the soil under a shallow groundwater table soil available p and organic matter contents were negatively correlated with soil water content and ph significantly table 4 near neutral ph values were optimum for the uptake of phosphate and phosphate ions could be fixed by calcium at a high ph barrow 2017 phosphatase activity was negatively correlated significantly with both soil water content and soil ph sucrase activity was negatively correlated only with soil ph and urease activity did not correlate significantly with both soil water content and ph table 4 possibly because soil water content and soil ph have different effects for various kinds of enzymes guan 1986 soil ph is a primary factor for controlling microbial activity and enzyme kinetics kang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 and microbial enzymatic production the ionization induced conformational changes of enzymes and the availability of substrates and enzymatic co factors are closely dependent on soil ph hu et al 2014 due to poor soil aeration and subsequently inhibition of soil microbial and root cell activity palta et al 2010 anuradha et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 si et al 2018 an increasing soil water content decreased phosphatase activity fig 11 and table 4 nevertheless wallenstein et al 2011 thought that the reactions of some soil enzymes to soil moisture were independent from active microbes and the relationship between these enzymes and soil moisture could be insignificant skujins 1976 available p and available k contents as well as urease and phosphatase activities also showed a significant positive correlation to organic matter content in soil table 4 more soil organic matter increases the microorganism population in soil and promotes soil enzyme activity guan 1986 hu et al 2014 meanwhile the improving enzyme activity accelerates organic matter decomposition and hence provides more available nutrition for crops chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 under experimental conditions soil available p content was positively correlated with sucrase activity and was negatively correlated with urease activity significantly however total n and available k did not significantly correlate with them phosphoric and thiophosphoric acids are very effective inhibitors for soil urease and soil available p also could be a factor to inhibit urease activity liao and raines 1985 sucrase activity increases with the enhanced microbial activity following more available p hu et al 2014 vlek et al 1980 thought that active urease activity could hydrolyze more urea and hence resulted in more n loss because of ammonia volatilization but guan 1986 found that sucrase and urease activities were not correlative with n level the discrepancy in the correlation between total n with urease is probably due to concentrations of urea n resulting from different soil water contents vlek et al 1980 sucrase and urease activities involves in mineralization of c n and p but not k kang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 and potassium may not be a factor to stimulate or inhibit these enzyme activities guan 1986 which possibly is the reason that sucrase and urease activities were irrelevant to soil available k content phosphatase was negatively correlated with total n and available k significantly at a p 0 01 probability level total n and available k contents can suppress phosphatase activity due to an imbalance in the proportion of soil nutrients as k p n p and c p guan 1986 phosphatase was also positively correlated with available p content at a p 0 05 probability level due to hydrolysis of organic phosphorus guan 1986 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 pascazio et al 2018 in addition phosphatase activity positively correlating with sucrase activity may be related to accumulation and decomposition of soil orgainc matter hu et al 2014 the relationships among soil enzyme activities and nutrient contents are very complicated wei et al 2012 and their mutual influence mechanisms should be studied further it can be inconcluded from the experimental results that groundwater depth not only determines water accessibility to crop growth but more important it also obviously changes soil environemtal conditions for crop growth that affects nutrient absorption and utilization by crops the most important soil environmental factor that affects soil chemical properity and enzyme activity under shallow groundwater level seems to be soil aeration that is related with groundwater depth zhang et al 2017 the effects of groundwater depth on soil chemical properity enzyme activity and subsequently crop growth are complex and fertilizer application rate may exaggerate this complexity further in the region with shallow groundwater level a good field management is to supply sufficient water supplement and meanwhile a good nutrient availability and utilization condition for crop growth as indicated in table 2 fertilization level did not obviously affected wheat yield under the extreme adverse soil environmetal condition such as at the groundwater depth of 0 2 m a significant effect of fertilization level on crop yield was appeared when groundwater depth became greater but the effect was weakened again following the further increase of groundwater depth therefore a suitable groundwater depth is key for good crop growth and potential maxmium yield 5 conclusions 1 soil water content and soil ph decreased with the increased groundwater depth but soil phosphatase activity increased with it soil organic matter and nutrient contents generally were minimum and wheat grain yield tended to be maximum or approximate steady when groundwater depth was about 0 5 0 6 m which indicated this range of groundwater depth could provide an optimal soil environment for crop growth 2 soil total n available p urease activity and wheat grain yield increased with the increase of fertilizer application rate but soil available k content decreased with it due to more k absorption by crops under higher n and p contents sucrase and phosphatase activities were greater in the normal fertilization level than that in the high fertilization level possibly due to the inhibition role after overdosed urea and phosphate application 3 the effect of fertilization level on wheat yield was significant when groundwater depth was 0 4 0 5 m but it was not obvious when the groundwater depth was smaller or greater than this range value an interaction effect between groundwater depth and fertilizer application rate on wheat grain yield existed and in general the effect of groundwater depth on wheat grain yield was greater than that of fertilizer application rate under experimental conditions therefore a good soil aeration condition and an adequate water complementary supply are the preconditions that the function of fertilizer can be fully realized 4 soil water content was correlated with soil ph organic matter content nutrient contents and phosphatase activity significantly soil organic matter content was correlated with soil ph available p and k contents as well as urease and phosphatase activities total n and available k contents were correlated with phosphatase activity and available p content was correlated with sucrase urease and phosphatase activities phosphatase maybe is the most important soil enzyme on adjusting or controlling soil nutrient levels under experimental conditions it can be concluded from the experimental results that groundwater depth and fertilization level affect soil physico chemical properties enzyme activities and winter wheat yield significantly a good soil aeration condition that is related with groundwater depth seems to be the most important environmental factor for normal crop growth under shallow groundwater level an appropriate groundwater level management and fertilizer application rate can improve soil water status enzyme activities and nutrient absorption and utilization by crops and consequently increase wheat yield acknowledgements project was supported by the national department public benefit research foundation no 201203077 
11382,waterlogging adversely affects winter wheat triticum aestivum l growth by deteriorating soil environmental factors the objective of this study is to test the effects of groundwater depth and fertilization level on soil properties enzyme activities and wheat yield experiments were carried out in micro lysimeters at the groundwater depths of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 m under low normal and high fertilization levels in the winter wheat growth season from oct 2015 to may 2016 soil water content ph organic matter content total n available p available k as well as sucrase urease and phosphatase activities were measured in various growth stages of winter wheat and yield component and grain yield were also measured after its harvest results indicated that soil water content and ph decreased with the increased groundwater depth the lower contents of soil organic matter and nutrients appeared when groundwater depth was 0 5 0 6 m sucrase in the heading stage urease in the jointing stage and phosphatase activities increased significantly with the increased groundwater depth grain yield increased with groundwater depth to its maximum or approximate steady value total n and available p contents and urease activity appeared to increase with fertilizer application rate but available k content showed a contrary tendency grain yield increased with fertilizer application rate but the effect of fertilization level on grain yield was lower than that of groundwater depth a significant interaction between groundwater depth and fertilization level on grain yield existed soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with available p content and phosphatase activity was correlated with soil water ph organic matter total n and available k contents it can be concluded that controlling groundwater depth and appropriate fertilizer application level can improve crop growth environment and promote winter wheat growth and its grain yield keywords correlation fertilizer application grain yield groundwater depth soil enzyme 1 introduction central china is a main grain production region and its winter wheat planting area accounts for about 12 of total acreage in china but this region frequently suffers waterlogging disasters because of high intensity rainfall during the wheat growing season and poor drainage conditions ren et al 2016 as a major abiotic stress affecting crop productivity bansal and srivastava 2015 about 10 15 million hectares of the world s wheat growing acreage are affected by waterlogging each year and subsequently results in a 20 50 reduction on winter wheat yields yu and chen 2013 groundwater table as an index to distinguish the oxygenated soil layer and the water saturated aquifer below is important to soil physico chemical properties soil fertility and subsequent crop growth pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 excessive rain under a shallow groundwater table condition results in waterlogging problems and hence aggravates oxygen supply which adversely affects photosynthesis due to low oxygen stress on roots yang et al 2013 bansal and srivastava 2015 najeeb et al 2015 ghobadi et al 2017 enzyme activity and plant growth pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 in addition a shallow groundwater table is more likely to result in secondary soil salinization or sodification if excessive salt exists in the groundwater or soil xu et al 2013 abliz et al 2016 however on the other hand groundwater is an important water source for plant growth and a deep groundwater table is a disadvantage to plant water replenishment from groundwater zimmermann et al 2017 excessively deep groundwater worsens plant growth environment and decreases crop yield as a result of the shortage of water supplies trillo and fernández 2005 and hence increases agricultural production costs scheumann 1997 soil fertility is closely related to groundwater table depth zimmermann et al 2017 groundwater depth affects soil moisture and in turn controls soil aerobic microbe activity and subsequently organic matter mineralization and either high or low soil water content is disadvantageous for soil fertility and crop growth guan 1986 adiku et al 2008 ren et al 2016 as compared to continuous wet soil under a high groundwater level soil drying stimulates n mineralization and reduces its denitrification with both effects leading to an increase of n availability venterink et al 2002 furthermore drying soil also increases k release from the soil venterink et al 2002 as an important index on the health status of soil fertility and soil productivity xiao et al 2016 soil enzymes that are closely related to microbial activity can catalyze some important reactions of soil nutrient cycling and control its cycling rate yang et al 2014 chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 pascazio et al 2018 sucrase hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose to provide energy for the growth of crop roots and microorganisms guan 1986 kang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 urease accelerates the hydrolysis of nitrogen to ammonia and phosphatase improves the rate of dephosphorization where organic phosphorus is decomposed into inorganic phosphorus guan 1986 hu et al 2014 lots of research results indicate that soil sucrase urease and phosphatase activities correlate with total c and n due to higher microbial biomass and greater stabilization nannipieri et al 2012 kang et al 2013 soil enzyme activity is also affected by soil nutrition status as an inhibiting promoting factor or metabolic product soil ph metal or non metallic ions and compounds are common inhibitors for enzyme activity guan 1986 hu et al 2014 sucrase activity would be enhanced with a little sugar in the soil and urease activity is stimulated by amino acid guan 1986 phosphatase activity is inhibited by high p availability olander and vitouser 2000 the mineralization of p in excess of demand would rapidly result in a negative feedback that represses phosphatase production and maintains p level below or near its threshold level for inhibition to occur olander and vitouser 2000 present studies about enzyme activity mainly focus on the relationship among soil physico chemical properties and its response to irrigation measures fertilizer application cultivation methods and edaphic conditions etc kang et al 2009 han et al 2012 wei et al 2012 yang et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 crop growth crop yield and soil nutrient transformation under a shallow groundwater table are mostly affected by hypoxia inhibition and water stress on root growth as well as microbial activity anuradha et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 however the effects of the groundwater table depth on soil physico chemical properties enzyme activity and crop growth have not been widely investigated by adjusting the groundwater table the relations among soil physico chemical properties enzyme activity and crop growth can be best managed and hence alleviate waterlogging hazards on crop growth li et al 2015 si et al 2018 and this is important to improve the crop growth environment and to utilize groundwater more efficiently therefore the objective of this research is to assess the effects of a shallow groundwater table and fertilization levels on soil physico chemical properties soil enzyme activity and winter wheat yield so as to explore the optimal growth environments of winter wheat under a shallow groundwater table 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental treatments the experimental site is located at the experimental station of

radius from oct 2015 to may 2016 the micro lysimeters were evenly filled layer by layer with soil collected from a local farm field at the bulk density of 1 27 g cm 3 the groundwater level in the micro lysimeters was controlled at the constant depths of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 m from the soil surface by water inlet and outlet appratus and excess water was drained out of micro lysimeters automatically fig 1 soil organic matter total n available p and available k contents as well as soil ph soil water ratio of 1 2 5 were measured when the soil was prepared and they were 8 63 g kg 1 1

than 5 0 m experimental arrangement for different treatments was shown in fig 2 winter wheat triticum aestivum l was sowed on 28 oct 2015 at a density of 210 plants m 2 and harvested on 4 may of the following year during the wheat growth period compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o of 14 16 15 and urea were applied at three times before sowing at the seedling stage and then again at the jointing stage and their proportion for the three times was 7 1 2 according to the habits of local farmers n p and k application rates in the whole growth period of winter wheat respectively were 180 65 and 60 kg ha

experimental treatments in the study were replicated three times 2 2 monitoring items and measurement methods daily rainfall and air temperature were obtained from a standard automatic weather station located in the experimental station fig 3 the data of monthly rainfall from 1952 to 2016 obtained from national science technology intertructure of china were used to calculate drought index for

of p 0 05 was used for seperation of the means partial correlation analysis with a two tailed method and multiple linear regression glm repeated measures were applied to analyze the relationship among wheat grain yield with soil physico chemical properties nutrients and enzyme activities and the level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 when using the pearson correlation 3 results 3 1 rainfall year type in the experimental period the rainfall was 388 0 mm in the winter wheat growth period of 2015 2016 which corresponds to the rainfall at 29 2 of multi year average rainfall probability in this region the calculation results showed that the drought index for rainfall was 0 05 and 0 34 respectively in 2016 and during the winter wheat growth period the mean daily air temperature was 12 2 c during the experimental period which was close to the multi year mean temperature 12 4 c of 65 years 1952 2016 therefore the weather condition in the experimental period generally represented a normal rainfall year 3 2 soil water content ph and organic matter content the variation of soil water content with groundwater depth in different winter wheat growth stages was shown in fig 4 for three fertilization levels soil water content generally decreased with the increased groundwater depth in various wheat growth stages due to weakened soil capillary effect and it also decreased significantly with growth time possibly as a result of increasing crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates fig 4 fertilizer application rate did not obviously affect soil water content fig 4 soil ph generally decreased with groundwater depth due to decreased groundwater evaporation and it also decreased with wheat growth time as a result of more rainfall in the late period of winter wheat growth fig 5 soil ph lowered from 7 84 0 20 to 7 63 0 17 when groundwater depth increased from 0 2 to 0 8 m and from 7 83 0 14 to 7 61 0 11 from the wintering stage to the filling stage on average for all three fertilization levels soil ph was obviously affected by fertilization level and the ph decreased with the increase of fertilizer application rate fig 5 the tested soil was generally neutral or weakly alkaline and soil secondary salinization or sodification was not found in this region due to the good quality of the groundwater and frequent rainfall leaching scanlon et al 2010 xu et al 2013 abliz et al 2016 soil organic matter content generally showed a tendency of first decreasing and then increasing with the increased groundwater depth which displayed the lowest level near the groundwater depth of 0 5 0 6 m fig 6 soil organic matter content increased with wheat growth time due to the combined effects of the increasing fine roots and strengthening microbial activity esmaeilzadeh and ahangar 2014 chandra et al 2016 the fertilizer application rate did not show an obvious influence on soil organic matter content average soil organic matter cotent was 9 40 0 73 10 01 0 76 9 79 0 80 and 10 16 0 76 g kg 1 respectively for the wintering jointing heading and filling growth stages of winter wheat under different experimental conditions soil organic matter content is affected by many environmental factors esmaeilzadeh and ahangar 2014 paul 2016 soil air permability soil water status microbe species and its activity intensity etc which are determined by the groundwater table depth under experimental conditions affect organic matter decomposition rate and its formation esmaeilzadeh and ahangar 2014 chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however crop root system growth and incompletely decomposed hairy root removal would result in a great variation on the measured organic matter content hu et al 2013 hobley et al 2015 which may be the reason for the insignificant influence of groundwater depth on soil organic matter content fig 6 3 3 nitrogen phosphorus and potassium contents in soil total n content in soil generally decreased at first and then slightly increased with an increased groundwater depth with the lowest content at the groundwater depth of about 0 6 m data not shown the total n content appeared to show a decreasing tendency with wheat growth time because of more absorption by crops but an increasing tendency with fertilizer application rate the total n content of 1 19 0 09 1 23 0 09 and 1 26 0 10 g kg 1 respectively at low normal and high fertilizer application rates in tested soil was within its normal range of the cultivated farmland soil in this region liu 2011 the variation tendency of available p content in soil with groundwater depth was similar to the soil s total n content fig 7 soil available p content decreased with wheat growth time respectively from the wintering to jointing stages and from the heading to filling stages due to crop absorption and utilization and the higher available p contents in the heading and filling stages than that in the wintering and jointing stages were the result of supplementary fertilizer application after sampling in the jointing stage the available p content in soil in the jointing stage was 13 70 3 83 14 93 3 13 and 17 59 5 12 mg kg 1 respectively at low normal and high fertilizer application rates which was significantly lower than that in the other growth stages under the same fertilizer rate and groundwater depth conditions fig 7 this may indicate the p status in the jointing stage was at a serious deficit for the wheat growth requirement with a normal soil availability p level of 16 25 mg kg 1 zhan et al 2015 the available p content in soil increased with the increased fertilizer application rate fig 7 available k content in soil showed a significant decrease at first and then an increase tendency with the increasing groundwater depth and the lowest available k level also appeared at the groundwater depth of 0 5 0 6 m fig 8 the available k content under a high fertilizer application rate decreased with wheat growth time and it also significantly decreased with the fertilizer application rate fig 8 which possibly means more k is adsorbed and utilized by wheat due to more vigorous growth under a good nutrient status venterink et al 2002 steffens et al 2005 as compared with a balanced status of n p k mineral nutrients available k content is usually higher under an n or p deficiency shang et al 2014 3 4 soil sucrase urease and phosphatase activities the effect of groundwater depth on sucrase activity depended on wheat growth stages fig 9 sucrase activity did not show an obvious variation with groundwater depth in the wintering and jointing stages sucrase activity increased significantly with groundwater depth in the heading stage however it increased initially and then decreased with groundwater depth in the filling stage and its peak value appeared at the groundwater depth of about 0 5 m fig 9 sucrase activity generally decreased with wheat growth time except in the heading stage and the sucrase activity in the heading stage was significantly higher than the other growth stages especially at a deep groundwater table which is related to vigorous growth roots in this growth stage yang et al 2013 chandra et al 2016 liang et al 2018 the sucrase activity was not affected significantly by fertilizer application rate and it was 1 10 0 28 1 17 0 26 and 1 12 0 33 mg glucose g soil 24 h 1 on average over the whole growth period respectively for low normal and high fertilization levels the variation tendency of urease activity with groundwater depth was different in various growth stages of winter wheat fig 10 urease activity increased significantly with groundwater depth in the jointing stage and it did not obviously change with groundwater depth in the other growth stages fig 10 urease activity was higher in the jointing stage but lower in the other growth stages except the wintering stage under a high level of fertilization treatment the reason for higher urease activity in the wintering stage under the high level of fertilization treatment was not clear fig 10 urease activity significantly increased with the increased fertilizer application rate and the average urease activity in the whole wheat growth period under different groundwater depths was 0 13 0 05 0 13 0 04 and 0 16 0 05 mg nh4 n g soil 24 h 1 respectively for low normal and high fertilizer application rates in general phosphatase activity increased significantly with groundwater depth and wheat growth time fig 11 the phosphatase activity level in the wintering growth stage was significantly lower than that in the other growth stages which possibly was related with the more available p in soil in this stage fig 7 olander and vitouser 2000 the phosphatase activity in the jointing heading and filling stages was 2 6 9 5 8 8 11 8 and 6 3 12 9 times higher than that in the wintering stage respectively for low normal and high fertilization levels which is similar to the conclusion of hu et al 2014 that phosphatase activity in the filling stage was at its highest over the whole growth period of wheat soil phosphatase activity was greater in the normal fertilizer application rate than that in the low and high application rates fig 11 with the mean values of 0 80 0 57 1 09 0 62 and 1 02 0 66 mg phenol g soil 24 h 1 respectively for low normal and high fertilizer application rates 3 5 wheat yield and its components crop height the number of spikes per unit area and ear length monotonously increased with groundwater depth significantly table 2 which means that a deep groundwater table is suitable to winter wheat tillering and plant growth however the number of spikelets per spike significantly increased at first and then decreased with groundwater depth and reached a maximum at the groundwater depth of 0 5 0 6 m and the number of infertility spikelets per spike showed a contrary tendency as spikelets per spike did grain number per ear and 1000 grain weight also showed a tendency of firstly increase and then decrease with groundwater depth and the maximum appeared as groundwater depth was 0 5 0 6 m these results indicate that deep groundwater table is not suitable to wheat grain formation possibly due to an insufficient water supply fig 4 and disadvantageous nutrient utilization figs 7 and 8 wheat grain yield significantly increased with groundwater depth as an s type curve relation and the optimal groundwater depth that appeared an approximate steady or maximum yield was about 0 6 m table 2 the optimal groundwater increased with fertilizer application rate because a high fertilization level promotes wheat growth and root system into a deeper soil layer and hence facilitates the absorption and utilization of water from the deep soil table 2 which may indicate an interaction between groundwater depth and fertilization level on wheat yield generally fertilizer application was beneficial to the increase of crop height spike number grain number per ear 1000 grain weight and grain yield and to the decrease of spikelet number per spike and infertility spikelet number per spike table 2 however the effects of fertilizer application rate on them were small and statistically insignificant 4 discussion and analyses the effect of rainfall on wheat growth status was weaken as a result of intense capillary rise under shallow and constant groundwater level in addition the experiment was conducted in a normal rainfall year compared with weather data in 56 years therefore the experiment results represented the winter wheat growth status of a normal rainfall condition in this region 4 1 effects of groundwater depth the anova test results showed that groundwater depth significantly affected soil physico chemical properties soil nutrient contents soil phosphatase activity and wheat grain yield at a p 0 05 probability level table 3 with the increase of groundwater depth soil capillary function is weakened liu et al 2015 najeeb et al 2015 ghobadi et al 2017 and soil water content was decreased fig 4 meanwhile less groundwater is evaporated and subsequently less salt is accumulated on surface soil xu et al 2013 abliz et al 2016 haddadi et al 2016 and hence resulted in a lower soil ph fig 5 both excessive high and too low soil water contents depress soil organic matter decomposition and wheat growth guan 1986 adiku et al 2008 which resulted in soil organic matter content decreasing initially and then increasing with the increased groundwater depth fig 6 soil waterlogging is alleviated and crop growth status is improved following an appropriate increased groundwater depth anuradha et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 and hence crops can grow more vigorously more nutrient ions in the soil are absorbed and utilized by the crops yang et al 2013 which resulted in the decrease of total n available p and available k contents in soil with the increased groundwater depth figs 7 and 8 however an excessive lowering of the groundwater table necessarily increases the difficulty of water absorption from groundwater and decreases water utilization by the crops which adversely affects crop growth and its nutrient absorption from soil trillo and fernández 2005 yang et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2017 and in turn resulted in an increased tendency of soil nutrient contents as the groundwater depth was greater than a critical value figs 7 and 8 soil microorganisms and plant roots are the main sources of soil enzymes yang et al 2014 chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 increased groundwater depth improves the soil s aerobic environment soil microbial biological activity and root cell viability anuradha et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 ren et al 2016 and hence increases hydrolase activities guan 1986 our experimental data confirmed that the soil phosphatase activity generally increased with the lowered groundwater table fig 11 but the effects of the groundwater depth on sucrase and urease activities were not significant table 3 other factors except groundwater depth such as soil temperature substrate concentrations growth stage etc may individually and or interactively affect soil enzyme activities as well guan 1986 kang et al 2009 nannipieri et al 2012 liang et al 2018 the effect of groundwater depth on wheat grain yield mainly is through a tradeoff between the water supply from groundwater and the wheat growth environment liu et al 2015 a shallow groundwater table can supply more water from groundwater to wheat growth but meanwhile it may also deteriorate some soil microorganisms and the wheat growth environment due to poor soil aeration excessive soil water content decreases dry matter accumulation the redistribution of stored photosynthate to the grain and the conversion capacity from carbohydrate to starch in grain jiang et al 2008 ren et al 2016 and hence results in the reduction of 1000 grain weight and grain yield table 2 under a shallow groundwater table ghobadi et al 2017 the response of wheat yield to groundwater depth depends on which of the water deficit level and growth environment is more important for its growth zimmermann et al 2017 a groundwater depth that is as shallow as possible but at the same time can maintain sufficient soil aeration is beneficial to wheat grain formation and its yield zimmermann et al 2017 4 2 effects of fertilizer application rate fertilizer application rate significantly affacted total n and available k contents in soil soil enzyme activities and wheat grain yield at a p 0 05 statistical level table 3 fertilizer application increased available n and p nutrients in soil fig 7 and hence resulted in more vigorous wheat growth and more k absorption and utilization by wheat steffens et al 2005 shang et al 2014 which possibly is the cause on the reduction of available k content in soil when the fertilizer application rate increased fig 8 generally n and p fertilizer application can promote microbial growth and enzyme activities nannipieri et al 2012 kang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 however sucrase and phosphatase activities were slightly higher in the normal fertilization level than that in the other two fertilizer application treatments figs 9 and 11 as suggested by guan 1986 an overdosed urea and phosphate application can inhibit urease phosphatase and other soil enzyme activities nutrient addition into soil acts as a selective pressure on bacterial community han et al 2012 and the increased soil nutrient following fertilizer application produces an increase in enzyme decomposition and hence results in an opposite effect on enzyme activities kang et al 2009 in this study an obvious inhibitory effect of fertilizer application on urease activity didn t occur fig 10 which may be due to the fact that its dosage level under the high fertilizer application rate was not enough to suppress urease activity guan 1986 fertilizer application increases the amount of soil nutrient and hence improves photosynthetic activity and its efficiency promotes aboveground dry mass accumulation and partitioning towards reproductive organs and consequently improves winter wheat yield jiang et al 2008 ierna and mauromicale 2018 however the effect of fertilizer application on wheat grain yield p 0 01 was less than that of groundwater depth p 0 001 under experimental conditions table 3 which indicates that crop growth is largely determined by soil water content yang et al 2013 this possibly is because shallow groundwater depth alters nutrient availability to plants the significant interaction p 0 001 between the groundwater depth and fertilizer application rate on soil available k content and wheat grain yield shown in table 3 confirmed this inference yang et al 2013 4 3 correlation between soil physico chemical properties and enzyme activities soil total n and available k contents were positively correlated with soil water content and soil ph significantly at a p 0 05 probability level table 4 which indicates their availability to wheat were inhibited and more n and k nutrients were left in the soil under a shallow groundwater table soil available p and organic matter contents were negatively correlated with soil water content and ph significantly table 4 near neutral ph values were optimum for the uptake of phosphate and phosphate ions could be fixed by calcium at a high ph barrow 2017 phosphatase activity was negatively correlated significantly with both soil water content and soil ph sucrase activity was negatively correlated only with soil ph and urease activity did not correlate significantly with both soil water content and ph table 4 possibly because soil water content and soil ph have different effects for various kinds of enzymes guan 1986 soil ph is a primary factor for controlling microbial activity and enzyme kinetics kang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 and microbial enzymatic production the ionization induced conformational changes of enzymes and the availability of substrates and enzymatic co factors are closely dependent on soil ph hu et al 2014 due to poor soil aeration and subsequently inhibition of soil microbial and root cell activity palta et al 2010 anuradha et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 si et al 2018 an increasing soil water content decreased phosphatase activity fig 11 and table 4 nevertheless wallenstein et al 2011 thought that the reactions of some soil enzymes to soil moisture were independent from active microbes and the relationship between these enzymes and soil moisture could be insignificant skujins 1976 available p and available k contents as well as urease and phosphatase activities also showed a significant positive correlation to organic matter content in soil table 4 more soil organic matter increases the microorganism population in soil and promotes soil enzyme activity guan 1986 hu et al 2014 meanwhile the improving enzyme activity accelerates organic matter decomposition and hence provides more available nutrition for crops chandra et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 under experimental conditions soil available p content was positively correlated with sucrase activity and was negatively correlated with urease activity significantly however total n and available k did not significantly correlate with them phosphoric and thiophosphoric acids are very effective inhibitors for soil urease and soil available p also could be a factor to inhibit urease activity liao and raines 1985 sucrase activity increases with the enhanced microbial activity following more available p hu et al 2014 vlek et al 1980 thought that active urease activity could hydrolyze more urea and hence resulted in more n loss because of ammonia volatilization but guan 1986 found that sucrase and urease activities were not correlative with n level the discrepancy in the correlation between total n with urease is probably due to concentrations of urea n resulting from different soil water contents vlek et al 1980 sucrase and urease activities involves in mineralization of c n and p but not k kang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 and potassium may not be a factor to stimulate or inhibit these enzyme activities guan 1986 which possibly is the reason that sucrase and urease activities were irrelevant to soil available k content phosphatase was negatively correlated with total n and available k significantly at a p 0 01 probability level total n and available k contents can suppress phosphatase activity due to an imbalance in the proportion of soil nutrients as k p n p and c p guan 1986 phosphatase was also positively correlated with available p content at a p 0 05 probability level due to hydrolysis of organic phosphorus guan 1986 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 pascazio et al 2018 in addition phosphatase activity positively correlating with sucrase activity may be related to accumulation and decomposition of soil orgainc matter hu et al 2014 the relationships among soil enzyme activities and nutrient contents are very complicated wei et al 2012 and their mutual influence mechanisms should be studied further it can be inconcluded from the experimental results that groundwater depth not only determines water accessibility to crop growth but more important it also obviously changes soil environemtal conditions for crop growth that affects nutrient absorption and utilization by crops the most important soil environmental factor that affects soil chemical properity and enzyme activity under shallow groundwater level seems to be soil aeration that is related with groundwater depth zhang et al 2017 the effects of groundwater depth on soil chemical properity enzyme activity and subsequently crop growth are complex and fertilizer application rate may exaggerate this complexity further in the region with shallow groundwater level a good field management is to supply sufficient water supplement and meanwhile a good nutrient availability and utilization condition for crop growth as indicated in table 2 fertilization level did not obviously affected wheat yield under the extreme adverse soil environmetal condition such as at the groundwater depth of 0 2 m a significant effect of fertilization level on crop yield was appeared when groundwater depth became greater but the effect was weakened again following the further increase of groundwater depth therefore a suitable groundwater depth is key for good crop growth and potential maxmium yield 5 conclusions 1 soil water content and soil ph decreased with the increased groundwater depth but soil phosphatase activity increased with it soil organic matter and nutrient contents generally were minimum and wheat grain yield tended to be maximum or approximate steady when groundwater depth was about 0 5 0 6 m which indicated this range of groundwater depth could provide an optimal soil environment for crop growth 2 soil total n available p urease activity and wheat grain yield increased with the increase of fertilizer application rate but soil available k content decreased with it due to more k absorption by crops under higher n and p contents sucrase and phosphatase activities were greater in the normal fertilization level than that in the high fertilization level possibly due to the inhibition role after overdosed urea and phosphate application 3 the effect of fertilization level on wheat yield was significant when groundwater depth was 0 4 0 5 m but it was not obvious when the groundwater depth was smaller or greater than this range value an interaction effect between groundwater depth and fertilizer application rate on wheat grain yield existed and in general the effect of groundwater depth on wheat grain yield was greater than that of fertilizer application rate under experimental conditions therefore a good soil aeration condition and an adequate water complementary supply are the preconditions that the function of fertilizer can be fully realized 4 soil water content was correlated with soil ph organic matter content nutrient contents and phosphatase activity significantly soil organic matter content was correlated with soil ph available p and k contents as well as urease and phosphatase activities total n and available k contents were correlated with phosphatase activity and available p content was correlated with sucrase urease and phosphatase activities phosphatase maybe is the most important soil enzyme on adjusting or controlling soil nutrient levels under experimental conditions it can be concluded from the experimental results that groundwater depth and fertilization level affect soil physico chemical properties enzyme activities and winter wheat yield significantly a good soil aeration condition that is related with groundwater depth seems to be the most important environmental factor for normal crop growth under shallow groundwater level an appropriate groundwater level management and fertilizer application rate can improve soil water status enzyme activities and nutrient absorption and utilization by crops and consequently increase wheat yield acknowledgements project was supported by the national department public benefit research foundation no 201203077 
11383,vegetated buffer strips may reduce nutrient inputs from agricultural land into surface waters their effectiveness at tile drained fields though remains unclear the objective of this study was to quantify nitrate reduction in the groundwater underneath a buffer strip to evaluate the effect of buffer strip width and to assess their impact on nitrate loading in a drainage ditch the study site was a tile drained lowland field on glacial till in north eastern germany the investigated grass buffer strips were 7 3 and 1 m wide water levels and nitrate concentrations in 29 monitoring wells and in the adjacent ditch were measured during three winter half years groundwater nitrate loads were calculated based on a simple darcy approach initial nitrate concentrations in the shallow groundwater entering the buffer strip were up to 98 mg l 1 with median values ranging between 2 and 36 mg l 1 within the buffer strip these concentrations decreased by 56 98 we assume that this reduction was caused by denitrification processes in two study years and dilution after snowmelt in the third year the width of the buffer strip did not have any influence on the nitrate reduction presumably site characteristics and the hydraulic conductivity are of greater importance the groundwater nitrate load was reduced by the buffer strip but the contribution of the groundwater to total ditch nitrate load was minor we conclude that possible positive effects of buffer strips on groundwater quality do not ameliorate surface water quality at tile drained field sites keywords tile drainage groundwater vegetated filter strips riparian zone 1 introduction the eu water framework directive postulates a good status of both surface waters and groundwater until 2015 in north eastern germany in the federal state of mecklenburg western pommerania a main problem in reaching this goal are high nitrate concentrations originating from non point sources more than 75 of the watercourses failed to reach a satisfying nitrate level in 2012 lung 2014 vegetated buffer strips provide a possibility to reduce nutrient and other pollutant inputs into surface waters and thus mitigate water quality located between the arable land and the water body they act upon two input pathways i they reduce surface runoff and associated transport of solutes and particles this most effectively reduces concentrations of substances mainly transported bound to particles such as phosphorus and pesticides patty et al 1997 abu zreig et al 2003 dorioz et al 2006 reichenberger et al 2007 ii the buffer strip enhances the distance between arable land and agrochemicals applied there and the watercourse involving a longer flow distance for the groundwater and thus an enhanced retention time this allows for more degradation of substances dissolved in the groundwater sabater et al 2003 davis et al 2007 the buffering capacity for nitrate is controlled by microbial denitrification and microbial and plant uptake the latter being only a temporary retention process haycock and pinay 1993 bedard haughn et al 2004 a substantial reduction in nitrate concentrations in buffer strips has been reported in many environments hill 1996 borin and bigon 2002 van beek et al 2007 but hickey and doran 2004 pointed out the need of experimental data from buffers in the 1 to 10 m width range typically encountered on farms the effectiveness of buffer strips in terms of nutrient and pollutant retention is mainly influenced by topography vidon and hill 2004 hydrogeology hill 1996 puckett 2004 and buffer strip width mayer et al 2007 king et al 2016 regarding vegetation type meta studies for both europe and the us did not find a difference between herbaceous and forested buffer strips sabater et al 2003 mayer et al 2007 the buffer strip width is the only other factor that can be modified the impact of the buffer strip width has been mainly investigated with respect to sediment retention and nutrient retention in surface runoff and it has been shown that the nutrient retention increases with buffer width lee et al 1999 schmitt et al 1999 abu zreig et al 2003 bedard haughn et al 2004 the widths investigated in these studies ranged between 2 and 16 m a meta analysis by mayer et al 2007 showed that total nitrate removal was more consistent in wide buffers 50 m than in narrower ones 0 25 m while subsurface removal of nitrate was not related to buffer width the buffer strip area bordering the field is most important for sediment and nutrient retention syversen 2002 blanco canqui et al 2004 balestrini et al 2011 the effectiveness of buffer strips in artificially drained landscapes is poorly investigated in north eastern germany more than half of the agricultural area predominantly glacial till is artificially drained mainly by tile drains koch et al 2010 drainage facilities may affect the functioning of buffer strips in two ways fig 1 firstly a large fraction of the water infiltrating on the arable land is directly routed to the receiving ditch via the drainage pipes hirt et al 2011 tiemeyer et al 2008 thus bypassing the buffer strip and its benefits so far bhattarai et al 2009 have shown for surface runoff at a drained site that nitrate and phosphorus concentrations declined through the buffer strip but this reduction did not improve the overall water quality due to high nitrate inputs via tile drainage secondly the hydraulic gradient from the field to the receiving surface water is highly enhanced by the deepened ditch increasing flow velocity of the groundwater and thus decreasing retention time the hydraulic gradient in buffer strips was reported to be negatively related to nitrate reduction in a pan european study sabater et al 2003 the lowered water table in the buffer strip is also unfavourable both for plant uptake and denitrification since the denitrification potential generally increases from the soil surface downwards all of these aspects indicate that buffer strips may not tap their full potential at drained sites in the german water management act wasserhaushaltsgesetz whg the buffer strip is prescribed to be generally at least 5 m wide starting from the slope top for watercourses with a pronounced slope top whg 38 differing regulations however may be issued by the federal states which typically stipulate minimum widths between 5 and 10 m landeswassergesetze in mecklenburg western pommerania the minimum width had been fixed to 7 m but was reduced in 2007 to 3 m in general and to 1 m temporarily under certain preconditions these values provided the basis for the buffer strips investigated in this study the objective of this study was to quantify the benefit of a buffer strip on nitrate loads from a drained lowland field and to estimate the effect of buffer strip width on nitrate reduction in the groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site is located in dummerstorf near the city of rostock mecklenburg western pommerania 54 00 11 n 12 15 07 s the pleistocene lowland landscape is characterized by small elevations 30 50 m a s l and gentle slopes 3 long term mean annual precipitation and temperature are 665 mm and 8 2 c respectively the cropland has a total area 23 ha and is drained by a fan shaped network of plastic tiles for a map of tile drains see tiemeyer et al 2007 the receiving ditch has a catchment of 179 ha which is tile drained to approximately 80 and predominantly used as cropland tiemeyer et al 2006 the drain spacing is 12 14 m at the tile drained field and 8 22 m in the ditch catchment the drainage depth is consistently 1 1 m the ditch is 2 0 2 5 m deep a 15 m wide grass buffer strip had been established along the ditch more than 15 years before onset of this study in 2008 a 100 m wide section of the buffer strip and bordering cropland was selected on grounds of a uniform surface slope this section was subdivided into three parts named transects a b and c where the width of the buffer strip was reduced to 7 3 and 1 m the remaining area of the buffer strip was converted back to cropland fig 2 the cropland was grown with winter wheat ley grass and winter barley in 2008 09 2009 10 and 2010 11 respectively the buffer strip with grass soil cultivation fertilization using mineral fertilizers and digestates of a biogas plant as well as application of pesticides were realized manually at the cropland part of the experimental site at the same dates and with the same rates as on the remaining field the buffer strip was mown in autumn a new tile drain was installed as an outer limit of the experimental site in 12 m distance to the ditch to ensure a similar groundwater table as boundary condition in all three transects fig 2 it was constructed parallel to the ditch at 90 cm depth no tile drains were located underneath the experimental area in december 2008 and january 2009 a total of 29 2 monitoring wells were installed with filtering depths of 1 2 2 3 or 3 4 m below surface wells were arranged in nests i e tubes with different filtering depths were located close to each other 0 5 m to form one measurement point the parent material at the study site is a highly compacted glacial till soil type is a gleyic anthrosol soil texture determined on soil samples taken during installation of the monitoring wells was sandy loam loam and silty clay loam in the top 150 cm and sandy loam down to 400 cm the soil was decalcified to about 150 cm depth in average and the carbonate content in the subsoil amounted to 11 8 15 3 2 2 field measurements and sampling data was collected in three winter half years 1 2009 4 2009 11 2009 4 2010 and 12 2010 4 2011 data gaps occurred during freezing periods when the ditch froze and piezometers not always were accessible the summer half years were not considered since the ditch only carries little water in summer and the contribution to annual nitrate load was expected to be low the depth to the water table and the water level in the ditch at locations p1 and p2 fig 2 were measured weekly a hundred meters downstream of the experimental site ditch water level precipitation and temperature were recorded in 15 min intervals and the flow velocity in the ditch was measured weekly with a flowmeter for subsequent calculation of discharge groundwater samples were taken on a weekly basis with a steel bailer sampler eijkelkamp the shallow well at measuring point 3 transect a however fell often dry and then could not be sampled in 2010 11 only the 1 2 m monitoring wells were sampled in transect a additionally the 2 3 m wells ditch water samples were taken weekly at locations p1 and p2 2010 11 only p2 and 3 7 daily mixed samples per week were taken 100 m downstream at the automatic sampling station the installed collector drain delivered water only sporadically and could be sampled at six dates all water samples were frozen at 20 c until analysis for nitrate and chloride using ion chromatography in 2009 10 dissolved oxygen content and temperature were measured in situ with a multiparameter probe mps5 ott messtechnik the hydraulic conductivity k was determined with a slug test using the hooghoudt and ernst equation twitty and rice 2001 in june 2010 measurements were conducted only in the 2 3 and 3 4 m monitoring wells because the water table was not high enough in the 1 2 m ones 2 3 nitrate reduction groundwater discharge and nitrate loads nitrate reduction in the buffer strip was calculated as the percent difference in the nitrate concentrations between 9 5 and 1 5 m distance to the ditch for each date where data from both paired monitoring wells was available incoming nitrate concentrations of 0 00 mg l 1 were not considered if the concentration in the outflowing water was larger than that in the inflowing water the reduction was set to zero following king et al 2016 as depicted in fig 2 the area between incoming and outgoing measuring points comprises different portions of cropland and buffer strip in transects a and b while only cropland is passed by in transect c i e the groundwater in transect c is sampled before it reaches the narrow buffer strip gradients i were calculated for each transect using the groundwater heights in 0 5 m distance from the ditch the ditch water level interpolated between p1 and p2 and the distance between the monitoring well and the outer position of the ditch water which in turn was calculated based on the ditch water level and the measured topographic ditch profiles the groundwater discharge q in m³ d 1 was then calculated according to darcy s law as q k a i where k in m d 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity a in m² is the cross sectional flow area calculated as the product of the width of the transect 33 m and the water level above the ditch base and i is the gradient between the groundwater level at 1 5 m distance to the ditch and the ditch linearly interpolated between p1 and p2 for k two scenarios were assumed for each transect kmean is the geometric mean of the values measured in 2 3 m depth in 0 5 1 5 and 3 5 m distance to the ditch and kmax is the maximum value measured in up to 3 5 m distance to the ditch in the respective transect the area of the drainage plot contributing to each transect catchment area was estimated to 570 m² the specific groundwater discharge rate q in mm d 1 for each transect was then calculated as q q 1000 570 m² the groundwater nitrate load was obtained by multiplying q with the nitrate concentration in 1 2 m depth in 1 5 m distance from the ditch the ditch nitrate load was calculated using measured discharge and nitrate concentrations and long term water level discharge and discharge nitrate concentration relationships for the dates in between 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater levels the observed groundwater levels showed congruent temporal dynamics at all measuring points fig 3 in the beginning of the winter half year the groundwater started to rise gradually see 2009 2010 in fig 3 it then remained at a constant level with peaks after rainfall and snowmelt events both types of events were observed in the years 2008 09 and 2009 10 while only snowmelt events occurred in 2010 2011 at the end of the winter half year as a result of lower precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration rates the groundwater levels started to decrease slightly this effect was not observed in 2011 when april was unusually wet groundwater levels generally increased with increasing distance from the ditch due to the ditch s drainage effect in addition they increased from transect c to transect a table 1 reflecting a higher ground level elevation in transect a the distance to the groundwater varied between 0 8 and 2 5 m over the study site the higher ground level elevation at transect a also entailed a larger distance to the groundwater about 1 82 m compared to 1 44 m in transect c as a consequence the wells screened at 1 2 m depth fell dry regularly in transect a the differences between years in median groundwater height and distance to groundwater were small although the precipitation sums differed considerably presuming low evapotranspiration rates during the winter half year this observation indicates that a substantial part of the precipitation was routed to the ditch not via the groundwater but via tile drains or surface runoff analogous to the groundwater levels hydraulic gradients close to the ditch decreased from transect a to transect c with median values of 0 11 and 0 05 respectively table 1 variations between years can be attributed to changing ditch water levels which in turn were influenced by plants growing in the ditch and associated maintenance operations kriging of the measured groundwater levels showed that groundwater flow was in general directed nearly perpendicular to the ditch however a higher groundwater table in transect a sometimes caused flow pathways to turn towards transect b which demonstrates a poor drainage effect of the ditch in the glacial till largest gradients occurred after snowmelt with values of up to 0 15 smallest gradients were observed in the beginning of the winter half year they were even negative at single dates when the ditch reacted more quickly to rainfall events than the groundwater resulting in ditch water infiltrating into the bank at transects b and c 3 2 nitrate concentrations nitrate concentrations measured in the groundwater ranged from 0 to 98 mg l 1 fig 4 they were generally below the quality standard for groundwater of 50 mg l 1 nitrate specified in the european union groundwater directive 2006 118 ec the threshold was only exceeded frequently in the shallow groundwater at transect c in the cropland measuring point 12 and at single dates at measuring points 2 4 and 10 in the ditch nitrate concentrations were generally greater than in the groundwater one fourth to ½ of the values measured throughout a winter half year were above 50 mg l 1 and they always exceeded the target threshold of 11 1 mg l 1 specified for surface waters in germany lawa länderarbeitsgemeinschaft wasser 1998 except for two dates in early november 2009 nitrate concentrations in the groundwater showed a distinct decrease with depth fig 4 fig 5 median values in 2 3 and 4 m depth encompassing the entire experimental site were 2 3 0 2 and 0 0 mg l 1 in 2008 09 and 8 6 1 7 and 0 6 mg l 1 in 2009 10 this decline with depth has also been reported for other sites e g king et al 2016 and can be explained with two reasons firstly nitrate reaches the groundwater from the top originating from the biosphere or anthropogenic activities secondly nitrate is often denitrified in deeper groundwater where the oxygen content tends to be lower and anoxic conditions can be found in fact the dissolved oxygen content measured in the monitoring wells decreased with depth median values 7 2 3 8 and 2 9 mg l 1 at 2 3 and 4 m depth corresponding to oxygen saturations of 61 3 32 2 and 26 2 oxic conditions prevailed in all depths though the upper groundwater exhibited distinct temporal dynamics fig 3 peak nitrate concentrations usually occurred after rainfall or snowmelt events a relation with fertilizer application was only found at one occasion dissimilar to the groundwater height nitrate concentrations in the single wells did not behave congruently resulting in a large spatial variability a large temporal and spatial variability of nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of cropland is typical baily et al 2011 bonton et al 2010 on our rather small study site the spatial variability may indicate that heterogeneous soil properties govern nitrate concentrations in the groundwater transport of nitrate to groundwater depends in general strongly on the groundwater recharge rate which in turn is mainly determined by the precipitation excess and soil hydraulic conductivity rozemeijer et al 2009 if the groundwater recharge is high less time is available for nitrate degradation in the vadose zone and the concentrations reaching the groundwater are higher for a glacial till though necpalova et al 2012 have reported that the shallow groundwater chemistry including nitrate concentrations is principally controlled by soil parameters rather than by meteorological ones preferential flow can be a reason for a high variability of water chemistry and may play a role for nitrate transport at the investigated site macropore flow as one type of preferential flow has been demonstrated using dye tracer experiments both on the cropland köhne et al 2011 and on the grass buffer strip data not shown mainly in earthworm burrows köhne et al 2011 observed a drop in saturated hydraulic conductivity at the boundary between topsoil and subsoil at 40 cm depth we conclude that if the topsoil approaches saturation during prolonged periods with rains or snowmelt the threshold matrix potential for macropore flow might be reached and preferential flow is initiated at this boundary upon snowmelt and rainfall events resulting in a fast transport of nitrate from the topsoil to the groundwater highest nitrate concentrations measured in the monitoring wells were usually associated with high groundwater levels and thus running tile drains this coherence implies that whenever nitrate concentrations are high part of the contaminated groundwater is discharged directly to the ditch via the tile drains thus bypassing the buffer strip the higher nitrate concentrations observed in the tile drain compared with the ditch at the study site tiemeyer et al 2008 are the consequence a long term accumulation of nitrogen in the study site s soil which is available for leaching is indicated by the field nitrogen balance tiemeyer et al 2006 contrary to a study in a drained silt loam polder by de vos et al 2000 high groundwater levels did not always entail high nitrate concentrations in our study indicating that nitrate availability in the topsoil is not continuous in the deeper groundwater temporal dynamics of nitrate concentrations were smaller the 3 m wells typically displayed a continuous rise of nitrate concentrations throughout the winter half year if enhanced nitrate concentrations were present this pattern indicates that nitrate accumulated during winter and was reduced during summer in the 4 m wells concentrations were usually constantly very low except for the backmost well in transect a with rather variable and large values and single peaks at the backmost wells in transects b and c 3 3 reduction of nitrate concentrations across the buffer strip in order to evaluate the influence of the buffer strip width a comparison between nitrate concentrations in 9 5 and 1 5 m distance from the ditch is displayed in fig 5 nitrate concentrations diminished across the buffer strip in each transect depth and year most of these differences were significant the upper groundwater s incoming median nitrate concentration ranged between 2 and 36 mg l 1 and was reduced to 0 to 12 mg l 1 the observed nitrate reductions amounted to 58 95 in the uppermost groundwater and to 34 100 underneath table 2 the range of reductions is exactly the same as the one mayer et al 2007 compiled in their meta study for herbaceous buffer strips with subsurface flow 34 100 later studies at 5 8 m wide buffer strips in northern italy showed reductions of 69 100 borin and bogin 2002 balestrini et al 2011 the reduction rates tend to be lower in transect c than in the other two transects but we attribute this finding to the generally lower incoming nitrate concentrations there rather than to the fact that the outgoing groundwater was sampled before it reached the narrow buffer strip a regression between incoming nitrate concentration and nitrate reduction shows that the reduction rate increases with input concentration r 0 50 significant at p 0 05 a relationship that has already been reported from other sites haycock and pinay 1993 sabater et al 2003 the buffer width thus does not have an influence on subsurface nitrate reduction at our glacial till study site this finding confirms mayer s et al 2007 statement that the subsurface removal of nitrate not appeared to be related to buffer strip width more recently king et al 2016 reported higher buffer strip effectiveness of 15 m compared to 8 m wide buffers only down to 2 m depth but not underneath it must be noted however that both hydraulic conductivity and gradients which have been shown to be negatively correlated to nitrate reduction in a meta study sabater et al 2003 differ between transects rendering a comparison difficult tables 1 and 3 the gradients and the hydraulic conductivity decrease from transect a to transect c concurrent with the buffer width the shorter flow distance is thus compensated by a longer residence time due to the lower flow velocity the reduction of nitrate concentrations underneath the buffer strip may basically be caused by two processes microbial denitrification and or dilution with nitrate poor water the dominant process at a site can be assessed by comparing the nitrate chloride ratio of incoming and outgoing groundwater mengis et al 1999 upon high nitrate concentrations the nitrate chloride ratios decreased between 9 5 and 1 5 m distance in 2008 09 and 2009 10 while the chloride concentrations remained similar janssen et al 2013 this indicates that denitrification processes might have taken place although conditions were unfavourable oxygen concentrations only sank below 1 2 mg the limit below which denitrification is assumed to take place in agricultural soils rivett et al 2008 at the end of winter and in the deeper groundwater and temperatures and carbon contents were low however studies have shown that complete denitrification processes may take place even under unfavourable conditions if residence times are sufficiently long groffman et al 1996 trevors 1985 in 2010 11 both nitrate chloride ratios and chloride concentrations decreased a sign that nitrate reduction was due to dilution indeed there was a long lasting snow cover that year with a prolonged period of snowmelt the dilution is confirmed by low nitrate concentrations in the collector drain fig 2 showing that nitrate poor water entered the soil from the surface a correlation between mean nitrate concentrations and k yielded positive relationships in all depths and years correlation coefficients ranged from 0 39 to 0 47 in the upper two depths in 2008 09 and 2009 10 underneath the correlations coefficients of 0 81 and 0 79 were significant at the 0 02 level these findings indicate that low hydraulic conductivities favour low nitrate concentrations at the study site since a longer residence time promotes the denitrification process in 2010 11 the correlation coefficient for the upper groundwater was as low as 0 18 but changed to 0 61 when only dates without snow cover were considered eliminating the dilution effect the heterogeneity of k thus not only affects the buffer strip s capacity to infiltrate surface runoff gatel et al 2016 and flow pathways hénault ethier et al 2017 but also its capacity to ameliorate water quality 3 4 groundwater nitrate loads the calculated groundwater discharge differs between the three transects it was distinctly higher in transect a than in transects b and c due to larger gradients and larger hydraulic conductivities fig 6 top overall the contribution of groundwater to the discharge was only relevant during baseflow conditions but negligible during discharge peaks the same was observed in the other two years differences between both calculation approaches using kmean and kmax were small in transect a but of greater importance in transects b and c it must be noted that k determined with slug tests only characterizes the immediate vicinity of the bore hole however the average groundwater discharge corresponded roughly to ditch discharge during baseflow which is why we assume that the calculated discharge is plausible the groundwater nitrate loads were distinctly reduced by the buffer strip fig 6 bottom average reductions over a winter half year calculated using the nitrate concentrations before and after the buffer strip amounted to 80 87 transect a 81 99 transect b and 66 93 transect c analogous to the groundwater discharge groundwater nitrate load contributed strongly to the ditch load during low flow periods however the major part of the total nitrate load was generated during discharge peaks where groundwater contribution was low not only because of the small groundwater discharge but also because nitrate concentrations were usually lower in the groundwater than in the ditch fig 6 bottom and the tile drain data not shown as a consequence an improvement of nitrate concentrations in the buffer strip did not entail a noticeable reduction in the ditch nitrate load this finding is in accordance with data from a silty clay loam tile drained field where noij et al 2012 did not observe any influence of a 5 m wide buffer strip on nitrate concentrations in the discharging water composed of surface run off drain and groundwater discharge 4 conclusions the effect of buffer strip width on groundwater nitrate concentrations and ditch nitrate loads at a tile drained lowland field site was evaluated buffer strips reduced nitrate concentrations in the groundwater by 60 100 and accordingly nitrate loads discharged by the groundwater the buffer strip width did not influence the nitrate reduction instead we assume that locally variable hydraulic properties were more decisive the reduction of groundwater nitrate loads however has only a minor influence on total nitrate load in the ditch since the contribution of groundwater nitrate load is small compared to that of tile drains we conclude that the width of buffer strips is not relevant for nitrate reduction at tile drained lowland sites and additional measures need to be taken to reduce nitrate loads from tile drains buffer strips do provide multiple benefits though besides nitrate reduction stutter et al 2012 acknowledgements the work was supported by the ministry for agriculture environment and consumer protection mecklenburg western pommerania grant no vi 720 5210 022

11383,vegetated buffer strips may reduce nutrient inputs from agricultural land into surface waters their effectiveness at tile drained fields though remains unclear the objective of this study was to quantify nitrate reduction in the groundwater underneath a buffer strip to evaluate the effect of buffer strip width and to assess their impact on nitrate loading in a drainage ditch the study site was a tile drained lowland field on glacial till in north eastern germany the investigated grass buffer strips were 7 3 and 1 m wide water levels and nitrate concentrations in 29 monitoring wells and in the adjacent ditch were measured during three winter half years groundwater nitrate loads were calculated based on a simple darcy approach initial nitrate concentrations in the shallow groundwater entering the buffer strip were up to 98 mg l 1 with median values ranging between 2 and 36 mg l 1 within the buffer strip these concentrations decreased by 56 98 we assume that this reduction was caused by denitrification processes in two study years and dilution after snowmelt in the third year the width of the buffer strip did not have any influence on the nitrate reduction presumably site characteristics and the hydraulic conductivity are of greater importance the groundwater nitrate load was reduced by the buffer strip but the contribution of the groundwater to total ditch nitrate load was minor we conclude that possible positive effects of buffer strips on groundwater quality do not ameliorate surface water quality at tile drained field sites keywords tile drainage groundwater vegetated filter strips riparian zone 1 introduction the eu water framework directive postulates a good status of both surface waters and groundwater until 2015 in north eastern germany in the federal state of mecklenburg western pommerania a main problem in reaching this goal are high nitrate concentrations originating from non point sources more than 75 of the watercourses failed to reach a satisfying nitrate level in 2012 lung 2014 vegetated buffer strips provide a possibility to reduce nutrient and other pollutant inputs into surface waters and thus mitigate water quality located between the arable land and the water body they act upon two input pathways i they reduce surface runoff and associated transport of solutes and particles this most effectively reduces concentrations of substances mainly transported bound to particles such as phosphorus and pesticides patty et al 1997 abu zreig et al 2003 dorioz et al 2006 reichenberger et al 2007 ii the buffer strip enhances the distance between arable land and agrochemicals applied there and the watercourse involving a longer flow distance for the groundwater and thus an enhanced retention time this allows for more degradation of substances dissolved in the groundwater sabater et al 2003 davis et al 2007 the buffering capacity for nitrate is controlled by microbial denitrification and microbial and plant uptake the latter being only a temporary retention process haycock and pinay 1993 bedard haughn et al 2004 a substantial reduction in nitrate concentrations in buffer strips has been reported in many environments hill 1996 borin and bigon 2002 van beek et al 2007 but hickey and doran 2004 pointed out the need of experimental data from buffers in the 1 to 10 m width range typically encountered on farms the effectiveness of buffer strips in terms of nutrient and pollutant retention is mainly influenced by topography vidon and hill 2004 hydrogeology hill 1996 puckett 2004 and buffer strip width mayer et al 2007 king et al 2016 regarding vegetation type meta studies for both europe and the us did not find a difference between herbaceous and forested buffer strips sabater et al 2003 mayer et al 2007 the buffer strip width is the only other factor that can be modified the impact of the buffer strip width has been mainly investigated with respect to sediment retention and nutrient retention in surface runoff and it has been shown that the nutrient retention increases with buffer width lee et al 1999 schmitt et al 1999 abu zreig et al 2003 bedard haughn et al 2004 the widths investigated in these studies ranged between 2 and 16 m a meta analysis by mayer et al 2007 showed that total nitrate removal was more consistent in wide buffers 50 m than in narrower ones 0 25 m while subsurface removal of nitrate was not related to buffer width the buffer strip area bordering the field is most important for sediment and nutrient retention syversen 2002 blanco canqui et al 2004 balestrini et al 2011 the effectiveness of buffer strips in artificially drained landscapes is poorly investigated in north eastern germany more than half of the agricultural area predominantly glacial till is artificially drained mainly by tile drains koch et al 2010 drainage facilities may affect the functioning of buffer strips in two ways fig 1 firstly a large fraction of the water infiltrating on the arable land is directly routed to the receiving ditch via the drainage pipes hirt et al 2011 tiemeyer et al 2008 thus bypassing the buffer strip and its benefits so far bhattarai et al 2009 have shown for surface runoff at a drained site that nitrate and phosphorus concentrations declined through the buffer strip but this reduction did not improve the overall water quality due to high nitrate inputs via tile drainage secondly the hydraulic gradient from the field to the receiving surface water is highly enhanced by the deepened ditch increasing flow velocity of the groundwater and thus decreasing retention time the hydraulic gradient in buffer strips was reported to be negatively related to nitrate reduction in a pan european study sabater et al 2003 the lowered water table in the buffer strip is also unfavourable both for plant uptake and denitrification since the denitrification potential generally increases from the soil surface downwards all of these aspects indicate that buffer strips may not tap their full potential at drained sites in the german water management act wasserhaushaltsgesetz whg the buffer strip is prescribed to be generally at least 5 m wide starting from the slope top for watercourses with a pronounced slope top whg 38 differing regulations however may be issued by the federal states which typically stipulate minimum widths between 5 and 10 m landeswassergesetze in mecklenburg western pommerania the minimum width had been fixed to 7 m but was reduced in 2007 to 3 m in general and to 1 m temporarily under certain preconditions these values provided the basis for the buffer strips investigated in this study the objective of this study was to quantify the benefit of a buffer strip on nitrate loads from a drained lowland field and to estimate the effect of buffer strip width on nitrate reduction in the groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site is located in dummerstorf near the city of rostock mecklenburg western pommerania 54 00 11 n 12 15 07 s the pleistocene lowland landscape is characterized by small elevations 30 50 m a s l and gentle slopes 3 long term mean annual precipitation and temperature are 665 mm and 8 2 c respectively the cropland has a total area 23 ha and is drained by a fan shaped network of plastic tiles for a map of tile drains see tiemeyer et al 2007 the receiving ditch has a catchment of 179 ha which is tile drained to approximately 80 and predominantly used as cropland tiemeyer et al 2006 the drain spacing is 12 14 m at the tile drained field and 8 22 m in the ditch catchment the drainage depth is consistently 1 1 m the ditch is 2 0 2 5 m deep a 15 m wide grass buffer strip had been established along the ditch more than 15 years before onset of this study in 2008 a 100 m wide section of the buffer strip and bordering cropland was selected on grounds of a uniform surface slope this section was subdivided into three parts named transects a b and c where the width of the buffer strip was reduced to 7 3 and 1 m the remaining area of the buffer strip was converted back to cropland fig 2 the cropland was grown with winter wheat ley grass and winter barley in 2008 09 2009 10 and 2010 11 respectively the buffer strip with grass soil cultivation fertilization using mineral fertilizers and digestates of a biogas plant as well as application of pesticides were realized manually at the cropland part of the experimental site at the same dates and with the same rates as on the remaining field the buffer strip was mown in autumn a new tile drain was installed as an outer limit of the experimental site in 12 m distance to the ditch to ensure a similar groundwater table as boundary condition in all three transects fig 2 it was constructed parallel to the ditch at 90 cm depth no tile drains were located underneath the experimental area in december 2008 and january 2009 a total of 29 2 monitoring wells were installed with filtering depths of 1 2 2 3 or 3 4 m below surface wells were arranged in nests i e tubes with different filtering depths were located close to each other 0 5 m to form one measurement point the parent material at the study site is a highly compacted glacial till soil type is a gleyic anthrosol soil texture determined on soil samples taken during installation of the monitoring wells was sandy loam loam and silty clay loam in the top 150 cm and sandy loam down to 400 cm the soil was decalcified to about 150 cm depth in average and the carbonate content in the subsoil amounted to 11 8 15 3 2 2 field measurements and sampling data was collected in three winter half years 1 2009 4 2009 11 2009 4 2010 and 12 2010 4 2011 data gaps occurred during freezing periods when the ditch froze and piezometers not always were accessible the summer half years were not considered since the ditch only carries little water in summer and the contribution to annual nitrate load was expected to be low the depth to the water table and the water level in the ditch at locations p1 and p2 fig 2 were measured weekly a hundred meters downstream of the experimental site ditch water level precipitation and temperature were recorded in 15 min intervals and the flow velocity in the ditch was measured weekly with a flowmeter for subsequent calculation of discharge groundwater samples were taken on a weekly basis with a steel bailer sampler eijkelkamp the shallow well at measuring point 3 transect a however fell often dry and then could not be sampled in 2010 11 only the 1 2 m monitoring wells were sampled in transect a additionally the 2 3 m wells ditch water samples were taken weekly at locations p1 and p2 2010 11 only p2 and 3 7 daily mixed samples per week were taken 100 m downstream at the automatic sampling station the installed collector drain delivered water only sporadically and could be sampled at six dates all water samples were frozen at 20 c until analysis for nitrate and chloride using ion chromatography in 2009 10 dissolved oxygen content and temperature were measured in situ with a multiparameter probe mps5 ott messtechnik the hydraulic conductivity k was determined with a slug test using the hooghoudt and ernst equation twitty and rice 2001 in june 2010 measurements were conducted only in the 2 3 and 3 4 m monitoring wells because the water table was not high enough in the 1 2 m ones 2 3 nitrate reduction groundwater discharge and nitrate loads nitrate reduction in the buffer strip was calculated as the percent difference in the nitrate concentrations between 9 5 and 1 5 m distance to the ditch for each date where data from both paired monitoring wells was available incoming nitrate concentrations of 0 00 mg l 1 were not considered if the concentration in the outflowing water was larger than that in the inflowing water the reduction was set to zero following king et al 2016 as depicted in fig 2 the area between incoming and outgoing measuring points comprises different portions of cropland and buffer strip in transects a and b while only cropland is passed by in transect c i e the groundwater in transect c is sampled before it reaches the narrow buffer strip gradients i were calculated for each transect using the groundwater heights in 0 5 m distance from the ditch the ditch water level interpolated between p1 and p2 and the distance between the monitoring well and the outer position of the ditch water which in turn was calculated based on the ditch water level and the measured topographic ditch profiles the groundwater discharge q in m³ d 1 was then calculated according to darcy s law as q k a i where k in m d 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity a in m² is the cross sectional flow area calculated as the product of the width of the transect 33 m and the water level above the ditch base and i is the gradient between the groundwater level at 1 5 m distance to the ditch and the ditch linearly interpolated between p1 and p2 for k two scenarios were assumed for each transect kmean is the geometric mean of the values measured in 2 3 m depth in 0 5 1 5 and 3 5 m distance to the ditch and kmax is the maximum value measured in up to 3 5 m distance to the ditch in the respective transect the area of the drainage plot contributing to each transect catchment area was estimated to 570 m² the specific groundwater discharge rate q in mm d 1 for each transect was then calculated as q q 1000 570 m² the groundwater nitrate load was obtained by multiplying q with the nitrate concentration in 1 2 m depth in 1 5 m distance from the ditch the ditch nitrate load was calculated using measured discharge and nitrate concentrations and long term water level discharge and discharge nitrate concentration relationships for the dates in between 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater levels the observed groundwater levels showed congruent temporal dynamics at all measuring points fig 3 in the beginning of the winter half year the groundwater started to rise gradually see 2009 2010 in fig 3 it then remained at a constant level with peaks after rainfall and snowmelt events both types of events were observed in the years 2008 09 and 2009 10 while only snowmelt events occurred in 2010 2011 at the end of the winter half year as a result of lower precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration rates the groundwater levels started to decrease slightly this effect was not observed in 2011 when april was unusually wet groundwater levels generally increased with increasing distance from the ditch due to the ditch s drainage effect in addition they increased from transect c to transect a table 1 reflecting a higher ground level elevation in transect a the distance to the groundwater varied between 0 8 and 2 5 m over the study site the higher ground level elevation at transect a also entailed a larger distance to the groundwater about 1 82 m compared to 1 44 m in transect c as a consequence the wells screened at 1 2 m depth fell dry regularly in transect a the differences between years in median groundwater height and distance to groundwater were small although the precipitation sums differed considerably presuming low evapotranspiration rates during the winter half year this observation indicates that a substantial part of the precipitation was routed to the ditch not via the groundwater but via tile drains or surface runoff analogous to the groundwater levels hydraulic gradients close to the ditch decreased from transect a to transect c with median values of 0 11 and 0 05 respectively table 1 variations between years can be attributed to changing ditch water levels which in turn were influenced by plants growing in the ditch and associated maintenance operations kriging of the measured groundwater levels showed that groundwater flow was in general directed nearly perpendicular to the ditch however a higher groundwater table in transect a sometimes caused flow pathways to turn towards transect b which demonstrates a poor drainage effect of the ditch in the glacial till largest gradients occurred after snowmelt with values of up to 0 15 smallest gradients were observed in the beginning of the winter half year they were even negative at single dates when the ditch reacted more quickly to rainfall events than the groundwater resulting in ditch water infiltrating into the bank at transects b and c 3 2 nitrate concentrations nitrate concentrations measured in the groundwater ranged from 0 to 98 mg l 1 fig 4 they were generally below the quality standard for groundwater of 50 mg l 1 nitrate specified in the european union groundwater directive 2006 118 ec the threshold was only exceeded frequently in the shallow groundwater at transect c in the cropland measuring point 12 and at single dates at measuring points 2 4 and 10 in the ditch nitrate concentrations were generally greater than in the groundwater one fourth to ½ of the values measured throughout a winter half year were above 50 mg l 1 and they always exceeded the target threshold of 11 1 mg l 1 specified for surface waters in germany lawa länderarbeitsgemeinschaft wasser 1998 except for two dates in early november 2009 nitrate concentrations in the groundwater showed a distinct decrease with depth fig 4 fig 5 median values in 2 3 and 4 m depth encompassing the entire experimental site were 2 3 0 2 and 0 0 mg l 1 in 2008 09 and 8 6 1 7 and 0 6 mg l 1 in 2009 10 this decline with depth has also been reported for other sites e g king et al 2016 and can be explained with two reasons firstly nitrate reaches the groundwater from the top originating from the biosphere or anthropogenic activities secondly nitrate is often denitrified in deeper groundwater where the oxygen content tends to be lower and anoxic conditions can be found in fact the dissolved oxygen content measured in the monitoring wells decreased with depth median values 7 2 3 8 and 2 9 mg l 1 at 2 3 and 4 m depth corresponding to oxygen saturations of 61 3 32 2 and 26 2 oxic conditions prevailed in all depths though the upper groundwater exhibited distinct temporal dynamics fig 3 peak nitrate concentrations usually occurred after rainfall or snowmelt events a relation with fertilizer application was only found at one occasion dissimilar to the groundwater height nitrate concentrations in the single wells did not behave congruently resulting in a large spatial variability a large temporal and spatial variability of nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of cropland is typical baily et al 2011 bonton et al 2010 on our rather small study site the spatial variability may indicate that heterogeneous soil properties govern nitrate concentrations in the groundwater transport of

generated during discharge peaks where groundwater contribution was low not only because of the small groundwater discharge but also because nitrate concentrations were usually lower in the groundwater than in the ditch fig 6 bottom and the tile drain data not shown as a consequence an improvement of nitrate concentrations in the buffer strip did not entail a noticeable reduction in the ditch nitrate load this finding is in accordance with data from a silty clay loam tile drained field where noij et al 2012 did not observe any influence of a 5 m wide buffer strip on nitrate concentrations in the discharging water composed of surface run off drain and groundwater discharge 4 conclusions the effect of buffer strip width on groundwater nitrate concentrations and ditch nitrate loads at a tile drained lowland field site was evaluated buffer strips reduced nitrate concentrations in the groundwater by 60 100 and accordingly nitrate loads discharged by the groundwater the buffer strip width did not influence the nitrate reduction instead we assume that locally variable hydraulic properties were more decisive the reduction of groundwater nitrate loads however has only a minor influence on total nitrate load in the ditch since the contribution of groundwater nitrate load is small compared to that of tile drains we conclude that the width of buffer strips is not relevant for nitrate reduction at tile drained lowland sites and additional measures need to be taken to reduce nitrate loads from tile drains buffer strips do provide multiple benefits though besides

data t rh rs and u measurements however all of these input variables may not be available and or not respect appropriate quality requirements for a given location especially in developing countries another serious problem which is often overlooked is the high cost requirement for the installation and maintenance of the full set of weather variables instruments data in automated weather stations valiantzas 2012 exner kittridge and rains 2010 valiantzas 2013d indeed wind data and solar radiation are often lacking or are of low or questionable quality allen 1996 and there is no method to predict wind speed with total confidence temperature data are routinely measured with low cost sensors air temperature can be measured with less error than the other meteorological variables by less

method estimates and the reference values respectively and 3 the traditional coefficient of determination r2 the standard error of the estimate is a measure of the accuracy of predictions the rt is a measure of overall bias error or systematic error the total predictive error of a model see is essentially composed by the error due to spread of data around the perfect line r2 and the error due to bias rt 3 results comparisons of daily data 3 1 test of the calibration of the radiation term monthly data the quality of the calibration of the new radiation term given by eq 4 versus the previous one given by eq 2 is tested using as input the meteorological data from the fao climwat database the statistical results indicated a good agreement between estimations of the calibrated eq 4 and the original values of eq 2 shown in fig 1 with y 0 96x and a coefficient of determination r2 0 985 3 2 comparisons of the new formulas using daily data the various limited data methods for predicting daily et0 were evaluated using daily data extracted from the 32 stations the approximate methods were compared with the reference standardized fao56 pm procedure using as input the full set of data i e t rh rs and u 3 2 1 methods requiring t and or rh data alone the three methods to be evaluated are i the new derived formula requiring temperature and humidity measurements et0new t rh ii the hargreaves samani formula requiring temperature data alone harg t and iii reduced set fao 56 penman monteith method pm t rh requiring temperature and humidity data the statistical results of the comparisons rt r2 and see values are shown in table 2a figs 2 and 3 present the correlation statistics of various methods at two stations selected as a sample hastings semi arid and orlando humid respectively table 2a shows that the new derived formula et0new t rh produced more accurate et0 estimations than the hargreaves samani formula for all the 32 stations the et0new t rh formula produced lower scatter in the regression fit than harg t for all the 32 stations with average for all the stations of r2 0 91 instead of r2 0 83 the et0new t rh produced significantly lower average see than harg t with average for all the stations see 0 65 mm d instead of see 0 95 mm d corresponding to a reduction in see of about 46 for alachua fl ona fl and parlier ca et0new t rh vs harg t produced lower see of approximately 147 140 and 61 respectively furthermore the et0new t rh method produced lower bias rt with average of rt 1 000 instead of rt 1 044 and significantly lower interval of confidence for arid or semi arid locations corresponding to the first 16 stations of table 2a the et0new t rh produced a lower average see by about 37 whereas for humid locations corresponding to the rest 16 stations produced a lower average see by about 51 the results show that the addition of rh measurements to temperature data in eq 7 improves drastically the predictions of et0 this improvement is mainly due to the significant reduction of the scatter in the regression fit when et0new t rh is applied instead of harg t this is more clearly shown from the correlation statistics graphs of the et0new t rh and harg t methods presented in figs 2a 3a and figs 2b 3b respectively the comparison of the two methods requiring both t and rh data i e the new derived formula et0new t rh and pm t rh is shown in table 2a results indicate that et0new t rh produced more accurate et0 estimates than pm t rh for all the 32 stations table 2a shows that the et0new t rh produced a lower scatter in the regression fit than pm t rh for all 32 stations except aguila az with average for all the stations of r2 0 91 instead of r2 0 87 and a significantly lower average see by about 21 for araxos gr ona fl and parlier ca eq 7 produced a lower see by about 67 47 and 39 respectively both methods produced approximately the same bias rt with a lower interval of confidence for the et0new t rh method the et0new t rh produced approximately lower average see value by the same percentage for arid and humid locations the improvement of et0new t rh over pm t rh is mainly due to the significant reduction of the scatter in the regression fit this is more clearly shown from the correlation statistics graphs of the et0new t rh and pm t rh methods presented in figs 2a 3a and figs 2c 3c respectively the pm t rh method including additional rh measurements performed also better than harg t producing a lower average see by about 21 note that et0new t rh produced a lower average of the see by 45 table 2b shows the performance statistics of the two alternatives to et0new t rh formulations i e et0alt rad t rh and et0alt rs t rh comparing the et0new t rh characterized by its simplicity with its alternative et0alt rad t rh based on the old version of erad tables 2a and 2b the et0new t rh performed relatively better for 28 out of the 32 stations producing a lower average see by about 4 the impact of using the new t rh formula for estimating rs eq 6 instead of the hargreaves samani eq 10 on the accuracy of et0 predictions is also investigated tables 2a and 2b present the comparison of et0new t rh with its alternative et0alt rs t rh based on the hargreaves samani formula it is concluded that the et0new t rh performed better than et0alt rs t rh for the majority of the 32 stations 29 out of the 32 stations producing a lower average of see by about 7 3 2 2 accounting for local average wind speed the comparison of the two methods requiring t and rh data as well as the u value i e the new derived formula et0new t rh u and pm t rh u is shown in table 3 the et0new t rh u produced more accurate et0 estimations than the pm t rh u for the majority of the stations 28 out of the 32 stations as can be seen from the table 3 the et0new t rh u produced lower scatter in the regression fit than pm t rh u higher values of r2 for the 32 stations with average of all stations r2 0 91 instead of r2 0 88 and lower average see by about 11 for alachua fl mcarthur ca and davis ca et0new t rh u produced a lower see by about 44 30 and 24 respectively only two stations santa rosa ca and delaveaga ca yielded poorer results with et0new t rh u producing clearly larger see by about 34 and 7 respectively the bias of both methods is significantly reduced compared to their corresponding methods not requiring u values et0new t rh and pm t rh and is essentially limited to 7 the improvement of et0new t rh u over pm t rh u is mainly due to the significant reduction of the scatter in the regression fit this is more clearly shown from the correlation statistics graphs of the et0new t rh u and pm t rh u methods presented in figs 2d 3d and figs 2e 3e respectively comparison of et0new t rh and et0new t rh u in tables 2a and 3 respectively indicates that et0new t rh u is more accurate by about 7 this improvement is essentially due to the reduction of the bias error when u is incorporated in the formula 4 summary and conclusion comparisons indicate the excellent performance of the suggested formula compared to other approximate methods for estimating et0 the method requires additionally to temperature data high quality humidity measurements for all the cases examined the suggested formula performed better than the hargreves samani method requiring temperature data alone producing a significant reduction of standard error of estimate by about 46 the method is suitable for evaluating et0 taking into account that the additional cost of humidity sensors in automated weather stations is significantly lower than the cost of sensors of the other meteorological variables the proposed formula is a better option than the reduced data fao 56 penman monteith procedure requiring relative humidity and temperature data alone the results indicated that the proposed method performed much better for all the locations producing a lower standard error by about 21 finally for places where local average wind speed value can be evaluated the new suggested formula performed better than the corresponding reduced data fao 56 penman monteith both methods accounting for local average wind speed producing lower standard error by about 11 the extended formula accounting for local average wind speed value produces the best results among all approximate methods

quality climatic data records temesgen et al 1999 that essentially cover the typical range of the expected input weather variables were selected valiantzas 2013d the latitude for the selected stations varies from 3 to 51 and the elevation of the selected sites varies from 0 to 3000 m some countries were selected to represent humid and semi humid temperate climates france italy spain and others to represent dry arid and semi arid tropical climates ethiopia sudan egypt and pakistan temesgen et al 1999 from the full data set the total number of monthly estimates no 3588 from 299 stations corresponding to well watered conditions temesgen et al 1999 were retained for calibration purposes mean monthly data from climwat refer to the long term average year for this reason the comparison of the methods was carried out using a set of high quality recorded daily data from real years the data was extracted from 32 weather stations the daily data set was selected from i 21 stations in california from the california irrigation management information system cimis database ii 7 stations in florida from the florida automated weather network fawn database iii 2 stations in arizona from azmet database and vi 2 stations in greece sixteen of these stations are characterized by an arid semiarid climate and the remaining 16 are characterized by a humid climate the selected stations cover a wide range of weather parameters the long term average wind ranged approximately from 1 0 to 4 0 m s table 1 lists the station number station name elevation latitude long term average wind speed

monteith method for estimating et0 from limited data when rs and u data are missing allen et al 1998 proposed the application of the standardized fao 56 penman monteith procedure by replacing u by a single constant value of u 2 m s and rs by the approximate values of rs obtained by the hargreaves and samani 1982 eq 10 this method hereinafter referred to as pm t rh furthermore a reduced set fao 56 penman monteith method accounting for u is also proposed according to this method the fao56 pm is applied similarly as pm t rh except that u is replaced by the single constant value of u u this method hereinafter referred to as pm t rh u 2 4 alternative forms of the new et0 based on t and rh 2 4 1 formula using previous version of erad et0alt rad t rh if instead of the new derived version of erad

fao56 pm complete set of data procedure considered as the reference method was performed using three statistical indexes produced by simple error analysis and linear regression i e y s x where s regression coefficient slope of the linear line y are the reference values of et0 obtained by the fao56 pm method and x are the corresponding estimates of et0 by the approximate method 1 the standard error of the estimate s e e 1 n y i x i 2 n o 1 0 5 where no total number of observations 2 the long term average ratio r t x a v y a v where xav and yav are the long term average values of the tested method estimates and the reference values respectively and 3 the traditional coefficient of determination r2 the standard error of the estimate is a measure of the accuracy of predictions the rt is a measure of overall bias error or systematic error the total predictive error of a model see is essentially composed by the error due to spread of data around the perfect line r2 and the error due to bias rt 3 results comparisons of daily data 3 1 test of the calibration of the radiation term monthly data the quality of the calibration of the new radiation term given by eq 4 versus the previous one given by eq 2 is tested using as input the meteorological data from the fao climwat database the statistical results indicated a good agreement between estimations of the calibrated eq 4 and the original values of eq 2 shown in fig 1 with y 0 96x and a coefficient of determination r2 0 985 3 2 comparisons of the new formulas using daily data the various limited data methods for predicting daily et0 were evaluated using daily data extracted from the 32 stations the approximate methods were compared with the reference standardized fao56 pm procedure using as input the full set of data i e t rh rs and u 3 2 1 methods requiring t and or rh data alone the three methods to be evaluated are i the new derived formula requiring temperature and humidity measurements et0new t rh ii the hargreaves samani formula requiring temperature data alone harg t and iii reduced set fao 56 penman monteith method pm t rh requiring temperature and humidity data the statistical results of the comparisons rt r2 and see values are shown in table 2a figs 2 and 3 present the correlation statistics of various methods at two stations selected as a sample hastings semi arid and orlando humid respectively table 2a shows that the new derived formula et0new t rh produced more accurate et0 estimations than the hargreaves samani formula for all the 32 stations the et0new t rh formula produced lower scatter in the regression fit than harg t for all the 32 stations with average for all the stations of r2 0 91 instead of r2 0 83 the et0new t rh produced significantly lower average see than harg t with average for all the stations see 0 65 mm d instead of see 0 95 mm d corresponding to a reduction in see of about 46 for alachua fl ona fl and parlier ca et0new t rh vs harg t produced lower see of approximately 147 140 and 61 respectively furthermore the et0new t rh method produced lower bias rt with average of rt 1 000 instead of rt 1 044 and significantly lower interval of confidence for arid or semi arid locations corresponding to the first 16 stations of table 2a the et0new t rh produced a lower average see by about 37 whereas for humid locations corresponding to the rest 16 stations produced a lower average see by about 51 the results show that the addition of rh measurements to temperature data in eq 7 improves drastically the predictions of et0 this improvement is mainly due to the significant reduction of the scatter in the regression fit when et0new t rh is applied instead of harg t this is more clearly shown from the correlation statistics graphs of the et0new t rh and harg t methods presented in figs 2a 3a and figs 2b 3b respectively the comparison of the two methods requiring both t and rh data i e the new derived formula et0new t rh and pm t rh is shown in table 2a results indicate that et0new t rh produced more accurate et0 estimates than pm t rh for all the 32 stations table 2a shows that the et0new t rh produced a lower scatter in the regression fit than pm t rh for all 32 stations except aguila az with average for all the stations of r2 0 91 instead of r2 0 87 and a significantly lower average see by about 21 for araxos gr ona fl and parlier ca eq 7 produced a lower see by about 67 47 and 39 respectively both methods produced approximately the same bias rt with a lower interval of confidence for the et0new t rh method the et0new t rh produced approximately lower average see value by the same percentage for arid and humid locations the improvement of et0new t rh over pm t rh is mainly due to the significant reduction of the scatter in the regression fit this is more clearly shown from the correlation statistics graphs of the et0new t rh and pm t rh methods presented in figs 2a 3a and figs 2c 3c respectively the pm t rh method including additional rh measurements performed also better than harg t producing a lower average see by about 21 note that et0new t rh produced a lower average of the see by 45 table 2b shows the performance statistics of the two alternatives to et0new t rh formulations i e et0alt rad t rh and et0alt rs t rh comparing the et0new t rh characterized by its simplicity with its alternative et0alt rad t rh based on the old version of erad tables 2a and 2b the et0new t rh performed relatively better for 28 out of the 32 stations producing a lower average see by about 4 the impact of using the new t rh formula for estimating rs eq 6 instead of the hargreaves samani eq 10 on the accuracy of et0 predictions is also investigated tables 2a and 2b present the comparison of et0new t rh with its alternative et0alt rs t rh based on the hargreaves samani formula it is concluded that the et0new t rh performed better than et0alt rs t rh for the majority of the 32 stations 29 out of the 32 stations producing a lower average of see by about 7 3 2 2 accounting for local average wind speed the comparison of the two methods requiring t and rh data as well as the u value i e the new derived formula et0new t rh u and pm t rh u is shown in table 3 the et0new t rh u produced more accurate et0 estimations than the pm t rh u for the majority of the stations 28 out of the 32 stations as can be seen from the table 3 the et0new t rh u produced lower scatter in the regression fit than pm t rh u higher values of r2 for the 32 stations with average of all stations r2 0 91 instead of r2 0 88 and lower average see by about 11 for alachua fl mcarthur ca and davis ca et0new t rh u produced a lower see by about 44 30 and 24 respectively only two stations santa rosa ca and delaveaga ca yielded poorer results with et0new t rh u producing clearly larger see by about 34 and 7 respectively the bias of both methods is significantly reduced compared to their corresponding methods not requiring u values et0new t rh and pm t rh and is essentially limited to 7 the improvement of et0new t rh u over pm t rh u is mainly due to the significant reduction of the scatter in the regression fit this is more clearly shown from the correlation statistics graphs of the et0new t rh u and pm t rh u methods presented in figs 2d 3d and figs 2e 3e respectively comparison of et0new t rh and et0new t rh u in tables 2a and 3 respectively indicates that et0new t rh u is more accurate by about 7 this improvement is essentially due to the reduction of the bias error when u is incorporated in the formula 4 summary and conclusion comparisons indicate the excellent performance of the suggested formula compared to other approximate methods for estimating et0 the method requires additionally to temperature data high quality humidity measurements for all the cases examined the suggested formula performed better than the hargreves samani method requiring temperature data alone producing a significant reduction of standard error of estimate by about 46 the method is suitable for evaluating et0 taking into account that the additional cost of humidity sensors in automated weather stations is significantly lower than the cost of sensors of the other meteorological variables the proposed formula is a better option than the reduced data fao 56 penman monteith procedure requiring relative humidity and temperature data alone the results indicated that the proposed method performed much better for all the locations producing a lower standard error by about 21 finally for places where local average wind speed value can be evaluated the new suggested formula performed better than the corresponding reduced data fao 56 penman monteith both methods accounting for local average wind speed producing lower standard error by about 11 the extended formula accounting for local average wind speed value produces the best results among all approximate methods
