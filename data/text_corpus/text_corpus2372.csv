11860,in many developing countries cities are faced with rising water demand due to rapidly increasing population inadequate municipal water supply and growing sanitation pressure consequently groundwater resources are being heavily relied on to meet the demand however the long term supply and quality of groundwater are threatened by multiple anthropogenic pressures this study assessed the quality and suitability of groundwater available to more than 600 000 inhabitants in several peri urban communities in accra the capital city of ghana thirty six 36 borehole samples were analysed for their suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes based on relevant physicochemical parameters in addition water quality index wqi sodium absorption ratio and relevant statistical plots were employed to assess the groundwater s quality and suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes the results indicate that almost all parameters measured were within the who recommended limits for drinking water for most samples this is reflected in the classification of 92 of water samples as good or excellent quality for domestic purposes using wqi the abundance of ions in groundwater followed the trend na ca2 mg2 k for cations and cl so4 2 hco3 f no3 for anions by using principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses the study identified mineral dissolution and anthropogenic activities as the main factors influencing groundwater chemistry in the study area these factors resulted in mixed water types viz na ca mg cl and na ca mg so4 and na cl as the dominant water type classifications based on the wilcox and ussl diagrams suggest that groundwater in the study area is generally suitable for irrigation given that these boreholes are new the results from this study represent background levels and have important implications for groundwater development and management in the rapidly developing capital of ghana graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water quality index accra ghana irrigation water quality groundwater pollution 1 introduction globally urbanisation is on the increase the rate of increase is substantial in many sub saharan african countries and mostly outstrips the supply of resources including pipe borne water in ghana an estimated 57 of the population live in urban areas with an annual urban growth rate of about 3 34 compared to a rural growth rate of 0 69 undesa 2018 additionally the urban population of approximately 18 million is expected to more than double by 2050 placing tremendous pressure on urban resources in accra the capital city of ghana access to potable water is under massive pressure from rapid urbanisation based on provisional results of ghana s most recent population and housing census 2021 the greater accra region which is the location of accra is currently the most populous in the country gss 2021 many of the new inhabitants of accra are based in peri urban settlements where municipal water supply is lacking as a result groundwater resources are becoming the primary source of water for many urban peri urban communities in the country through the sinking of boreholes for domestic industrial and irrigation purposes yidana et al 2011 however the interplay of a rapidly growing urban population increasing exploitation of water resources and escalating pollution from anthropogenic activities have combined to exacerbate the vulnerability and potential contamination of aquifers burri et al 2019 jia et al 2020 rezaei et al 2020 saka et al 2013 anthropogenic activities such as physical changes to landscapes application of synthetic chemicals and massive exploitation of underground water resources threaten the sustainability of future water supply in urban areas and amplify the risks of water scarcity particularly among poor urban dwellers this situation is projected to worsen under climate change scenarios ahmad and al ghouti 2020 bodrud doza et al 2020 saka et al 2013 these developments have occasioned the need to investigate the state and fate of groundwater resources in many cities in the african sub region cobbing and hiller 2019 groundwater quality and development has been highly researched in ghana for decades and has played a pivotal role in the livelihoods of people in hundreds of communities anornu et al 2017 sunkari et al 2020 yidana et al 2008 2012 nonetheless groundwater development and use mainly through the sinking of boreholes have been primarily restricted to rural areas and the semi arid northern regions of the country akurugu et al 2020 chegbeleh et al 2020 loh et al 2020 lutz et al 2007 nsiah et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 yidana et al 2008 zango et al 2019 until recent years groundwater developments in southern ghana and urban areas of the country have been low and restricted mainly to private boreholes kortatsi 2006 kortatsi and jorgensen 2001 saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 2020 however given the growing population burden which is not matched by development in surface water infrastructure groundwater resources present a more affordable means of water access and are rapidly becoming an essential proportion of urban water supply saka et al 2013 this has led to increasing research into groundwater resources in ghana s urban areas including accra foppen et al 2020 hagan and darko 2020 kortatsi 2006 saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 as is occurring in other parts of the world peri urban accra is faced with an increasing urban sprawl characterised by unplanned settlements and land use change promoting unsustainable developments and associated environmental concerns in the city yiran et al 2020 studies show that the study area which includes ga west ga east la nkwantanang madina and adentan municipalities of accra is faced with significant changes in land use increasing commercial activities massive generation of waste and improper waste management systems sunkari et al 2019 tibu et al 2019 moreover evidence suggests that the rate of environmental degradation and pollution in ghana s capital city is mirrored by the population growth rate owusu 2002 these challenges have been associated with adverse health consequences including one of the highest prevalence of buruli ulcer cases in the country within some of the peri urban communities under study kofie et al 2008 owusu and adamba 2012 in addition rapid population growth unplanned developments and other anthropogenic activities act as significant contributors to groundwater quality degradation antony et al 2020 previous studies by sunkari et al 2019 and saka et al 2013 have shown that groundwater chemistry in the ga west municipality of accra is primarily controlled by seawater intrusion leaching of chemicals from pit latrines and refuse dumps interaction with minerals and agrochemicals while studies on groundwater quality in some of the municipalities in the study area exist they have been restricted to fewer boreholes in few locations often for private use given the rising concern for water quality and scarcity in peri urban accra the government of ghana through the community water and sanitation agency cwsa has prioritised the sinking of boreholes in several communities to address potable water needs of thousands of its residents this study provides the most comprehensive groundwater quality assessment of carefully planned and engineered boreholes located in the ga west ga east la nkwantanang madina and adentan municipalities by employing a combination of multivariate statistical methods and conventional hydrochemical techniques the study examined the main factors controlling the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study areas the findings provide valuable information on the quality of groundwater resources within a large portion of peri urban accra that will help inform policy on the development management and sustainable use of groundwater resources within the greater accra region of ghana 2 study area 2 1 location and climate this study was carried out in four of the fastest growing municipalities in accra ga west ga east la nkwantanang madina and adentan fig 1 the study area lies within longitudes 5 35 0 n and 5 50 0 n and latitudes 0 30 0 w and 0 50 0 w the area shares boundaries to the north with upper west akim nsawam adoagyiri and akwapim south districts ga south municipal to the west kpone katamanso to the east and ga central okaikwai north ayawaso west ledzokuku krowor and tema west municipalities to the south these municipalities were chosen because of a combination of factors some of which are discussed herein that affect the demand and supply availability of groundwater until recent years these municipalities were considered rural but are now urban areas due to the rapid urbanisation of accra yiran et al 2020 studies have attributed the settlement or relocation of people to peri urban areas such as the study areas to several factors related to cost and affordability including lower rent preferences changing lifestyle and lower land prices baye et al 2020 oppong and yeboah 2013 as more and more people move into these peri urban areas they begin to densify and the demand for services including water for domestic and other purposes increases however the provision of potable water in these peri urban areas remains a major challenge due to cost given that many of the communities in these municipalities are not connected to municipal water supply there is a growing dependence on groundwater supply as a source of potable water for domestic use in this regard several boreholes have been drilled in these communities by the community water and sanitation agency cwsa of ghana for water supply purposes the purpose is not only to meet the growing domestic water needs but also the associated increases in industrial and agricultural water demand in the communities at the same time the rapid urbanisation and developments in the areas under study have been associated with poor planning and are largely characterised by the gross absence of appropriate sanitary facilities according to the ghana statistical service nearly one quarter of households in the study area are without conventional toilet facilities gss 2012 posing considerable risks to the environment in addition groundwater availability may be impacted by climate change and climate variability the area is characterised by high temperatures ranging between 25 1 c and 32 1 c and low rainfall between 79 cm yr 1 to 127 cm yr 1 gss 2012 the rainfall availability is projected to further decrease due to climate change ipcc 2014 with negative implications for groundwater recharge the effect of low rainfall on groundwater recharge may be exacerbated by the continuous increase in human settlement and other activities which make the land surface impervious resulting in more runoff and less infiltration hagan et al 2018 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of the study area is predominantly dahomeyan and togo structural rocks intruded by undifferentiated granitoid the dahomeyan comprises acidic ortho and para gneisses schist and migmatite many of which are rich in garnet hornblende and biotite fig 2 a the dahomeyan structural unit in ghana generally consists of felsic and mafic gneisses that alternate grant 1967 the main litho tectonic units of the dahomeyan are i quartzo feldspathic and augen gneisses locally referred to as ho gneisses ii a suture zone of distinct mafic and ultramafic rocks and iii a granitoid gneiss migmatite assemblages the dahomeyan is distinct from other rocks in the country because of its composition of high grade metamorphic rocks holm 1973 the togo structural unit within the study area comprises schist quartzite and phyllite with rare occurrences of sandstone shale and silicified limestone fig 2a the main lithologies of the togo unit are schists quartzites phyllites and phyllonites the phyllites and phyllonites are intensely deformed and usually occur along with thrust contact between togo and dahomeyan rocks or as thin intercalations with quartzite anani et al 2019 darko et al 2019 nude et al 2015 have reclassified shale sandstone and silicified limestone to belong to the buem structural unit structurally regional lineament within the study area indicates two main orientations of ne sw and nw sw trends these fractures tend to control the borehole yields within the study area in ghana the hydrogeological terranes follow the geological terranes to a large extent dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 banoeng yakubo et al 2010 have identified five hydrogeological provinces following the work of gyau boakye and tumbulto 2000 these delineations are based on the knowledge and understanding of the rock types on current knowledge of the rock types well depths well yields groundwater quality among others the hydrogeology of the study area falls under the basement complex province aquifers of all granitoids and the pan african province aquifers of the buem and togo structural units fig 2b the dahomeyan system is characterised by low yields of groundwater from hand dug wells and boreholes dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 the low yield is due to the rock types gneisses made of colossal crystalline structure and the impervious nature of their weathered material clay the togo structural unit which is highly fractured and jointed with folded layers of rocks build a fracture flow aquifer system recharge to groundwater within this basement complex type is high with highly variable depth to groundwater table yidana et al 2014 thus within the togo structural unit the degree and extent of fracturing control borehole yields the geological formations characterising the study area therefore suggest that the hydrogeological conditions would be controlled by secondary permeabilities arising from structures fractures and joint systems due to deformation locally a single aquifer unit within the weathered zone made up of quartzite schist formations has been identified for the ga east and adentan municipalities based on available data and current understanding of the hydrogeology the aquifer thickness ranges from 6 5 m to 31 5 m and the borehole depths range from 50 m to 90 m hagan and darko 2020 preliminary studies into the aquifer system within the ga west municipality similarly reveals a single aquifer unit within the weathered zone granite formation with aquifer thickness ranging from 10 m to 36 m and borehole depths of 32 m 78 m 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and hydrochemical analysis groundwater samples from thirty six 36 newly constructed boreholes within the study area were used in this study fig 3 water samples were collected into pre washed high density polyethene bottles of 500 ml capacity all samples were stored at 4 c using ice in an ice chest prior to laboratory analysis to assess the water quality samples were analysed for the following physicochemical parameters hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th and the ions chloride cl fluoride f sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 bicarbonate hco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k the analysis of samples was conducted at the water research laboratory of the centre for scientific and industrial research csir in accra and the water quality laboratory of the ghana water company limited in ho ghana samples were analysed based on standard procedures for water analysis as outlined by the american public health association apha the ph was measured at room temperature using a ph meter suntex model no sp 2100 electrical conductivity and tds were measured using a lovibond consodirect con 200 instruments total hardness hd calcium and magnesium were measured using the edta titrimetric method potassium and sodium were determined using a digital flame photometer gallenkamp fga 350 1 the analysis of nitrates and sulphates were performed by employing an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer using the hydrazine reduction and barium chloride reduction respectively chloride was estimated by the argentometric titration method while fluoride was determined using an ion selective electrode method orion thermo scientific 3 2 data processing multivariate statistical analysis and water quality assessment the results obtained from the physicochemical analysis was used to characterise the quality of groundwater first by comparing values of the physicochemical parameters with their respective who standards in addition other methods for quality assessment of groundwater including the water quality index were employed the water quality index wqi method was used to evaluate the suitability of water for drinking domestic purposes the computation of the wqi is a four step approach the first step involves assigning weight w i to each of the twelve parameter considered ph th tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f for the computation of wqi based on their relative importance to the overall quality of groundwater parameters such as ph no3 and f were assigned a maximum weight of 5 due to their significant role in the water quality assessment while weights ranging from 2 to 4 were assigned to the remaining parameters based on their relative roles in the water quality assessment the second step involves the computation of relative weight of each parameter w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the relative weight w i is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters the third step is based on a computation of the quality rating scale q i for each parameter q i c i s i 100 where q i is the quality rating c i is the concentration of each parameter in mg l 1 and s i is the who standard for each parameter in mg l 1 the fourth step is the determination of the sub index si for each parameter this is then used to calculate the wqi si w i q i the overall wqi was then computed by summing all the sub index values for each sample wqi i 1 n si the computed wqis were then classified using the classification model proposed by sahu and sikdar table 1 3 3 irrigation water quality assessment the quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes was determined using several indices including the united states salinity laboratory ussl diagram the wilcox diagram and values of ec th ki mh pi sar and na these indices are considered effective approaches to assessing the suitability of water for irrigation purposes and are described below 3 3 1 kelly s index ki kelly s index ki expresses the ratio between sodium ions versus calcium and magnesium ions present in groundwater as follows ki na ca 2 mg 2 ki thus indicates the amount of sodium in water compared to calcium and magnesium 3 3 2 magnesium hazard mh the magnesium hazard mh index helps to measure the relative amount of magnesium in water and hence its possible impact on soil and crops when used for irrigation mh is computed as follows mh mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 100 3 3 3 permeability index pi the permeability index pi measures the relative concentrations of hco3 and na to those of sodium magnesium and calcium based on the equation below doneen 1964 pi na hco 3 na ca 2 mg 2 100 3 3 4 sodium absorption ratio sar the sodium absorption ratio sar indicates the degree to which other cations may be replaced by sodium the value of sar is calculated based on the formula proposed by richards 1954 sar na 1 2 ca 2 mg 2 3 3 5 percentage sodium na the percentage sodium na is another vital factor in characterising the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes the na content is expressed as a soluble sodium percentage and is computed as follows na na k na k ca 2 mg 2 100 3 4 quality assurance several quality assurance measures were undertaken from sampling and sample pretreatment to analysis and data treatment aimed at ensuring the quality of the data produced these include the use of analytical grade reagents and chemicals as well as sample and reagent blanks all samples were analysed in duplicates and where necessary in triplicates the assurance of the quality and validity of data obtained in work was measured by calculating the charge balance error cbe for each sample a cbe of 5 was obtained in almost all samples suggesting a perfect quality of analysis a few samples showed a cbe of 10 which was assumed to be of good quality apha 2012 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrochemistry the descriptive statistics of the results obtained from the chemical analysis of all parameters studied are presented in table 2 together with their applicable who guideline values for drinking water the ph of samples showed little variability with few outliers the values ranged from 5 90 to 9 90 with a mean value of 7 27 0 14 suggesting the groundwater understudy may be considered largely neutral to slightly basic however approximately 17 of the water samples fell outside of the who recommended standard of 6 50 8 50 for drinking water nonetheless the ph value of water in itself is not known to have a significant effect on human consumption rather the ph effect is largely based on its source and influence on the dissolution of other elements some of which may be harmful in this study the ph values reported are generally within optimal levels and do not favour the excessive dissolution of ions and heavy metals however a low ph of 5 90 was obtained from a borehole at new nmai djor nnd raising concern for the dissolution of heavy metals some of which may be toxic upon consumption yidana 2010 the low ph may be due to the dissolution of granites phyllites and schist in the togo formation ganyaglo et al 2019 saka et al 2013 the ec of groundwater samples ranged from 260 0 to 6628 0 μs cm 1 with a mean value of 1389 5 219 3 μs cm 1 the large standard deviation in the mean value reflects the wide variation in the measured values from the various wells approximately 19 of ec values were above the recommended standard of 2000 0 μs cm 1 similar to the ec data the values of tds showed a wide variability ranging from 130 0 mg l 1 to 3314 0 mg l 1 with a mean value of 727 7 113 36 mg l 1 given the who guideline of 1000 0 mg l 1 22 of the samples analysed reported values higher than the recommended limit the values of total hardness th also displayed a high variation with a minimum of 30 0 mg l 1 and a maximum of 1067 0 mg l 1 and a mean of 247 70 40 70 mg l 1 approximately 36 of the samples were above the who limit of 200 0 mg l 1 based on the mean values of parameters the abundance of ions analysed in this study increased as follows k mg2 ca2 na for cations and no3 f hco3 so4 2 cl for anions the levels of k and mg2 for all 36 sampled boreholes were within their respective who acceptable limits for drinking water however approximately 6 and 11 of water samples showed levels of ca2 and na respectively above the who recommended limits for anions all 36 sampled boreholes had levels of no3 and f well within their respective who recommended limits for drinking water however approximately 6 of boreholes had so4 2 concentrations above the who recommended limit for drinking water whiles 3 of samples showed concentrations of hco3 exceeding the who acceptable limit the concentration of cl was highest among all ions considered with levels exceeding the recommended maximum concentration in more than 22 of samples studied 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis a visual assessment of the distribution of data was performed using boxplots and are shown in fig 4 the boxplots show two or more large values that are distinct from the bulk of the data for mg2 ca2 and na these observations can be considered as outliers the distribution of all the cations is skewed to the right these observations are similar to the boxplots for ec tds and th the borehole with a ph value of 9 90 is quite distinct from the other wells and thus can be considered an outlier this renders the distribution right skewed the anions cl hco3 and so4 2 show one or more outliers the boxplot for each of these anions indicates right skewness however no3 is slightly positively skewed while f is approximately symmetric most parameters including na k cl so4 2 ph ec and tds showed the presence of at least one outlier contributing to the skewness of the distributions pearson s correlation was computed to identify trends and correlation between the water quality parameters analysed table 3 in this regard parameters that have a correlation coefficient r of at least 0 5 are considered to be significantly correlated the correlation matrix revealed significant correlations between several parameters most of which are strong and positive for instance very strong positive correlations 0 89 were recorded between ec and the following parameters tds th ca2 mg2 and cl due to the interdependence of ec on these parameters this assertion is evident in the significant loadings of ca2 mg2 na so4 2 and cl with tds and ec also reported in other similar studies in the study area saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 on the other hand ph showed a weak positive correlation with most parameters based on these relationships a mixed water type system comprising na ca mg cl and na ca mg so4 dominate the groundwater system in the area these correlations were further visualised using scatter plot matrices fig 5 the strong correlation between any two parameters is depicted by the linearity of the plot generated as observed for parameters such as ec and tds row 3 column 2 and tds and ca2 row 5 column 3 similarly column 1 depicts a weak correlation that exists between ph and the other parameters in addition principal component analysis pca was performed using the r statistical package to illustrate relationships between the physicochemical parameters badeenezhad et al 2020 khawla and mohamed 2020 the pca of the 12 physicochemical parameters showed that over 80 of the total variation in the groundwater system in the study area is explained by the first two components table 4 a component 1 pca 1 showed significant positive loadings with tds cl th mg2 na and so4 2 table 4 b which may be attributable to mineral dissolution as a result of rock water interaction loh et al 2020 saka et al 2013 yidana 2010 component 2 pca 2 on the other hand showed significant positive loadings with f and no3 and significant negative loadings with hco3 and ph the significant positive loadings of no3 and f with pca 2 suggest the influence of anthropogenic activities in the area yidana 2010 yidana et al 2010 no3 and f in groundwater could result from phosphate fertilisers from agricultural farms or the burning of coal or disposal of fly ash on the land surface these are common activities that characterise the study area and therefore could contribute to significant amounts of these ions in groundwater in the study area furthermore using the hclust function in the statistical package r a hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed for the parameters based on a hierarchical tree dendrogram using ward s method to project the similarities correlations amongst them fig 6 ibe et al 2020 loh et al 2020 results from hca suggest two distinct clusters with a phenon line drawn at a linkage distance of 22 fig 6 cluster 1 comprises th ca2 mg2 tds cl na so4 2 ph and hco3 whereas cluster 2 consists of no3 f and k cluster 1 suggests the influence of ion dissolution as a result of rock water interactions and is in agreement with results from pca 1 table 4b the sub clustering of ca2 mg2 and th is clearly seen in the hca which corroborates the contribution of carbonate hardness similarly the relation between na and cl as well as their contribution to tds tables 3 and 4b is clearly evident in the hca where they are linked at the closest linkage distance this shows their close relation suggesting na cl as the dominant water type lastly similar to the pca 2 cluster 2 represents the influence of anthropogenic activities as evident by the clustering of k f and no3 which are constituents of agrochemicals that may be runoff from farmlands 4 3 groundwater quality and suitability for domestic drinking purposes the predominant use of borehole water in the study locations is for domestic purposes including cooking drinking and washing given the use and heavy reliance on this source of water the quality of borehole water is critical due to its possible health implications of the parameters measured ec and tds had about 19 and 22 and of samples reporting values outside of the who recommended limits respectively the value of ec is primarily an indication of the total dissolved ions present in water which is expressed as tds tds is an essential parameter in water quality and represents the variety of solids dissolved in a solution including chlorides carbonates bicarbonates sulphates calcium magnesium sodium and potassium adimalla and taloor 2020 the measured tds values in this study are low compared to a similar study in the accra plains where about 75 of the borehole samples showed tds ranging from 1000 to 10 000 with na and cl as the dominant ions kortatsi 2006 however similar results 148 1 4020 0 have been reported for tds in groundwater samples from ga west municipality saka et al 2013 in this study tds ranged from 130 0 to 3314 0 mg l 1 the values of th were generally high with about 36 of samples having values above 200 mg l 1 the recommended limit set by the who the high levels of th is a reflection of the generally high values of ca2 ions th represents the total concentration of dissolved ca2 and mg2 ion concentrations in groundwater and may influence the taste of drinking water and reduce the effectiveness of detergents although there is a low association with health water with th values above 200 mg l 1 has a high probability of causing scales deposition in pipes water systems and excessive use of soap and formation of scum who 2017 in about 11 of boreholes ph values were lower than 6 5 the lower limit recommended by the who low ph values have no direct health effects nonetheless the cause of the low ph and the increased dissolution of ions may introduce adverse health impacts for groundwater who 2017 generally acidity in groundwater is associated with granite based minerals in the current study only about 6 of the groundwater samples reported a ph above 8 5 with nearly 97 of the boreholes occurring in the dahomeyan and granitoid the observed ph levels may be attributable to the quartzo feldspathic acidic and the mafic basic compositions of the gneiss in the dahomeyan and the granites overall the concentration of ions in the groundwater samples were low and within acceptable limits however cl and na concentrations were above the recommended limits in 22 and 11 of borehole samples studied respectively the ions with concentrations above their respective who guideline values have been shown in fig 8 chloride was the most abundant anion present in the samples studied this could be linked to the metamorphic nature of the terrain the gneissic rocks of the dahomeyan comprise minerals of quartz feldspars and variable proportions of micas chlorite muscovite and biotite and their alteration releases cl mg fe etc in solution the findings from this study show that about 22 of samples had high chloride concentrations above a recommended value of 250 0 mg l 1 with values ranging from 18 00 mg l 1 to 1099 0 mg l 1 while the level of chloride is generally low the concentration of chloride in groundwater samples from sk5 and sas were considerably high with values of 1099 0 mg l 1 and 993 0 mg l 1 respectively the excessive chloride content in groundwater particularly near coastal areas is generally found to be a result of seawater intrusion saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 yidana et al 2010 nonetheless domestic wastes agricultural activities municipal effluents and leaching from septic tanks have been suggested as possible sources of elevated levels of chloride in groundwater adimalla and taloor 2020 in a study of 164 boreholes kortatsi 2006 showed that the majority of the samples studied were moderately saline to brackish with relatively high concentrations of chloride ranging from 58 mg l 1 to 8511 mg l 1 these high levels may not only be considered a health hazard but also make the water corrosive and taste salty as such chloride in water is considered a vital contamination index compared to cl other anions showed generally low levels and were well within acceptable limits for drinking water for instance in all samples the maximum nitrate and fluoride concentrations measured were each 0 150 mg l 1 the low concentration of nitrates in the groundwater reflects the low impact of anthropogenic activities on the underground water systems particularly from chemical fertiliser usage sewage and wastewater barakat 2020 in a review of over 80 000 research publications spanning 40 years from 1978 to 2017 jia et al 2020 have identified nitrates as the most frequently encountered pollutant in groundwater nitrates in groundwater are of particular concern as they have been linked to harmful health effects including methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome in infants and the risk of stomach cancer adimalla et al 2021 shukla and saxena 2020 the major sources of nitrates in groundwater are agriculture and sewage waste burri et al 2019 sewage manure has been estimated as the significant source 80 of nitrates contamination in groundwater in the lower volta river basin in ghana egbi et al 2020 in locations with inappropriately planned sanitation pit latrines have been observed to contribute to high levels of nitrates in groundwater through underground discharges from latrines located nearby boreholes egbi et al 2020 nevertheless high nitrate levels tend to be more prevalent in surface water and shallow groundwater the results from this study suggest that nitrates are not a major challenge to groundwater quality perhaps due to the lack of major agricultural activities and other major industrial activities in the location at the same time research shows that contaminant levels in groundwater may steadily build up to significantly high levels as groundwater undergoes contamination for instance anornu et al 2017 have shown that after three decades about 95 of groundwater in the upper east region of ghana had nitrate levels above baseline concentrations given that the boreholes in this study are relatively new the impact of anthropogenic pollutants such as nitrates is expected to be minimal nonetheless the rapidly increasing human settlements and their attendant implications for anthropogenic activities are projected to have a more significant impact in the future fluoride contamination of groundwater is known to be a major concern in northern ghana several studies have reported high fluoride concentrations in northern ghana and many other locations particularly in coastal towns dongzagla et al 2019 ganyaglo et al 2019 loh et al 2020 rossiter et al 2010 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 zango et al 2021 the high fluoride content is attributed to the underlying geology characterised by fluoride bearing minerals such as fluorite and apatite in crystalline basement rocks of granite and birimian alfredo et al 2014 in this study fluoride concentrations were low and ranged between 0 001 mg l 1 and 0 472 mg l 1 with a mean value of 0 124 mg l 1 the observed low levels may be due to the presence of variable proportions of micas in the study area higher values of fluoride ranging from 0 21 mg l 1 to 1 88 mg l 1 have been reported in the ga west municipality of ghana sunkari et al 2019 the higher levels were suggested to be due to the possible dissolution of mica minerals while fluoride is an essential element for human health excess of it in the human body poses health risks in moderate concentrations 0 7 mg l 1 1 2 mg l 1 fluoride is believed to promote good teeth and bone development freeze and lehr 2009 however higher intake 1 5 mg l 1 may result in dental fluorosis particularly among children ganyaglo et al 2019 the samples from this study revealed sulphate concentrations ranging from 10 0 mg l 1 to 714 0 mg l 1 based on the who guideline value of 250 0 mg l 1 two samples reported values beyond the recommended limit the two samples ffw and sas showed sulphate concentrations of 450 0 mg l 1 and 714 0 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of sulphates obtained in this study are higher than that obtained in a similar study of boreholes in ga west municipality by sunkari et al 2019 who reported a maximum sulphate concentration of 312 2 mg l 1 and a mean value of 60 0 mg l 1 in previous studies in ghana low levels of sulphates have been observed with occasional high values in some borehole samples across the country anim gyampo et al 2019 bhattacharya et al 2012 ganyaglo et al 2019 gyamfi et al 2019 kulinkina et al 2017 loh et al 2020 rossiter et al 2010 yidana 2010 generally high levels of sulphates in groundwater result from the presence of mudstone geology and the oxidation of sulphide and sulphate minerals including pyrites chegbeleh et al 2020 the oxidation process also leads to the formation of other ions acids and sometimes the release of heavy metals such as nickel and arsenic gejl et al 2020 while the use of inorganic fertilisers may contribute to sulphate concentrations in groundwater the absence of significant farming activities in the study area suggests that the influence of fertiliser if any may be minimal similar findings have been obtained for several boreholes in locations close to the sampling area sunkari et al 2019 however some significantly high values have been recorded in some locations in ghana as a result of the dissolution of minerals or saline water intrusion rossiter et al 2010 yidana et al 2010 2012 in general elevated concentrations of sulphate may affect the taste of water as well as cause gastrointestinal disorders the content of bicarbonate ions in the borehole water in this study ranged from 11 1 mg l 1 to 353 8 mg l 1 similar albeit slightly higher findings have been reported for groundwater in the kwahu bombouaka group of the voltaian basin the level of hco3 concentration was attributed to their precipitation through soils and rocks sunkari et al 2020 this process may be catalysed by the atmospheric reaction of carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid which dissolves such minerals releasing hco3 and associated ions in the process loh et al 2020 hco3 is normally one of the most abundant anions in groundwater and is largely formed from the dissolution of silicate minerals and atmospheric infusion of co2 and decomposition of organic compounds fresh groundwater in coastal areas is predominantly ca hco3 often resulting from the dissolution of carbonate minerals however sunkari et al 2019 have reported hco3 as the dominant anion in boreholes with values ranging from 350 mg l 1 to 2000 mg l 1 with an average of 674 mg l 1 in boreholes from ga west municipality the high concentrations of hco3 is believed to arise from the weathering of and dissolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks including granites phyllites and schists given their fractured aquifer characteristics sunkari et al 2019 the concentration of hco3 in the study is significantly lower the presence and concentrations of ions in the groundwater samples studied were primarily influenced by dissolution from underground rocks belonging to the togo series which forms part of the dahomeyan formation sunkari et al 2019 the major minerals present include calcite quartz feldspars dolomite and muscovite these rock water interactions result in high concentrations of inorganic ions often found in groundwater in the study locations and in various parts of the country exceeding who guideline values in some cases rossiter et al 2010 sunkari et al 2020 2022 4 4 groundwater quality based on wqi in recent years wqi has become increasingly important in assessing the overall quality of groundwater by providing the composite influence of physical and chemical parameters in terms of a single value the index number lumb et al 2011 this weighted arithmetic index approach assigns weights w i to water quality parameters based on their perceived significance relative to health implications and groundwater potability wqi has been applied in almost all major studies assessing water quality for drinking purposs adimalla et al 2020 asadi et al 2020 bhadra et al 2020 lumb et al 2011 shukla and saxena 2021 tian et al 2019 the wqi for each of the considered parameters were computed based on parameters and weights table 5 and the overall results for the various samples are presented in table 6 classification of the computed wqis based on the model proposed by sahu and sikdar 2008 is presented in table 7 based on table 7 about two thirds 67 of groundwater samples are considered as excellent 25 as good and 8 as poor in quality thus 92 of groundwater from the boreholes studied are deemed potable and generally suitable for domestic purposes however samples from sk5 sas and ogm were found to be of poor quality the poor quality is primarily due to the relatively high concentrations of ions including na ca2 k mg2 cl and so4 2 thus influencing values of ec tds and th these high values are in agreement with similar studies in the greater accra region kortatsi 2006 sunkari et al 2019 2022 the alteration of the common minerals in the quartzo feldspathic rocks in the dahomeyan and schist present in togo structural unit in the study area could account for the observed levels of the ions these ions are released through water interaction and the metamorphism of rocks in addition groundwater samples from sas and ogm showed the highest levels of nitrates in all samples studied while the reported nitrate concentrations were low and well within the who recommended limits the higher levels in these locations may be associated with localised contamination fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution of the computed wqis interpolated based on an inverse distance weighting technique which produced the least root mean square error of 38 91 4 5 groundwater suitability for irrigation the quality of water for irrigation purposes largely depends on its mineral composition as this influences soil composition structure and functions and has a resultant effect on plant health as a result several indices have been developed to estimate the suitability of groundwater resources for irrigation in this study several of these indices were utilised and a statistical summary of the results of the assessment are presented in table 8 diagrammatic representations of these indices including the use of wilcox and ussl diagrams are shown in figs 8 and 9 4 5 1 kelly s index ki kelly s index ki expresses the ratio between sodium ions versus calcium and magnesium ions present in groundwater and thus indicates the amount of sodium in water compared to calcium and magnesium according to the index ki 1 connotes an excess sodium ratio which is unsuitable for irrigation whereas ki 1 signifies a good sodium ratio suitable for irrigation purposes sundaray et al 2009 based on the results from this study ki ranged from a minimum of 0 22 to a maximum of 3 39 with an average value of 1 23 table 8 the results suggest that groundwater from 44 of the boreholes studied are suitable for irrigation while 56 are unsuitable based on the kelly index 4 5 2 magnesium hazard mh the impact of magnesium on crop yield is significant particularly when its concentration far exceeds that of calcium paliwal 1972 as a result a magnesium hazard mh index helps to measure the relative amount of magnesium in water and hence its possible impact on soil and crops when used for irrigation in general the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions present in groundwater are in a state that maintains an equilibrium hem 1985 a shift in equilibrium as a result of excess magnesium has a damaging effect on soil structure and crop yield sundaray et al 2009 based on the results obtained for groundwater in the present study table 8 mh values range between 29 and 81 with an average of 41 overall 83 of samples are considered suitable mh 50 for irrigation while 17 are considered unsuitable mh 50 based on magnesium hazard 4 5 3 permeability index pi the permeability index pi measures the relative concentrations of hco3 and na to those of sodium magnesium and calcium doneen 1964 the poor quality of groundwater does not only have negative implications for crops but also soils such impact on soil is largely a result of the concentrations of dissolved ions particularly hco3 na ca2 and mg2 these ions influence the permeability of soils a vital parameter for the migration of dissolved minerals through soils and into plant roots from table 8 the pi values of the groundwater samples studied ranged from 28 32 to 106 56 with a mean of 70 50 these values suggest that 64 of groundwater in the study area are considered moderately safe class ii for irrigation while 36 of boreholes are deemed unsafe class iii for irrigation based on doneen classification doneen 1964 4 5 4 sodium absorption ratio sar groundwater with relatively high na concentration is associated with high sar values which result in the replacement of calcium and magnesium ions by sodium ions becoming saturated with na and thereby destroying soil structure this makes the estimation of sar of groundwater crucial in assessing their suitability for irrigation richards 1954 in the current study all groundwater samples were deemed excellent 97 or good 3 for irrigation based on sar values obtained table 8 notwithstanding the generally high concentrations of sodium ions recorded in several groundwater samples the optimal values of sar reflect the equally high levels of calcium and magnesium ions in the samples studied this resulted in sar values of 10 for almost all samples indicating their suitability for irrigation the ussl diagram richards 1954 further provides an important criterion for visualising and evaluating the quality of groundwater for irrigation based on sar sodium hazard and ec salinity hazard this approach categorises each of sar and ec into four groups low medium high and very high the ussl diagram of samples from the 36 boreholes studied are shown in fig 10 from this figure the values of sar were generally low with about 94 of boreholes classified as low sodium hazard on the other hand the values of salinity were relatively high with about 61 of boreholes categorised as high or very high based on fig 10 about 39 of boreholes were categorised in c2 s1 medium salinity and low sodium hazard another 39 of boreholes fell in the field of c3 s1 high salinity and low sodium hazard while about 14 of boreholes were categorised as c4 s1 very high salinity and low sodium hazard the remaining boreholes showed very high salinity with either medium or high sodium hazards when used for irrigation groundwater with high values of ec has the potential to accumulate salts in the soil thereby promoting soil salinisation ghazaryan et al 2020 this may impair the growth of crops by restricting water supply to the roots while also degrading the physical structure of soils based on data from the ussl diagram of the 36 boreholes analysed in this study salinity may represent a concern for the potential use of the groundwater for irrigation purposes in about 19 of samples despite the low values of sar 4 5 5 percentage sodium na an excess amount of sodium ions na in irrigation water tends to replace calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions within soil this leads to reduced soil permeability and restricts the circulation of air and water resulting in the formation of dry and compact soils that are unsuitable for crop production collins and jenkins 1996 in the literature na 60 is considered suitable for irrigation wilcox 1955 yidana 2010 yidana et al 2012 from tables 8 and 3 of boreholes were categorised as excellent na 20 19 as good 20 na 40 42 as permissible 40 na 60 and 36 as doubtful 60 na 80 for irrigation purposes a graphical representation that gives a better understanding of the influence of na on irrigation is provided by the wilcox classification which plots values of na versus ec wilcox 1955 fig 9 presents the computed na versus ec values on the wilcox plot for sampled groundwater in this study from the diagram 50 of the borehole samples were classified as being excellent to good for irrigation while 11 of samples were categorised as unsuitable in general the wilcox diagram suggests that about 61 of the boreholes studied may be classified as suitable for irrigation purposes whereas 19 are classified as unsuitable with the remaining 20 falling in between these two classifications 5 conclusion as groundwater resources become increasingly important in urban and peri urban communities the need for water quality assurance and management is imperative by assessing the groundwater quality of 36 boreholes distributed in peri urban communities in accra ghana this study has established the quality of water available to an estimated 630 000 inhabitants who rely on this source of water for domestic and irrigation purposes the results of this study provide crucial information for groundwater development and management in ghana s capital city with a rapidly growing population the use of a variety of water quality indicators did not only help to provide sufficient information on the quality and suitability of the groundwater for varied purposes but also to increase the reliability of conclusions made in the study the results from the wqi showed that 92 of the groundwater samples are of acceptable quality for domestic use while the remaining 8 were classified as being of poor quality although the high percentage of groundwater of good quality portends well for groundwater development the low quality of groundwater from some 8 of boreholes suggests the need for caution in developing and sustaining the quality of groundwater resources in the communities in assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation a diversity of indices that reflects varying emphasis and impacts of different ions either separately or in combination with other ions were applied the findings from these assessments suggest that groundwater from the majority of boreholes studied is considered suitable for irrigation of crops nonetheless several boreholes may require some level of treatment prior to their use for the irrigation of crops due to high levels of some ions these findings are crucial considering the growing use of peri urban landscapes for irrigated crop production the quality of water observed from the boreholes studied were mainly influenced by the presence and concentrations of dissolved ions present with na and cl being the dominant cation and anion respectively the observed levels of ions may be attributed to the mineral weathering of the rocks that underlain the terrain the low levels of pollutants such as no3 may reflect the lower impact of anthropogenic activities new state of the boreholes dept of wells and less developed residential settlements in the localities studied given the low impact of anthropogenic effects the need for better management of these water resources is even more important considering the potential harm to lives and the high cost of treatment of polluted water as such limiting groundwater pollution in the study area is crucial through appropriate land use limiting runoff and discharge from agriculture and industries respectively and the education of inhabitants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11860,in many developing countries cities are faced with rising water demand due to rapidly increasing population inadequate municipal water supply and growing sanitation pressure consequently groundwater resources are being heavily relied on to meet the demand however the long term supply and quality of groundwater are threatened by multiple anthropogenic pressures this study assessed the quality and suitability of groundwater available to more than 600 000 inhabitants in several peri urban communities in accra the capital city of ghana thirty six 36 borehole samples were analysed for their suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes based on relevant physicochemical parameters in addition water quality index wqi sodium absorption ratio and relevant statistical plots were employed to assess the groundwater s quality and suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes the results indicate that almost all parameters measured were within the who recommended limits for drinking water for most samples this is reflected in the classification of 92 of water samples as good or excellent quality for domestic purposes using wqi the abundance of ions in groundwater followed the trend na ca2 mg2 k for cations and cl so4 2 hco3 f no3 for anions by using principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses the study identified mineral dissolution and anthropogenic activities as the main factors influencing groundwater chemistry in the study area these factors resulted in mixed water types viz na ca mg cl and na ca mg so4 and na cl as the dominant water type classifications based on the wilcox and ussl diagrams suggest that groundwater in the study area is generally suitable for irrigation given that these boreholes are new the results from this study represent background levels and have important implications for groundwater development and management in the rapidly developing capital of ghana graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water quality index accra ghana irrigation water quality groundwater pollution 1 introduction globally urbanisation is on the increase the rate of increase is substantial in many sub saharan african countries and mostly outstrips the supply of resources including pipe borne water in ghana an estimated 57 of the population live in urban areas with an annual urban growth rate of about 3 34 compared to a rural growth rate of 0 69 undesa 2018 additionally the urban population of approximately 18 million is expected to more than double by 2050 placing tremendous pressure on urban resources in accra the capital city of ghana access to potable water is under massive pressure from rapid urbanisation based on provisional results of ghana s most recent population and housing census 2021 the greater accra region which is the location of accra is currently the most populous in the country gss 2021 many of the new inhabitants of accra are based in peri urban settlements where municipal water supply is lacking as a result groundwater resources are becoming the primary source of water for many urban peri urban communities in the country through the sinking of boreholes for domestic industrial and irrigation purposes yidana et al 2011 however the interplay of a rapidly growing urban population increasing exploitation of water resources and escalating pollution from anthropogenic activities have combined to exacerbate the vulnerability and potential contamination of aquifers burri et al 2019 jia et al 2020 rezaei et al 2020 saka et al 2013 anthropogenic activities such as physical changes to landscapes application of synthetic chemicals and massive exploitation of underground water resources threaten the sustainability of future water supply in urban areas and amplify the risks of water scarcity particularly among poor urban dwellers this situation is projected to worsen under climate change scenarios ahmad and al ghouti 2020 bodrud doza et al 2020 saka et al 2013 these developments have occasioned the need to investigate the state and fate of groundwater resources in many cities in the african sub region cobbing and hiller 2019 groundwater quality and development has been highly researched in ghana for decades and has played a pivotal role in the livelihoods of people in hundreds of communities anornu et al 2017 sunkari et al 2020 yidana et al 2008 2012 nonetheless groundwater development and use mainly through the sinking of boreholes have been primarily restricted to rural areas and the semi arid northern regions of the country akurugu et al 2020 chegbeleh et al 2020 loh et al 2020 lutz et al 2007 nsiah et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 yidana et al 2008 zango et al 2019 until recent years groundwater developments in southern ghana and urban areas of the country have been low and restricted mainly to private boreholes kortatsi 2006 kortatsi and jorgensen 2001 saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 2020 however given the growing population burden which is not matched by development in surface water infrastructure groundwater resources present a more affordable means of water access and are rapidly becoming an essential proportion of urban water supply saka et al 2013 this has led to increasing research into groundwater resources in ghana s urban areas including accra foppen et al 2020 hagan and darko 2020 kortatsi 2006 saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 as is occurring in other parts of the world peri urban accra is faced with an increasing urban sprawl characterised by unplanned settlements and land use change promoting unsustainable developments and associated environmental concerns in the city yiran et al 2020 studies show that the study area which includes ga west ga east la nkwantanang madina and adentan municipalities of accra is faced with significant changes in land use increasing commercial activities massive generation of waste and improper waste management systems sunkari et al 2019 tibu et al 2019 moreover evidence suggests that the rate of environmental degradation and pollution in ghana s capital city is mirrored by the population growth rate owusu 2002 these challenges have been associated with adverse health consequences including one of the highest prevalence of buruli ulcer cases in the country within some of the peri urban communities under study kofie et al 2008 owusu and adamba 2012 in addition rapid population growth unplanned developments and other anthropogenic activities act as significant contributors to groundwater quality degradation antony et al 2020 previous studies by sunkari et al 2019 and saka et al 2013 have shown that groundwater chemistry in the ga west municipality of accra is primarily controlled by seawater intrusion leaching of chemicals from pit latrines and refuse dumps interaction with minerals and agrochemicals while studies on groundwater quality in some of the municipalities in the study area exist they have been restricted to fewer boreholes in few locations often for private use given the rising concern for water quality and scarcity in peri urban accra the government of ghana through the community water and sanitation agency cwsa has prioritised the sinking of boreholes in several communities to address potable water needs of thousands of its residents this study provides the most comprehensive groundwater quality assessment of carefully planned and engineered boreholes located in the ga west ga east la nkwantanang madina and adentan municipalities by employing a combination of multivariate statistical methods and conventional hydrochemical techniques the study examined the main factors controlling the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study areas the findings provide valuable information on the quality of groundwater resources within a large portion of peri urban accra that will help inform policy on the development management and sustainable use of groundwater resources within the greater accra region of ghana 2 study area 2 1 location and climate this study was carried out in four of the fastest growing municipalities in accra ga west ga east la nkwantanang madina and adentan fig 1 the study area lies within longitudes 5 35 0 n and 5 50 0 n and latitudes 0 30 0 w and 0 50 0 w the area shares boundaries to the north with upper west akim nsawam adoagyiri and akwapim south districts ga south municipal to the west kpone katamanso to the east and ga central okaikwai north ayawaso west ledzokuku krowor and tema west municipalities to the south these municipalities were chosen because of a combination of factors some of which are discussed herein that affect the demand and supply availability of groundwater until recent years these municipalities were considered rural but are now urban areas due to the rapid urbanisation of accra yiran et al 2020 studies have attributed the settlement or relocation of people to peri urban areas such as the study areas to several factors related to cost and affordability including lower rent preferences changing lifestyle and lower land prices baye et al 2020 oppong and yeboah 2013 as more and more people move into these peri urban areas they begin to densify and the demand for services including water for domestic and other purposes increases however the provision of potable water in these peri urban areas remains a major challenge due to cost given that many of the communities in these municipalities are not connected to municipal water supply there is a growing dependence on groundwater supply as a source of potable water for domestic use in this regard several boreholes have been drilled in these communities by the community water and sanitation agency cwsa of ghana for water supply purposes the purpose is not only to meet the growing domestic water needs but also the associated increases in industrial and agricultural water demand in the communities at the same time the rapid urbanisation and developments in the areas under study have been associated with poor planning and are largely characterised by the gross absence of appropriate sanitary facilities according to the ghana statistical service nearly one quarter of households in the study area are without conventional toilet facilities gss 2012 posing considerable risks to the environment in addition groundwater availability may be impacted by climate change and climate variability the area is characterised by high temperatures ranging between 25 1 c and 32 1 c and low rainfall between 79 cm yr 1 to 127 cm yr 1 gss 2012 the rainfall availability is projected to further decrease due to climate change ipcc 2014 with negative implications for groundwater recharge the effect of low rainfall on groundwater recharge may be exacerbated by the continuous increase in human settlement and other activities which make the land surface impervious resulting in more runoff and less infiltration hagan et al 2018 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of the study area is predominantly dahomeyan and togo structural rocks intruded by undifferentiated granitoid the dahomeyan comprises acidic ortho and para gneisses schist and migmatite many of which are rich in garnet hornblende and biotite fig 2 a the dahomeyan structural unit in ghana generally consists of felsic and mafic gneisses that alternate grant 1967 the main litho tectonic units of the dahomeyan are i quartzo feldspathic and augen gneisses locally referred to as ho gneisses ii a suture zone of distinct mafic and ultramafic rocks and iii a granitoid gneiss migmatite assemblages the dahomeyan is distinct from other rocks in the country because of its composition of high grade metamorphic rocks holm 1973 the togo structural unit within the study area comprises schist quartzite and phyllite with rare occurrences of sandstone shale and silicified limestone fig 2a the main lithologies of the togo unit are schists quartzites phyllites and phyllonites the phyllites and phyllonites are intensely deformed and usually occur along with thrust contact between togo and dahomeyan rocks or as thin intercalations with quartzite anani et al 2019 darko et al 2019 nude et al 2015 have reclassified shale sandstone and silicified limestone to belong to the buem structural unit structurally regional lineament within the study area indicates two main orientations of ne sw and nw sw trends these fractures tend to control the borehole yields within the study area in ghana the hydrogeological terranes follow the geological terranes to a large extent dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 banoeng yakubo et al 2010 have identified five hydrogeological provinces following the work of gyau boakye and tumbulto 2000 these delineations are based on the knowledge and understanding of the rock types on current knowledge of the rock types well depths well yields groundwater quality among others the hydrogeology of the study area falls under the basement complex province aquifers of all granitoids and the pan african province aquifers of the buem and togo structural units fig 2b the dahomeyan system is characterised by low yields of groundwater from hand dug wells and boreholes dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 the low yield is due to the rock types gneisses made of colossal crystalline structure and the impervious nature of their weathered material clay the togo structural unit which is highly fractured and jointed with folded layers of rocks build a fracture flow aquifer system recharge to groundwater within this basement complex type is high with highly variable depth to groundwater table yidana et al 2014 thus within the togo structural unit the degree and extent of fracturing control borehole yields the geological formations characterising the study area therefore suggest that the hydrogeological conditions would be controlled by secondary permeabilities arising from structures fractures and joint systems due to deformation locally a single aquifer unit within the weathered zone made up of quartzite schist formations has been identified for the ga east and adentan municipalities based on available data and current understanding of the hydrogeology the aquifer thickness ranges from 6 5 m to 31 5 m and the borehole depths range from 50 m to 90 m hagan and darko 2020 preliminary studies into the aquifer system within the ga west municipality similarly reveals a single aquifer unit within the weathered zone granite formation with aquifer thickness ranging from 10 m to 36 m and borehole depths of 32 m 78 m 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and hydrochemical analysis groundwater samples from thirty six 36 newly constructed boreholes within the study area were used in this study fig 3 water samples were collected into pre washed high density polyethene bottles of 500 ml capacity all samples were stored at 4 c using ice in an ice chest prior to laboratory analysis to assess the water quality samples were analysed for the following physicochemical parameters hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th and the ions chloride cl fluoride f sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 bicarbonate hco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k the analysis of samples was conducted at the water research laboratory of the centre for scientific and industrial research csir in accra and the water quality laboratory of the ghana water company limited in ho ghana samples were analysed based on standard procedures for water analysis as outlined by the american public health association apha the ph was measured at room temperature using a ph meter suntex model no sp 2100 electrical conductivity and tds were measured using a lovibond consodirect con 200 instruments total hardness hd calcium and magnesium were measured using the edta titrimetric method potassium and sodium were determined using a digital flame photometer gallenkamp fga 350 1 the analysis of nitrates and sulphates were performed by employing an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer using the hydrazine reduction and barium chloride reduction respectively chloride was estimated by the argentometric titration method while fluoride was determined using an ion selective electrode method orion thermo scientific 3 2 data processing multivariate statistical analysis and water quality assessment the results obtained from the physicochemical analysis was used to characterise the quality of groundwater first by comparing values of the physicochemical parameters with their respective who standards in addition other methods for quality assessment of groundwater including the water quality index were employed the water quality index wqi method was used to evaluate the suitability of water for drinking domestic purposes the computation of the wqi is a four step approach the first step involves assigning weight w i to each of the twelve parameter considered ph th tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f for the computation of wqi based on their relative importance to the overall quality of groundwater parameters such as ph no3 and f were assigned a maximum weight of 5 due to their significant role in the water quality assessment while weights ranging from 2 to 4 were assigned to the remaining parameters based on their relative roles in the water quality assessment the second step involves the computation of relative weight of each parameter w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the relative weight w i is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters the third step is based on a computation of the quality rating scale q i for each parameter q i c i s i 100 where q i is the quality rating c i is the concentration of each parameter in mg l 1 and s i is the who standard for each parameter in mg l 1 the fourth step is the determination of the sub index si for each parameter this is then used to calculate the wqi si w i q i the overall wqi was then computed by summing all the sub index values for each sample wqi i 1 n si the computed wqis were then classified using the classification model proposed by sahu and sikdar table 1 3 3 irrigation water quality assessment the quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes was determined using several indices including the united states salinity laboratory ussl diagram the wilcox diagram and values of ec th ki mh pi sar and na these indices are considered effective approaches to assessing the suitability of water for irrigation purposes and are described below 3 3 1 kelly s index ki kelly s index ki expresses the ratio between sodium ions versus calcium and magnesium ions present in groundwater as follows ki na ca 2 mg 2 ki thus indicates the amount of sodium in water compared to calcium and magnesium 3 3 2 magnesium hazard mh the magnesium hazard mh index helps to measure the relative amount of magnesium in water and hence its possible impact on soil and crops when used for irrigation mh is computed as follows mh mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 100 3 3 3 permeability index pi the permeability index pi measures the relative concentrations of hco3 and na to those of sodium magnesium and calcium based on the equation below doneen 1964 pi na hco 3 na ca 2 mg 2 100 3 3 4 sodium absorption ratio sar the sodium absorption ratio sar indicates the degree to which other cations may be replaced by sodium the value of sar is calculated based on the formula proposed by richards 1954 sar na 1 2 ca 2 mg 2 3 3 5 percentage sodium na the percentage sodium na is another vital factor in characterising the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes the na content is expressed as a soluble sodium percentage and is computed as follows na na k na k ca 2 mg 2 100 3 4 quality assurance several quality assurance measures were undertaken from sampling and sample pretreatment to analysis and data treatment aimed at ensuring the quality of the data produced these include the use of analytical grade reagents and chemicals as well as sample and reagent blanks all samples were analysed in duplicates and where necessary in triplicates the assurance of the quality and validity of data obtained in work was measured by calculating the charge balance error cbe for each sample a cbe of 5 was obtained in almost all samples suggesting a perfect quality of analysis a few samples showed a cbe of 10 which was assumed to be of good quality apha 2012 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrochemistry the descriptive statistics of the results obtained from the chemical analysis of all parameters studied are presented in table 2 together with their applicable who guideline values for drinking water the ph of samples showed little variability with few outliers the values ranged from 5 90 to 9 90 with a mean value of 7 27 0 14 suggesting the groundwater understudy may be considered largely neutral to slightly basic however approximately 17 of the water samples fell outside of the who recommended standard of 6 50 8 50 for drinking water nonetheless the ph value of water in itself is not known to have a significant effect on human consumption rather the ph effect is largely based on its source and influence on the dissolution of other elements some of which may be harmful in this study the ph values reported are generally within optimal levels and do not favour the excessive dissolution of ions and heavy metals however a low ph of 5 90 was obtained from a borehole at new nmai djor nnd raising concern for the dissolution of heavy metals some of which may be toxic upon consumption yidana 2010 the low ph may be due to the dissolution of granites phyllites and schist in the togo formation ganyaglo et al 2019 saka et al 2013 the ec of groundwater samples ranged from 260 0 to 6628 0 μs cm 1 with a mean value of 1389 5 219 3 μs cm 1 the large standard deviation in the mean value reflects the wide variation in the measured values from the various wells approximately 19 of ec values were above the recommended standard of 2000 0 μs cm 1 similar to the ec data the values of tds showed a wide variability ranging from 130 0 mg l 1 to 3314 0 mg l 1 with a mean value of 727 7 113 36 mg l 1 given the who guideline of 1000 0 mg l 1 22 of the samples analysed reported values higher than the recommended limit the values of total hardness th also displayed a high variation with a minimum of 30 0 mg l 1 and a maximum of 1067 0 mg l 1 and a mean of 247 70 40 70 mg l 1 approximately 36 of the samples were above the who limit of 200 0 mg l 1 based on the mean values of parameters the abundance of ions analysed in this study increased as follows k mg2 ca2 na for cations and no3 f hco3 so4 2 cl for anions the levels of k and mg2 for all 36 sampled boreholes were within their respective who acceptable limits for drinking water however approximately 6 and 11 of water samples showed levels of ca2 and na respectively above the who recommended limits for anions all 36 sampled boreholes had levels of no3 and f well within their respective who recommended limits for drinking water however approximately 6 of boreholes had so4 2 concentrations above the who recommended limit for drinking water whiles 3 of samples showed concentrations of hco3 exceeding the who acceptable limit the concentration of cl was highest among all ions considered with levels exceeding the recommended maximum concentration in more than 22 of samples studied 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis a visual assessment of the distribution of data was performed using boxplots and are shown in fig 4 the boxplots show two or more large values that are distinct from the bulk of the data for mg2 ca2 and na these observations can be considered as outliers the distribution of all the cations is skewed to the right these observations are similar to the boxplots for ec tds and th the borehole with a ph value of 9 90 is quite distinct from the other wells and thus can be considered an outlier this renders the distribution right skewed the anions cl hco3 and so4 2 show one or more outliers the boxplot for each of these anions indicates right skewness however no3 is slightly positively skewed while f is approximately symmetric most parameters including na k cl so4 2 ph ec and tds showed the presence of at least one outlier contributing to the skewness of the distributions pearson s correlation was computed to identify trends and correlation between the water quality parameters analysed table 3 in this regard parameters that have a correlation coefficient r of at least 0 5 are considered to be significantly correlated the correlation matrix revealed significant correlations between several parameters most of which are strong and positive for instance very strong positive correlations 0 89 were recorded between ec and the following parameters tds th ca2 mg2 and cl due to the interdependence of ec on these parameters this assertion is evident in the significant loadings of ca2 mg2 na so4 2 and cl with tds and ec also reported in other similar studies in the study area saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 on the other hand ph showed a weak positive correlation with most parameters based on these relationships a mixed water type system comprising na ca mg cl and na ca mg so4 dominate the groundwater system in the area these correlations were further visualised using scatter plot matrices fig 5 the strong correlation between any two parameters is depicted by the linearity of the plot generated as observed for parameters such as ec and tds row 3 column 2 and tds and ca2 row 5 column 3 similarly column 1 depicts a weak correlation that exists between ph and the other parameters in addition principal component analysis pca was performed using the r statistical package to illustrate relationships between the physicochemical parameters badeenezhad et al 2020 khawla and mohamed 2020 the pca of the 12 physicochemical parameters showed that over 80 of the total variation in the groundwater system in the study area is explained by the first two components table 4 a component 1 pca 1 showed significant positive loadings with tds cl th mg2 na and so4 2 table 4 b which may be attributable to mineral dissolution as a result of rock water interaction loh et al 2020 saka et al 2013 yidana 2010 component 2 pca 2 on the other hand showed significant positive loadings with f and no3 and significant negative loadings with hco3 and ph the significant positive loadings of no3 and f with pca 2 suggest the influence of anthropogenic activities in the area yidana 2010 yidana et al 2010 no3 and f in groundwater could result from phosphate fertilisers from agricultural farms or the burning of coal or disposal of fly ash on the land surface these are common activities that characterise the study area and therefore could contribute to significant amounts of these ions in groundwater in the study area furthermore using the hclust function in the statistical package r a hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed for the parameters based on a hierarchical tree dendrogram using ward s method to project the similarities correlations amongst them fig 6 ibe et al 2020 loh et al 2020 results from hca suggest two distinct clusters with a phenon line drawn at a linkage distance of 22 fig 6 cluster 1 comprises th ca2 mg2 tds cl na so4 2 ph and hco3 whereas cluster 2 consists of no3 f and k cluster 1 suggests the influence of ion dissolution as a result of rock water interactions and is in agreement with results from pca 1 table 4b the sub clustering of ca2 mg2 and th is clearly seen in the hca which corroborates the contribution of carbonate hardness similarly the relation between na and cl as well as their contribution to tds tables 3 and 4b is clearly evident in the hca where they are linked at the closest linkage distance this shows their close relation suggesting na cl as the dominant water type lastly similar to the pca 2 cluster 2 represents the influence of anthropogenic activities as evident by the clustering of k f and no3 which are constituents of agrochemicals that may be runoff from farmlands 4 3 groundwater quality and suitability for domestic drinking purposes the predominant use of borehole water in the study locations is for domestic purposes including cooking drinking and washing given the use and heavy reliance on this source of water the quality of borehole water is critical due to its possible health implications of the parameters measured ec and tds had about 19 and 22 and of samples reporting values outside of the who recommended limits respectively the value of ec is primarily an indication of the total dissolved ions present in water which is expressed as tds tds is an essential parameter in water quality and represents the variety of solids dissolved in a solution including chlorides carbonates bicarbonates sulphates calcium magnesium sodium and potassium adimalla and taloor 2020 the measured tds values in this study are low compared to a similar study in the accra plains where about 75 of the borehole samples showed tds ranging from 1000 to 10 000 with na and cl as the dominant ions kortatsi 2006 however similar results 148 1 4020 0 have been reported for tds in groundwater samples from ga west municipality saka et al 2013 in this study tds ranged from 130 0 to 3314 0 mg l 1 the values of th were generally high with about 36 of samples having values above 200 mg l 1 the recommended limit set by the who the high levels of th is a reflection of the generally high values of ca2 ions th represents the total concentration of dissolved ca2 and mg2 ion concentrations in groundwater and may influence the taste of drinking water and reduce the effectiveness of detergents although there is a low association with health water with th values above 200 mg l 1 has a high probability of causing scales deposition in pipes water systems and excessive use of soap and formation of scum who 2017 in about 11 of boreholes ph values were lower than 6 5 the lower limit recommended by the who low ph values have no direct health effects nonetheless the cause of the low ph and the increased dissolution of ions may introduce adverse health impacts for groundwater who 2017 generally acidity in groundwater is associated with granite based minerals in the current study only about 6 of the groundwater samples reported a ph above 8 5 with nearly 97 of the boreholes occurring in the dahomeyan and granitoid the observed ph levels may be attributable to the quartzo feldspathic acidic and the mafic basic compositions of the gneiss in the dahomeyan and the granites overall the concentration of ions in the groundwater samples were low and within acceptable limits however cl and na concentrations were above the recommended limits in 22 and 11 of borehole samples studied respectively the ions with concentrations above their respective who guideline values have been shown in fig 8 chloride was the most abundant anion present in the samples studied this could be linked to the metamorphic nature of the terrain the gneissic rocks of the dahomeyan comprise minerals of quartz feldspars and variable proportions of micas chlorite muscovite and biotite and their alteration releases cl mg fe etc in solution the findings from this study show that about 22 of samples had high chloride concentrations above a recommended value of 250 0 mg l 1 with values ranging from 18 00 mg l 1 to 1099 0 mg l 1 while the level of chloride is generally low the concentration of chloride in groundwater samples from sk5 and sas were considerably high with values of 1099 0 mg l 1 and 993 0 mg l 1 respectively the excessive chloride content in groundwater particularly near coastal areas is generally found to be a result of seawater intrusion saka et al 2013 sunkari et al 2019 yidana et al 2010 nonetheless domestic wastes agricultural activities municipal effluents and leaching from septic tanks have been suggested as possible sources of elevated levels of chloride in groundwater adimalla and taloor 2020 in a study of 164 boreholes kortatsi 2006 showed that the majority of the samples studied were moderately saline to brackish with relatively high concentrations of chloride ranging from 58 mg l 1 to 8511 mg l 1 these high levels may not only be considered a health hazard but also make the water corrosive and taste salty as such chloride in water is considered a vital contamination index compared to cl other anions showed generally low levels and were well within acceptable limits for drinking water for instance in all samples the maximum nitrate and fluoride concentrations measured were each 0 150 mg l 1 the low concentration of nitrates in the groundwater reflects the low impact of anthropogenic activities on the underground water systems particularly from chemical fertiliser usage sewage and wastewater barakat 2020 in a review of over 80 000 research publications spanning 40 years from 1978 to 2017 jia et al 2020 have identified nitrates as the most frequently encountered pollutant in groundwater nitrates in groundwater are of particular concern as they have been linked to harmful health effects including methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome in infants and the risk of stomach cancer adimalla et al 2021 shukla and saxena 2020 the major sources of nitrates in groundwater are agriculture and sewage waste burri et al 2019 sewage manure has been estimated as the significant source 80 of nitrates contamination in groundwater in the lower volta river basin in ghana egbi et al 2020 in locations with inappropriately planned sanitation pit latrines have been observed to contribute to high levels of nitrates in groundwater through underground discharges from latrines located nearby boreholes egbi et al 2020 nevertheless high nitrate levels tend to be more prevalent in surface water and shallow groundwater the results from this study suggest that nitrates are not a major challenge to groundwater quality perhaps due to the lack of major agricultural activities and other major industrial activities in the location at the same time research shows that contaminant levels in groundwater may steadily build up to significantly high levels as groundwater undergoes contamination for instance anornu et al 2017 have shown that after three decades about 95 of groundwater in the upper east region of ghana had nitrate levels above baseline concentrations given that the boreholes in this study are relatively new the impact of anthropogenic pollutants such as nitrates is expected to be minimal nonetheless the rapidly increasing human settlements and their attendant implications for anthropogenic activities are projected to have a more significant impact in the future fluoride contamination of groundwater is known to be a major concern in northern ghana several studies have reported high fluoride concentrations in northern ghana and many other locations particularly in coastal towns dongzagla et al 2019 ganyaglo et al 2019 loh et al 2020 rossiter et al 2010 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 zango et al 2021 the high fluoride content is attributed to the underlying geology characterised by fluoride bearing minerals such as fluorite and apatite in crystalline basement rocks of granite and birimian alfredo et al 2014 in this study fluoride concentrations were low and ranged between 0 001 mg l 1 and 0 472 mg l 1 with a mean value of 0 124 mg l 1 the observed low levels may be due to the presence of variable proportions of micas in the study area higher values of fluoride ranging from 0 21 mg l 1 to 1 88 mg l 1 have been reported in the ga west municipality of ghana sunkari et al 2019 the higher levels were suggested to be due to the possible dissolution of mica minerals while fluoride is an essential element for human health excess of it in the human body poses health risks in moderate concentrations 0 7 mg l 1 1 2 mg l 1 fluoride is believed to promote good teeth and bone development freeze and lehr 2009 however higher intake 1 5 mg l 1 may result in dental fluorosis particularly among children ganyaglo et al 2019 the samples from this study revealed sulphate concentrations ranging from 10 0 mg l 1 to 714 0 mg l 1 based on the who guideline value of 250 0 mg l 1 two samples reported values beyond the recommended limit the two samples ffw and sas showed sulphate concentrations of 450 0 mg l 1 and 714 0 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of sulphates obtained in this study are higher than that obtained in a similar study of boreholes in ga west municipality by sunkari et al 2019 who reported a maximum sulphate concentration of 312 2 mg l 1 and a mean value of 60 0 mg l 1 in previous studies in ghana low levels of sulphates have been observed with occasional high values in some borehole samples across the country anim gyampo et al 2019 bhattacharya et al 2012 ganyaglo et al 2019 gyamfi et al 2019 kulinkina et al 2017 loh et al 2020 rossiter et al 2010 yidana 2010 generally high levels of sulphates in groundwater result from the presence of mudstone geology and the oxidation of sulphide and sulphate minerals including pyrites chegbeleh et al 2020 the oxidation process also leads to the formation of other ions acids and sometimes the release of heavy metals such as nickel and arsenic gejl et al 2020 while the use of inorganic fertilisers may contribute to sulphate concentrations in groundwater the absence of significant farming activities in the study area suggests that the influence of fertiliser if any may be minimal similar findings have been obtained for several boreholes in locations close to the sampling area sunkari et al 2019 however some significantly high values have been recorded in some locations in ghana as a result of the dissolution of minerals or saline water intrusion rossiter et al 2010 yidana et al 2010 2012 in general elevated concentrations of sulphate may affect the taste of water as well as cause gastrointestinal disorders the content of bicarbonate ions in the borehole water in this study ranged from 11 1 mg l 1 to 353 8 mg l 1 similar albeit slightly higher findings have been reported for groundwater in the kwahu bombouaka group of the voltaian basin the level of hco3 concentration was attributed to their precipitation through soils and rocks sunkari et al 2020 this process may be catalysed by the atmospheric reaction of carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid which dissolves such minerals releasing hco3 and associated ions in the process loh et al 2020 hco3 is normally one of the most abundant anions in groundwater and is largely formed from the dissolution of silicate minerals and atmospheric infusion of co2 and decomposition of organic compounds fresh groundwater in coastal areas is predominantly ca hco3 often resulting from the dissolution of carbonate minerals however sunkari et al 2019 have reported hco3 as the dominant anion in boreholes with values ranging from 350 mg l 1 to 2000 mg l 1 with an average of 674 mg l 1 in boreholes from ga west municipality the high concentrations of hco3 is believed to arise from the weathering of and dissolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks including granites phyllites and schists given their fractured aquifer characteristics sunkari et al 2019 the concentration of hco3 in the study is significantly lower the presence and concentrations of ions in the groundwater samples studied were primarily influenced by dissolution from underground rocks belonging to the togo series which forms part of the dahomeyan formation sunkari et al 2019 the major minerals present include calcite quartz feldspars dolomite and muscovite these rock water interactions result in high concentrations of inorganic ions often found in groundwater in the study locations and in various parts of the country exceeding who guideline values in some cases rossiter et al 2010 sunkari et al 2020 2022 4 4 groundwater quality based on wqi in recent years wqi has become increasingly important in assessing the overall quality of groundwater by providing the composite influence of physical and chemical parameters in terms of a single value the index number lumb et al 2011 this weighted arithmetic index approach assigns weights w i to water quality parameters based on their perceived significance relative to health implications and groundwater potability wqi has been applied in almost all major studies assessing water quality for drinking purposs adimalla et al 2020 asadi et al 2020 bhadra et al 2020 lumb et al 2011 shukla and saxena 2021 tian et al 2019 the wqi for each of the considered parameters were computed based on parameters and weights table 5 and the overall results for the various samples are presented in table 6 classification of the computed wqis based on the model proposed by sahu and sikdar 2008 is presented in table 7 based on table 7 about two thirds 67 of groundwater samples are considered as excellent 25 as good and 8 as poor in quality thus 92 of groundwater from the boreholes studied are deemed potable and generally suitable for domestic purposes however samples from sk5 sas and ogm were found to be of poor quality the poor quality is primarily due to the relatively high concentrations of ions including na ca2 k mg2 cl and so4 2 thus influencing values of ec tds and th these high values are in agreement with similar studies in the greater accra region kortatsi 2006 sunkari et al 2019 2022 the alteration of the common minerals in the quartzo feldspathic rocks in the dahomeyan and schist present in togo structural unit in the study area could account for the observed levels of the ions these ions are released through water interaction and the metamorphism of rocks in addition groundwater samples from sas and ogm showed the highest levels of nitrates in all samples studied while the reported nitrate concentrations were low and well within the who recommended limits the higher levels in these locations may be associated with localised contamination fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution of the computed wqis interpolated based on an inverse distance weighting technique which produced the least root mean square error of 38 91 4 5 groundwater suitability for irrigation the quality of water for irrigation purposes largely depends on its mineral composition as this influences soil composition structure and functions and has a resultant effect on plant health as a result several indices have been developed to estimate the suitability of groundwater resources for irrigation in this study several of these indices were utilised and a statistical summary of the results of the assessment are presented in table 8 diagrammatic representations of these indices including the use of wilcox and ussl diagrams are shown in figs 8 and 9 4 5 1 kelly s index ki kelly s index ki expresses the ratio between sodium ions versus calcium and magnesium ions present in groundwater and thus indicates the amount of sodium in water compared to calcium and magnesium according to the index ki 1 connotes an excess sodium ratio which is unsuitable for irrigation whereas ki 1 signifies a good sodium ratio suitable for irrigation purposes sundaray et al 2009 based on the results from this study ki ranged from a minimum of 0 22 to a maximum of 3 39 with an average value of 1 23 table 8 the results suggest that groundwater from 44 of the boreholes studied are suitable for irrigation while 56 are unsuitable based on the kelly index 4 5 2 magnesium hazard mh the impact of magnesium on crop yield is significant particularly when its concentration far exceeds that of calcium paliwal 1972 as a result a magnesium hazard mh index helps to measure the relative amount of magnesium in water and hence its possible impact on soil and crops when used for irrigation in general the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions present in groundwater are in a state that maintains an equilibrium hem 1985 a shift in equilibrium as a result of excess magnesium has a damaging effect on soil structure and crop yield sundaray et al 2009 based on the results obtained for groundwater in the present study table 8 mh values range between 29 and 81 with an average of 41 overall 83 of samples are considered suitable mh 50 for irrigation while 17 are considered unsuitable mh 50 based on magnesium hazard 4 5 3 permeability index pi the permeability index pi measures the relative concentrations of hco3 and na to those of sodium magnesium and calcium doneen 1964 the poor quality of groundwater does not only have negative implications for crops but also soils such impact on soil is largely a result of the concentrations of dissolved ions particularly hco3 na ca2 and mg2 these ions influence the permeability of soils a vital parameter for the migration of dissolved minerals through soils and into plant roots from table 8 the pi values of the groundwater samples studied ranged from 28 32 to 106 56 with a mean of 70 50 these values suggest that 64 of groundwater in the study area are considered moderately safe class ii for irrigation while 36 of boreholes are deemed unsafe class iii for irrigation based on doneen classification doneen 1964 4 5 4 sodium absorption ratio sar groundwater with relatively high na concentration is associated with high sar values which result in the replacement of calcium and magnesium ions by sodium ions becoming saturated with na and thereby destroying soil structure this makes the estimation of sar of groundwater crucial in assessing their suitability for irrigation richards 1954 in the current study all groundwater samples were deemed excellent 97 or good 3 for irrigation based on sar values obtained table 8 notwithstanding the generally high concentrations of sodium ions recorded in several groundwater samples the optimal values of sar reflect the equally high levels of calcium and magnesium ions in the samples studied this resulted in sar values of 10 for almost all samples indicating their suitability for irrigation the ussl diagram richards 1954 further provides an important criterion for visualising and evaluating the quality of groundwater for irrigation based on sar sodium hazard and ec salinity hazard this approach categorises each of sar and ec into four groups low medium high and very high the ussl diagram of samples from the 36 boreholes studied are shown in fig 10 from this figure the values of sar were generally low with about 94 of boreholes classified as low sodium hazard on the other hand the values of salinity were relatively high with about 61 of boreholes categorised as high or very high based on fig 10 about 39 of boreholes were categorised in c2 s1 medium salinity and low sodium hazard another 39 of boreholes fell in the field of c3 s1 high salinity and low sodium hazard while about 14 of boreholes were categorised as c4 s1 very high salinity and low sodium hazard the remaining boreholes showed very high salinity with either medium or high sodium hazards when used for irrigation groundwater with high values of ec has the potential to accumulate salts in the soil thereby promoting soil salinisation ghazaryan et al 2020 this may impair the growth of crops by restricting water supply to the roots while also degrading the physical structure of soils based on data from the ussl diagram of the 36 boreholes analysed in this study salinity may represent a concern for the potential use of the groundwater for irrigation purposes in about 19 of samples despite the low values of sar 4 5 5 percentage sodium na an excess amount of sodium ions na in irrigation water tends to replace calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions within soil this leads to reduced soil permeability and restricts the circulation of air and water resulting in the formation of dry and compact soils that are unsuitable for crop production collins and jenkins 1996 in the literature na 60 is considered suitable for irrigation wilcox 1955 yidana 2010 yidana et al 2012 from tables 8 and 3 of boreholes were categorised as excellent na 20 19 as good 20 na 40 42 as permissible 40 na 60 and 36 as doubtful 60 na 80 for irrigation purposes a graphical representation that gives a better understanding of the influence of na on irrigation is provided by the wilcox classification which plots values of na versus ec wilcox 1955 fig 9 presents the computed na versus ec values on the wilcox plot for sampled groundwater in this study from the diagram 50 of the borehole samples were classified as being excellent to good for irrigation while 11 of samples were categorised as unsuitable in general the wilcox diagram suggests that about 61 of the boreholes studied may be classified as suitable for irrigation purposes whereas 19 are classified as unsuitable with the remaining 20 falling in between these two classifications 5 conclusion as groundwater resources become increasingly important in urban and peri urban communities the need for water quality assurance and management is imperative by assessing the groundwater quality of 36 boreholes distributed in peri urban communities in accra ghana this study has established the quality of water available to an estimated 630 000 inhabitants who rely on this source of water for domestic and irrigation purposes the results of this study provide crucial information for groundwater development and management in ghana s capital city with a rapidly growing population the use of a variety of water quality indicators did not only help to provide sufficient information on the quality and suitability of the groundwater for varied purposes but also to increase the reliability of conclusions made in the study the results from the wqi showed that 92 of the groundwater samples are of acceptable quality for domestic use while the remaining 8 were classified as being of poor quality although the high percentage of groundwater of good quality portends well for groundwater development the low quality of groundwater from some 8 of boreholes suggests the need for caution in developing and sustaining the quality of groundwater resources in the communities in assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation a diversity of indices that reflects varying emphasis and impacts of different ions either separately or in combination with other ions were applied the findings from these assessments suggest that groundwater from the majority of boreholes studied is considered suitable for irrigation of crops nonetheless several boreholes may require some level of treatment prior to their use for the irrigation of crops due to high levels of some ions these findings are crucial considering the growing use of peri urban landscapes for irrigated crop production the quality of water observed from the boreholes studied were mainly influenced by the presence and concentrations of dissolved ions present with na and cl being the dominant cation and anion respectively the observed levels of ions may be attributed to the mineral weathering of the rocks that underlain the terrain the low levels of pollutants such as no3 may reflect the lower impact of anthropogenic activities new state of the boreholes dept of wells and less developed residential settlements in the localities studied given the low impact of anthropogenic effects the need for better management of these water resources is even more important considering the potential harm to lives and the high cost of treatment of polluted water as such limiting groundwater pollution in the study area is crucial through appropriate land use limiting runoff and discharge from agriculture and industries respectively and the education of inhabitants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11861,on behalf of all co authors of the article hydrogeochemical and isotopic controls on the source of fluoride in groundwater within the vea catchment northeastern ghana by zango et al 2021 we wish to thank bam and bansah 2022 for the interest in our paper we would like to clarify from the onset that we observed some errors in fig 3 after the publication which necessitated an erratum but before we could submit our erratum bam and bansah 2022 submitted a comment on the paper when their attention was drawn to the erratum they insisted on a response to their comments we have included below a response to some aspects raised in the comments to our aforementioned article which are already in our erratum the comments were mainly based on the isotope data interpretation which constitutes only about 5 of the paper we will also shed light on what we thought was perhaps misunderstood in our article graphical abstract image 1 comments we are involved in the same kind of work in the same region and have dealt with the same rock formations and climate as shown in our latest paper bam and bansah 2020 https doi org 10 1016 j apgeochem 2020 104662 we would appreciate it if the authors would clarify the following points since these are at the heart of their study objective and conclusion 1 to compare isotopic data where isotope in local precipitation data is not available the authors argue that the gmwl craig 1961 may not be representative of the local conditions in the study area hence they opted for the akiti 1986 line as the lmwl this is a sound argument except that the authors did not explain why the choice of the akiti 1986 line which was derived from precipitation samples collected along the coast near accra acheampong and hess 2000 jørgensen and banoeng yakubo 2001 which is about 750 800 km away from the southernmost sampling point sherigu fig 1 of the study area is a better decision than published data and lines e g bam and bansah 2020 dakoure 2003 in the area rainfall sources patterns and climate of the two stations i e accra and the study area are different response thank you for the comment we provided rainfall data from navrongo in our erratum this data was obtained from crp currently ongoing in the area furthermore to state emphatically that akiti data was taken for accra and does not represent the entire country is not entirely correct both bam and gibrilla were part of akiti s laboratory at the university of ghana and akiti stated emphatically that the statement by acheampong and hess 2000 and jørgensen and banoeng yakubo 2001 were not accurate and that his line represents the local meteoric water line lmwl for ghana salifu et al 2017 if bam and bansah 2022 are insisting that their paper should rather be used for lmwl for ghana we have the following questions for them bam and bansah 2020 indicated that the total number of samples were 62 from tamale navrongo and ougadougu in burkina faso and gnip database in which they were silent on the locations the questions that arise are 1 how did they obtain their meteoric water line this is because the number of rainy days in one location in a year is more than the 62 samples obtained for all these locations does it mean that they took just some few rains in all the locations to draw their meteoric water line 2 what is the size of the data at each station and what is the duration of the sampling at each station 3 how did they account for the rainfall that does not contribute to recharge in coming up with the lmwl we wish to state that the development of a local meteoric water line for ghana is still ongoing for this reason we decided to stick to the navrongo rainfall data for our study even the lmwl by akiti 1986 has been used in several hydrochemical studies in ghana far away from the greater accra region as exemplified by the works of e g salifu et al 2017 therefore the assertion of bam and bansah 2022 that the lmwl by akiti 1986 should not be used would imply that all hydrochemistry works in other parts of ghana either than accra that used the lmwl of akiti 1986 are equivocal comments 2 have the authors attempted to compare the akiti 1986 line with rainfall isotope data from published literature in the region or the study area how does this compare and why did they not rely on data from numerous published records on isotopes in rainfall found in the area response as stated earlier akiti s line is the reference for ghana in the absence of rainfall data as at the time of writing the paper we did not have access to any data on rainfall stable isotopes in the area we however got data from navrongo from an ongoing iaea sponsored research during the erratum which we begun before these comments were sent to us comments 3 contrary to the interpretation given in the paper fig 3a p 11 the data suggests that except for some few 5 groundwater isotope samples which plotted on or around the lmwl fig 2 red circle almost all the groundwater samples are evaporated relative to this lmwl clear reason why this line could not be a justified line for this area response as we stated earlier the akiti s line is for ghana so we expect some variations due to specific local conditions if this argument is correct then the global meteoric water line gmwl is meaningless if the global meteoric water line can be used in the absence of local rainfall data why can t we use akiti s ghana line even though it will also show some variations like the gmwl comments 4 a simple trend line through the groundwater data gives an equation of the line as y 5 17x 0 06 r2 0 54 and not y 3 88x 6 26 fig 3a p11 interestingly the akiti 1986 line and the gmwl all have 69 samples n 69 how did the authors come about this numbers the slope of the evaporation line 3 88 does not represent anything close to groundwater but surface water i e ponds dams wetlands which receive discharge water from either irrigation or very shallow evaporitic groundwater discharge and seasonal rainfall is this line for the samples obtained from the vea dam or any other dams in the area it would be helpful if the authors could clarify how they came by this line response thank you for the observation this is a clear error both akiti s line and the gmwl are equations we did not need the number of samples to draw the line the 69 represents the groundwater samples the slope of 3 88 actually represents the dam water not the groundwater comments 5 the authors claim of local meteoric origin of water for recharge or likely recharged from fresh local precipitation rainfall is simply because the water samples plotted on and around the gmwl and not the lmwl if the local meteoric water line akiti 1986 is representative of the local study area as the authors earlier asserted p 5 why are they not solely relying on that line for rightful interpretation of the data the purpose of the lmwl is to assist in rightful interpretation of isotopic data considering local meteorological conditions the authors admitted their reliance on the gmwl however some of the samples shifted from the gmwl and plotted in the lower slope area along the evaporation line suggesting that after precipitation the water goes through secondary evaporation indeed per the lmwl consideration all the samples except 5 are evaporated and this buttressed our point that the lmwl akiti 1986 line is redundant and at best only useful to show these samples are different from those obtained along the coastline in accra response thanks for the observation we have already indicated in the response to comment 4 that the akiti s line is still useful in the absence of local precipitation data we however used rainfall stable isotopes from navrongo in our erratum which clarifies the point raised here comments 6 could the authors explain why there is considerable isotopic variation of the groundwater are these variations comparable to regional isotopes in precipitation and groundwater data or are the variations due to the variability in depth of the wells or mechanism of recharge geology are the wells bored and capped or opened hand dug are they shallow or deep is there any correlation between depth and isotope variations response thanks for the observation yes we are also surprised with the variations of the isotopic composition of the groundwater 4 15 and 2 75 for δ18o other papers reported much higher variations 5 7 to 2 7 for δ18o bam and bansah 2020 as stated earlier this is the subject of an ongoing research all the samples were taken from functional boreholes with hand pumps with the exception of very few old wells most of the boreholes are beyond 30 m the sampling storage and analysis of the samples were carried out using the standard protocols duplicate samples were also taken and analyzed we did not observe any correlation between the depth and isotope variation depth 0 0018 δ18o 3 5037 r2 0 0107 hence not discussed in the paper the considerable isotopic variation of the groundwater samples is a subject of a current research vea catchment has a lot of dams close to some of the boreholes so it is not surprising to see enriched groundwater as observed in fig 3 the dam water has different isotopic composition with the groundwater this leads to the question what is the cause of this observation even though variation in the regional isotopic composition of rainfall could be one of the reasons we postulate that the nature of the sampling of the surface water just below the surface may be a contributing factor we refer you to a paper by gibrilla et al 2018 https doi org 10 1016 j gsd 2017 12 006 that analyzed the water levels in a monitoring well within the catchment and observed little change in the groundwater level throughout the year suggesting a potential contribution of the surface water to the groundwater you will agree with us that most of the surface water samples for isotope analysis were taken just below the surface this will definitely have a different isotopic composition to samples taken from the bottom which actually contributes to recharge for this reason we have made a follow up sampling by profiling the dam taking samples from the surface to the bottom at 0 5 m intervals to 4 m deep comments 7 zango et al 2021 noted that the f in the groundwater may be released from the aquifer materials via local meteoric recharge and to some extent evaporation p 11 how is it possible for evaporation to release f into groundwater are there industrial processors of glass steel and aluminum pesticides and fertilizers chemicals and metals copper and brass titanium superalloys etc and refractory metals for military use in the area higher concentrations of f would only mean loss of precipitation rich f water to evaporation before recharge which by the gmwl and the observations in fig 3b the waters are not response thanks for the observation we did not mean to say that evaporation can release f into groundwater but rather evaporation can lead the concentration of the f in groundwater we agree the statement was not clear the statement should have read the f in the groundwater may be released from the aquifer materials while intense evaporation can result in the concentration of the f in the groundwater comments 8 in fact about fig 3b the authors wrote that enriched isotopic composition is observed with low fluoride concentration whilst depleted isotopic composition is observed with a higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater p 11 although that is not what we see from fig 3b it only re emphasized our point that the authors cannot conclude that f is released by evaporitic rainfall before recharge response thanks for the observation there was no clear relationship between the isotopic compositions with f concentration if evaporation is the dominant factor responsible for f then we expect enriched samples should have high f while depleted samples showing low f comments 9 in fig 3b only the f concentration changed isotope variations in the two groups are the same 3 6 to 2 6 δ18o we can identify two to three groups of the f waters which should be explained by geology or well depths or proximity to industrial activities etc and not a single raw isotope plot with f have the authors considered the depth of these wells and the influence of the diverse geological formations on f release considering fig 1a response thanks for the observation yes a plot of δ18o depth and f concentrations zango et al 2021 fig 3b indicates that all the wells showed similar isotopic compositions however higher groundwater f concentrations were associated with deeper wells fig 3b this implies that dissolution of fluoride from the geology is the main process governing the fluoride concentration in the study area since dissolution does not affect the isotopic composition this explains why the isotopes have relatively constant values comments 10 how did the authors confirm evaporation of rainfall effects on f concentration noting there is wide variability in the groundwater isotopes see comment 6 how are the authors without establishing effect of evaporation in the groundwater recharge process or samples able to use only δ 18o to determine f source the authors could calculate for the d excess or lc excess and use that but their dual isotope plot relative to the gmwl already revealed there is no such pronounced effect in any sample considering that their own evaporation line plots far down the more positive groundwater samples response thanks for the observation the f concentration is mainly from the geology the discussion of d excess or lc excess is out of the scope of the paper declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11861,on behalf of all co authors of the article hydrogeochemical and isotopic controls on the source of fluoride in groundwater within the vea catchment northeastern ghana by zango et al 2021 we wish to thank bam and bansah 2022 for the interest in our paper we would like to clarify from the onset that we observed some errors in fig 3 after the publication which necessitated an erratum but before we could submit our erratum bam and bansah 2022 submitted a comment on the paper when their attention was drawn to the erratum they insisted on a response to their comments we have included below a response to some aspects raised in the comments to our aforementioned article which are already in our erratum the comments were mainly based on the isotope data interpretation which constitutes only about 5 of the paper we will also shed light on what we thought was perhaps misunderstood in our article graphical abstract image 1 comments we are involved in the same kind of work in the same region and have dealt with the same rock formations and climate as shown in our latest paper bam and bansah 2020 https doi org 10 1016 j apgeochem 2020 104662 we would appreciate it if the authors would clarify the following points since these are at the heart of their study objective and conclusion 1 to compare isotopic data where isotope in local precipitation data is not available the authors argue that the gmwl craig 1961 may not be representative of the local conditions in the study area hence they opted for the akiti 1986 line as the lmwl this is a sound argument except that the authors did not explain why the choice of the akiti 1986 line which was derived from precipitation samples collected along the coast near accra acheampong and hess 2000 jørgensen and banoeng yakubo 2001 which is about 750 800 km away from the southernmost sampling point sherigu fig 1 of the study area is a better decision than published data and lines e g bam and bansah 2020 dakoure 2003 in the area rainfall sources patterns and climate of the two stations i e accra and the study area are different response thank you for the comment we provided rainfall data from navrongo in our erratum this data was obtained from crp currently ongoing in the area furthermore to state emphatically that akiti data was taken for accra and does not represent the entire country is not entirely correct both bam and gibrilla were part of akiti s laboratory at the university of ghana and akiti stated emphatically that the statement by acheampong and hess 2000 and jørgensen and banoeng yakubo 2001 were not accurate and that his line represents the local meteoric water line lmwl for ghana salifu et al 2017 if bam and bansah 2022 are insisting that their paper should rather be used for lmwl for ghana we have the following questions for them bam and bansah 2020 indicated that the total number of samples were 62 from tamale navrongo and ougadougu in burkina faso and gnip database in which they were silent on the locations the questions that arise are 1 how did they obtain their meteoric water line this is because the number of rainy days in one location in a year is more than the 62 samples obtained for all these locations does it mean that they took just some few rains in all the locations to draw their meteoric water line 2 what is the size of the data at each station and what is the duration of the sampling at each station 3 how did they account for the rainfall that does not contribute to recharge in coming up with the lmwl we wish to state that the development of a local meteoric water line for ghana is still ongoing for this reason we decided to stick to the navrongo rainfall data for our study even the lmwl by akiti 1986 has been used in several hydrochemical studies in ghana far away from the greater accra region as exemplified by the works of e g salifu et al 2017 therefore the assertion of bam and bansah 2022 that the lmwl by akiti 1986 should not be used would imply that all hydrochemistry works in other parts of ghana either than accra that used the lmwl of akiti 1986 are equivocal comments 2 have the authors attempted to compare the akiti 1986 line with rainfall isotope data from published literature in the region or the study area how does this compare and why did they not rely on data from numerous published records on isotopes in rainfall found in the area response as stated earlier akiti s line is the reference for ghana in the absence of rainfall data as at the time of writing the paper we did not have access to any data on rainfall stable isotopes in the area we however got data from navrongo from an ongoing iaea sponsored research during the erratum which we begun before these comments were sent to us comments 3 contrary to the interpretation given in the paper fig 3a p 11 the data suggests that except for some few 5 groundwater isotope samples which plotted on or around the lmwl fig 2 red circle almost all the groundwater samples are evaporated relative to this lmwl clear reason why this line could not be a justified line for this area response as we stated earlier the akiti s line is for ghana so we expect some variations due to specific local conditions if this argument is correct then the global meteoric water line gmwl is meaningless if the global meteoric water line can be used in the absence of local rainfall data why can t we use akiti s ghana line even though it will also show some variations like the gmwl comments 4 a simple trend line through the groundwater data gives an equation of the line as y 5 17x 0 06 r2 0 54 and not y 3 88x 6 26 fig 3a p11 interestingly the akiti 1986 line and the gmwl all have 69 samples n 69 how did the authors come about this numbers the slope of the evaporation line 3 88 does not represent anything close to groundwater but surface water i e ponds dams wetlands which receive discharge water from either irrigation or very shallow evaporitic groundwater discharge and seasonal rainfall is this line for the samples obtained from the vea dam or any other dams in the area it would be helpful if the authors could clarify how they came by this line response thank you for the observation this is a clear error both akiti s line and the gmwl are equations we did not need the number of samples to draw the line the 69 represents the groundwater samples the slope of 3 88 actually represents the dam water not the groundwater comments 5 the authors claim of local meteoric origin of water for recharge or likely recharged from fresh local precipitation rainfall is simply because the water samples plotted on and around the gmwl and not the lmwl if the local meteoric water line akiti 1986 is representative of the local study area as the authors earlier asserted p 5 why are they not solely relying on that line for rightful interpretation of the data the purpose of the lmwl is to assist in rightful interpretation of isotopic data considering local meteorological

areas with similar prevailing challenges graphical abstract image 1 keywords protecting and sustaining water resources approaches and recommendations sustainable water cecs review 1 introduction in few years ahead water stress will increase astronomically following the intensive exploitation and the pollution of global freshwater resources lópez zavala et al 2016 despite its abundance on earth a greater portion is inaccessible while the portion accessible is unequally distributed the earth s surface is composed of about 70 water however only about 2 5 of this is fresh water and less than 1 is available for human use and consumption baker et al 2016 ghana is endowed with an abundance of water resources the availability and utilization of consumptive and non consumptive purposes of water sources are under optimal levels owusu et al 2016 yeleliere et al 2018 protection of the world s water resources become important following the destruction of the environment in the early industrial era abanyie et al 2019 diagboya et al 2020 in ghana several anthropogenic activities coupled with rapid population growth have led to an increase in the pollution of water resources both surface and groundwater yeleliere et al 2018 bekoe et al 2021 douti et al 2021 amuah et al 2021 anthropogenic activities have contributed immensely to the pollution contamination of water resources unsustainable agricultural practices the excessive and untimely application of fertilizers and synthetic pesticides has led to chemical pollution of surface and groundwater resources through leaching and runoff from agricultural fields gyau boakye and biney 2002 stagnari et al 2016 the continuous farming of agricultural fields and the unregulated application of agrochemicals have also increased the vulnerability of these fields to erosion greatly increasing the turbidity of surface waters also improper waste management such as littering and the dumping of refuse in drains have led to the washing of waste into surface waters following the occurrence of rain besides the discharge of untreated effluent from industries as well as wastewater and sewage from households has resulted in chemical and microbial pollution of these water resources gyau boakye and biney 2002 the practice of quarrying has also led to the generation of sand and silt increasing the turbidity of surface waters this has also resulted in heavy metal pollution of ground and surface water resources through the increased activity of weathering dissolving minerals and elements locked up in these rocks sunkari et al 2019 spillage of oil and chemicals from car repair shops has also reduced the quality of water resources and adversely affected the biodiversity in this environmental medium united states environmental

results and discussion 3 1 summary of the major sources of water pollution in ghana 3 1 1 waste and chemical pollution in ghana indiscriminate disposal of waste from both households and industrial sources into waterbodies is a common practice and a major source of water pollution as indicated by the findings of owusu et al 2016 increased amounts of these organic waste and industrial pollutants endangers not only the quality but also the sustainability of water resources karr and chu 2000 several experts have linked rising seasonal floods in main cities to improper waste management practices in the country such as dumping waste into waterbodies mensah and ahadzie 2020 runoffs also convey large amounts of untreated industrial waste dumped into open sewers into lagoons and other surface waterbodies causing significant pollution and disturbing the natural ecosystem of these waterbodies owusu boadi and kuitunen 2002 owusu et al 2016 yeleliere et al 2018 these pollutants could further leach into groundwater systems since brunner et al 2010 and tian et al 2015 have indicated that surface and groundwater are connected and interact 3 1 2 climate change and conditions climate change poses negative impacts on water quality and supplies kumar 2012 nakuja et al 2012 dankwa et al 2021 warmer drier conditions for example affect the mineralization of dangerous heavy metals that percolate into groundwater sources murdoch et al 2000 also high water temperatures contribute to eutrophication and excess algal growth which reduce water quality aladejana et al 2020 found that groundwater quality of the shallow coastal aquifer of eastern dahomey basin in southwestern nigeria were highly influenced by climatic conditions studies by anayah and kaluarachchi 2009 and resource centre network ghana 2021 have affirmed these findings in ghana groundwater quality can be influenced by weather circumstances such as high intensity rain or drought and pathogens can spread to locations where they are not naturally present lutz et al 2016 abanyie et al 2016 also found that in the bolgatanga municipality turbidity total and fecal coliforms total hardness and ph of groundwater samples rose during the rainy season compared to the dry season 3 1 3 mining activities illegal mining galamsey is known to pollute the environment significantly the chemicals used and the trash heaps are long term contaminants of both soil and water bodies kuffour et al 2018 kazapoe et al 2021 the operations of the small scale mining industry of gold are been established as the second largest source of pollution after agriculture in africa kessey and arko 2013 and in ghana and while causing more deaths each day also led to higher cost of water treatment with subsequent implication on the cost of water consumption because of the high amount of water required to wash the gold illegal miners frequently labor near water sources kuffour et al 2018 as tailings are thrown straight into rivers without treatment this results in significant debris contamination of streams and rivers kessey and arko 2013 it not only changes the aesthetics of the river stream but water also changes the physicochemical and biological properties making it unfit for human use studies including smedley et al 1996 kortatsi et al 2008 armah et al 2010 ato et al 2010 dorleku et al 2018 duncan 2020 obiri yeboah et al 2021 and karikari et al 2021 have reported surface and groundwater pollution in ghana emanating from mining activities to curb the menace of mining activities on water quality it is suggested that regulations covering mining in ghana are properly enforced and water quality assessments are done regularly in mining areas 3 1 4 soil chemistry and geological formation natural and geological factors could also influence surface and groundwater resources porous soils purify groundwater better than non porous soils this is due to some soilcharacteristics and properties such as soil particle size and thickness chemical contents chemical constituents water percolation and saturation rates national research council 1994 pesticides leak into groundwater through porous soils and could pose serious health impacts through groundwater consumption and contact gupta and yadav 2018 the occurrence of significant cations in groundwater sources in the bawku east municipality and the atankwidi basin in north east ghana according to anim gyampo et al 2018 is mostly due to the interaction of rock materials and water also anku et al 2009 attributed low ph levels in groundwater primarily to natural biogeochemical processes co2 generation in the soil zone through root respiration and the effect from leaching of organic acids from the decay of organic matter in the eastern corridor of northern ghana the predominant processes controlling the groundwater chemistry were attributed to mineral dissolution reactions ion exchange processes and evapotranspiration processes salifu et al 2012 high f levels in the groundwater resources in the bongo area have largely related to intense dissolution of the bongo granitoids which contain biotite and muscovite as the dominant fluoride bearing minerals and the sufficient groundwater rock interaction since the water samples are mainly sourced from deeper boreholes sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 loh et al 2020 posited that silicate mineral dissolution and the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters are the main controls on groundwater hydrochemistry also in the talensi district of northern ghana chegbeleh et al 2020 stated silicate and carbonate mineral weathering as the main controls on groundwater chemistry in the district these findings show that geo natural factors such as soil chemistry and geological properties also significantly influence water quality 3 1 5 proliferation of water weeds water pollution is a global issue and aquatic plants weeds have wreaked havoc in water resources globally aquatic weeds are plants that grow in waterbodies or in wet land which are mostly not desired owusu et al 2016 they grow in profusion and usually occur along the shores or within surface water systems like dams lakes and rivers natural aquatic plant populations are beneficial to any aquatic ecosystem to some extent because they provide fish food aid in nutrient cycling purify the water reduce undesired algae growth and provide habitat for wildlife such as birds however unwanted proliferation of aquatic weeds especially water hyacinth and salvinia have several implications such as increasing cost of treating and suppling urban water mathur and mathur 2006 the menace of water weeds is reaching worrying extents in many parts of the world particularly in tropical waterbodies where they have led to ecological economic losses and the challenge of managing water resources efficiently and ghana is no exception aloo et al 2013 the presence of aquatic weeds in surface water have been reported by paperna 1969 in the volta lake in ghana after four 4 years of its construction a similar study by odei 1987 also discussed the presence and menace of aquatic weeds in the volta lake estuary at ada in ghana the most affected area is the tano abby ehy lagoon complex as well as along 25 km of the river from the convergence of the tano river with the lagoon complex which poses a threat to the aquatic life the quality of the water and the management of the water body for the authorities wrc 2015 though the impacts of water weeds on water quality has not been studied extensively in ghana studies done have reported deleterious impacts on water resources 3 1 6 poor sanitation han et al 2016 and zeng et al 2021 described groundwater systems around sanitary landfills as highly contaminated due to the seepage of leachate from the landfill sites landfills and solid waste sw management is a challenging problem that is likely to be the source of contaminants to groundwater sources within the bolgatanga municipality of ghana akurugu 2018 owusu 2010 avers that in the major cities of ghana many household toilets and even public toilet facilities are most often redirected into drains which are in turn washed into waterbodies during downpours lutterodt et al 2018 mentioned poor sanitation around boreholes as one of the predominant factors affecting groundwater quality in ghana an assessment of heavy metal levels in groundwater sources around the oti landfill site in kumasi by boateng et al 2019 reported above threshold levels of pb cd cr and fe similar to these findings kanmani and gandhimathi 2013 and podlasek et al 2021 indicated that groundwater sources around a landfill in ariyamangalam india and poland and the czech republic were critically contaminated with hms in a study by obiri danso et al 2009 improper siting of wells and boreholes near latrines and dumpsites significantly affected groundwater quality issahaku et al 2017 reported that open defecation is a source of microbial contaminants in groundwater sources in the kassena nankana municipality 3 1 7 poor agricultural practices due to seasonality and its effects on rainfall most farmers prefer to farm close to waterbodies and hence it is very common to locate farmlands very close to these waterbodies in ghana douti et al 2021 for instance studies by fianko et al 2009 and sunkari et al 2019 in ghana papazotos et al 2019 in psachna basin greece and mukate et al 2018 2020 in solapur india have reported that agricultural activities pose debilitating impacts on groundwater quality similarly obiri danso et al 2011 asare donkor et al 2018 and miyittah et al 2020 have indicated similar results in agogo the birim river basin and aby lagoon system in ghana farmers draw water from these waterbodies for irrigation purposes as well as the application of pesticides and other chemicals to boost production through these farm practices chemicals are leached into these waterbodies and hence affect the quality of surface water systemsand increase the cost of water treatment fao 2018 reported that in 2015 an estimated 4 1 million tons of global usage of pesticides however this is expected to reach 9 8 billion tons in 2050 maggi et al 2019 fianko et al 2011 indicated that between 2002 and 2006 the amount of pesticide imported into ghana geometrically rose from 7763 metric tons to 27 886 metric tons and more than 87 of farmers use pesticides botwe et al 2012 identified elevated concentrations of pesticide residues of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 1 1 1 trichloro 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl ethane ddt and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde in groundwater sources in the offinso district of ghana nitrogen n from manures and inorganic fertilizers has been discussed as a concern with regards to groundwater pollution particularly no3 due to its high solubility nitrate salts capacity can potentially impact health through drinking water who 2006 oyelude et al 2013 identified the presence of nitrates in groundwater sources in the knma which were observed to have emanated from fertilizer application on farmlands kortatsi 2007 in the wassa west district and quansah and amankwah 2011 in the tarkwa nsuaem municipality and prestea huni valley areas reported average no3 concentration levels of 61 0 mg l and 59 0 mg l in groundwater in koon green and brenu akyim respectively 3 2 emerging contaminants in water resources in ghana 3 2 1 antibiotics the concentration of antibiotics in water resources has been less studied in ghana however azanu et al 2018 studied antibiotic levels in water and effluent from hospitals in the kumasi area twelve 12 different antibiotics including amoxicillin oxytetracycline doxycycline ampicillin ciprofloxacin metronidazole chlorotetracycline sulfamethoxazole erythromycin cefuroxime tetracycline and trimethoprim were considered the study reported that the highest concentration of antibiotic in the surface water sources was sulfamethoxazole 2861 ng l followed by ciprofloxacin and erythromycin the study further showed that amoxicillin had the lowest maximum concentration 2 7 ng l the measure of antibiotics was extremely above the antimicrobial resistance threshold of 0 1 ng l stated by gullberg et al 2011 this suggest that consuming water from these surface water sources could result in sub mic doses which can cause antibiotic resistance in the human gut though these water sources had high loads of antibiotics they were used for irrigation thus azanu et al 2018 revealed that five sulfamethoxazole cefuroxime ciprofloxacin metronidazole and erythromycin and two trimethoprim and ampicillin antibiotics were identified in lettuce sampled from markets and farms respectively though several studies including ma et al 2015 balzer et al 2016 yao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 kairigo et al 2020 li et al 2020 and zainab et al 2021 have reported the presence of antibiotics in surface and groundwater sources in other parts of the world in ghana this has been given less research attention based on this it is recommended that further studies are done to assess the levels of antibiotics in surface and groundwater sources especially those close to hospitals and pharmaceutical companies it is also essential to understand the antibiotic composition of treated water distributed for public use 3 2 2 microplastics in the akora river central region of ghana adu boahen et al 2020 reported a total of 286 microplastics within an area of 85 m3 though this is significantly lower than reported levels by zhao et al 2014 and wang et al 2016 in china lechner et al 2014 in australia naidoo et al 2015 in kwazulu natal south africa and sadri and thompson 2014 where 10 200 and 1591 141 0 2 48 and a mean of 0 028 items were recorded per m3 this has the potential to pose deleterious impacts on public health and aquatic lives a study by gbogbo et al 2020 also mentioned that the microplastic level is observed in the coastal wetland of sakumo ii lagoon was 0 13 ml 1 and 0 09 ml 1 before and after staining respectively though studies have been done in ghana these have focused on chico ortiz et al 2020 and adika et al 2020 in lagoon sediments and pelagic and demersal fish species there is a general lack of studies on microplastics in water resources in ghana due to the astronomic use of face masks in combating the spread of the covid 19 pandemic and poor solid waste management in the country it is proposed that extensive studies are done to assess the levels of plastics nano and micro plastics in water resources and their associated implications 3 2 3 perfluoroalkyl acids pfas essumang et al 2017 reported high levels of pfas in the kakum and pra river basins and tap water this study presents the first recorded case of perfluoroalkyl acids in surface and treated water in ghana the findings of the study were a mean level of the total pfas at the pra and kakum basins were 398 ng l and 281 ng l while tap water from these two areas were 200 ng l and 197 ng l respectively the study further indicated that the total pfas was 99 composed of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic pfao the risk quotient for both pfas were pfos 1 74 and pfao 1 01 due to the ability of pfas to bioaccumulate in soil air food and water it is a great concern since pfas contribute to decreased fertility liver dysfunction cancer thyroid diseases and hormone suppression kounang 2019 the agency for toxic substances and disease registry 2020 also indicated that exposure to high levels of pfas can increase cholesterol levels alter liver enzymes decrease vaccine response in children increase the risk of high blood pressure and pre eclampsia in pregnant women and increase the risk of testicular and kidney cancer it is recommended that pfas are bio monitored especially in ground and water resources within industrial areas 3 3 key players in water resources management in ghana and their mandates ghana has several public institutions tasked with the sustainable management of the water resources in the country warm 1998 banoeng yakubo 2017 these include the water resources commission wrc ghana water company limited gwcl water research institute of the council for scientific and industrial research csir wri irrigation development authority ida environmental protection agency epa meteorological services department msd hydrological division of the ministry of works and housing and the public utility regulatory commission purc ministry of works and housing 1998 kankam yeboah et al 2004 wrm institutions in ghana are categorized into organizations involved in water resources data collection and processing use and development of water resources water related regulatory activities and civic society and ngos this section seeks to spell out the mandates of these water resources governing institutions in the country the water resources commission wrc as a water resources governing institution has the right to integrate water resources management at the national level parliament of ghana 1996 this role includes granting water rights rationalizing coordinating and directing the activities of all water related institutions as well as the development of water related policies under the mandate to develop water related policies of the wrc the institution hasdeveloped a ghana water policy with the objective to promote an efficient management system and environmentally sound development of all water resources in ghana in line with the main focus of the wrc to effectively manage the water resources of ghana a water resources management fund wrmf has been set up and would be disbursed for projects and activities that address research activities development of efficient water resources database co operation with other riparian countries assistance where possible to specific projects initiated by communities watershed protection and specific projects of concern to water resources utilization also the council for scientific and industrial research csir among its functions is to encourage coordinated employment of scientific research for the management utilization and conservation of the natural resources of ghana in the interest of development within this framework the csir water research institute wri conducts research on the country s water resources to provide scientific and technological information and services for socio economic development the present ghana water company limited gwcl formerly known as the ghana water and sewerage corporation gwsc which was set up in 1965 parliament of ghana 1965 is the national agency responsible for domestic and industrial water and sewerage management in both urban and rural areas the community water and sanitation division cwsd formed in 1994 concentrates on accelerating water and sanitation delivery in the rural areas the cwsd advocates community ownership and community management approach in the irrigation sector the ghana irrigation development authority set up in 1985 under the supreme military council decree smcd 85 1977 is responsible for the management of irrigation schemes which includes advisory roles on technical aspects to farmers the environmental protection council was set up in 1974 national redemption council decree nrcd 239 1974 and has been transformed into an environmental protection agency with executive powers to deal with environmental issues odame ababio 2003 kankam yeboah et al 2004 the agency now demands the preparation presentation and approval of environmental impact assessment statements for developmental projects prior to their implementation in any part of ghana the epa contributes to wrm in ghana by tackling human activities close to waterbodies and those that pose possible implications water resources it does periodic monitoring to ensure that the quality of surface and groundwater resources are not compromised the meteorological services department and the hydrological services division of the ministry of works and housing respectively provide hydrometeorological and hydrometric data to support the sustainable management of water resources and the environment pooled roles of these institutions aid in the conservation of ghana s water resources in addition to the above mentioned public institutions several local and international non governmental organizations such as friends of rivers and water bodies ghana dams dialogue earth service gofa wateraid usaid weija lake protection association irc and ghana country water partnership are involved in various water related activities in ghana banoeng yakubo 2017 obuobie et al 2018 3 4 statutory laws and policies for wrm in ghana commons and unconstitutional laws for the protection of water resources have existed in ghana however the establishment of the 1992 constitution formalized the creation and implementation of legislative instruments albeit these laws did not provide any institutional framework for water resource regulations other related policies covering fisheries forestry and land served as foundations for the establishment of minerals fisheries and lands commissions however the water resources sector was improved by the initiatives implemented by these commission in 1996 the water resources commission act 522 established the water resources commission specifically for proper management of ghana s water resources the act is the main instrument that directs water use and its management in ghana parliament of ghana 1996 yeleliere et al 2018 to effectively manage water resources the following are major acts laws and policies that have been ratified and implemented rivers ordinance cap 226 1903 post independence common laws act 46 of 1961 act 310 of 1965 nlcd 293 of 1969 nrcd 239 of 1974 smcd 85 of 1977 act 490 of 1994 ghana water company limited act 461 1993 local government act 462 1993 water resource commission act 522 1996 community water and sanitation agency act 564 1998 water use regulation li 1692 2001 local government service act 656 2003 drilling license and groundwater regulation li 1827 2006 national water policy 2007 riparian buffer zone policy 2011 dam safety regulation li 2236 2016 ministry of sanitation and water resources medium term expenditure framework mtef for 2017 2019 2017 3 5 approaches to protecting and sustaining water resources in ghana and beyond the availability and accessibility of fresh water are becoming a global concern ghana s water vision for 2025 has the main objective to promote an efficient and effective management system and environmentally sound development of all water resources in ghana national water policy nwp 2007 similarly the ministry of sanitation and water resources under the medium term expenditure framework mtef for 2017 2019 2017 it is stated that to enhance wrm in ghana it is essential to support the creative and innovative research in the production and use of improved technologies and approaches for effective provision of water therefore water resources management wrm is essential for protecting water resources from pollution overexploitation and the development of water systems for future use wrm is also important in playing a key role in sustaining water resources for irrigation purposes to combat food insecurity tackling flood issues addressing complex issues on water availability accessibility ownership distribution and usability and reducing water related diseases it also reduces freshwater stress it is critical for the country to have a holistic strategy to water resource management and development in order to attain the aforementioned goal and adapt to current priorities this section seeks to present measures by which water resources may be protected and preserved for public health protection and ecological management purposes 3 5 1 environmental recommendations 3 5 1 1 ensuring proper disposal of chemicals and toxin bearing materials maintaining water quality and access to freshwater are major global challenges a report by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 2019 indicated that about 400 megatons of industrial waste are discharged into waterbodies these effluents are usually discharged without proper treatment to ensure that the qualities of the natural water systems are maintained therefore debilitating implications manifest studies including nartey et al 2012 huang et al 2014 appiah adjei et al 2016 egbi et al 2017 akortia et al 2021 and douti et al 2021 have reported the debilitating impacts posed by the indiscriminate disposal of various forms of waste such as solid waste e waste waste from oil and metal works leachates from dump sites radioactive waste and animal dung into surface and groundwater resources thus the nwp 2007 states that preventing pollution of water sources through indiscriminate discharge of wastes solid liquid from domestic commercial and industrial mining activities will be paramount in protecting water resources in ghana it should be ensured that waste materials liquid and solid fig 2 that can contaminate pollute water systems are disposed of properly waste in the form of hazardous and organic pollutants such as mining medical pharmaceutical and agricultural wastes industrial wastewater spoilt batteries oils and e waste should be managed and disposed of properly using enhanced methods instead of disposing them into waterbodies or directly into the environment which eventually exposes toxic elements and heavy metals into surface water via runoff or leach into groundwater systems ghana has been battling the effects of illegal small scale on some major natural water resources attiogbe and nkansah 2017 for instance nyarko 2001 and essumang et al 2007 respectively reported levels of as and hg and cr reaching 12 200 μgl 1 and 6251 μgl 1 and 45 μgl 1 in water resources in the konongo old mining shaft and wassa west district resulting from mining activities in the anloga community of the volta region of ghana akoto et al 2019 reported high levels of chloride cadmium nitrate and lead in some wells in a review study yeleliere et al 2018 indicated that the improper disposal of waste fig 2 results in the infiltration of toxic chemicals into groundwater sources the study further indicated that the pra mamang ankobra and densu rivers in ghana have been significantly polluted following the discharge and deposition of industrial and agricultural waste into these rivers the overall pressure of agriculture on water quality in rivers lakes groundwater and coastal waters has eased since the early 1990s due to the decline in nutrient surpluses and pesticide use for most economic co operation and development oecd member countries parris 2011 a rise in salinity due to the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has contributed to water contamination mateo sagasta et al 2017 van der werf 1996 mentioned that about 2 5 million tons of pesticides are used in the agricultural sector annually gupta and yadav 2018 also indicated that pesticides leach into groundwater through deep percolation into porous soils and pose severe health risks through groundwater consumption this suggests that the possible impacts of fertilizers and pesticides on groundwater are enormous pelig ba 2011 revealed concentrations of pesticides including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt benzene hexachloride bhc and heptachlor epoxide in above threshold levels in both surface and groundwater sources in a study in the tono catchment of the upper east region of ghana similarly kuranchie mensah et al 2012 detected gamma hexachlorocyclohexane hch delta hexachlorocyclohexane δ hch heptachlor c10h5cl7 aldrin c12h8cl6 and dieldrin c12h8cl6o in water sources in weija and nsawam affum et al 2018 in the ankrobra basin of ghana identified pesticides including p p dde p p ddt methoxychlor p p ddd endrin dieldrin allethrin methamidophos permethrin pirimiphos methyl malathion l cyhalothrin chlorpyrifos fenitrothion fenpropathrin cypermethrin ethoprophos deltamethrin β hexachlorocyclohexane and cyfluthrin in both ground and surface water sources the study further showed that the concentrations of individual banned pesticides in the surface water and groundwater samples respectively fell between lod and 0 110 μg l avg 0 018 0 019 μg l and lod and 0 055 μg l 0 014 0 011 μg l respectively meanwhile concentrations of non banned pesticides were between lod and 0 925 μg l 0 117 0 186 μg l and lod and 2 μg l 0 140 0 350 μg l nakuja et al 2012 and kwoyiga and stefan 2018 in the northeastern part of ghana suggested that farmers should be encouraged to rely on rain fed farming during the rainy period to preserve surface and groundwater for dry season farming generally human induced activities that have direct or indirect and minor or major negative impacts on water systems should be discouraged also effective irrigation schemes and the creation of protection zones along watercourses and in buffer zones between farms and waterbodies can significantly reduce water return flow runoff and deposition of agrochemicals into surface water systems the implementation of the aforementioned recommendations may limit the demands on water sources and sustain quality and quantity them for other essential purposes 3 5 1 2 improve waste management poor management of waste including industrial municipal and healthcare has debilitating implications on both groundwater and surface water resources kumar et al 2020 ashfaq et al 2019 a review of waste management in major towns across ghana by miezah et al 2015 showed that waste management in the country is generally poor fig 3 leachates and runoff from landfills have been observed to contaminate surface and groundwater systems samadder et al 2017 mishra et al 2019 sackey et al 2020 to prevent the seepage of runoff of leachates from dumpsites and landfills into groundwater and surface water systems waste disposal sites must be sited far from residential areas and it should be ensured that they are properly engineered and managed in preventing runoff and or seepage of leachates from dumpsites and landfills into groundwater and surface water systems waste disposal sites must be properly engineered and managed as well as sited far from residential areas solid waste ought to be disposed of properly away from waterbodies since the deposition of solid waste into surface water systems could pose detrimental effects on the ecosystem and consumers of the water and the aquatic lives similarly owusu 2010 avers that in the major cities of ghana many household toilets and even public toilet facilities are mostly redirected into drains which are in turn washed into waterbodies this contributes immensely to the fecal contamination of water resources jeong 2001 also indicated that industrial effluents and dissolution of concrete walls of septic tanks exposed major ions such as nitrate na calcium ca2 phosphorus po4 2 and magnesium mg2 to groundwater within the area proper engineering approaches and assessments ought to be adopted before siting boreholes wells and septic tanks to prevent the possible seepage of fecal materials into groundwater systems similarly open defecation must be discouraged since fecal materials are deposited into surface waterbodies through runoff collins et al 2007 it is recommended that municipal solid and liquid wastes and radioactive infectious industrial and agricultural wastes be disposed of appropriately to avoid present and future debilitating effects on the natural ecosystem and public health to protect water resources from contamination resulting from waste governments must invest in constructing and managing well engineered landfills 3 5 1 3 avoid encroaching water bodies catchments the creation of new infrastructure and the expansion of existing ones to accommodate the growing population threaten water resources and the roles they play international federation of surveyors 2010 the water resources commission of ghana has set a 300 m buffer zones for surface waterbodies this prohibits physical development within these zones water resources commission 2008 however aabeyir and aduah 2014 revealed that this regulation has been violated nationwide fig 4 to protect waterbodies it is prudent to prevent encroachment into waterways as cities towns expand urban sprawls encroach into waterways due to pressure for land for development purposes the influx of people from rural areas into urban areas and increasing demand for freshwater giridhar and anirudh 2014 this increases contamination levels decreases water volumes and qualities and the drying up of surface waterbodies regulations proper planning and monitoring and public sensitization must be employed to prevent people from encroaching into water zones it is also important to site water sources especially boreholes and wells distant from pollution sources highly polluted areas usually coincide with densely populated and urbanized areas where most infrastructure and industrial production plants are located and therefore need to be given primary attention when implementing measures on reducing water pollution nazarov et al 2004 to prevent contamination of ground and surface water resources especially for consumptive purposes it is required to site boreholes wells tap water from areas including industries septic tanks and open defecation areas and farmlands that have obvious effects on water resources van der wal 2010 bruni and spuhler 2020 also groundwater drawing points must be sited above seasonal flood levels this will ensure perennial availability of water for consumptive and non consumptive purposes and significantly reduce physical chemical and microbial contamination of groundwater resources collins 2000 van der wal 2010 3 5 1 4 enhancing afforestation kim et al 2017 posit that afforestation is an effective approach to enhance and reestablish environmental functions and ecosystems afforestation has therefore been argued by several studies including lima et al 2012 and kim et al 2017 as a return investment for water conservation fig 5 afforestation aids in water flow reduction and the average loss of stream flow due to afforestation of grasslands and scrublands have been estimated to be one third to three quarters as a result of increasing canopy cover and forest floor interception putuhena and cordery 2000 farley et al 2005 similarly tree canopy cover enhances water quality can avert erosion and shallow land sliding especially by reducing surface runoffs which are eventually deposited in surface water bodies sidle et al 2006 calder 2007 afforestation improves water quality by limiting agrochemical nutrient and erosion runoff from farmlands into waterbodies pattanayak et al 2005 also ellis et al 2006 revealed that tree belts have been used in the interception and absorption of surface runoff before they are deposited into streams similarly hansen et al 2007 described afforestation as an effective way of reducingleaching of nitrate into groundwater systems and improving the quality of water leaving the root zone aragão 2012 also showed that improving vegetation cover reduces surface runoff maintains the hydrological cycle and balances precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 5 formulating and implementing national and local afforestation programs will therefore greatly improve water conservation and quality 3 5 2 instructional and legislative interventions 3 5 2 1 strengthening wrm institutions and promoting programs towards water resources protection the nwp 2007 states that to improve wrm in ghana there is the need to support the development of skills related to various water management functions at all levels adequately empower and equip water management institutions and das with appropriate tools and sustainable resources to effectively undertake their functions though anokye and gupta 2012 discussed that to enhance wrm institutions mandated to manage water resources must be well equipped protecting water resources also requires coordination among sector institutions which include the environmental protection agency ghana ministry of water resources works and housing water research institute ghana water company limited forestry commission hydrological service department meteorological services department volta river authority irrigation development authority and the ministry of local government and rural development coordination among these institutions will prevent overlapping of responsibilities and strategies as well as the development of policies with greater coherence to ensure the achievement of a sustainable environment and the effective utilization of both financial and human resources adank et al 2011 darling and hamilton 2002 revealed that another way to improve the habit of water conservation is employing incentives and cost sharing approaches aimed at promoting the adoption and retrofitting of preferred water saving technologies such as the use of water regulators in showerheads automation of handwashing facilities and washing basins among others which will greatly reduce water consumed thereby reducing the rate of withdrawing water from the various water sources dupont 2010 indicated that in canada cost sharing incentive programs where farmers are reimbursed for portions of their expenses in the adoption of best practices for protecting water resources have been very successful in sustaining and protecting water resources these approaches can be adopted by appreciating the efforts made by individuals institutions industries communities and households to sustaining water resources this will further motivate others to be conscious of wrm water related programs such as integrated water resources management iwrm and ensuring its completion and compliance have been successful in water conservation and protection united nations 2015 revealed that the iwrm approach has been widely accepted internationally as the way forward for efficient equitable and sustainable development and management of the world s limited water resources and for coping with conflicting demands mardiste et al 2014 described it as a cost effective and practicable tool in water resources management globally the adoption of iwrm is essential in protecting water resources since it addresses and satisfies basic human and ecosystem requirements for water resources the management and protection of river basins and drives the need for local national and international actions and sustainable water use programs radosevich 2003 kasbohm et al 2009 3 5 2 2 formulating enforcing and strengthening water related legislations the formulation and implementation of legislative structures have been useful tools in the protection of water resources for instance dating to the 1990s ghana has used several statutes in managing water systems however these statutes were not comprehensive and general nwp 2007 therefore the nwp was formulated and implemented in 2007 by the ministry of water resources works and housing to ensure the efficient management of water resources within the country it also ensures the effective interaction amongst key personalities and stakeholder institutions by integrating their respective activities and enhances urban water distribution as indicated by laryea 1994 and nyarko 2004 as challenges in the water sector following these reforms there are still some persisting challenges such as building in waterways late response to pipe leakages disposal of waste into or near waterbodies systems and mining activities along surface waterbodies that require strengthening and efficient implementation of the water policy a few years ago ghana battled the effects of illegal small scale mining on its water resources however interventions by key stakeholders and institutions and a ban on illegal small scale mining have led to the improvement in the quality of major rivers that suffered pollution larnyoh 2019 stated that the ministry of sanitation and water resources reported improvement in the quality of major rivers that suffered pollution as turbidity levels in the rivers pra ankobra and birim which were 3822 nephelometric turbidity units ntu 553 ntu and 1805 ntu have respectively declined to 261 ntu 217 ntu and 883 ntu also nyabor 2017 and ashong 2019 reported significant improvement in the physical characteristics of the birim and ankrobra rivers hajkowicz and collins 2007 in a multi criteria analysis for water resource planning and owusu et al 2016 in a review of ghana s water resources also reiterated the importance of legislation and water policy as essential tools for protecting water resources in ghana there are several policies and regulations on conserving water resources but these regulations may be purposeless if there is no political will to implement and enforce them for instance in ghana the national water policy promotes the sustainable utilization of water resources government of ghana gog 2007 the national land policy abhors farm practices close to water bodies ministry of lands and forestry 1999 the environmental sanitation policy also regulates the disposal of waste in water bodies however water resources are still under human induced pollution because successive governments lack the maximum political will to strictly enforce these regulations there is therefore the need for political will to enforce regulations in the country as purported by akumiah 2007 as posited by ajulor 2018 africa has no problem with policy plan or formulation other than the challenge of policy implementation with the right institutions in place and a strong political backing there would not be the need to enact other new policies as these existing policies and regulations will be very useful in conserving water resources in the country 3 5 3 social and household interventions 3 5 3 1 attitudinal change preventing wastage and contamination of water the nwp 2007 recommends that water is viewed as a finite and vulnerable resource the policy further states that in protecting water resources it is essential to promote partnerships between the public and private sectors for the protection and conservation of water resources through the use of cleaner and efficient technologies effective waste management and sound land management and agricultural practices thus individual institutional community and household management of water that have negative implications on the quality and quantity of freshwater ought to be reformed deliberate actions that promote wastage of water fig 6 especially for domestic purposes must be curtailed it is essential to ensure that leaking pipes and spoilt pipelines are reported and repaired with a sense of urgency furthermore to manage water properly taps must be turned off when not in use run full loads of dishes and laundry at a time take short showers install water saving showerheads flow restrictions kumari and singh 2017 smith et al 1989 and bhunia and ghosh 2011 revealed that broken pipelines could contribute to water contamination and the spread of waterborne diseases it must be acknowledged that water is a finite resource therefore conscious actions must be put in place to prevent eliminate or manage water wastage and institutional personal community and household based activities that contribute to water wastage to achieve this education and sensitization of the public on water resource conservation and protection are required with minimal adherence of the public to water regulation education and training of the public on the importance and preservation of water resources will sensitize the public equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills needed for the preservation of water resources and the adherence to regulations yeleliere et al 2018 darling and hamilton 2002 proposed the use of public education as a means of conserving water resources through conservation programs as almost all water conservation efforts to a larger extent depend on public awareness the public ought to understand the need for water resources conservation moglia et al 2018 averred that the most important driver for the conservation of water is for households to adopt water efficient practices that are made known through public education the nwp 2007 states that it is essential to promote and encourage water use efficiency techniques in agriculture and reduce transmission losses of water in irrigation systems educating farmers particularly will enable the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices such as erosion mitigation measures wastewater reuse and environmentally friendly approaches in the application of fertilizers preserving water resources in preserving the limited amount of freshwater available for man s health and wellbeing it is important to also promote reusing and recycling wastewater increasing population intensive agriculture urbanization and industrialization have placed high demand for freshwater therefore to preserve the available and accessible surface and groundwater sources it is important to reuse greywater for other purposes for instance treated wastewater can be used for ferti irrigation and greywater from washings and bathtubs for watering gardens washing cars or paths help in saving fresh water instead of extracting and disposing of fresh water always wastewater from industrial and domestic activities that are within permissible limits could be used for irrigation purposes flushing toilets construction dust control and washing cars and bikes this reduces the demands and stress on freshwater for other essential purposes lópez zavala et al 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2020 3 5 4 financial 3 5 4 1 allocation of adequate financial resources into water resource management the nwp 2007 aims at meeting the social needs for water as a priority while recognizing the economic value of water and the goods and services it provides the nwp 2007 further indicates that one of the key challenges of wrm in ghana is ensuring water resources management is adequately funded and appropriate levies instituted for raw water abstraction to promote efficiency sustainability and equity the policy aims to ensure that adequate funds are available for the development of the water sector to achieve the goal of making water available for all however the findings of rees et al 2008 and lindgaard jørgensen et al 2012 have shown that limited financial resources allocated to water resources have resulted in the non compliance of the public and institutions to water resources regulations inadequate provision of infrastructure and lack of expertise the allocation of adequate resources will thus enable the provision of the necessary infrastructure and capacity building to enhance the expertise of workers for effective supervision and coordination of regulations eshun and okyere 2017 tuokuu et al 2018 this will improve effective monitoring programs including water and ecological quality monitoring and evaluation to ensure compliance with laid down regulations and laws as well as the identification of gaps in planning and programming of implemented policies and the development of appropriate solutions while strengthening existing actions 3 5 4 2 invest in water related researches frequent field assessment and monitoring of pollution water is an elixir for all life forms and is imperative for improving health and wellbeing to promote wrm in ghana the nwp 2007 policy plan indicated integrating water resources management and development with environmental management in order to ensure the sustainability of water resources in both quantity and quality however the organization for economic co operation and development 2011 report on the challenges of financing water and sanitation indicated that limited funds are provided for water related studies and expansion this makes it difficult for effective studies in water resources for improvement therefore agencies and academic institutions must be financed and encouraged to undertake periodic assessments of surface waterbodies and groundwater sources in their catchments the nwp 2007 stipulates that it is essential to 1 promote and support scientific technological and socio economic research including the development and use of appropriate technologies and practices for sustainable water resources development 2 encourage interdisciplinary and participatory research that recognises the need for a link between technology and communities 3 support the data collection agencies to provide data and information on land use and water resources and 4 ensure that assessment and analysis of water resources availability and the impact of climate change and catchment degradation on water resources implementing these programs properly will inform policymakers and consumers on the state of water used and may suggest the need for further investigation in cases of above threshold levels according to cosgrove and loucks 2015 this process aids in reducing pollution and water overuse therefore the quantity and quality of water resources are preserved for future use 3 5 5 technology and engineering 3 5 5 1 promoting and practicing rain harvesting lópez zavala et al 2016 presented rainwater harvesting as a potential alternative to addressing the increasing demands for freshwater and reducing water stress apart from the construction of rain harvesting systems to ensure water security in droughts it is essential in the sustainability of groundwater and surface water resources as water extraction is reduced this does not only contribute to recharging groundwater it also augments water supply rainwater harvesting and artificial recharging are becoming very important issues several studies including boers and ben asher 1982 and campisano et al 2017 have touted rainwater harvesting as an important way to conserving water akuffobea essilfie et al 2020 in a study in ghana indicated that promoting rainwater harvesting may prove to be essential for improving water security the study further reveals that this allows more water to become available for ecosystems and their capacity to perform their functions is improved also since rainwater harvesting tanks redistribute water over longer scales the technique has the potential to reduce incidences of flooding downstream the issue of commercial rainwater harvesting however seems to be a neglected practice as rainwater flows through drains and sometimes resulting in flooding to conserve water it is therefore expedient to invest in rainwater harvesting as it has proven to be a sure way of conserving water campisano et al 2017 it is essential to stop the decline in groundwater levels and conserve surface water run off during the rainy season to reduce the groundwater extraction which may be preserved for consumption during droughts and dry seasons households and institutions could construct install rain harvesting systems and store water in above ground and underground tanks which may be distributed by gravity or using pumping machines 3 5 5 2 decreasing run off and evaporation studies by baker et al 2016 owusu et al 2016 and abanyie et al 2019 have indicated that though about 70 of the earth is water with 2 5 being fresh water about 1 is available and accessible for man s utilization according to latimer et al 2009 and boogaard and lucke 2019 huge water loss occurs due to run off and evaporation on most of the soils pavements tiling and asphalting which can be reduced by allowing most of the water to infiltrate into the groundwater systems this can be achieved by encouraging the use of lawns as an alternative to pavements tiles and asphalt also using contour cultivation terrace farming water spreading or improved water storage systems can serve as an effective tool for conservation of water for future use pennstate extension 2014 asiedu 2019 reported that ghana s rainforest is being lost at an alarming rate the reportage further indicated that the global forest watch gfw estimates that there was a 60 increase in ghana s primary rainforest loss in 2018 compared to 2017 however vegetation is significant in reducing runoff and pesticide and nutrient leaching into groundwater systems roberts and roberts 1989 water volumes running off natural groundcover areas may be as little as 10 of rainfall compared to 55 from mostly paved areas as urbanization progresses harder water impervious surfaces are constructed including streets roofs parking lots and driveways the result does not only increase surface runoff but a decrease in the time elapsed before runoff occurs brach 1989 redfern et al 2016 well maintained lawn areas can play a key role in significantly decreasing surface runoff losses leslie and knoop 1989 mentioned that runoff loss from a healthy stand of grass is a lot less than that from traditional row crop agriculture for example grasslands experience about 84 668 times less erosion than areas cultivated by wheat or corn leslie and knoop 1989 thick healthy lawns are found to limit pesticide runoff roberts and roberts 1989 paving and tiling significantly reduce retard the infiltration and percolation of rainwater to recharge groundwater however areas where potential contaminants are released or disposed including fitting shops and workshops wire houses and fuel delivery stations may be paved cemented asphalted or tiled but the wastewater from these areas ought to be collected through outlets for proper treatment and final disposal this is to prevent seepage of potentially toxic elements into surface and groundwater sources via runoff and leaching respectively 3 5 5 3 install well and spring river protections according to the oxford committee for famine relief oxfam 2008 a surface water source may be protected by installing a tapping creating rifts along surface water bodies obstructs other pollution sources such as urban runoff from entering the water also unstable and eroded water banks can be stabilized with gabions and stones while wells may be protected from external contaminants using linings and aprons fig 7 these respectively prevent ground and surface driven contamination sources and factors from impacting the water quality bruni and spuhler 2020 surface water sources may further be protected from predominant contamination sources including farmlands latrines and industries by creating inner protection zones and fences which are about 20 m from the water sources the size of the zone of protection is however dependent on the permeability of the native soil meuli and wehrle 2001 as such areas with gravel and rough soils which have high permeability compared to clay dominated areas may have limited protected areas while those with poor permeability may have protected zones of a radius of about 150 m hermoso et al 2016 bruni and spuhler 2020 this is because soils with high permeability may have less runoff of soil into the water body 3 5 5 4 adherence to engineering and technical advice ganyaglo et al 2019 in a groundwater quality study in the bongo and kassena nankana west districts of ghana identified elevated levels of f 1 5 mg l in uncapped groundwater sources compared to capped sources the study further indicated that the policy of capping wells with fluoride above 1 5 mg l is not strictly adhered to especially for boreholes drilled by individuals youth groups philanthropist and politicians adhering to engineering and technical guidelines for maintaining boreholes and wells aids in conserving quality and quantity water resources owners and managers of private and public boreholes and wells are expected to examine stubs caps signs of damage check the functionality of backflow devices arrange for routine water quality testing test water after heavy rain and flood remove surrounding debris and waste check for signs of vermin and insects avoid the application of agrochemicals within 100 m radius to groundwater sources and siting septic systems distant from boreholes and wells notwithstanding most of these recommendations are not adhered to though geo natural factors and sources contribute to water contamination anthropogenic sources significantly posed serious threats to water quality and public health campisano et al 2000 yeleliere et al 2018 water pollution may be significantly reduced following adherence to stipulated engineering and technical recommendations it is also essential to ensure the proper maintenance of water production and delivery systems to sustain water quality and water delivery systems used in water production and delivery such as water pumps and pipelines should be rehabilitated frequently to address damages repair breakages and cracks also monitoring activities in the surrounding area must be conducted along with the repair of protection zones and fences checking for appropriate operation by and checking whether the basic rules are respected by users oxfam 2008 bruni and spuhler 2020 also abandoned boreholes and wells groundwater systems no longer in use should be properly demolished and plugged though water sources are usually abandoned based on geo natural and anthropogenic factors they are abandonment is however done without proper sealing and decommissioning processes improperly decommissioned and abandoned wells may pose serious threats to groundwater quality and threaten public health therefore these wells must be properly plugged to prevent contamination and reduce hazards in situations where new wells are to be constructed old wells should be plugged abandoned wells can allow surface runoff to directly enter an aquifer contaminating them and potentially contaminating nearby wells which can result in cross contamination of different aquifers which have linkages with the well and can be a liability problem if the well contaminates other groundwater sources that share the same aquifer fig 8 bruni and spuhler 2020 4 conclusions and recommendations various water resources globally have been polluted owing to anthropogenic activities including improper management of waste environmentally unsound agricultural practices and non enforcement of water related policies and legislations these activities coupled with the increasing human population and industrial activities have worsened this global environmental problem the importance of water resources has thus resulted in growing concerns for conserving these resources and as such more attention is required to protect water resources ghana has several public institutions tasked with the sustainable management of the water resources in the country these include wrc gwcl csir wri ida epa msd purc however these institutions are unable to effectively function to properly manage water resources aside the well studied water contaminants such as heavy metals agrochemicals f and nutrients na ca2 po4 2 and mg2 in elevated levels contaminants of emerging concern that require detailed research are antibiotics microplastics and perfluoroalkyl acids social technical institutional personal legislative financial political and household interventions including the allocation of adequate financial resources into water resource management proper disposal of chemicals and toxin bearing materials attitudinal change and political enforcement of water related policies may be essential tools and procedures in the conservation of global water resources for the present and future generations and the protection of public health this study recommends that surface and groundwater systems should be monitored frequently especially for the emerging contaminants microplastics antibiotics and perfluoroalkyl acids their sources and possible public health and ecological implications farmers should be educated on how to properly apply and handle agrochemicals proper environmental assessment should be conducted before siting wells or boreholes industrial and domestic wastewater should be properly treated before being discharged into the environment regulations focusing on water resources should be properly enforced or enacted to deter deliberate contamination of water resources the cecs discussed in this study should be considered extensively in scientific and health research consent for publication not applicable funding this research did not receive any grant from any funding agency commercial

11862,geo natural and anthropogenic factors have threatened water resources though several studies have been conducted to identify the approaches to conserve these resources no categorical study has been done to synthesize the emerging contaminates in water resources and approaches to sustaining water resources this study sought to highlight approaches to protecting and sustaining surface and groundwater resources by triangulating 198 literature sources deforestation mining activities encroachment of watercourses farming and poor waste disposal have resulted in high levels of pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane gamma and delta hexachlorocyclohexane l cyhalothrin cypermethrin fenitrothion fenpropathrin ethoprophos heavy metals as 12 200 μgl 1 hg 6251 μgl 1 cr 45 μgl 1 f na ca2 po4 2 and mg2 in elevated levels have been detected in surface and groundwater resources from this study contaminants of emerging concern cec that require detailed research are antibiotics microplastics and perfluoroalkyl acids the formulation and implementation of policies regulation and scientific recommendations have been discussed as effective tools for protecting water resources in ghana and beyond for instance the ban and regulation of mining in ghana showed that the turbidity levels measured in rivers ankobra 553 ntu birim 1805 ntu and pra 3822 ntu respectively reduced to 217 ntu 883 ntu and 261 ntu to conserve and protect water resources proper disposal of chemicals and toxin bearing materials promoting practicing rain harvesting employing legislative tools reusing recycling water wastewater environmentally friendly farming irrigation practices public education on water resources management afforestation water management programs adherence to engineering and technical advice political enforcement of water related policies avoiding encroachment into water bodies catchments and investing in water related researches are highly recommended in the protection of water resources adopting and complying with the recommendations presented in this study can serve as guidelines for protecting and sustaining water resources for present and future use in ghana and areas with similar prevailing challenges graphical abstract image 1 keywords protecting and sustaining water resources approaches and recommendations sustainable water cecs review 1 introduction in few years ahead water stress will increase astronomically following the intensive exploitation and the pollution of global freshwater resources lópez zavala et al 2016 despite its abundance on earth a greater portion is inaccessible while the portion accessible is unequally distributed the earth s surface is composed of about 70 water however only about 2 5 of this is fresh water and less than 1 is available for human use and consumption baker et al 2016 ghana is endowed with an abundance of water resources the availability and utilization of consumptive and non consumptive purposes of water sources are under optimal levels owusu et al 2016 yeleliere et al 2018 protection of the world s water resources become important following the destruction of the environment in the early industrial era abanyie et al 2019 diagboya et al 2020 in ghana several anthropogenic activities coupled with rapid population growth have led to an increase in the pollution of water resources both surface and groundwater yeleliere et al 2018 bekoe et al 2021 douti et al 2021 amuah et al 2021 anthropogenic activities have contributed immensely to the pollution contamination of water resources unsustainable agricultural practices the excessive and untimely application of fertilizers and synthetic pesticides has led to chemical pollution of surface and groundwater resources through leaching and runoff from agricultural fields gyau boakye and biney 2002 stagnari et al 2016 the continuous farming of agricultural fields and the unregulated application of agrochemicals have also increased the vulnerability of these fields to erosion greatly increasing the turbidity of surface waters also improper waste management such as littering and the dumping of refuse in drains have led to the washing of waste into surface waters following the occurrence of rain besides the discharge of untreated effluent from industries as well as wastewater and sewage from households has resulted in chemical and microbial pollution of these water resources gyau boakye and biney 2002 the practice of quarrying has also led to the generation of sand and silt increasing the turbidity of surface waters this has also resulted in heavy metal pollution of ground and surface water resources through the increased activity of weathering dissolving minerals and elements locked up in these rocks sunkari et al 2019 spillage of oil and chemicals from car repair shops has also reduced the quality of water resources and adversely affected the biodiversity in this environmental medium united states environmental protection agency 2020 water protection and sustainability are deliberate acts of reducing water usage wastage and loss and water quality it involves strategies regulations and activities geared towards the sustainable management of freshwater resources to sustain the hydrosphere and to meet current and future consumptive and non consumptive demands the focus of water conservation is to ensure that available water today and in the future is sufficient and safe for public consumption and domestic and industrial activities water protection preservation and sustainability can be categorized into two main forms namely qualitative and quantitative controls no categorical study has been done to discuss approaches to sustaining the quality and quantity of water resources therefore this study seeks to present the key players in water resources management in ghana and their mandates summary of the major sources of water pollution in ghana statutory laws and policies for wrm in ghana and emerging contaminants in water resources in ghana and highlights practical and realistic methods that can be adopted to protect sustain and preserve the quality and quantity of water resources by synthesizing and triangulating the findings and recommendations from a wide range of sources including journals articles reportages and reports on water resource reduction the sources of water pollution and the possible approaches to curtail these challenges this will serve as a conceptual framework for policy makers and researchers in the development of specific strategies to sustaining water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description and research approach this study focused on ghana longitudes 0 05 04 e and 3 14 12 w and latitudes 5 5 39 n and 10 54 38 n to the north and south it shares borders with burkina faso and the gulf of guinea and togo and cote d ivoire to the east and west respectively fig 1 the study highlights key players in water resources management in ghana and their mandates the major sources of water pollution statutory laws and policies for wrm emerging contaminants in water resources in ghana and practical and sustainable methods of preserving and sustaining the quality and quantity of both surface and groundwater resources by synthesizing and triangulating the findings and recommendations from a wide range of literature sources including journals articles and reports on water resource reduction the sources of water pollution and the possible approaches to curtail these challenges keywords including water resources water protection and sustainability water resource management in ghana and water resources conservation were searched in core sciencedirect scopus base microsoft academic worldwide science google browser geobase google scholar elsevier biobase semantic scholar google books science gov pubmed central asci sage and researchgate a total of 198 literature sources were considered in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of the major sources of water pollution in ghana 3 1 1 waste and chemical pollution in ghana indiscriminate disposal of waste from both households and industrial sources into waterbodies is a common practice and a major source of water pollution as indicated by the findings of owusu et al 2016 increased amounts of these organic waste and industrial pollutants endangers not only the quality but also the sustainability of water resources karr and chu 2000 several experts have linked rising seasonal floods in main cities to improper waste management practices in the country such as dumping waste into waterbodies mensah and ahadzie 2020 runoffs also convey large amounts of untreated industrial waste dumped into open sewers into lagoons and other surface waterbodies causing significant pollution and disturbing the natural ecosystem of these waterbodies owusu boadi and kuitunen 2002 owusu et al 2016 yeleliere et al 2018 these pollutants could further leach into groundwater systems since brunner et al 2010 and tian et al 2015 have indicated that surface and groundwater are connected and interact 3 1 2 climate change and conditions climate change poses negative impacts on water quality and supplies kumar 2012 nakuja et al 2012 dankwa et al 2021 warmer drier conditions for example affect the mineralization of dangerous heavy metals that percolate into groundwater sources murdoch et al 2000 also high water temperatures contribute to eutrophication and excess algal growth which reduce water quality aladejana et al 2020 found that groundwater quality of the shallow coastal aquifer of eastern dahomey basin in southwestern nigeria were highly influenced by climatic conditions studies by anayah and kaluarachchi 2009 and resource centre network ghana 2021 have affirmed these findings in ghana groundwater quality can be influenced by weather circumstances such as high intensity rain or drought and pathogens can spread to locations where they are not naturally present lutz et al 2016 abanyie et al 2016 also found that in the bolgatanga municipality turbidity total and fecal coliforms total hardness and ph of groundwater samples rose during the rainy season compared to the dry season 3 1 3 mining activities illegal mining galamsey is known to pollute the environment significantly the chemicals used and the trash heaps are long term contaminants of both soil and water bodies kuffour et al 2018 kazapoe et al 2021 the operations of the small scale mining industry of gold are been established as the second largest source of pollution after agriculture in africa kessey and arko 2013 and in ghana and while causing more deaths each day also led to higher cost of water treatment with subsequent implication on the cost of water consumption because of the high amount of water required to wash the gold illegal miners frequently labor near water sources kuffour et al 2018 as tailings are thrown straight into rivers without treatment this results in significant debris contamination of streams and rivers kessey and arko 2013 it not only changes the aesthetics of the river stream but water also changes the physicochemical and biological properties making it unfit for human use studies including smedley et al 1996 kortatsi et al 2008 armah et al 2010 ato et al 2010 dorleku et al 2018 duncan 2020 obiri yeboah et al 2021 and karikari et al 2021 have reported surface and groundwater pollution in ghana emanating from mining activities to curb the menace of mining activities on water quality it is suggested that regulations covering mining in ghana are properly enforced and water quality assessments are done regularly in mining areas 3 1 4 soil chemistry and geological formation natural and geological factors could also influence surface and groundwater resources porous soils purify groundwater better than non porous soils this is due to some soilcharacteristics and properties such as soil particle size and thickness chemical contents chemical constituents water percolation and saturation rates national research council 1994 pesticides leak into groundwater through porous soils and could pose serious health impacts through groundwater consumption and contact gupta and yadav 2018 the occurrence of significant cations in groundwater sources in the bawku east municipality and the atankwidi basin in north east ghana according to anim gyampo et al 2018 is mostly due to the interaction of rock materials and water also anku et al 2009 attributed low ph levels in groundwater primarily to natural biogeochemical processes co2 generation in the soil zone through root respiration and the effect from leaching of organic acids from the decay of organic matter in the eastern corridor of northern ghana the predominant processes controlling the groundwater chemistry were attributed to mineral dissolution reactions ion exchange processes and evapotranspiration processes salifu et al 2012 high f levels in the groundwater resources in the bongo area have largely related to intense dissolution of the bongo granitoids which contain biotite and muscovite as the dominant fluoride bearing minerals and the sufficient groundwater rock interaction since the water samples are mainly sourced from deeper boreholes sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 loh et al 2020 posited that silicate mineral dissolution and the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters are the main controls on groundwater hydrochemistry also in the talensi district of northern ghana chegbeleh et al 2020 stated silicate and carbonate mineral weathering as the main controls on groundwater chemistry in the district these findings show that geo natural factors such as soil chemistry and geological properties also significantly influence water quality 3 1 5 proliferation of water weeds water pollution is a global issue and aquatic plants weeds have wreaked havoc in water resources globally aquatic weeds are plants that grow in waterbodies or in wet land which are mostly not desired owusu et al 2016 they grow in profusion and usually occur along the shores or within surface water systems like dams lakes and rivers natural aquatic plant populations are beneficial to any aquatic ecosystem to some extent because they provide fish food aid in nutrient cycling purify the water reduce undesired algae growth and provide habitat for wildlife such as birds however unwanted proliferation of aquatic weeds especially water hyacinth and salvinia have several implications such as increasing cost of treating and suppling urban water mathur and mathur 2006 the menace of water weeds is reaching worrying extents in many parts of the world particularly in tropical waterbodies where they have led to ecological economic losses and the challenge of managing water resources efficiently and ghana is no exception aloo et al 2013 the presence of aquatic weeds in surface water have been reported by paperna 1969 in the volta lake in ghana after four 4 years of its construction a similar study by odei 1987 also discussed the presence and menace of aquatic weeds in the volta lake estuary at ada in ghana the most affected area is the tano abby ehy lagoon complex as well as along 25 km of the river from the convergence of the tano river with the lagoon complex which poses a threat to the aquatic life the quality of the water and the management of the water body for the authorities wrc 2015 though the impacts of water weeds on water quality has not been studied extensively in ghana studies done have reported deleterious impacts on water resources 3 1 6 poor sanitation han et al 2016 and zeng et al 2021 described groundwater systems around sanitary landfills as highly contaminated due to the seepage of leachate from the landfill sites landfills and solid waste sw management is a challenging problem that is likely to be the source of contaminants to groundwater sources within the bolgatanga municipality of ghana akurugu 2018 owusu 2010 avers that in the major cities of ghana many household toilets and even public toilet facilities are most often redirected into drains which are in turn washed into waterbodies during downpours lutterodt et al 2018 mentioned poor sanitation around boreholes as one of the predominant factors affecting groundwater quality in ghana an assessment of heavy metal levels in groundwater sources around the oti landfill site in kumasi by boateng et al 2019 reported above threshold levels of pb cd cr and fe similar to these findings kanmani and gandhimathi 2013 and podlasek et al 2021 indicated that groundwater sources around a landfill in ariyamangalam india and poland and the czech republic were critically contaminated with hms in a study by obiri danso et al 2009 improper siting of wells and boreholes near latrines and dumpsites significantly affected groundwater quality issahaku et al 2017 reported that open defecation is a source of microbial contaminants in groundwater sources in the kassena nankana municipality 3 1 7 poor agricultural practices due to seasonality and its effects on rainfall most farmers prefer to farm close to waterbodies and hence it is very common to locate farmlands very close to these waterbodies in ghana douti et al 2021 for instance studies by fianko et al 2009 and sunkari et al 2019 in ghana papazotos et al 2019 in psachna basin greece and mukate et al 2018 2020 in solapur india have reported that agricultural activities pose debilitating impacts on groundwater quality similarly obiri danso et al 2011 asare donkor et al 2018 and miyittah et al 2020 have indicated similar results in agogo the birim river basin and aby lagoon system in ghana farmers draw water from these waterbodies for irrigation purposes as well as the application of pesticides and other chemicals to boost production through these farm practices chemicals are leached into these waterbodies and hence affect the quality of surface water systemsand increase the cost of water treatment fao 2018 reported that in 2015 an estimated 4 1 million tons of global usage of pesticides however this is expected to reach 9 8 billion tons in 2050 maggi et al 2019 fianko et al 2011 indicated that between 2002 and 2006 the amount of pesticide imported into ghana geometrically rose from 7763 metric tons to 27 886 metric tons and more than 87 of farmers use pesticides botwe et al 2012 identified elevated concentrations of pesticide residues of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 1 1 1 trichloro 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl ethane ddt and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde in groundwater sources in the offinso district of ghana nitrogen n from manures and inorganic fertilizers has been discussed as a concern with regards to groundwater pollution particularly no3 due to its high solubility nitrate salts capacity can potentially impact health through drinking water who 2006 oyelude et al 2013 identified the presence of nitrates in groundwater sources in the knma which were observed to have emanated from fertilizer application on farmlands kortatsi 2007 in the wassa west district and quansah and amankwah 2011 in the tarkwa nsuaem municipality and prestea huni valley areas reported average no3 concentration levels of 61 0 mg l and 59 0 mg l in groundwater in koon green and brenu akyim respectively 3 2 emerging contaminants in water resources in ghana 3 2 1 antibiotics the concentration of antibiotics in water resources has been less studied in ghana however azanu et al 2018 studied antibiotic levels in water and effluent from hospitals in the kumasi area twelve 12 different antibiotics including amoxicillin oxytetracycline doxycycline ampicillin ciprofloxacin metronidazole chlorotetracycline sulfamethoxazole erythromycin cefuroxime tetracycline and trimethoprim were considered the study reported that the highest concentration of antibiotic in the surface water sources was sulfamethoxazole 2861 ng l followed by ciprofloxacin and erythromycin the study further showed that amoxicillin had the lowest maximum concentration 2 7 ng l the measure of antibiotics was extremely above the antimicrobial resistance threshold of 0 1 ng l stated by gullberg et al 2011 this suggest that consuming water from these surface water sources could result in sub mic doses which can cause antibiotic resistance in the human gut though these water sources had high loads of antibiotics they were used for irrigation thus azanu et al 2018 revealed that five sulfamethoxazole cefuroxime ciprofloxacin metronidazole and erythromycin and two trimethoprim and ampicillin antibiotics were identified in lettuce sampled from markets and farms respectively though several studies including ma et al 2015 balzer et al 2016 yao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 kairigo et al 2020 li et al 2020 and zainab et al 2021 have reported the presence of antibiotics in surface and groundwater sources in other parts of the world in ghana this has been given less research attention based on this it is recommended that further studies are done to assess the levels of antibiotics in surface and groundwater sources especially those close to hospitals and pharmaceutical companies it is also essential to understand the antibiotic composition of treated water distributed for public use 3 2 2 microplastics in the akora river central region of ghana adu boahen et al 2020 reported a total of 286 microplastics within an area of 85 m3 though this is significantly lower than reported levels by zhao et al 2014 and wang et al 2016 in china lechner et al 2014 in australia naidoo et al 2015 in kwazulu natal south africa and sadri and thompson 2014 where 10 200 and 1591 141 0 2 48 and a mean of 0 028 items were recorded per m3 this has the potential to pose deleterious impacts on public health and aquatic lives a study by gbogbo et al 2020 also mentioned that the microplastic level is observed in the coastal wetland of sakumo ii lagoon was 0 13 ml 1 and 0 09 ml 1 before and after staining respectively though studies have been done in ghana these have focused on chico ortiz et al 2020 and adika et al 2020 in lagoon sediments and pelagic and demersal fish species there is a general lack of studies on microplastics in water resources in ghana due to the astronomic use of face masks in combating the spread of the covid 19 pandemic and poor solid waste management in the country it is proposed that extensive studies are done to assess the levels of plastics nano and micro plastics in water resources and their associated implications 3 2 3 perfluoroalkyl acids pfas essumang et al 2017 reported high levels of pfas in the kakum and pra river basins and tap water this study presents the first recorded case of perfluoroalkyl acids in surface and treated water in ghana the findings of the study were a mean level of the total pfas at the pra and kakum basins were 398 ng l and 281 ng l while tap water from these two areas were 200 ng l and 197 ng l respectively the study further indicated that the total pfas was 99 composed of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic pfao the risk quotient for both pfas were pfos 1 74 and pfao 1 01 due to the ability of pfas to bioaccumulate in soil air food and water it is a great concern since pfas contribute to decreased fertility liver dysfunction cancer thyroid diseases and hormone suppression kounang 2019 the agency for toxic substances and disease registry 2020 also indicated that exposure to high levels of pfas can increase cholesterol levels alter liver enzymes decrease vaccine response in children increase the risk of high blood pressure and pre eclampsia in pregnant women and increase the risk of testicular and kidney cancer it is recommended that pfas are bio monitored especially in ground and water resources within industrial areas 3 3 key players in water resources management in ghana and their mandates ghana has several public institutions tasked with the sustainable management of the water resources in the country warm 1998 banoeng yakubo 2017 these include the water resources commission wrc ghana water company limited gwcl water research institute of the council for scientific and industrial research csir wri irrigation development authority ida environmental protection agency epa meteorological services department msd hydrological division of the ministry of works and housing and the public utility regulatory commission purc ministry of works and housing 1998 kankam yeboah et al 2004 wrm institutions in ghana are categorized into organizations involved in water resources data collection and processing use and development of water resources water related regulatory activities and civic society and ngos this section seeks to spell out the mandates of these water resources governing institutions in the country the water resources commission wrc as a water resources governing institution has the right to integrate water resources management at the national level parliament of ghana 1996 this role includes granting water rights rationalizing coordinating and directing the activities of all water related institutions as well as the development of water related policies under the mandate to develop water related policies of the wrc the institution hasdeveloped a ghana water policy with the objective to promote an efficient management system and environmentally sound development of all water resources in ghana in line with the main focus of the wrc to effectively manage the water resources of ghana a water resources management fund wrmf has been set up and would be disbursed for projects and activities that address research activities development of efficient water resources database co operation with other riparian countries assistance where possible to specific projects initiated by communities watershed protection and specific projects of concern to water resources utilization also the council for scientific and industrial research csir among its functions is to encourage coordinated employment of scientific research for the management utilization and conservation of the natural resources of ghana in the interest of development within this framework the csir water research institute wri conducts research on the country s water resources to provide scientific and technological information and services for socio economic development the present ghana water company limited gwcl formerly known as the ghana water and sewerage corporation gwsc which was set up in 1965 parliament of ghana 1965 is the national agency responsible for domestic and industrial water and sewerage management in both urban and rural areas the community water and sanitation division cwsd formed in 1994 concentrates on accelerating water and sanitation delivery in the rural areas the cwsd advocates community ownership and community management approach in the irrigation sector the ghana irrigation development authority set up in 1985 under the supreme military council decree smcd 85 1977 is responsible for the management of irrigation schemes which includes advisory roles on technical aspects to farmers the environmental protection council was set up in 1974 national redemption council decree nrcd 239 1974 and has been transformed into an environmental protection agency with executive powers to deal with environmental issues odame ababio 2003 kankam yeboah et al 2004 the agency now demands the preparation presentation and approval of environmental impact assessment statements for developmental projects prior to their implementation in any part of ghana the epa contributes to wrm in ghana by tackling human activities close to waterbodies and those that pose possible implications water resources it does periodic monitoring to ensure that the quality of surface and groundwater resources are not compromised the meteorological services department and the hydrological services division of the ministry of works and housing respectively provide hydrometeorological and hydrometric data to support the sustainable management of water resources and the environment pooled roles of these institutions aid in the conservation of ghana s water resources in addition to the above mentioned public institutions several local and international non governmental organizations such as friends of rivers and water bodies ghana dams dialogue earth service gofa wateraid usaid weija lake protection association irc and ghana country water partnership are involved in various water related activities in ghana banoeng yakubo 2017 obuobie et al 2018 3 4 statutory laws and policies for wrm in ghana commons and unconstitutional laws for the protection of water resources have existed in ghana however the establishment of the 1992 constitution formalized the creation and implementation of legislative instruments albeit these laws did not provide any institutional framework for water resource regulations other related policies covering fisheries forestry and land served as foundations for the establishment of minerals fisheries and lands commissions however the water resources sector was improved by the initiatives implemented by these commission in 1996 the water resources commission act 522 established the water resources commission specifically for proper management of ghana s water resources the act is the main instrument that directs water use and its management in ghana parliament of ghana 1996 yeleliere et al 2018 to effectively manage water resources the following are major acts laws and policies that have been ratified and implemented rivers ordinance cap 226 1903 post independence common laws act 46 of 1961 act 310 of 1965 nlcd 293 of 1969 nrcd 239 of 1974 smcd 85 of 1977 act 490 of 1994 ghana water company limited act 461 1993 local government act

groundwater regulation li 1827 2006 national water policy 2007 riparian buffer zone policy 2011 dam safety regulation li 2236 2016 ministry of sanitation and water resources medium term expenditure framework mtef for 2017 2019 2017 3 5 approaches to protecting and sustaining water resources in ghana and beyond the availability and accessibility of fresh water are becoming a global concern ghana s water vision for 2025 has the main objective to promote an efficient and effective management system and environmentally sound development of all water resources in ghana national water policy nwp 2007 similarly the ministry of sanitation and water resources under the medium term expenditure framework mtef for 2017 2019 2017 it is stated that to enhance wrm in ghana it is essential to support the creative and innovative research in the production and use of improved technologies and approaches for effective provision of water therefore water resources management wrm is essential for protecting water resources from pollution overexploitation and the development of water systems for future use wrm is also important in playing a key role in sustaining water resources for irrigation purposes to combat food insecurity tackling flood issues addressing complex issues on water availability accessibility ownership distribution and usability and reducing water related diseases it also reduces freshwater stress it is critical for the country to have a holistic strategy to water resource management and development in order to attain the aforementioned goal and adapt to current priorities this section seeks to present measures by which water resources may be protected and preserved for public health protection and ecological management purposes 3 5 1 environmental recommendations 3 5 1 1 ensuring proper disposal of chemicals and toxin bearing materials maintaining water quality and access to freshwater are major global challenges a report by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 2019 indicated that about 400 megatons of industrial waste are discharged into waterbodies these effluents are usually discharged without proper treatment to ensure that the qualities of the natural water systems are maintained therefore debilitating implications manifest studies including nartey et al 2012 huang et al 2014 appiah adjei et al 2016 egbi et al 2017 akortia et al 2021 and douti et al 2021 have reported the debilitating impacts posed by the indiscriminate disposal of various forms of waste such as solid waste e waste waste from oil and metal works leachates from dump sites radioactive waste and animal dung into surface and groundwater resources thus the nwp 2007 states that preventing pollution of water sources through indiscriminate discharge of wastes solid liquid from domestic commercial and industrial mining activities will be paramount in protecting water resources in ghana it should be ensured that waste materials liquid and solid fig 2 that can contaminate pollute water systems are disposed of properly waste in the form of hazardous and organic pollutants such as mining medical pharmaceutical and agricultural wastes industrial wastewater spoilt batteries oils and e waste should be managed and disposed of properly using enhanced methods instead of disposing them into waterbodies or directly into the environment which eventually exposes toxic elements and heavy metals into surface water via runoff or leach into groundwater systems ghana has been battling the effects of illegal small scale on some major natural water resources attiogbe and nkansah 2017 for instance nyarko 2001 and essumang et al 2007 respectively reported levels of as and hg and cr reaching 12 200 μgl 1 and 6251 μgl 1 and 45 μgl 1 in water resources in the konongo old mining shaft and wassa west district resulting from mining activities in the anloga community of the volta region of ghana akoto et al 2019 reported high levels of chloride cadmium nitrate and lead in some wells in a review study yeleliere et al 2018 indicated that the improper disposal of waste fig 2 results in the infiltration of toxic chemicals into groundwater sources the study further indicated that the pra mamang ankobra and densu rivers in ghana have been significantly polluted following the discharge and deposition of industrial and agricultural waste into these rivers the overall pressure of agriculture on water quality in rivers lakes groundwater and coastal waters has eased since the early 1990s due to the decline in nutrient surpluses and pesticide use for most economic co operation and development oecd member countries parris 2011 a rise in salinity due to the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has contributed to water contamination mateo sagasta et al 2017 van der werf 1996 mentioned that about 2 5 million tons of pesticides are used in the agricultural sector annually gupta and yadav 2018 also indicated that pesticides leach into groundwater through deep percolation into porous soils and pose severe health risks through groundwater consumption this suggests that the possible impacts of fertilizers and pesticides on groundwater are enormous pelig ba 2011 revealed concentrations of pesticides including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt benzene hexachloride bhc and heptachlor epoxide in above threshold levels in both surface and groundwater sources in a study in the tono catchment of the upper east region of ghana similarly kuranchie mensah et al 2012 detected gamma hexachlorocyclohexane hch delta hexachlorocyclohexane δ hch heptachlor c10h5cl7 aldrin c12h8cl6 and dieldrin c12h8cl6o in water sources in weija and nsawam affum et al 2018 in the ankrobra basin of ghana identified pesticides including p p dde p p ddt methoxychlor p p ddd endrin dieldrin allethrin methamidophos permethrin pirimiphos methyl malathion l cyhalothrin chlorpyrifos fenitrothion fenpropathrin cypermethrin ethoprophos deltamethrin β hexachlorocyclohexane and cyfluthrin in both ground and surface water sources the study further showed that the concentrations of individual banned pesticides in the surface water and groundwater samples respectively fell between lod and 0 110 μg l avg 0 018 0 019 μg l and lod and 0 055 μg l 0 014 0 011 μg l respectively meanwhile concentrations of non banned pesticides were between lod and 0 925 μg l 0 117 0 186 μg l and lod and 2 μg l 0 140 0 350 μg l nakuja et al 2012 and kwoyiga and stefan 2018 in the northeastern part of ghana suggested that farmers should be encouraged to rely on rain fed farming during the rainy period to preserve surface and groundwater for dry season farming generally human induced activities that have direct or indirect and minor or major negative impacts on water systems should be discouraged also effective irrigation schemes and the creation of protection zones along watercourses and in buffer zones between farms and waterbodies can significantly reduce water return flow runoff and deposition of agrochemicals into surface water systems the implementation of the aforementioned recommendations may limit the demands on water sources and sustain quality and quantity them for other essential purposes 3 5 1 2 improve waste management poor management of waste including industrial municipal and healthcare has debilitating implications on both groundwater and surface water resources kumar et al 2020 ashfaq et al 2019 a review of waste management in major towns across ghana by miezah et al 2015 showed that waste management in the country is generally poor fig 3 leachates and runoff from landfills have been observed to contaminate surface and groundwater systems samadder et al 2017 mishra et al 2019 sackey et al 2020 to prevent the seepage of runoff of leachates from dumpsites and landfills into groundwater and surface water systems waste disposal sites must be sited far from residential areas and it should be ensured that they are properly engineered and managed in preventing runoff and or seepage of leachates from dumpsites and landfills into groundwater and surface water systems waste disposal sites must be properly engineered and managed as well as sited far from residential areas solid waste ought to be disposed of properly away from waterbodies since the deposition of solid waste into surface water systems could pose detrimental effects on the ecosystem and consumers of the water and the aquatic lives similarly owusu 2010 avers that in the major cities of ghana many household toilets and even public toilet facilities are mostly redirected into drains which are in turn washed into waterbodies this contributes immensely to the fecal contamination of water resources jeong 2001 also indicated that industrial effluents and dissolution of concrete walls of septic tanks exposed major ions such as nitrate na calcium ca2 phosphorus po4 2 and magnesium mg2 to groundwater within the area proper engineering approaches and assessments ought to be adopted before siting boreholes wells and septic tanks to prevent the possible seepage of fecal materials into groundwater systems similarly open defecation must be discouraged since fecal materials are deposited into surface waterbodies through runoff collins et al 2007 it is recommended that municipal solid and liquid wastes and radioactive infectious industrial and agricultural wastes be disposed of appropriately to avoid present and future debilitating effects on the natural ecosystem and public health to protect water resources from contamination resulting from waste governments must invest in constructing and managing well engineered landfills 3 5 1 3 avoid encroaching water bodies catchments the creation of new infrastructure and the expansion of existing ones to accommodate the growing population threaten water resources and the roles they play international federation of surveyors 2010 the water resources commission of ghana has set a 300 m buffer zones for surface waterbodies this prohibits physical development within these zones water resources commission 2008 however aabeyir and aduah 2014 revealed that this regulation has been violated nationwide fig 4 to protect waterbodies it is prudent to prevent encroachment into waterways as cities towns expand urban sprawls encroach into waterways due to pressure for land for development purposes the influx of people from rural areas into urban areas and increasing demand for freshwater giridhar and anirudh 2014 this increases contamination levels decreases water volumes and qualities and the drying up of surface waterbodies regulations proper planning and monitoring and public sensitization must be employed to prevent people from encroaching into water zones it is also important to site water sources especially boreholes and wells distant from pollution sources highly polluted areas usually coincide with densely populated and urbanized areas where most infrastructure and industrial production plants are located and therefore need to be given primary attention when implementing measures on reducing water pollution nazarov et al 2004 to prevent contamination of ground and surface water resources especially for consumptive purposes it is required to site boreholes wells tap water from areas including industries septic tanks and open defecation areas and farmlands that have obvious effects on water resources van der wal 2010 bruni and spuhler 2020 also groundwater drawing points must be sited above seasonal flood levels this will ensure perennial availability of water for consumptive and non consumptive purposes and significantly reduce physical chemical and microbial contamination of groundwater resources collins 2000 van der wal 2010 3 5 1 4 enhancing afforestation kim et al 2017 posit that afforestation is an effective approach to enhance and reestablish environmental functions and ecosystems afforestation has therefore been argued by several studies including lima et al 2012 and kim et al 2017 as a return investment for water conservation fig 5 afforestation aids in water flow reduction and the average loss of stream flow due to afforestation of grasslands and scrublands have been estimated to be one third to three quarters as a result of increasing canopy cover and forest floor interception putuhena and cordery 2000 farley et al 2005 similarly tree canopy cover enhances water quality can avert erosion and shallow land sliding especially by reducing surface runoffs which are eventually deposited in surface water bodies sidle et al 2006 calder 2007 afforestation improves water quality by limiting agrochemical nutrient and erosion runoff from farmlands into waterbodies pattanayak et al 2005 also ellis et al 2006 revealed that tree belts have been used in the interception and absorption of surface runoff before they are deposited into streams similarly hansen et al 2007 described afforestation as an effective way of reducingleaching of nitrate into groundwater systems and improving the quality of water leaving the root zone aragão 2012 also showed that improving vegetation cover reduces surface runoff maintains the hydrological cycle and balances precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 5 formulating and implementing national and local afforestation programs will therefore greatly improve water conservation and quality 3 5 2 instructional and legislative interventions 3 5 2 1 strengthening wrm institutions and promoting programs towards water resources protection the nwp 2007 states that to improve wrm in ghana there is the need to support the development of skills related to various water management functions at all levels adequately empower and equip water management institutions and das with appropriate tools and sustainable resources to effectively undertake their functions though anokye and gupta 2012 discussed that to enhance wrm institutions mandated to manage water resources must be well equipped protecting water resources also requires coordination among sector institutions which include the environmental protection agency ghana ministry of water resources works and housing water research institute ghana water company limited forestry commission hydrological service department meteorological services department volta river authority irrigation development authority and the ministry of local government and rural development coordination among these institutions will prevent overlapping of responsibilities and strategies as well as the development of policies with greater coherence to ensure the achievement of a sustainable environment and the effective utilization of both financial and human resources adank et al 2011 darling and hamilton 2002 revealed that another way to improve the habit of water conservation is employing incentives and cost sharing approaches aimed at promoting the adoption and retrofitting of preferred water saving technologies such as the use of water regulators in showerheads automation of handwashing facilities and washing basins among others which will greatly reduce water consumed thereby reducing the rate of withdrawing water from the various water sources dupont 2010 indicated that in canada cost sharing incentive programs where farmers are reimbursed for portions of their expenses in the adoption of best practices for protecting water resources have been very successful in sustaining and protecting water resources these approaches can be adopted by appreciating the efforts made by individuals institutions industries communities and households to sustaining water resources this will further motivate others to be conscious of wrm water related programs such as integrated water resources management iwrm and ensuring its completion and compliance have been successful in water conservation and protection united nations 2015 revealed that the iwrm approach has been widely accepted internationally as the way forward for efficient equitable and sustainable development and management of the world s limited water resources and for coping with conflicting demands mardiste et al 2014 described it as a cost effective and practicable tool in water resources management globally the adoption of iwrm is essential in protecting water resources since it addresses and satisfies basic human and ecosystem requirements for water resources the management and protection of river basins and drives the need for local national and international actions and sustainable water use programs radosevich 2003 kasbohm et al 2009 3 5 2 2 formulating enforcing and strengthening water related legislations the formulation and implementation of legislative structures have been useful tools in the protection of water resources for instance dating to the 1990s ghana has used several statutes in managing water systems however these statutes were not comprehensive and general nwp 2007 therefore the nwp was formulated and implemented in 2007 by the ministry of water resources works and housing to ensure the efficient management of water resources within the country it also ensures the effective interaction amongst key personalities and stakeholder institutions by integrating their respective activities and enhances urban water distribution as indicated by laryea 1994 and nyarko 2004 as challenges in the water sector following these reforms there are still some persisting challenges such as building in waterways late response to pipe leakages disposal of waste into or near waterbodies systems and mining activities along surface waterbodies that require strengthening and efficient implementation of the water policy a few years ago ghana battled the effects of illegal small scale mining on its water resources however interventions by key stakeholders and institutions and a ban on illegal small scale mining have led to the improvement in the quality of major rivers that suffered pollution larnyoh 2019 stated that the ministry of sanitation and water resources reported improvement in the quality of major rivers that suffered pollution as turbidity levels in the rivers pra ankobra and birim which were 3822 nephelometric turbidity units ntu 553 ntu and 1805 ntu have respectively declined to 261 ntu 217 ntu and 883 ntu also nyabor 2017 and ashong 2019 reported significant improvement in the physical characteristics of the birim and ankrobra rivers hajkowicz and collins 2007 in a multi criteria analysis for water resource planning and owusu et al 2016 in a review of ghana s water resources also reiterated the importance of legislation and water policy as essential tools for protecting water resources in ghana there are several policies and regulations on conserving water resources but these regulations may be purposeless if there is no political will to implement and enforce them for instance in ghana the national water policy promotes the sustainable utilization of water resources government of ghana gog 2007 the national land policy abhors farm practices close to water bodies ministry of lands and forestry 1999 the environmental sanitation policy also regulates the disposal of waste in water bodies however water resources are still under human induced pollution because successive governments lack the maximum political will to strictly enforce these regulations there is therefore the need for political will to enforce regulations in the country as purported by akumiah 2007 as posited by ajulor 2018 africa has no problem with policy plan or formulation other than the challenge of policy implementation with the right institutions in place and a strong political backing there would not be the need to enact other new policies as these existing policies and regulations will be very useful in conserving water resources in the country 3 5 3 social and household interventions 3 5 3 1 attitudinal change preventing wastage and contamination of water the nwp 2007 recommends that water is viewed as a finite and vulnerable resource the policy further states that in protecting water resources it is essential to promote partnerships between the public and private sectors for the protection and conservation of water resources through the use of cleaner and efficient technologies effective waste management and sound land management and agricultural practices thus individual institutional community and household management of water that have negative implications on the quality and quantity of freshwater ought to be reformed deliberate actions that promote wastage of water fig 6 especially for domestic purposes must be curtailed it is essential to ensure that leaking pipes and spoilt pipelines are reported and repaired with a sense of urgency furthermore to manage water properly taps must be turned off when not in use run full loads of dishes and laundry at a time take short showers install water saving showerheads flow restrictions kumari and singh 2017 smith et al 1989 and bhunia and ghosh 2011 revealed that broken pipelines could contribute to water contamination and the spread of waterborne diseases it must be acknowledged that water is a finite resource therefore conscious actions must be put in place to prevent eliminate or manage water wastage and institutional personal community and household based activities that contribute to water wastage to achieve this education and sensitization of the public on water resource conservation and protection are required with minimal adherence of the public to water regulation education and training of the public on the importance and preservation of water resources will sensitize the public equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills needed for the preservation of water resources and the adherence to regulations yeleliere et al 2018 darling and hamilton 2002 proposed the use of public education as a means of conserving water resources through conservation programs as almost all water conservation efforts to a larger extent depend on public awareness the public ought to understand the need for water resources conservation moglia et al 2018 averred that the most important driver for the conservation of water is for households to adopt water efficient practices that are made known through public education the nwp 2007 states that it is essential to promote and encourage water use efficiency techniques in agriculture and reduce transmission losses of water in irrigation systems educating farmers particularly will enable the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices such as erosion mitigation measures wastewater reuse and environmentally friendly approaches in the application of fertilizers preserving water resources in preserving the limited amount of freshwater available for man s health and wellbeing it is important to also promote reusing and recycling wastewater increasing population intensive agriculture urbanization and industrialization have placed high demand for freshwater therefore to preserve the available and accessible surface and groundwater sources it is important to reuse greywater for other purposes for instance treated wastewater can be used for ferti irrigation and greywater from washings and bathtubs for watering gardens washing cars or paths help in saving fresh water instead of extracting and disposing of fresh water always wastewater from industrial and domestic activities that are within permissible limits could be used for irrigation purposes flushing toilets construction dust control and washing cars and bikes this reduces the demands and stress on freshwater for other essential purposes lópez zavala et al 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2020 3 5 4 financial 3 5 4 1 allocation of adequate financial resources into water resource management the nwp 2007 aims at meeting the social needs for water as a priority while recognizing the economic value of water and the goods and services it provides the nwp 2007 further indicates that one of the key challenges of wrm in ghana is ensuring water resources management is adequately funded and appropriate levies instituted for raw water abstraction to promote efficiency sustainability and equity the policy aims to ensure that adequate funds are available for the development of the water sector to achieve the goal of making water available for all however the findings of rees et al 2008 and lindgaard jørgensen et al 2012 have shown that limited financial resources allocated to water resources have resulted in the non compliance of the public and institutions to water resources regulations inadequate provision of infrastructure and lack of expertise the allocation of adequate resources will thus enable the provision of the necessary infrastructure and capacity building to enhance the expertise of workers for effective supervision and coordination of regulations eshun and okyere 2017 tuokuu et al 2018 this will improve effective monitoring programs including water and ecological quality monitoring and evaluation to ensure compliance with laid down regulations and laws as well as the identification of gaps in planning and programming of implemented policies and the development of appropriate solutions while strengthening existing actions 3 5 4 2 invest in water related researches frequent field assessment and monitoring of pollution water is an elixir for all life forms and is imperative for improving health and wellbeing to promote wrm in ghana the nwp 2007 policy plan indicated integrating water resources management and development with environmental management in order to ensure the sustainability of water resources in both quantity and quality however the organization for economic co operation and development 2011 report on the challenges of financing water and sanitation indicated that limited funds are provided for water related studies and expansion this makes it difficult for effective studies in water resources for improvement therefore agencies and academic institutions must be financed and encouraged to undertake periodic assessments of surface waterbodies and groundwater sources in their catchments the nwp 2007 stipulates that it is essential to 1 promote and support scientific technological and socio economic research including the development and use of appropriate technologies and practices for sustainable water resources development 2 encourage interdisciplinary and participatory research that recognises the need for a link between technology and communities 3 support the data collection agencies to provide data and information on land use and water resources and 4 ensure that assessment and analysis of water resources availability and the impact of climate change and catchment degradation on water resources implementing these programs properly will inform policymakers and consumers on the state of water used and may suggest the need for further investigation in cases of above threshold levels according to cosgrove and loucks 2015 this process aids in reducing pollution and water overuse therefore the quantity and quality of water resources are preserved for future use 3 5 5 technology and engineering 3 5 5 1 promoting and practicing rain harvesting lópez zavala et al 2016 presented rainwater harvesting as a potential alternative to addressing the increasing demands for freshwater and reducing water stress apart from the construction of rain harvesting systems to ensure water security in droughts it is essential in the sustainability of groundwater and surface water resources as water extraction is reduced this does not only contribute to recharging groundwater it also augments water supply rainwater harvesting and artificial recharging are becoming very important issues several studies including boers and ben asher 1982 and campisano et al 2017 have touted rainwater harvesting as an important way to conserving water akuffobea essilfie et al 2020 in a study in ghana indicated that promoting rainwater harvesting may prove to be essential for improving water security the study further reveals that this allows more water to become available for ecosystems and their capacity to perform their functions is improved also since rainwater harvesting tanks redistribute water over longer scales the technique has the potential to reduce incidences of flooding downstream the issue of commercial rainwater harvesting however seems to be a neglected practice as rainwater flows through drains and sometimes resulting in flooding to conserve water it is therefore expedient to invest in rainwater harvesting as it has proven to be a sure way of conserving water campisano et al 2017 it is essential to stop the decline in groundwater levels and conserve surface water run off during the rainy season to reduce the groundwater extraction which may be preserved for consumption during droughts and dry seasons households and institutions could construct install rain harvesting systems and store water in above ground and underground tanks which may be distributed by gravity or using pumping machines 3 5 5 2 decreasing run off and evaporation studies by baker et al 2016 owusu et al 2016 and abanyie et al 2019 have indicated that though about 70 of the earth is water with 2 5 being fresh water about 1 is available and accessible for man s utilization according to latimer et al 2009 and boogaard and lucke 2019 huge water loss occurs due to run off and evaporation on most of the soils pavements tiling and asphalting which can be reduced by allowing most of the water to infiltrate into the groundwater systems this can be achieved by encouraging the use of lawns as an alternative to pavements tiles and asphalt also using contour cultivation terrace farming water spreading or improved water storage systems can serve as an effective tool for conservation of water for future use pennstate extension 2014 asiedu 2019 reported that ghana s rainforest is being lost at an alarming rate the reportage further indicated that the global forest watch gfw estimates that there was a 60 increase in ghana s primary rainforest loss in 2018 compared to 2017 however vegetation is significant in reducing runoff and pesticide and nutrient leaching into groundwater systems roberts and roberts 1989 water volumes running off natural groundcover areas may be as little as 10 of rainfall compared to 55 from mostly paved areas as urbanization progresses harder water impervious surfaces are constructed including streets roofs parking lots and driveways the result does not only increase surface runoff but a decrease in the time elapsed before runoff occurs brach 1989 redfern et al 2016 well maintained lawn areas can play a key role in significantly decreasing surface runoff losses leslie and knoop 1989 mentioned that runoff loss from a healthy stand of grass is a lot less than that from traditional row crop agriculture for example grasslands experience about 84 668 times less erosion than areas cultivated by wheat or corn leslie and knoop 1989 thick healthy lawns are found to limit pesticide runoff roberts and roberts 1989 paving and tiling significantly reduce retard the infiltration and percolation of rainwater to recharge groundwater however areas where potential contaminants are released or disposed including fitting shops and workshops wire houses and fuel delivery stations may be paved cemented asphalted or tiled but the wastewater from these areas ought to be collected through outlets for proper treatment and final disposal this is to prevent seepage of potentially toxic elements into surface and groundwater sources via runoff and leaching respectively 3 5 5 3 install well and spring river protections according to the oxford committee for famine relief oxfam 2008 a surface water source may be protected by installing a tapping creating rifts along surface water bodies obstructs other pollution sources such as urban runoff from entering the water also unstable and eroded water banks can be stabilized with gabions and stones while wells may be protected from external contaminants using linings and aprons fig 7 these respectively prevent ground and surface driven contamination sources and factors from impacting the water quality bruni and spuhler 2020 surface water sources may further be protected from predominant contamination sources including farmlands latrines and industries by creating inner protection zones and fences which are about 20 m from the water sources the size of the zone of protection is however dependent on the permeability of the native soil meuli and wehrle 2001 as such areas with gravel and rough soils which have high permeability compared to clay dominated areas may have limited protected areas while those with poor permeability may have protected zones of a radius of about 150 m hermoso et al 2016 bruni and spuhler 2020 this is because soils with high permeability may have less runoff of soil into the water body 3 5 5 4 adherence to engineering and technical advice ganyaglo et al 2019 in a groundwater quality study in the bongo and kassena nankana west districts of ghana identified elevated levels of f 1 5 mg l in uncapped groundwater sources compared to capped sources the study further indicated that the policy of capping wells with fluoride above 1 5 mg l is not strictly adhered to especially for boreholes drilled by individuals youth groups philanthropist and politicians adhering to engineering and technical guidelines for maintaining boreholes and wells aids in conserving quality and quantity water resources owners and managers of private and public boreholes and wells are expected to examine stubs caps signs of damage check the functionality of backflow devices arrange for routine water quality testing test water after heavy rain and flood remove surrounding debris and waste check for signs of vermin and insects avoid the application of agrochemicals within 100 m radius to groundwater sources and siting septic systems distant from boreholes and wells notwithstanding most of these recommendations are not adhered to though geo natural factors and sources contribute to water contamination anthropogenic sources significantly posed serious threats to water quality and public health campisano et al 2000 yeleliere et al 2018 water pollution may be significantly reduced following adherence to stipulated engineering and technical recommendations it is also essential to ensure the proper maintenance of water production and delivery systems to sustain water quality and water delivery systems used in water production and delivery such as water pumps and pipelines should be rehabilitated frequently to address damages repair breakages and cracks also monitoring activities in the surrounding area must be conducted along with the repair of protection zones and fences checking for appropriate operation by and checking whether the basic rules are respected by users oxfam 2008 bruni and spuhler 2020 also abandoned boreholes and wells groundwater systems no longer in use should be properly demolished and plugged though water sources are usually abandoned based on geo natural and anthropogenic factors they are abandonment is however done without proper sealing and decommissioning processes improperly decommissioned and abandoned wells may pose serious threats to groundwater quality and threaten public health therefore these wells must be properly plugged to prevent contamination and reduce hazards in situations where new wells are to be constructed old wells should be plugged abandoned wells can allow surface runoff to directly enter an aquifer contaminating them and potentially contaminating nearby wells which can result in cross contamination of different aquifers which have linkages with the well and can be a liability problem if the well contaminates other groundwater sources that share the same aquifer fig 8 bruni and spuhler 2020 4 conclusions and recommendations various water resources globally have been polluted owing to anthropogenic activities including improper management of waste environmentally unsound agricultural practices and non enforcement of water related policies and legislations these activities coupled with the increasing human population and industrial activities have worsened this global environmental problem the importance of water resources has thus resulted in growing concerns for conserving these resources and as such more attention is required to protect water resources ghana has several public institutions tasked with the sustainable management of the water resources in the country these include wrc gwcl csir wri ida epa msd purc however these institutions are unable to effectively function to properly manage water resources aside the well studied water contaminants such as heavy metals agrochemicals f and nutrients na ca2 po4 2 and mg2 in elevated levels contaminants of emerging concern that require detailed research are antibiotics microplastics and perfluoroalkyl acids social technical institutional personal legislative financial political and household interventions including the allocation of adequate financial resources into water resource management proper disposal of chemicals and toxin bearing materials attitudinal change and political enforcement of water related policies may be essential tools and procedures in the conservation of global water resources for the present and future generations and the protection of public health this study recommends that surface and groundwater systems should be monitored frequently especially for the emerging contaminants microplastics antibiotics and perfluoroalkyl acids their sources and possible public health and ecological implications farmers should be educated on how to properly apply and handle agrochemicals proper environmental assessment should be conducted before siting wells or boreholes industrial and domestic wastewater should be properly treated before being discharged into the environment regulations focusing on water resources should be properly enforced or enacted to deter deliberate contamination of water resources the cecs discussed in

11863,in recent years researchers have become more concerned regarding the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in our environment as they have the potential to instigate serious health problems both in human beings as well as marine animals conventional methods of treating these edcs have failed mostly at this moment electrospun nanofibres have become the holy grail in this field their multifaceted functions include adsorption filtration extraction detection and degradation of these harmful chemicals they have the potential to adsorb up to 357 14 mg g of heavy metal moradi et

introduction on the working parameters of an electrospinning machine and the role of synthesized nanofibre in the treatment of edcs conclusively the challenges and future prospects of these nanofibres in this field have been highlighted therefore this review can show a direction towards a new approach to ejecting edcs through bridging the gaps in the previous recent works graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrospun nanofibre endocrine disrupting chemicals micro extraction sensors 1 introduction the endocrine system of our body is responsible for secreting hormones that bind with specific receptors such interactions control various operations like metabolism growth and development mood fertility sexual function body weight regulation etc endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are exogenous chemicals that interrupt this intricate chemical interaction and interfere with the plethora of functions that these hormones play causing numerous diseases lauretta et al 2019 la merrill et al 2020 according to the commonly accepted world health organization who international programme on chemical safety ipcs 2002 description edc is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function s of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse health effects in organisms it possesses properties that might be expected to lead to endocrine disruption in an intact organism or sub populations as per international panel on chemical pollution ipcp report international panel on chemical pollution 2016 most of the common edcs are polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides like atrazine chlorpyrifos triclosan heavy metals like lead cadmium estrogens like 17α ethynylestradiol bisphenol a and phthalates careless use of insecticides and pesticides along with dumping of untreated landfills municipal and industrial wastes in the water bodies make aquatic systems a huge accumulator of harmful edcs table 1 shows the concentration of edcs detected in rivers creeks and sediments all over india exposure of human beings to such chemicals through products like toys pharmaceuticals insecticides cosmetics cookware etc can cause diseases like cancer diabetes thyroid reproductive system disorders obesity metabolic disorder and neurotoxicity le magueresse battistoni et al 2017 mallozzi et al 2017 sifakis et al 2017 ghassabian and trasande 2018 papalou et al 2019 toporova and balaguer 2019 yilmaz et al 2020 exposure of fishes to edcs can cause reduced egg production larval deformities and alteration of genes through generations decourten et al 2020 major et al 2020 in a study conducted by pandey and mohanty 2017 it was found that the thyroid and pituitary glands of a bird amandava were affected on simultaneous exposure to two commonly used pesticides another similar study conducted by lópez perea and mateo 2019 showed the presence of common organochloride edcs in the blood and uropygial gland secretion of birds especially from wetlands that collect treated sewage water fig 1 illustrates a detailed account of sources and effects of common edcs due to its adverse health effects researchers all over the world have devised methods for the detection and removal of edcs from the environment conventional methods used in waste water treatment plants for ejection of edcs such as chlorination or adsorption by activated carbon have not shown many fruitful results methods like membrane technology katibi et al 2021 ultrasonication chu et al 2017 ozonation olmez hanci et al 2020 photochemical decomposition gmurek et al 2017 and fenton s process silva et al 2021 are also used for the treatment of edcs various research experiments maryskova et al 2019 amini et al 2021 fang et al 2021 reveal that amalgamation of these processes along with electrospun nanofibres can be a promising horizon in this field nanofibres are a manmade approach towards making fibres of diameter on the scale of tens to a hundred nanometers these are similar to webs made by spiders or human hair and animal fur they are characterized by a high surface to volume ratio good porosity and high mechanical strength kenry and lim 2017 there are various methods to synthesize nanofibres few of which them are sonochemical method lee et al 2019 plasma induced synthesis sun et al 2017 centrifugal jet spinning li et al 2019 blow spinning tan et al 2020 and melt blowing kamin et al 2021 there are many drawbacks of these methods such as getting fibres of diameter less than 100 nm and undesirable morphology electrospinning is an electrohydrodynamic technique that produces nanofibres without any self assembly most easily and cheaply it runs on the phenomenon of the electrostatic field which leads to the movement of a liquid finally resulting in the formation of nanofibres progression of liquids under electrostatic field was first observed by william gilbert in about 1600 since then this technique has been evolved over the years ghosal et al 2018 figen 2020 nanofibres have numerous applications including air filtration vehicle cabin filtration removal of dyes and oil from water bodies kim et al 2018 zhijiang et al 2018 islam et al 2019 bian et al 2020 lou et al 2020 phan et al 2020 although several review papers scrutinize the role of electrospun nanofibres for waste water management liao et al 2018 j j zhang et al 2019 cui et al 2020 liu et al 2020 kugarajah et al 2021 marinho et al 2021 ratshiedana et al 2021 thamer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 to date no review paper focuses on its role in sensing adsorbing and degrading i e doing an a to z treatment of edcs this paper sheds light on recent progress made in the preparation of nanofibres and their applications in biosensing photocatalysis adsorption and microextraction for the removal of edcs fig 2 initially this article provides a brief account of the conventional methods of treating edcs and their drawbacks followed by a precise introduction on working parameters of an electrospinning machine and the role of synthesized nanofibres in the treatment of edcs with special emphasis on their working mechanisms a succinct discussion on the recent patents in this field has also been included conclusively the challenges and future prospects of these nanofibres have been highlighted 2 conventional methods for edc removal from wastewater the conventional methods employed for the ejection of edcs from waste water are sedimentation filtration flocculation coagulation adsorption by powdered activated carbon pac granular activated carbon gac chemical oxidation and chlorination gao et al 2020 ternes et al 2002 conducted an experiment that proved that granulated activated carbon gac is efficient enough to remove pharmaceuticals like bezafibrate carbamazepine and diclofenac from waste water both in pilot experiments and real waterworks but flocculation using iron iii chloride showed no noteworthy eradication of targeted pharmaceuticals choi et al 2006 also found similar results through extensive lab and pilot experiments they confirmed that the flocculation coagulation technique could remove only 0 3 of bisphenol a and 4 7 of nonylphenol gac adsorption and ozonation proved to be better alternatives during water treatment however even adsorption and ozonation technologies have a number of disadvantages crini and lichtfouse 2019 commercial activated carbons cac are expensive which makes the process costly the eradication of the adsorbents involves procedures like incineration regeneration or replacement regeneration of cac is also pricey and leads to loss of materials on the other hand ozone has a short life and no action on salinity waste water treatment plants wwtps have failed to remove edcs from the water completely botero coy et al 2018 investigated urban wastewater samples accumulated before and after treatment in wwtps of bogotá and medellin according to their study the concentration of most of the pharmaceuticals in the effluent waste water was similar to that of influent wastewater similarly szymonik et al 2017 expressed concern over the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water and rivers in poland elfikrie et al 2020 studied the effectiveness of conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtp in selangor malaysia and tanjung karang they reported that dwtp was inefficient in removal of pesticides like imidacloprid buprofezin tebuconazole and propiconazole mohapatra et al 2016 carried out similar experiments to find out the fate of pharmaceuticals at two urban wwtps in india they concluded that urban wwtps were successful only in partial removal of pharmaceuticals due to the massive failure of conventional waste water treatment plants in the treatment of common edcs researchers have felt the urge to focus on better alternatives 3 electrospinning a paradigm technique for edc treatment in a nutshell 3 1 electrospinning process the polymeric solution to be electrospun is prepared and poured within a syringe having a capillary tip the syringe is suspended and a metallic collector is placed right under it a high voltage is applied to the polymeric solution which charges the fluid creating a high electric field between the syringe and the collector thus a droplet is produced on the tip of the syringe when the applied voltage is strong enough to produce an electric field that can prevail over the surface tension of this droplet it transforms into a jet forming the taylor cone while traversing towards the collector place the jet experiences bending instabilities accompanied by evaporation of the solvent this results in smaller diameter fibres fibrils and longer lengths of the fibres are thus formed the collector accumulates the nonwoven uniform mostly fibres bagheri et al 2020 bhagure and rao 2020 as depicted in fig 3 3 2 electrospinning parameters affecting the morphology of the fibres in table 2 various electrospinning parameters and their effect on the morphology of nanofibers have been discussed 3 3 types of electrospun nanofibre electrospun nanofibres can be classified based on their methods of preparation most of the common types of electrospun nanofibres which have found widespread applications in the removal of edcs are discussed below 3 3 1 molecularly imprinted polymers mips a procedure called molecular imprinting technology mit is used to make synthetic receptors that have high specificity for particular molecules to put it in a simpler way it is a technique that mimics the antibody antigen system of our body in this process a three dimensional template monomer composite is formed by the method of polymerization in the company of a cross linking agent on completion of polymerization the template is removed via washing which leaves behind specific binding sites complementing the configuration and functionality of the template as the template and the functional groups of the polymer can bind with each other via several intermolecular interactions the product has the potential to recognize the template and is highly specific belbruno 2019 patel et al 2020 fig 4 represents a scheme for the preparation of mips since a cross linked polymer cannot be solubilized the approach towards molecular imprinting during electrospinning is not feasible considering the drawbacks there are three other methods to produce electrospun mip nanofibres mip layer formation on electrospun nanofibre solid phase imprinting and encapsulation of mip nanoparticles into electrospun nanofibres moein et al 2019 segundo et al 2020 the first approach involves the development of a mip layer or grafting to from electrospun support the second method involves immobilization of the template on a solid support the third technique is the easiest of all it primarily involves two steps to produce mip nanoparticles and to immobilize embed the nanoparticles into the electrospun nanofibres they have several applications such as removal of environmental pollutants speltini et al 2017 biological sample analysis pandey et al 2020 and drug delivery koudehi and zibaseresht 2020 3 3 2 core shell nanofibres and hollow nanofibres as the name core shell suggests here the polymeric nanofibre has a core and a shell which has several benefits over a single compartment nanofibre the shell layer helps to protect the inner incorporated ingredients and assists in its controlled release also the core and shell of the fibre can have different properties which help them to carry the inner ingredient for instance hydrophilic items in the core phase can be encapsulated into hydrophobic polymers in the shell phase huang et al 2018 it has several applications like drug delivery abdullah et al 2019 catalysis zhu et al 2019 separation zang et al 2017 etc on the other hand if the core of the nanofibres is removed it forms hollow nanofibres they can be made by two methods coaxial electrospinning and emulsion electrospinning as illustrated in fig 4 co axial electrospinning han and steckl 2019 is a technique where two different solutions are filled into two capillaries each preparing the core and sheath of the fibre respectively on reaching an optimum value of electric potential the liquid from the inner capillary forms the core while the one from the outer capillary forms the shell of the taylor cone we get the core shell nanofibres on further elongation emulsion electrospinning roy et al 2018 involves the preparation of an emulsion of the desired liquids unlike co axial electrospinning it just requires a single capillary 3 3 3 composites composites constitute a group of materials having a chemical composition of more than one phase and properties different from their fundamental constituents it usually consists of a continuous and dispersed phase their matrix can be made of different types of materials such as polymer metal or ceramic they help to enhance the properties of the original constituents used to make the fibre for example generally the mechanical strength of nanofibres made from a single component limits its applications in places where strong nanofibres are needed such as the membrane technology composite nanofibres help to overcome this shortcoming due to the presence of selective components which enhance the mechanical strength of the fibre they have numerous applications such as dye adsorption habiba et al 2018 tissue engineering gao et al 2019 separation of oil from water karki et al 2019 and removing different water pollutants malwal and gopinath 2017 4 sensing of endocrine disruptors by electrospun nanofibres biosensors can be described as an analytical apparatus that identifies alterations in biological processes and transforms them into electrical signals it can be generally categorized into three classes based on the method of transduction mass based biosensors optical based biosensors and electrochemical biosensors in an electrochemical biosensor an electrode is used for the immobilization of biomolecules such as enzymes antibodies or nucleic acids and electron movement cho et al 2020 they can be further classified as potentiometric amperometric conductometric and impedometric on the other hand an optical biosensor senses interaction between micro organisms and analytes and associate the observed optical signal to the number of target molecules based on the number of photons involved in the process damborský et al 2016 supraja et al 2020 prepared a multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt embedded zinc oxide zno nanofibre through the process of electrospinning and used it as an immunosensor for detecting the pesticide atrazine which is a potential endocrine disruptor fig 5 its electrochemical properties were examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv the sensor could detect atrazine successfully even at a low concentration having a detection range of 10 zm 1 μm mercante et al 2021 used the electrospinning technique to prepare the nanofibres of polyamide 6 and poly allylamine hydrochloride embedded with gold nanoparticles further tyrosinase tyr was immobilized into the nanofibre for amperometric sensing of bisphenol a bpa cv was used to detect the electrode s electrochemical properties kim et al 2016 proposed a fet sensor for detecting bpa the sensor used a transducer made of multichannel carbon nanofibres mcnfs modified with aptamers that bind bpa the mcnfs were made by electrospinning poly acrylonitrile pan and poly methyl methacrylate pmma and heating the prepared nanofibres the aptamer based fet sensor showed faster response time specific and low level detection of bpa at extremely low cost for fabrication while wang et al 2016 developed an electroluminescence ecl quenching sensor for the detection of bpa in river water firstly a core shell nanoparticle having ruthenium ii tris bipyridine doped copper as core and gold as shell ru cu au was prepared via a low temperature method the resultant nanoparticle was further electrospun with nylon 6 pa6 amino functionalized mwcnt ru cu au mwcnts pa6 the nanofibre acted as an ecl sensor which detected bpa within a limit of 10 pm kumar et al 2020 devised a method to use an electrospun cobalt zinc oxide nanofibre cozno nf to detect the insecticide fipronil its electrochemical properties were assessed using eis and cv techniques teodoro et al 2018 synthesized an electrospun nanofibre comprising of reduced graphene oxide rgo cellulose nanowhiskers cnw and polyamide 6 pa6 which showed an excellent capability of sensing mercury ii the sensor had a low limit of detection of 0 0052 μm in a concentration range of 2 5 200 μm the nanofibre showed high selectivity towards hg ii even in presence of other ions like cd ii and pb ii supraja et al 2019b proposed a method for the detection of atrazine using electrospun manganese oxide nanofibre anti atrazine antibody was immobilized into the nanofibre the modified electrode was thus used as a sensor furquim et al 2020 devised a green method of making a sensor that could detect bpa at low concentrations graphene oxide pyrolyzed from citric acid was further adsorbed into polycaprolactone pcl fibres the sensor thus produced could specifically sense the presence of bpa in water within a limit of detection lod of 23 nm its electrochemical properties were studied using cv pavinatto et al 2018 developed a bio sensor that could detect 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in urine samples even in the presence of other interfering compounds the proposed bio sensor was made of an electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp chitosan chi reduced graphene oxide rgo nanofibre laccase enzyme was immobilized into it using glutaraldehyde it showed apt reproducibility chamuah et al 2018 developed a surface enhanced raman scattering sers substrate made of gold au coated electrospun polyvinyl alcohol pva nanofibres for detection of various pesticides for the sake of study the research was done using three pesticides deltamethrin quinalphos and thiacloprid the minimum detected concentration of the above pesticides was 0 33 0 288 and 0 2658 mg kg respectively thus the substrate had the potential to emerge as a raman signaling sensor for sensing other chemicals hu et al 2017 developed a colorimetric strip that could detect uranyl uo2 2 the strip was made of electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibre doped with 2 5 bromo 2 pyridylazo 5 diethylamino phenol br padap due to the strong complexation between br padap and uo2 2 the colorimetric sensor changed its colour from yellow to purple on detection of uo2 2 supraja et al 2019 also developed a sensor based on electrospun tin iv oxide nanofibre for the detection of atrazine table 3 represents the limit of detection achieved by various electrospun nanofibres as sensors 5 adsorption and filtration of edcs by electrospun nanofibres adsorption is the accumulation of molecules of gases liquids or solids on the surface of another material adsorbent it gets influenced by a number of factors such as ph dosage contact time temperature etc different nanofibres can show different adsorption mechanisms the adsorption can be based on simple ion exchange or covalent attachment or chelation it can also be affinity or magnetic adsorption depending on the materials used to fabricate the nanofibre najafi and frey 2020 due to their excellent adsorption capabilities electrospun nanofibres are also used as membrane filters the mechanical strength of the nanofibres is enhanced by the addition of nanomaterials to make them strong enough for this purpose biofouling is another facet of its use that can be overcome by cleaning operations or surface modification of the fibre goetz et al 2016 had reported hydrophilic electrospun membranes of cellulose acetate coated with chitin which could be used for water filtration thus nanofibres could be used in membrane bioreactors mbr which are used for the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater mohammad et al 2019 moradi et al 2018b proposed an electrospun nanofibrous membrane made of fumarate alumoxane

electrospun cellulose nanofibre with β cyclodextrin ca p cdp which possessed the potential to adsorb bisphenol pollutants bisphenol a bpa bisphenol s bps and bisphenol f bpf static and dynamic adsorption tests were conducted the proposed membrane demonstrated outstanding adsorption capability even in real water samples owing to its hydrophobic nature hydrogen bonding and π π stacking sun et al 2019 prepared a clay based nanofibrous membrane that could adsorb bpa by electrospinning organic rectorite with polyacrylonitrile srt pan first natural rectorite was treated with trimethyl stearyl ammonium bromide to enhance its properties adsorption studies revealed that adsorption of bpa increased with an increase in the amount of rectorite 20 wt of organic rectorite srt pan 2 0cec was considered as the optimum concentration required for both electrospinning of a good nanofibre and achieving maximum adsorption the hydrophobicity of the membrane further assisted its adsorption capability jasni et al 2017 proposed adsorption of bpa using electrospun nylon 6 6 nanofibrous membrane nnm the membrane demonstrated good adsorption great stability and high reusability again electrostatic interaction along with hydrophobicity was found to be the key reason behind the adsorption of bpa by the membrane while the size of bpa was also an important element as the nanofibre could eliminate pollutants of micron size sobhanardakani and zandipak 2018 fabricated ceo2 cufe2o4 nanofibres for effective adsorption of bpa and 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 haider et al 2018 devised a technique for the ejection of copper cu ii and lead pb ii metals ions from aqueous samples amine grafted agnfs chitosan nanofibrous membranes were prepared amine grafting led to the presence of more nitrogen binding sites required for the effectual elimination of the heavy metal ions mahar et al 2019 fabricated porous carbon nanofibres p cnfs by electrospinning different compositions of pan polyacrylonitrile and pmma polymethyl methacrylate solutions followed by carbonization of the product thus the final fabricated nanofibre was utilized for adsorption of lead pb ii the adsorption mechanism could be explained on the basis of chemical interaction between the pb ii ions and the surface functional groups of the fibre also the porosity of the fibre enhanced its efficiency as an absorbent the fibre could be used for 4 cycles with 77 adsorption efficiency moradi et al 2018b embedded fumarate ferroxane fum f nanoparticles into pan nanofibres by immersing the electrospun pan nanofibre in the fum f solution the prepared nanofibre showed efficient adsorption of pb ii ions the adsorption mechanism was based on ion exchange and complex formation malik et al 2018 prepared pan and magnetite fe3o4 nanofibre by electrospinning fecl3 loaded pan nanofibres and then chemical treating it for in situ development of fe3o4 on it the composite nanofibre thus formed could be used for

electrospun phytic acid with polyurethane to form pu phytic acid nanofibrous membrane which could be used for adsorption of pb ii though phytic acid is hydrophilic in nature due to the presence of six phosphate groups the prepared membrane still had excellent mechanical properties the chelating property of phytic acid enhanced its adsorption capability with increasing ph of the adsorption solution

used for adsorption of estradiol e2 and chlorpyrifos cp whereas westrup et al 2021 proposed to use electrospun poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat fibres for adsorption of estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 hydrophobicity and π π interactions were the main reasons behind its adsorption capability camiré et al 2020 synthesized nanofibrous membranes by

photoelectrochemical catalysis and helped in the degradation of uranium ren et al 2018 fabricated graphene oxide doped mnfe2o4 nanofibres and used them for catalytic ozonation of di n butyl phthalate similarly restivo et al 2016 prepared nitrogen doped carbon nanofibre and used it for catalytic ozonation of atrazine metolachlor and nonylphenol 8 recent patents for treatment of edcs an analysis of patents helps to identify the current research trends emerging techniques and upcoming technologies that will be helpful in the treatment of edcs beijing normal university filed a patent application

which claims to degrade chlorophenol pollutants following this two more patents cn102703415a junfeng et al 2012a and cn102701430a junfeng et al 2012b had been filed which again used the same emulsion

wo2017205732a1 cwiertny et al 2017 for preparing electrospun composite nanofibre that could be used for water treatment applications such as the removal of metal pollutants which are a major class of endocrine disruptors 9 challenges and future scope although electrospun nanofibres have become too exceptionally helpful in the field of separation and sensing of edcs a few challenges are still needed to be tackled large scale manufacturing of electrospun nanofibre with exclusive surface morphology and properties is still a huge challenge in the discussed field although needleless electrospinning boosts large production of nanofibre it still requires advanced knowledge on the influence of polymer kind and solution properties on electrospinning many electrospun nanofibres are made from organic solvents which can be toxic volatile and poisonous in nature it can risk both human health and our environment green electrospinning agarwal and greiner 2011 stresses on greener solutions or solvent free electrospinning needs to be highlighted more in this field melt electrospinning can become a better alternative as it focuses on the avoidance of toxic free solvents the hydrophilicity of the polymers often lowers their mechanical strength and thus limits their use most of the recent works focus on the treatment of a particular group of edcs heavy metals medicines pesticides fabrication of electrospun nanofibres capable of separating various species simultaneously is a big challenge the majority of the methods used for its synthesis such as in situ polymerization remain limited within the boundaries of the lab and are not apposite for industrial manufacturing fabrication of polymer scaffolds that are not reactive towards the environment or sensing material is also a big challenge more research should be done towards making portable sensors many times electrospinning fails to fabricate dense membranes which are essential for processes like nanofiltration membrane fouling also limits their use in filtration multi fluid electrospinning wang et al 2020 can give a mileage to the electrospinning process and increase its capability to form new nanostructures the most commonly used forms of multi fluid electrospinning are co axial side by side and tri axial electrospinning as discussed earlier co axial electrospinning is used to form core shell or hollow nanofibre on the other hand side by side electrospinning also known as janus electrospinning forms janus nanofibre gupta and wilkes 2003 pioneered the formation of janus nanofibre through the process of electrospinning it is mostly prepared by two types of spinnerets where either there are two cylinders placed next to each other side by side or there is a smaller cylinder that comes into contact with a larger one internally these janus nanofibres have excellent sensing li et al 2020 and photocatalytic h liu et al 2019 activity which can be extended towards the treatment of edcs in near future similarly tri axial electrospinning involves the use of a spinneret which consists of a concentric arrangement of three cylinders it can also be used to fabricate core shell and hollow nanofibre khan et al 2021 thus multi fluid electrospinning has the potential to become the future of the electrospinning field 10 conclusion recently researchers have concentrated more on using electrospun nanofibre as a means to sense adsorb filter and degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs electrospun nanofibre has proven to have multiple advantages over conventional water treatment techniques which have failed in filtering out the common edcs properties like a high surface area to volume ratio good porosity and enhanced water permeability make them suitable enough for treating edcs in the waste water electrospinning has emerged as the most convenient pocket friendly and easy technique for the production of nanofibre various researches show that electrospun nanofibre can detect common edcs even at low concentrations however despite its multi faceted roles the use of nanofibre for edc treatment has remained restricted within the premises of laboratories researchers need to devise suitable methods that can make industrial manufacturing of electrospun nanofibre possible at a large scale which in turn will increase its practical applications with the development in the existing technologies like needleless and multifluid electrospinning the drawbacks can be easily overcome in near future as the quest for new techniques to treat the edcs is the basic need of the hour electrospun nanofibres show the potential to become the new vista in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors wish to appreciate dst west bengal the centre for research in nanoscience and nanotechnology and the department of polymer science and technology university of calcutta for their financial and technical support 
11863,in recent years researchers have become more concerned regarding the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in our environment as they have the potential to instigate serious health problems both in human beings as well as marine animals conventional methods of treating these edcs have failed mostly at this moment electrospun nanofibres have become the holy grail in this field their multifaceted functions include adsorption filtration extraction detection and degradation of these harmful chemicals they have the potential to adsorb up to 357 14 mg g of heavy metal moradi et al 2018a and extract as low as 0 007 ng ml 1 of edcs zhang and xu 2017 this review provides a brief account of the conventional methods of treating edcs and their major drawbacks followed by a precise introduction on the working parameters of an electrospinning machine and the role of synthesized nanofibre in the treatment of edcs conclusively the challenges and future prospects of these nanofibres in this field have been highlighted therefore this review can show a direction towards a new approach to ejecting edcs through bridging the gaps in the previous recent works graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrospun nanofibre endocrine disrupting chemicals micro extraction sensors 1 introduction the endocrine system of our body is responsible for secreting hormones that bind with specific receptors such interactions control various operations like metabolism growth and development mood fertility sexual function body weight regulation etc endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are exogenous chemicals that interrupt this intricate chemical interaction and interfere with the plethora of functions that these hormones play causing numerous diseases lauretta et al 2019 la merrill et al 2020 according to the commonly accepted world health organization who international programme on chemical safety ipcs 2002 description edc is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function s of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse health effects in organisms it possesses properties that might be expected to lead to endocrine disruption in an intact organism or sub populations as per international panel on chemical pollution ipcp report international panel on chemical pollution 2016 most of the common edcs are polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides like atrazine chlorpyrifos triclosan heavy metals like lead cadmium estrogens like 17α ethynylestradiol bisphenol a and phthalates careless use of insecticides and pesticides along with dumping of untreated landfills municipal and industrial wastes in the water bodies make aquatic systems a huge accumulator of harmful edcs table 1 shows the concentration of edcs detected in rivers creeks and sediments all over india exposure of human beings to such chemicals through products like toys pharmaceuticals insecticides cosmetics cookware etc can cause diseases like cancer diabetes thyroid reproductive system disorders obesity metabolic disorder and neurotoxicity le magueresse battistoni et al 2017 mallozzi et al 2017 sifakis et al 2017 ghassabian and trasande 2018 papalou et al 2019 toporova and balaguer 2019 yilmaz et al 2020 exposure of fishes to edcs can cause reduced egg production larval deformities and alteration of genes through generations decourten et al 2020 major et al 2020 in a study conducted by pandey and mohanty 2017 it was found that the thyroid and pituitary glands of a bird amandava were affected on simultaneous exposure to two commonly used pesticides another similar study conducted by lópez perea and mateo 2019 showed the presence of common organochloride edcs in the blood and uropygial gland secretion of birds especially from wetlands that collect treated sewage water fig 1 illustrates a detailed account of sources and effects of common edcs due to its adverse health effects researchers all over the world have devised methods for the detection and removal of edcs from the environment conventional methods used in waste water treatment plants for ejection of edcs such as chlorination or adsorption by activated carbon have not shown many fruitful results methods like membrane technology katibi et al 2021 ultrasonication chu et al 2017 ozonation olmez hanci et al 2020 photochemical decomposition gmurek et al 2017 and fenton s process silva et al 2021 are also used for the treatment of edcs various research experiments maryskova et al 2019 amini et al 2021 fang et al 2021 reveal that amalgamation of these processes along with electrospun nanofibres can be a promising horizon in this field nanofibres are a manmade approach towards making fibres of diameter on the scale of tens to a hundred nanometers these are similar to webs made by spiders or human hair and animal fur they are characterized by a high surface to volume ratio good porosity and high mechanical strength kenry and lim 2017 there are various methods to synthesize nanofibres few of which them are sonochemical method lee et al 2019 plasma induced synthesis sun et al 2017 centrifugal jet spinning li et al 2019 blow spinning tan et al 2020 and melt blowing kamin et al 2021 there are many drawbacks of these methods such as getting fibres of diameter less than 100 nm and undesirable morphology electrospinning is an electrohydrodynamic technique that produces nanofibres without any self assembly most easily and cheaply it runs on the phenomenon of the electrostatic field which leads to the movement of a liquid finally resulting in the formation of nanofibres progression of liquids under electrostatic field was first observed by william gilbert in about 1600 since then this technique has been evolved over the years ghosal et al 2018 figen 2020 nanofibres have numerous applications including air filtration vehicle cabin filtration removal of dyes and oil from water bodies kim et al 2018 zhijiang et al 2018 islam et al 2019 bian et al 2020 lou et al 2020 phan et al 2020 although several review papers scrutinize the role of electrospun nanofibres for waste water management liao et al 2018 j j zhang et al 2019 cui et al 2020 liu et al 2020 kugarajah et al 2021 marinho et al 2021 ratshiedana et al 2021 thamer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 to date no review paper focuses on its role in sensing adsorbing and degrading i e doing an a to z treatment of edcs this paper sheds light on recent progress made in the preparation of nanofibres and their applications in biosensing photocatalysis adsorption and microextraction for the removal of edcs fig 2 initially this article provides a brief account of the conventional methods of treating edcs and their drawbacks followed by a precise introduction on working parameters of an electrospinning machine and the role of synthesized nanofibres in the treatment of edcs with special emphasis on their working mechanisms a succinct discussion on the recent patents in this field has also been included conclusively the challenges and future prospects of these nanofibres have been highlighted 2 conventional methods for edc removal from wastewater the conventional methods employed for the ejection of edcs from waste water are sedimentation filtration flocculation coagulation adsorption by powdered activated carbon pac granular activated carbon gac chemical oxidation and chlorination gao et al 2020 ternes et al 2002 conducted an experiment that proved that granulated activated carbon gac is efficient enough to remove pharmaceuticals like bezafibrate carbamazepine and diclofenac from waste water both in pilot experiments and real waterworks but flocculation using iron iii chloride showed no noteworthy eradication of targeted pharmaceuticals choi et al 2006 also found similar results through extensive lab and pilot experiments they confirmed that the flocculation coagulation technique could remove only 0 3 of bisphenol a and 4 7 of nonylphenol gac adsorption and ozonation proved to be better alternatives during water treatment however even adsorption and ozonation technologies have a number of disadvantages crini and lichtfouse 2019 commercial activated carbons cac are expensive which makes the process costly the eradication of the adsorbents involves procedures like incineration regeneration or replacement regeneration of cac is also pricey and leads to loss of materials on the other hand ozone has a short life and no action on salinity waste water treatment plants wwtps have failed to remove edcs from the water completely botero coy et al 2018 investigated urban wastewater samples accumulated before and after treatment in wwtps of bogotá and medellin according to their study the concentration of most of the pharmaceuticals in the effluent waste water was similar to that of influent wastewater similarly szymonik et al 2017 expressed concern over the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water and rivers in poland elfikrie et al 2020 studied the effectiveness of conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtp in selangor malaysia and tanjung karang they reported that dwtp was inefficient in removal of pesticides like imidacloprid buprofezin tebuconazole and propiconazole mohapatra et al 2016 carried out similar experiments to find out the fate of pharmaceuticals at two urban wwtps in india they concluded that urban wwtps were successful only in partial removal of pharmaceuticals due to the massive failure of conventional waste water treatment plants in the treatment of common edcs researchers have felt the urge to focus on better alternatives 3 electrospinning a paradigm technique for edc treatment in a nutshell 3 1 electrospinning process the polymeric solution to be electrospun is prepared and poured within a syringe having a capillary tip the syringe is suspended and a metallic collector is placed right under it a high voltage is applied to the polymeric solution which charges the fluid creating a high electric field between the syringe and the collector thus a droplet is produced on the tip of the syringe when the applied voltage is strong enough to produce an electric field that can prevail over the surface tension of this droplet it transforms into a jet forming the taylor cone while traversing towards the collector place the jet experiences bending instabilities accompanied by evaporation of the solvent this results in smaller diameter fibres fibrils and longer lengths of the fibres are thus formed the collector accumulates the nonwoven uniform mostly fibres bagheri et al 2020 bhagure and rao 2020 as depicted in fig 3 3 2 electrospinning parameters affecting the morphology of the fibres in table 2 various electrospinning parameters and their effect on the morphology of nanofibers have been discussed 3 3 types of electrospun nanofibre electrospun nanofibres can be classified based on their methods of preparation most of the common types of electrospun nanofibres which have found widespread applications in the removal of edcs are discussed below 3 3 1 molecularly imprinted polymers mips a procedure called molecular imprinting technology mit is used to make synthetic receptors that have high specificity for particular molecules to put it in a simpler way it is a technique that mimics the antibody antigen system of our body in this process a three dimensional template monomer composite is formed by the method of polymerization in the company of a cross linking agent on completion of polymerization the template is removed via washing which leaves behind specific binding sites complementing the configuration and functionality of the template as the template and the functional groups of the polymer can bind with each other via several intermolecular interactions the product has the potential to recognize the template and is highly specific belbruno 2019 patel et al 2020 fig 4 represents a scheme for the preparation of mips since a cross linked polymer cannot be solubilized the approach towards molecular imprinting during electrospinning is not feasible considering the drawbacks there are three other methods to produce electrospun mip nanofibres mip layer formation on electrospun nanofibre solid phase imprinting and encapsulation of mip nanoparticles into electrospun nanofibres moein et al 2019 segundo et al 2020 the first approach involves the development of a mip layer or grafting to from electrospun support the second method involves immobilization of the template on a solid support the third technique is the easiest of all it primarily involves two steps to produce mip nanoparticles and to immobilize embed the nanoparticles into the electrospun nanofibres they have several applications such as removal of environmental pollutants speltini et al 2017 biological sample analysis pandey et al 2020 and drug delivery koudehi and zibaseresht 2020 3 3 2 core shell nanofibres and hollow nanofibres as the name core shell suggests here the polymeric nanofibre has a core and a shell which has several benefits over a single compartment nanofibre the shell layer helps to protect the inner incorporated ingredients and assists in its controlled release also the core and shell of the fibre can have different properties which help them to carry the inner ingredient for instance hydrophilic items in the core phase can be encapsulated into hydrophobic polymers in the shell phase huang et al 2018 it has several applications like drug delivery abdullah et al 2019 catalysis zhu et al 2019 separation zang et al 2017 etc on the other hand if the core of the nanofibres is removed it forms hollow nanofibres they can be made by two methods coaxial electrospinning and emulsion electrospinning as illustrated in fig 4 co axial electrospinning han and steckl 2019 is a technique where two different solutions are filled into two capillaries each preparing the core and sheath of the fibre respectively on reaching an optimum value of electric potential the liquid from the inner capillary forms the core while the one from the outer capillary forms the shell of the taylor cone we get the core shell nanofibres on further elongation emulsion electrospinning roy et al 2018 involves the preparation of an emulsion of the desired liquids unlike co axial electrospinning it just requires a single capillary 3 3 3 composites composites constitute a group of materials having a chemical composition of more than one phase and properties different from their fundamental constituents it usually consists of a continuous and dispersed phase their matrix can be made of different types of materials such as polymer metal or ceramic they help to enhance the properties of the original constituents used to make the fibre for example generally the mechanical strength of nanofibres made from a single component limits its applications in places where strong nanofibres are needed such as the membrane technology composite nanofibres help to overcome this shortcoming due to the presence of selective components which enhance the mechanical strength of the fibre they have numerous applications such as dye adsorption habiba et al 2018 tissue engineering gao et al 2019 separation of oil from water karki et al 2019 and removing different water pollutants malwal and gopinath 2017 4 sensing of endocrine disruptors by electrospun nanofibres biosensors can be described as an analytical apparatus that identifies alterations in biological processes and transforms them into electrical signals it can be generally categorized into three classes based on the method of transduction mass based biosensors optical based biosensors and electrochemical biosensors in an electrochemical biosensor an electrode is used for the immobilization of biomolecules such as enzymes antibodies or nucleic acids and electron movement cho et al 2020 they can be further classified as potentiometric amperometric conductometric and impedometric on the other hand an optical biosensor senses interaction between micro organisms and analytes and associate the observed optical signal to the number of target molecules based on the number of photons involved in the process damborský et al 2016 supraja et al 2020 prepared a multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt embedded zinc oxide zno nanofibre through the process of electrospinning and used it as an immunosensor for detecting the pesticide atrazine which is a potential endocrine disruptor fig 5 its electrochemical properties were examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv the sensor could detect atrazine successfully even at a low concentration having a detection range of 10 zm 1 μm mercante et al 2021 used the electrospinning technique to prepare the nanofibres of polyamide 6 and poly allylamine hydrochloride embedded with gold nanoparticles further tyrosinase tyr was immobilized into the nanofibre for amperometric sensing of bisphenol a bpa cv was used to detect the electrode s electrochemical properties kim et al 2016 proposed a fet sensor for detecting bpa the sensor used a transducer made of multichannel carbon nanofibres mcnfs modified with aptamers that bind bpa the mcnfs were made by electrospinning poly acrylonitrile pan and poly methyl methacrylate pmma and heating the prepared nanofibres the aptamer based fet sensor showed faster response time specific and low level detection of bpa at extremely low cost for fabrication while wang et al 2016 developed an electroluminescence ecl quenching sensor for the detection of bpa in river water firstly a core shell nanoparticle having ruthenium ii tris bipyridine doped copper as core and gold as shell ru cu au was prepared via a low temperature method the resultant nanoparticle was further electrospun with nylon 6 pa6 amino functionalized mwcnt ru cu au mwcnts pa6 the nanofibre acted as an ecl sensor which detected bpa within a limit of 10 pm kumar et al 2020 devised a method to use an electrospun cobalt zinc oxide nanofibre cozno nf to detect the insecticide fipronil its electrochemical properties were assessed using eis and cv techniques teodoro et al 2018 synthesized an electrospun nanofibre comprising of reduced graphene oxide rgo cellulose nanowhiskers cnw and polyamide 6 pa6 which showed an excellent capability of sensing mercury ii the sensor had a low limit of detection of 0 0052 μm in a concentration range of 2 5 200 μm the nanofibre showed high selectivity towards hg ii even in presence of other ions like cd ii and pb ii supraja et al 2019b proposed a method for the detection of atrazine using electrospun manganese oxide nanofibre anti atrazine antibody was immobilized into the nanofibre the modified electrode was thus used as a sensor furquim et al 2020 devised a green method of making a sensor that could detect bpa at low concentrations graphene oxide pyrolyzed from citric acid was further adsorbed into polycaprolactone pcl fibres the sensor thus produced could specifically sense the presence of bpa in water within a limit of detection lod of 23 nm its electrochemical properties were studied using cv pavinatto et al 2018 developed a bio sensor that could detect 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 in urine samples even in the presence of other interfering compounds the proposed bio sensor was made of an electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp chitosan chi reduced graphene oxide rgo nanofibre laccase enzyme was immobilized into it using glutaraldehyde it showed apt reproducibility chamuah et al 2018 developed a surface enhanced raman scattering sers substrate made of gold au coated electrospun polyvinyl alcohol pva nanofibres for detection of various pesticides for the sake of study the research was done using three pesticides deltamethrin quinalphos and thiacloprid the minimum detected concentration of the above pesticides was 0 33 0 288 and 0 2658 mg kg respectively thus the substrate had the potential to emerge as a raman signaling sensor for sensing other chemicals hu et al 2017 developed a colorimetric strip that could detect uranyl uo2 2 the strip was made of electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibre doped with 2 5 bromo 2 pyridylazo 5 diethylamino phenol br padap due to the strong complexation between br padap and uo2 2 the colorimetric sensor changed its colour from yellow to purple on detection of uo2 2 supraja et al 2019 also developed a sensor based on electrospun tin iv oxide nanofibre for the detection of atrazine table 3 represents the limit of detection achieved by various electrospun nanofibres as sensors 5 adsorption and filtration of edcs by electrospun nanofibres adsorption is the accumulation of molecules of gases liquids or solids on the surface of another material adsorbent it gets influenced by a number of factors such as ph dosage contact time temperature etc different nanofibres can show different adsorption mechanisms the adsorption can be based on simple ion exchange or covalent attachment or chelation it can also be affinity or magnetic adsorption depending on the materials used to fabricate the nanofibre najafi and frey 2020 due to their excellent adsorption capabilities electrospun nanofibres are also used as membrane filters the mechanical strength of the nanofibres is enhanced by the addition of nanomaterials to make them strong enough for this purpose biofouling is another facet of its use that can be overcome by cleaning operations or surface modification of the fibre goetz et al 2016 had reported hydrophilic electrospun membranes of cellulose acetate coated with chitin which could be used for water filtration thus nanofibres could be used in membrane bioreactors mbr which are used for the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater mohammad et al 2019 moradi et al 2018b proposed an electrospun nanofibrous membrane made of fumarate alumoxane embedded pan which could be used in membrane bioreactors fig 6 represents the adsorption isotherm of functionalized carbon nanofibres when it was used for lead adsorption lv et al 2021 modified electrospun cellulose nanofibre with β cyclodextrin ca p cdp which possessed the potential to adsorb bisphenol pollutants bisphenol a bpa bisphenol s bps and bisphenol f bpf static and dynamic adsorption tests were conducted the proposed membrane demonstrated outstanding adsorption capability even in real water samples owing to its hydrophobic nature hydrogen bonding and π π stacking sun et al 2019 prepared a clay based nanofibrous membrane that could adsorb bpa by electrospinning organic rectorite with polyacrylonitrile srt pan first natural rectorite was treated with trimethyl stearyl ammonium bromide to enhance its properties adsorption studies revealed that adsorption of bpa increased with an increase in the amount of rectorite 20 wt of organic rectorite srt pan 2 0cec was considered as the optimum concentration required for both electrospinning of a good nanofibre and achieving maximum adsorption the hydrophobicity of the membrane further assisted its adsorption capability jasni et al 2017 proposed adsorption of bpa using electrospun nylon 6 6 nanofibrous membrane nnm the membrane demonstrated good adsorption great stability and high reusability again electrostatic interaction along with hydrophobicity was found to be the key reason behind the adsorption of bpa by the membrane while the size of bpa was also an important element as the nanofibre could eliminate pollutants of micron size sobhanardakani and zandipak 2018 fabricated ceo2 cufe2o4 nanofibres for effective adsorption of bpa and 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 haider et al 2018 devised a technique for the ejection of copper cu ii and lead pb ii metals ions from aqueous samples amine grafted agnfs chitosan nanofibrous membranes were prepared amine grafting led to the presence of more nitrogen binding sites required for the effectual elimination of the heavy metal ions mahar et al 2019 fabricated porous carbon nanofibres p cnfs by electrospinning different compositions of pan polyacrylonitrile and pmma polymethyl methacrylate solutions followed by carbonization of the product thus the final fabricated nanofibre was utilized for adsorption of lead pb ii the adsorption mechanism could be explained on the basis of chemical interaction between the pb ii ions and the surface functional groups of the fibre also the porosity of the fibre enhanced its efficiency as an absorbent the fibre could be used for 4 cycles with 77 adsorption efficiency moradi et al 2018b embedded fumarate ferroxane fum f nanoparticles into pan nanofibres by immersing the electrospun pan nanofibre in the fum f solution the prepared nanofibre showed efficient adsorption of pb ii ions the adsorption mechanism was based on ion exchange and complex formation malik et al 2018 prepared pan and magnetite fe3o4 nanofibre by electrospinning fecl3 loaded pan nanofibres and then chemical treating it for in situ development of fe3o4 on it the composite nanofibre thus formed could be used for adsorption of pb ii from an aqueous environment the nanofibres were characterized using several techniques according to reusability studies it could be reused up to 3 cycles fang et al 2021 electrospun phytic acid with polyurethane to form pu phytic acid nanofibrous membrane which could be used for adsorption of pb ii though phytic acid is hydrophilic in nature due to the presence of six phosphate groups the prepared membrane still had excellent mechanical properties the chelating property of phytic acid enhanced its adsorption capability with increasing ph of the adsorption solution karim et al 2019 electrospun poly vinyl alcohol chitosan pva chi nanofibres for adsorption of lead and cadmium s s zhang et al 2019 prepared a fixed bed column for the removal of pb ii ions a poly vinyl alcohol poly acrylic acid pva paa nanofibre membrane was electrospun and its dynamic adsorption behaviour was studied different adsorption influencing parameters were studied which revealed that adsorption was not influenced by the bed height but low concentration favoured adsorption schäfer et al 2018 electrospun mixed polyethersulfone and β cyclodextrin cd to form fibres which were further used for adsorption of estradiol e2 and chlorpyrifos cp whereas westrup et al 2021 proposed to use electrospun poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat fibres for adsorption of estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 hydrophobicity and π π interactions were the main reasons behind its adsorption capability camiré et al 2020 synthesized nanofibrous membranes by electrospinning alkaline lignin with pva at optimum conditions the proposed membrane had the capability of adsorbing fluoxetine meng et al 2019 prepared a nanofibre band by electrospinning gelatin pva and bayberry tannin gpnb bt in presence of cross linker glutaraldehyde its adsorption capacity towards uranium was examined the band had high mechanical strength and porosity it showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 170 mg g at an initial concentration of 80 mg l and 1 4 μg g at a low concentration of 3 μg l 1 talebi et al 2017 electrospun polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate poly ethylene oxide and hzsm5 zeolites pva sa peo hzsm5 to get a nanofibre that could adsorb uranium and thorium the fibre had more selectivity towards th iv than u vi similarly christou et al 2019 electrospun pvp chitosan nanofibres for adsorption of u vi from an aqueous environment the presence of polar groups and the fibrous structure strengthened its adsorption capability peter et al 2016 prepared a carbon nanofibre carbon nanotube composite and tested its sorption capacity against atrazine and sulfamethoxazole where the nanotubes played the role of primary sorbent hou et al 2018 fabricated a nanofibre membrane by combining a chelating fibre apan along with a mesoporous fibre cs pva through the process of bipolar jet electrospinning the nanofibrous membrane thus obtained was used for chemical filtration of cd2 and bpa the membrane proved re usability even after ten cycles of filtration as cd2 and bpa could be removed from it by the process of elution with hcl and ethanol respectively khalil and schäfer 2021 electrospun polyethersulfone pes along with β cyclodextrin epichlorohydrin βcdp and accumulated it on an ultrafiltration uf membrane the membrane s capability of filtering e2 was tested through static and dynamic filtration the high surface area of the composite fibre along with the presence of βcdp made the process of ultrafiltration easy and apposite for the removal of steroid hormones almasian et al 2018 fabricated a core shell nanofibre consisting of polyacrylonitrile pan polyaniline pani and increased its hydrophilicity by the addition of diethylenetriamine the membrane was used for filtration adsorption of pb2 and cd2 from water khoriha et al 2020 used coconut pulp waste activated carbon and nylon6 6 electrospun membrane for adsorption of triclosan from an aqueous environment table 4 represents the maximum adsorption capacity of various electrospun nanofibres 6 extraction of edcs with electrospun nanofibers as sorptive phase micro extraction generally

patents helps to identify the current research trends emerging techniques and upcoming technologies that will be helpful in the treatment of edcs beijing normal university filed a patent application

which claims to degrade chlorophenol pollutants following this two more patents cn102703415a junfeng et al 2012a and cn102701430a junfeng et al 2012b had been filed which again used the same emulsion technology for laccase immobilization into nanofibre and degraded pahs the regents of the university of california as well as university of iowa research foundation filed a patent application wo2017205732a1 cwiertny et al 2017 for preparing electrospun composite nanofibre that could be used for water treatment applications such as the removal of metal pollutants which are a major class of endocrine disruptors 9 challenges and future scope although electrospun nanofibres have become too exceptionally helpful in the field of separation and sensing of edcs a few challenges are still needed to be tackled large scale manufacturing of electrospun nanofibre with exclusive surface morphology and properties is still a huge challenge in the discussed field although needleless electrospinning boosts large production of nanofibre it still requires advanced knowledge on the influence of polymer kind and solution properties on electrospinning many electrospun nanofibres are made from organic solvents which can be toxic volatile and poisonous in nature it can risk both human health and our environment green electrospinning agarwal and greiner 2011 stresses on greener solutions or solvent free electrospinning needs to be highlighted more in this field melt electrospinning can become a better alternative as it focuses on the avoidance of toxic free solvents the hydrophilicity of the polymers often lowers their mechanical strength and thus limits their use most of the recent works focus on the treatment of a particular group of edcs heavy metals medicines pesticides fabrication of electrospun nanofibres capable of separating various species simultaneously is a big challenge the majority of the methods used for its synthesis such as in situ polymerization remain limited within the boundaries of the lab and are not apposite for industrial manufacturing fabrication of polymer scaffolds that are not reactive towards the environment or sensing material is also a big challenge more research should be done towards making portable sensors many times electrospinning fails to fabricate dense membranes which are essential for processes like nanofiltration membrane fouling also limits their use in filtration multi fluid electrospinning wang et al 2020 can give a mileage to the electrospinning process and increase its capability to form new nanostructures the most commonly used forms of multi fluid electrospinning are co axial side by side and tri axial electrospinning as discussed earlier co axial electrospinning is used to form core shell or hollow nanofibre on the other hand side by side electrospinning also known as janus electrospinning forms janus nanofibre gupta and wilkes 2003 pioneered the formation of janus nanofibre through the process of electrospinning it is mostly prepared by two types of spinnerets where either there are two cylinders placed next to each other side by side or there is a smaller cylinder that comes into contact with a larger one internally these janus nanofibres have excellent sensing li et al 2020 and photocatalytic h liu et al 2019 activity which can be extended towards the treatment of edcs in near future similarly tri axial electrospinning involves the use of a spinneret which consists of a concentric arrangement of three cylinders it can also be used to fabricate core shell and hollow nanofibre khan et al 2021 thus multi fluid electrospinning has the potential to become the future of the electrospinning field 10 conclusion recently researchers have concentrated more on using electrospun nanofibre as a means to sense adsorb filter and degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs electrospun nanofibre has proven to have multiple advantages over conventional water treatment techniques which have failed in filtering out the common edcs properties like a high surface area to volume ratio good porosity and enhanced water permeability make them suitable enough for treating edcs in the waste water electrospinning has emerged as the most convenient pocket friendly and easy technique for the production of nanofibre various researches show that electrospun nanofibre can detect common edcs even at low concentrations however despite its multi faceted roles the use of nanofibre for edc treatment has remained restricted within the premises of laboratories researchers need to devise suitable methods that can make industrial manufacturing of electrospun nanofibre possible at a large scale which in turn will increase its practical applications with the development in the existing technologies like needleless and multifluid electrospinning the drawbacks can be easily overcome in near future as the quest for new techniques to treat the edcs is the basic need of the hour electrospun nanofibres show the potential to become the new vista in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors wish to appreciate dst west bengal the

11864,this study reviewed groundwater fluoride and the associated human health risks in ghana the physical and chemical properties of fluorine that make it soluble in the soil and aquifer materials were carefully reviewed the pathways through which fluoride gets into groundwater were also reviewed fluoride concentrations in groundwater can be as high as 67 mg l its natural concentration in water depends largely on the nature of the geologic formations fluoride bearing minerals anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials oh for f ph temperature and residence time of waters within a particular formation high f concentrations in groundwater are due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana are only restricted to northern ghana where elevated groundwater fluoride concentrations 0 05 13 29 mg l in the north east region northern region upper east region and surrounding communities have been reported the elevated groundwater fluoride concentrations are as a result of intense water rock interaction ion exchange reactions and mineral dissolution from the bongo granitoids and voltaian sediments children in the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana are exposed to the intake of more fluoridated water than the other age groups and thus children have higher non carcinogenic risks although almost all the age groups show evidence of dental fluorosis children are the hypersensitive population it is recommended that sustainable defluoridation methods such as adsorption precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange techniques be employed to curtail the menace of dental fluorosis graphical abstract image 1 keywords defluoridation techniques dental fluorosis fluoride contamination groundwater northern ghana sustainable fluoride mitigation 1 introduction fluorine is a halogen that naturally exists in the form of fluoride f due to its high reactivity and electronegativity ganyaglo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 murray et al 2021 it constitutes about 0 06 0 09 of the earth s crust been the 13th most abundant element rusiniak et al 2021 fluoride f occurs in waters in varied concentrations jacks et al 2005 brindha and elango 2011 dar et al 2011 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a b its natural concentration in waters depends largely on the nature of the geologic formations fluoride bearing minerals anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials oh for f ph alkalinity temperature and residence time of waters within a particular formation saxena and ahmed 2001 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 zango et al 2019 some of the minerals that have the greatest impact on the hydrogeochemistry of fluoride are fluorite apatite mica amphiboles some clay minerals such as illite montmorillinite and kaolinite and villiamite dar et al 2011 sunkari et al 2018 fluoride is colourless tasteless or scentless when dissolved in water thereby making it difficult to be determined through physical examination its concentrations in waters can only be determined by chemical analysis brindha and elango 2011 fluoride causes health problems in people all over the world a concentration of at least 0 6 mg l promotes growth of human teeth and bones narbutaitė et al 2007 intake of groundwater with fluoride levels exceeding 1 5 mg l will eventually lead to dental fluorosis sunkari et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 aravinthasamy et al 2020 zango et al 2021 ijumulana et al 2021 a further consumption of higher concentration will result in skeletal fluorosis brindha and elango 2011 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 there are several ways of mitigating fluoride contamination in groundwater these methods include dilution of the groundwater contaminated with fluoride adsorption ion exchange and precipitation among others preference of any of these methods depends on the affordability magnitude of the contamination of groundwater as well as the origin of the contaminants whether it is natural or anthropogenic bannerman and ayibotele 1984 apambire et al 1997 abugri and pelig ba 2011 brindha and elango 2011 kimambo et al 2019 ghana is one of the fluorosis endemic countries in west africa the highly fluoridated parts of ghana are mainly restricted to the northern fringes of the country which are largely dominated by varying lithologies involving rocks belonging to the birimian supergroup and the voltaian supergroup fig 1 these rocks are mainly volcanic and sedimentary rocks that are intruded by granitoids fig 1 the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana have been the focus of many researchers in the past decades apambire et al 1997 anku et al 2009 atipoka 2009 salifu et al 2012 yidana et al 2012 firempong et al 2013 alfredo et al 2014 craig et al 2015 2018 anornu et al 2017 tay 2017 sunkari et al 2018 donzagla et al 2019 ganyaglo et al 2019 sunkari et al 2019 zango et al 2019 2021 zakaria et al 2021 most of these studies are localized to specific communities districts municipalities and districts in northern ghana however there is no comprehensive review on the fluoride menace to the groundwater resources in the entire country this study aims at reviewing all studies previously conducted in ghana especially in the highly fluoridated parts of northern ghana to elucidate the groundwater fluoride levels sources of fluoride enrichment in groundwater extent and severity of fluorosis and sustainable mitigation measures of high groundwater fluoride 2 mineralogy and geochemistry of fluorine fluorine f has a higher concentration of about 850 1200 mg l in intermediate igneous rocks under terrestrial conditions kabat pendias and pendias 1992 abugri and pelig ba 2011 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a b the commonest f bearing minerals involved in the mechanism of f enrichment in water are fluorite caf2 fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f biotite kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 f2 cryolite na3alf6 villiaumite naf amphiboles ca na k 0 1 ca fe li mg mn na 2 al cr fe mg mn ti 5 al si ti 8o22 oh f cl 2 and topaz al2 sio4 f2 kabata pendias and pendias 1992 ozsvath 2009 abugri and pelig ba 2011 rao 2017 sunkari et al 2018 jha and tripathi 2021 fluoride is largely adsorbed by the soil mineral components at an acidic ph usually at ph range of 6 7 larsen and widdowson 1971 perroilt et al 1976 chhabra et al 1980 omueti and jones 1980 abugri and pelig ba 2011 high groundwater f concentrations are mostly related to alkaline environments that are characterised by high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations as well as low calcium concentrations handa 1975 rao et al 1993 kundu et al 2001 edmunds and smedley 2005 jacks et al 2005 brindha and elango 2011 alkaline conditions with ph range of 7 6 8 6 facilitate the dissolution and dissociation of fluoride bearing minerals from the host rocks saxena and ahmed 2001 brindha and elango 2011 at higher ph ionic exchange occurs between f and oh ions in clay minerals such as illite kaolinite and montmorillinite and in silicate minerals such as mica and amphiboles resulting in increase of f ion concentration in groundwater gupta et al 2012 f solubility is lowest in acidic environments especially at a ph range of 5 6 5 gupta et al 2012 in mica for example the hydroxyl ions replace f as shown in equations 1 and 2 below 1 kal2 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f muscovite 2 kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg3 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f biotite according to gupta et al 2012 and malago et al 2017 the dissolution of f accounts for the presence of fluoride in groundwater in sandstone dominant aquifers for example the hydrolysis of alumino silicate minerals in sandstone aquifers produces bicarbonate ion hco3 which can enhance fluorite dissolution equation 3 3 caf2 2hco3 caco3 2f h2o co2 the sodium bicarbonate type of waters generally have high concentrations of fluoride handa 1975 chae et al 2007 brindha and elango 2011 the presence of high hco3 na and ph promotes the release of f from aquifer matrix into groundwater jacks et al 2005 brindha and elango 2011 gupta et al 2012 3 mechanism of fluoride concentration and enrichment in groundwater the mechanism of fluoride concentration and enrichment in groundwater is explicitly explained by rao 2011 and malago et al 2017 below precipitation waters get enriched in co2 from the air and soil as well as biochemical reactions of bacteria and organic matter during infiltration equations 4 and 5 resulting in an increase in ph and subsequent over saturation of caco3 4 co2 h2o h2co3 5 h2co3 hco3 h the onset of evapotranspiration coupled with dry climatic conditions lead to the precipitation of caco3 thereby leaving the soils to become alkaline with higher sodium concentration the carbonates can also be derived from the dissolution of silicate minerals through the action of h2co3 equation 6 6 cation al silicate h2co3 hydrated al silicate cation hco3 dissolved sio2 the caco3 present in the soil or aquifer material can also get dissolved as illustrated in equations 7 and 8 7 caco3 h 2f caf2 hco3 8 caf2 ca2 2f hence the f bearing minerals apatite biotite fluorite hornblende and muscovite are considered the principal sources of f in groundwater whereas phosphate fertilizers is the supplementary source of f in the water both surface water and groundwater some clay minerals are also significant sources of high fluoride concentrations in groundwater due to ion exchange between f and oh rao 2011 malago et al 2017 as the alkaline water activates the processes of dissolution and dissociation of f from the soils and weathered rocks rao et al 1993 saxena and ahmed 2001 jacks et al 2005 rao 2011 gupta et al 2012 malago et al 2017 with a simultaneous precipitation of caco3 there is a reduction in total hardness in terms of ca2 and mg2 ions and a dissolution of caf2 equations 9 and 10 9 caf2 2hco 3 caco3 2f h2o co2 10 caf2 2nahco caco3 2na 2f h2o co2 from the above equations the mechanism of high f concentration in groundwater is that f is mainly released from the f bearing minerals during infiltration by geochemical reactions and that the groundwater in its pathway is subjected to evapotranspiration due to the influence of arid climate resulting in precipitation of caco3 and a reduction in the activity of total hardness so that there is a dissolution of f malago et al 2017 rao 2011 besides the excess alkalinity activates the alkalinity in the presence of alkaline soils causing the higher concentration of f in the groundwater malago et al 2017 rao 2011 4 sources of fluoride in groundwater high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater are derived from two main sources natural lithogenic geogenic and anthropogenic kim et al 2010 brindha and elango 2011 rao 2011 ali et al 2016 geogenic sources include the nature of aquifer material and volcanic ash brindha and elango 2011 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 anthropogenic sources include phosphate fertilizers and fly ash kim et al 2010 brindha and elango 2011 4 1 geogenic sources of fluoride contamination in groundwater 4 1 1 aquifer material under normal temperature and pressure fluoride bearing minerals like cryolite and fluorite have lower solubility however when the ph becomes alkaline within a specific conductivity range of 750 1750 μs cm fluoride bearing minerals tend to have higher solubility and thus dissolve faster saxena and ahmed 2001 brindha and elango 2011 the average content of f in granitoids is 810 mg kg wedepohl 1969 brindha and elango 2011 the weathering dissolution and dissociation of these rocks facilitate mobilization of f in groundwater subsequently longer times of groundwater residence in aquifers dominated by fractured fluoride rich rocks elevate the groundwater f levels brindha and elango 2011 4 1 2 volcanic ash as mentioned volcanic rocks contain high amount of f hydrogen fluoride is one of the gases that easily dissolves in magmas and is partly dissipated during volcanic eruption d alessandro 2006 brindha and elango 2011 during volcanic eruption f is emitted in the form of volcanic ash this falls out as particulate f and also together with precipitating water percolating and infiltrating waters will finally mobilize f into groundwater this accounts for the f contamination in areas where volcanic eruption is common for example iceland fridriksson 1983 steingrímsson 1998 brindha and elango 2011 walser et al 2020 the solubility of volcanic ash is very high and hence the risk of f contamination in groundwater is very high it has been established that volcanic sources are the main cause of groundwater f contamination in kenya gaciri and davies 1993 brindha and elango 2011 the f concentration in ash from hekla eruption in 2010 was found to be in the range of 23 35 mg kg matvælastofnun 2010 brindha and elango 2011 4 1 3 calcretes sepiolite and palygorskite calcretes are common in regolith overlying granitic rocks and are composed of microcrystalline calcite with variable concentration of mg 3 mol mgco3 reddy et al 2010 they are reported as a common source of f in groundwater for example jacks et al 2005 reported fluorine concentrations of calcretes in india ranging from 510 to 9000 mg kg jacks et al 2005 suggested that the fluorine is released from solution by co precipitation with calcite and dolomite moreover fan et al 2003 also indicated that sorption of fluorine on calcite surfaces is also a mechanism of fluorine mobilization in calcretes and subsequently in groundwater another possible site for the sorption of fluorine is the presence of sepiolite and palygorskite in calcrete deposits reddy et al 2010 sepiolite is less stable and palygorskite easily weathers into smectite singer et al 1995 these clay minerals are mg hydroxysilicates and are reported to contain significant amounts of f in the oh positions reddy et al 2010 for instance about 1 3 of f in a spanish sepiolite which is in equilibrium with 2 mg l of f in groundwater was reported by torres ruiz et al 1994 similarly fluoride rich sepiolite and palygorskite in sandy soils in south africa and iran were reported by singer et al 1995 and khademi and mermut 1999 respectively in both cases the authors suggested that formation of the fluoride rich sepiolite and palygorskite occurred after calcrete precipitation under alkaline soil conditions this suggests that alkaline ph plays a major role in mobilization of f in sepiolite and palygorskite 4 2 anthropogenic sources of fluoride contamination 4 2 1 phosphate fertilizers the application of phosphate fertilizers on agricultural lands increases f contamination in soil and groundwater motalane and strydom 2004 farooqi et al 2007 brindha and elango 2011 analysis of f content in phosphate fertilizers yielded the following superphosphate 2750 mg of f kg potash 10 mg of f kg and npk nitrogen phosphorous potassium 1675 mg of f kg all contain reasonable amounts of f brindha and elango 2011 4 2 2 fly ash combustion of fossil fuels produces fly ash which also accounts for high f contamination in soil and for that matter in groundwater worldwide combustion of coal especially those used in firing power plants is estimated to also produce about 150 million tons of fly ash worldwide annually prasad and mondal 2006 piekos and paslawska 1998 brindha and elango 2011 churchill et al 1948 reported that coal contains 40 295 mg of f kg they however observed that the f content of coal depends on the type and amount of coal being burnt the use of coal by brick kilns for burning is also not a negligible source for f contamination jha et al 2008 brindha and elango 2011 improper disposal of fly ash may cause leaching of f into soil and groundwater brindha and elango 2011 5 socio economic and health implications of high groundwater fluoride water for domestic purposes especially drinking water is the major source of f intake in humans antwi et al 2011 most of the people affected by highly fluoridated groundwater are low income earners and they largely live in the tropical countries arid and semi arid regions where the per capita consumption of water is high due the dry climatic conditions kim et al 2010 in ghana for instance the daily consumption of water is about 3 4 l day per adult which is higher than the who estimated daily consumption of 2 l day per adult apambire et al 1997 kim et al 2010 indicating that people are more exposed to the threat of fluorosis the intensity is also higher in densely populated countries like india and china gupta et al 2006 kim et al 2010 the who recommends a minimum of 0 6 mg l and a maximum of 1 5 mg l as the permissible limits of f intake into the human body who 2008 any intake of f concentration below or above these limits will result in the associated negative health impacts the most common impact is fluorosis a health condition caused by intake of f greater than 1 5 mg l children below the age of eight are the most affected antwi et al 2011 fluorosis comes in different forms dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis narbutaitė et al 2007 antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 ijumulana et al 2021 dental fluorosis 1 5 4 mg l of f is characterised by staining and pitting of the teeth and may eventually lead to damage of the enamel in severe cases who 2008 antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 a further accumulation of f 4 mg l in the bones over years will lead to skeletal fluorosis crippling fluorosis 10 mg l thyroid changes 50 mg l growth retardation 100 mg l and kidney problems 120 mg l as they facilitate the formation of kidney stones who 2001 2002 antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 also an intake of f concentration of 0 5 mg l or less into the human body has the potential of causing dental caries antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 other health implications that could occur owing to the intake of highly fluoridated water include low haemoglobin levels muscle fibre degeneration excessive thirst deformities in rbcs skin rashes headache nervousness depression neurological manifestations gastrointestinal problems urinary tract malfunctioning nausea abdominal pain reduced immunity tingling sensation in fingers and toes low iq male sterility repeated abortions or still births and other genotoxic effects li et al 1988 tang et al 2008 brindha and elango 2011 6 groundwater fluoride hotspots in ghana a summary of the groundwater f concentrations in northern ghana is given in table 1 the occurrence of high f concentrations in groundwater has been reported in parts of the savelugu municipality tay 2017 and parts of the gushiegu municipality maxwell et al 2012 both in the northern region of ghana fig 1 table 1 the bongo district and its surrounding areas parts of the bolgatanga municipality in the upper east region of ghana northeastern ghana are of epidemic levels apambire et al 1997 pelig ba 1987 apambire et al 1997 abugri and pelig ba 2011 antwi et al 2011 yidana et al 2012 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 fig 1 recently zango et al 2019 reported extremely high f concentrations 0 05 13 29 mg l in groundwater resources within the newly created north east region of ghana fig 1 table 1 they suggested that the high groundwater f is due to the semi arid climatic conditions of the region alkaline nature of the water water rock interaction mineral dissolution and ion exchange reactions tay 2017 found high concentrations of f in the northern part of the savelugu municipality from zoosali to nyoglo in the range of 1 5 3 0 mg l high above the who accepted maximum value of 1 5 mg l fig 1 table 1 anim gyampo et al 2018 established the relation between f concentration and sericite composition they established a positive relationship between f concentration and modal composition of sericite and as such sericite is the major contributor of f contamination with carbonate minerals been the minor contributors in parts of the gushiegu municipality they concluded that the voltaian supergroup is of marine environment as suggested by affaton et al 1990 high f contamination 1 71 4 4 mg l in groundwater has been reported in the bongo district and surrounding communities fig 1 table 1 which is significantly higher than the who 2017 standard value of 1 5 mg l for drinking water smedley et al 1995 atipoka 2009 abugri and pelig ba 2011 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 abanyie et al 2020 zango et al 2021 the bongo district forms part of the birimian supergroup of ghana with the bongo granitoids been the major rocks outcropping there there are high and low fluoride concentrations in the birimian supergroup fig 1 due to the variation in composition of the brimian rocks areas dominated by the birimian metavolcanic and intrusive rocks that contain abundant micas biotite and muscovite show higher groundwater fluoride concentrations than those largely overlain by birimian metasediments that contain lesser amounts of micas sunkari et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 the topography of the area is generally flat about 40 of the land surface is covered with granite outcrops thereby making farming and other activities very difficult bongo district assembly the major minerals in the granite are quartz plagioclase microcline muscovite and biotite with considerable amounts of amphiboles especially hornblende zirconium and apatite occur as accessory minerals whereas sericite and epidote are also reported locally as secondary minerals sunkari et al 2018 the mechanism of the release of f from the f bearing minerals is explained using a model by sunkari et al 2018 the f released from the regolith can be drained into neighbouring catchments and may remain within the regolith for a long time this may eventually pollute water being tapped from such reservoirs aquifers ozsvath 2006 also indicated that albite dissolution and ion exchange reactions can result in high f levels in groundwater thus the positive relationship of f with na and k na k na ca2 mg2 ratio reveal the influence of f mobility sunkari et al 2018 hence the high concentration of f in groundwater in the bongo district could be as a result of the presence of albite accounting for pinkish colouration and biotite in the bongo granitoids and pegmatite veins in the granitoids ozsvath 2009 sunkari et al 2018 7 human health risks associated with fluoridated groundwater in ghana studies on human health risk assessment of fluoridated groundwater in ghana are not readily available most of the studies only predict the presence of dental fluorosis without a detailed health risk assessment however at the time of writing this review only ganyaglo et al 2019 and zango et al 2019 conducted human health risk assessment of high groundwater fluoride in the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana whilst ganyaglo et al 2019 studied the upper east region zango et al 2019 studied the north east region of ghana these studies generally appraised the estimated daily intake of fluoridated water and the non carcinogenic human health risks associated with the various age groups infants children teenagers and adults accordingly children in northern ghana drink more fluoridated water 0 00 1 13 mg kg day than the other age groups fig 2 this implies that children are more exposed to the human health risks associated with fluoridated groundwater than the other age groups as a result previous studies have indicated that children are exposed to higher non carcinogenic human health risks like dental fluorosis in northern ghana than the other age groups fig 3 the non carcinogenic human health risks were assessed by computing the hazard quotients ganyaglo et al 2019 zango et al 2019 where if the hazard quotient exceeds 1 a potential non carcinogenic human health risk is envisaged for the consumption of fluoridated water therefore children in northern ghana who have hazard quotients ranging from 0 07 to 18 8 fig 3 are the hypersensitive population although almost all the age groups show evidence of dental fluorosis children are the most affected since they drink more fluoridated groundwater 8 sustainable mitigation measures various measures proposed by researchers for mitigation of f contamination in water are summarised in a schematic chart in fig 4 they are classified into in situ and ex situ measures fig 4 in situ methods aim at mitigating the concentration of f in the aquifer through artificial recharge bhagavan and raghu 2005 brindha and elango 2011 the ex situ methods aim at the decontamination of water at the household or community level brindha and elango 2011 8 1 in situ treatment methods check dams constructed in anantapur district india were useful in reducing f content in groundwater bhagavan and raghu 2005 according to brindha and elango 2011 rainfall recharge or rainwater harvesting can be adopted using percolation tanks and recharge pits recharge of rainwater after filtration through the existing wells can also be planned to improve the groundwater quality of a particular aquifer this method may prove useful if it is carefully planned and constructed 8 2 ex situ treatment methods the most common ex situ techniques for defluoridation are adsorption membrane separation precipitation and ion exchange abugri and pelig ba 2011 brindha and elango 2011 8 2 1 adsorption technique this method of f decontamination involves channelling water via a contact bed in which the f is adsorbed onto the matrix chidambaram et al 2003 and chauhan et al 2007 intimated that the commonly used absorbents are activated charcoal and activated alumina other absorbents that have the potential of de fluoridating groundwater are char brick bone serpentine waste mud red mud rice husk charfines bentonite kaolinite and ceramic brindha and elango 2011 effective de fluoridation by these absorbents is contingent on the initial f concentration ph contact time absorbent type and its size 8 2 2 precipitation technique this method involves addition of calcium to fluoride contaminated waters which precipitate fluoride as fluorite an alternative is the use of aluminium salts lime or alum precipitation methods are simple and cost effective brindha and elango 2011 8 2 3 membrane separation technique membrane separation technique comprises of reverse osmosis and electrodialysis both methods employ the use of a semi permeable membranes that are capable of eliminating dissolved solutes from the water when they pass through them however the two techniques are quite distinct because reverse osmosis operates with pressure whereas electrodialysis operates with direct potential reverse osmosis is also economical and the equipment can be installed at homes but electrodialysis involves a complex and massive set up and hence more expensive it is best fit for the community level both membrane techniques involve the removal of essential ions for the human body brindha and elango 2011 abugri and pelig ba 2011 are of the opinion that the membrane techniques are the appropriate technology for poor rural areas in developing countries due to their cost fouling issues operational sophistication and difficulty of intermittent operation meanwhile brindha and elango 2011 are suggested that membrane techniques are comparatively costly due to their nature 8 2 4 ion exchange technique according to brindha and elango 2011 in this method of defluoridation water passed through a column containing ion exchange resin which enables the fluoride ions to replace calcium ions in the resin when the resin is saturated with the fluoride ions it is backwashed with solution containing chloride such as sodium chloride the chloride ions will then replace the fluoride ions in the resin and the water is ready for reuse however the backwash is rich in fluoride and hence care should be taken in disposing this solution so that it does not re contaminate the defluoridated water 8 3 advantages and disadvantages of sustainable groundwater fluoride mitigation measures the proposed sustainable groundwater fluoride mitigation measures have both advantages and disadvantages ingle et al 2014 which are summarised in table 2 therefore adoption of any of them should be with caution both the advantages and disadvantages should be a guide to which technique is suitable for mitigating high groundwater fluoride menace in aquifers 9 conclusion recommendations and research gaps the presence of f bearing minerals in the host rocks and water rock interactions in an alkaline environment under dry climatic conditions have been established to be the main causes of f enrichment and contamination in groundwater chemical processes such as decomposition dissociation and dissolution are also responsible for the mobility and transport of fluoride in groundwater chemical weathering under arid to semi arid conditions with relatively high alkalinity and long residence time favours high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater the high groundwater f contamination in northern ghana can be attributed to the above mechanism due to the presence of albite and biotite in the bongo granitoids and pegmatite veins the bongo granitoids contain from 2 to more than 20 times the amount of fluorine in the surrounding rock formations the groundwater fluoride contamination has resulted in dental fluorosis particularly in children since they drink more fluoridated water than other age groups the following are recommended to mitigate high fluoride concentrations in groundwater and their impact on human health in ghana and other high fluoride zones worldwide 1 the people of northern ghana should avoid the use of phosphate fertilizers as they contribute to the anthropogenic sources of groundwater fluoride contamination they should adopt organic farming 2 afforestation should be encouraged a good vegetation cover will reduce evapotranspiration and hence deposition of fluoride bearing salts in the unsaturated zone and their subsequent infiltration into groundwater will be impeded 3 the people of northern ghana and other similar high fluoride zones should resort to the use of fluoride free toothpaste this will reduce the amount of fluoride intake into their bodies 4 the government should complement the efforts of researchers and non governmental organizations to establish defluoridation plants in northern ghana a lot of research has been done on fluoride contamination in groundwater and in identifying high fluoride zones globally but the problem of defluoridation of these fluoride waters especially groundwater still remains unsolved to a large extent especially how to reduce the high cost of the sustainable fluoride mitigation measures and make them affordable to households most of these defluoridation methods are ex situ measures with the accompanying high cost a careful look into the in situ measures where the problem is solved from the source can be of great help since fluoride contamination in groundwater is largely confined to arid and semi arid regions globally especially africa and asia future research should clearly establish the link between climate change and fluoride contamination the cost of analysing water samples is increasingly high and overburdens the limited resources of researchers as such future research should consider coming out with models to predict levels of fluoride in groundwater mobilization of fluoride residence time and fluoride migration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11864,this study reviewed groundwater fluoride and the associated human health risks in ghana the physical and chemical properties of fluorine that make it soluble in the soil and aquifer materials were carefully reviewed the pathways through which fluoride gets into groundwater were also reviewed fluoride concentrations in groundwater can be as high as 67 mg l its natural concentration in water depends largely on the nature of the geologic formations fluoride bearing minerals anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials oh for f ph temperature and residence time of waters within a particular formation high f concentrations in groundwater are due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana are only restricted to northern ghana where elevated groundwater fluoride concentrations 0 05 13 29 mg l in the north east region northern region upper east region and surrounding communities have been reported the elevated groundwater fluoride concentrations are as a result of intense water rock interaction ion exchange reactions and mineral dissolution from the bongo granitoids and voltaian sediments children in the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana are exposed to the intake of more fluoridated water than the other age groups and thus children have higher non carcinogenic risks although almost all the age groups show evidence of dental fluorosis children are the hypersensitive population it is recommended that sustainable defluoridation methods such as adsorption precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange techniques be employed to curtail the menace of dental fluorosis graphical abstract image 1 keywords defluoridation techniques dental fluorosis fluoride contamination groundwater northern ghana sustainable fluoride mitigation 1 introduction fluorine is a halogen that naturally exists in the form of fluoride f due to its high reactivity and electronegativity ganyaglo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 murray et al 2021 it constitutes about 0 06 0 09 of the earth s crust been the 13th most abundant element rusiniak et al 2021 fluoride f occurs in waters in varied concentrations jacks et al 2005 brindha and elango 2011 dar et al 2011 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a b its natural concentration in waters depends largely on the nature of the geologic formations fluoride bearing minerals anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials oh for f ph alkalinity temperature and residence time of waters within a particular formation saxena and ahmed 2001 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 zango et al 2019 some of the minerals that have the greatest impact on the hydrogeochemistry of fluoride are fluorite apatite mica amphiboles some clay minerals such as illite montmorillinite and kaolinite and villiamite dar et al 2011 sunkari et al 2018 fluoride is colourless tasteless or scentless when dissolved in water thereby making it difficult to be determined through physical examination its concentrations in waters can only be determined by chemical analysis brindha and elango 2011 fluoride causes health problems in people all over the world a concentration of at least 0 6 mg l promotes growth of human teeth and bones narbutaitė et al 2007 intake of groundwater with fluoride levels exceeding 1 5 mg l will eventually lead to dental fluorosis sunkari et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 aravinthasamy et al 2020 zango et al 2021 ijumulana et al 2021 a further consumption of higher concentration will result in skeletal fluorosis brindha and elango 2011 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 there are several ways of mitigating fluoride contamination in groundwater these methods include dilution of the groundwater contaminated with fluoride adsorption ion exchange and precipitation among others preference of any of these methods depends on the affordability magnitude of the contamination of groundwater as well as the origin of the contaminants whether it is natural or anthropogenic bannerman and ayibotele 1984 apambire et al 1997 abugri and pelig ba 2011 brindha and elango 2011 kimambo et al 2019 ghana is one of the fluorosis endemic countries in west africa the highly fluoridated parts of ghana are mainly restricted to the northern fringes of the country which are largely dominated by varying lithologies involving rocks belonging to the birimian supergroup and the voltaian supergroup fig 1 these rocks are mainly volcanic and sedimentary rocks that are intruded by granitoids fig 1 the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana have been the focus of many researchers in the past decades apambire et al 1997 anku et al 2009 atipoka 2009 salifu et al 2012 yidana et al 2012 firempong et al 2013 alfredo et al 2014 craig et al 2015 2018 anornu et al 2017 tay 2017 sunkari et al 2018 donzagla et al 2019 ganyaglo et al 2019 sunkari et al 2019 zango et al 2019 2021 zakaria et al 2021 most of these studies are localized to specific communities districts municipalities and districts in northern ghana however there is no comprehensive review on the fluoride menace to the groundwater resources in the entire country this study aims at reviewing all studies previously conducted in ghana especially in the highly fluoridated parts of northern ghana to elucidate the groundwater fluoride levels sources of fluoride enrichment in groundwater extent and severity of fluorosis and sustainable mitigation measures of high groundwater fluoride 2 mineralogy and geochemistry of fluorine fluorine f has a higher concentration of about 850 1200 mg l in intermediate igneous rocks under terrestrial conditions kabat pendias and pendias 1992 abugri and pelig ba 2011 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a b the commonest f bearing minerals involved in the mechanism of f enrichment in water are fluorite caf2

topaz al2 sio4 f2 kabata pendias and pendias 1992 ozsvath 2009 abugri and pelig ba 2011 rao 2017 sunkari et al 2018 jha and tripathi 2021 fluoride is largely adsorbed by the soil mineral components at an acidic ph usually at ph range of 6 7 larsen and widdowson 1971 perroilt et al 1976 chhabra et al 1980 omueti and jones 1980 abugri and pelig ba 2011 high groundwater f concentrations are mostly related to alkaline environments that are characterised by high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations as well as low calcium concentrations handa 1975 rao et al 1993 kundu et al 2001 edmunds and smedley 2005 jacks et al 2005 brindha and elango 2011 alkaline conditions with ph range of 7 6 8 6 facilitate the dissolution and dissociation of fluoride bearing minerals from the host rocks saxena and ahmed 2001 brindha and elango 2011 at higher ph ionic exchange occurs between f and oh ions in clay minerals such as illite kaolinite and montmorillinite and in silicate minerals such as mica and amphiboles resulting in increase of f ion concentration in groundwater gupta et al 2012 f solubility is lowest in acidic environments especially at a ph range of 5 6 5 gupta et al 2012 in mica for example the hydroxyl ions replace f as shown in equations 1 and 2 below 1 kal2 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f muscovite 2 kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg3 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f biotite according to gupta et al 2012 and malago et al 2017 the dissolution of f accounts for the presence of fluoride in groundwater in sandstone dominant aquifers for example the hydrolysis of alumino silicate minerals in sandstone aquifers produces bicarbonate ion hco3 which can enhance fluorite dissolution equation 3 3 caf2 2hco3 caco3 2f h2o co2 the sodium bicarbonate type of waters generally have high concentrations of fluoride handa 1975 chae et al 2007 brindha and elango 2011 the presence of high hco3 na and ph promotes the release of f from aquifer matrix into groundwater jacks et al 2005 brindha and elango 2011 gupta et al 2012 3 mechanism of fluoride concentration and enrichment in groundwater the mechanism of fluoride concentration and enrichment in groundwater is explicitly explained by rao 2011 and malago et al 2017 below precipitation waters get enriched in co2 from the air and soil as well as biochemical reactions of bacteria and organic matter during infiltration equations 4 and 5 resulting in an increase in ph and subsequent over saturation of caco3 4 co2 h2o h2co3 5 h2co3 hco3 h the onset of evapotranspiration coupled with dry climatic conditions lead to the precipitation of caco3 thereby leaving the soils to become alkaline with higher sodium concentration the carbonates can also be derived from the dissolution of silicate minerals through the action of h2co3 equation 6 6 cation al silicate h2co3 hydrated al silicate cation hco3 dissolved sio2 the caco3 present in the soil or aquifer material can also get dissolved as illustrated in equations 7 and 8 7 caco3 h 2f caf2 hco3 8 caf2 ca2 2f hence the f bearing minerals apatite biotite fluorite hornblende and muscovite are considered the principal sources of f in groundwater whereas phosphate fertilizers is the supplementary source of f in the water both surface water and groundwater some clay minerals are also significant sources of high fluoride concentrations in groundwater due to ion exchange between f and oh rao 2011 malago et al 2017 as the alkaline water activates the processes of dissolution and dissociation of f from the soils and weathered rocks rao et al 1993 saxena and ahmed 2001 jacks et al 2005 rao 2011 gupta et al 2012 malago et al 2017 with a simultaneous precipitation of caco3 there is a reduction in total hardness in terms of ca2 and mg2 ions and a dissolution of caf2 equations 9 and 10 9 caf2 2hco 3 caco3 2f h2o co2 10 caf2 2nahco caco3 2na 2f h2o co2 from the above equations the mechanism of high f concentration in groundwater is that f is mainly released from the f bearing minerals during infiltration by geochemical reactions and that the groundwater in its pathway is subjected to evapotranspiration due to the influence of arid climate resulting in precipitation of caco3 and a reduction in the activity of total hardness so that there is a dissolution of f malago et al 2017 rao 2011 besides the excess alkalinity activates the alkalinity in the presence of alkaline soils causing the higher concentration of f in the groundwater malago et al 2017 rao 2011 4 sources of fluoride in groundwater high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater are derived from two main sources natural lithogenic geogenic and anthropogenic kim et al 2010 brindha and elango 2011 rao 2011 ali et al 2016 geogenic sources include the nature of aquifer material and volcanic ash brindha and elango 2011 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 anthropogenic sources include phosphate fertilizers and fly ash kim et al 2010 brindha and elango 2011 4 1 geogenic sources of fluoride contamination in groundwater 4 1 1 aquifer material under normal temperature and pressure fluoride bearing minerals like cryolite and fluorite have lower solubility however when the ph becomes alkaline within a specific conductivity range of 750 1750 μs cm fluoride bearing minerals tend to have higher solubility and thus dissolve faster saxena and ahmed 2001 brindha and elango 2011 the average content of f in granitoids is 810 mg kg wedepohl 1969 brindha and elango 2011 the weathering dissolution and dissociation of these rocks facilitate mobilization of f in groundwater subsequently longer times of groundwater residence in aquifers dominated by fractured fluoride rich rocks elevate the groundwater f levels brindha and elango 2011 4 1 2 volcanic ash as mentioned volcanic rocks contain high amount of f hydrogen fluoride is one of the gases that easily dissolves in magmas and is partly dissipated during volcanic eruption d alessandro 2006 brindha and elango 2011 during volcanic eruption f is emitted in the form of volcanic ash this falls out as particulate f and also together with precipitating water percolating and infiltrating waters will finally mobilize f into groundwater this accounts for the f contamination in areas where volcanic eruption is common for example iceland fridriksson 1983 steingrímsson 1998 brindha and elango 2011 walser et al 2020 the solubility of volcanic ash is very high and hence the risk of f contamination in groundwater is very high it has been established that volcanic sources are the main cause of groundwater f contamination in kenya gaciri and davies 1993 brindha and elango 2011 the f concentration in ash from hekla eruption in 2010 was found to be in the range of 23 35 mg kg matvælastofnun 2010 brindha and elango 2011 4 1 3 calcretes sepiolite and palygorskite calcretes are common in regolith overlying granitic rocks and are composed of microcrystalline calcite with variable concentration of mg 3 mol mgco3 reddy et al 2010 they are reported as a common source of f in groundwater for example jacks et al 2005 reported fluorine concentrations of calcretes in india ranging from 510 to 9000 mg kg jacks et al 2005 suggested that the fluorine is released from solution by co precipitation with calcite and dolomite moreover fan et al 2003 also indicated that sorption of fluorine on calcite surfaces is also a mechanism of fluorine mobilization in calcretes and subsequently in groundwater another possible site for the sorption of fluorine is the presence of sepiolite and palygorskite in calcrete deposits reddy et al 2010 sepiolite is less stable and palygorskite easily weathers into smectite singer et al 1995 these clay minerals are mg hydroxysilicates and are reported to contain significant amounts of f in the oh positions reddy et al 2010 for instance about 1 3 of f in a spanish sepiolite which is in equilibrium with 2 mg l of f in groundwater was reported by torres ruiz et al 1994 similarly fluoride rich sepiolite and palygorskite in sandy soils in south africa and iran were reported by singer et al 1995 and khademi and mermut 1999 respectively in both cases the authors suggested that formation of the fluoride rich sepiolite and palygorskite occurred after calcrete precipitation under alkaline soil conditions this suggests that alkaline ph plays a major role in mobilization of f in sepiolite and palygorskite 4 2 anthropogenic sources of fluoride contamination 4 2 1 phosphate fertilizers the application of phosphate fertilizers on agricultural lands increases f contamination in soil and groundwater motalane and strydom 2004 farooqi et al 2007 brindha and elango 2011 analysis of f content in phosphate fertilizers yielded the following superphosphate 2750 mg of f kg potash 10 mg of f kg and npk nitrogen phosphorous potassium 1675 mg of f kg all contain reasonable amounts of f brindha and elango 2011 4 2 2 fly ash combustion of fossil fuels produces fly ash which also accounts for high f contamination in soil and for that matter in groundwater worldwide combustion of coal especially those used in firing power plants is estimated to also produce about 150 million tons of fly ash worldwide annually prasad and mondal 2006 piekos and paslawska 1998 brindha and elango 2011 churchill et al 1948 reported that coal contains 40 295 mg of f kg they however observed that the f content of coal depends on the type and amount of coal being burnt the use of coal by brick kilns for burning is also not a negligible source for f contamination jha et al 2008 brindha and elango 2011 improper disposal of fly ash may cause leaching of f into soil and groundwater brindha and elango 2011 5 socio economic and health implications of high groundwater fluoride water for domestic purposes especially drinking water is the major source of f intake in humans antwi et al 2011 most of the people affected by highly fluoridated groundwater are low income earners and they largely live in the tropical countries arid and semi arid regions where the per capita consumption of water is high due the dry climatic conditions kim et al 2010 in ghana for instance the daily consumption of water is about 3 4 l day per adult which is higher than the who estimated daily consumption of 2 l day per adult apambire et al 1997 kim et al 2010 indicating that people are more exposed to the threat of fluorosis the intensity is also higher in densely populated countries like india and china gupta et al 2006 kim et al 2010 the who recommends a minimum of 0 6 mg l and a maximum of 1 5 mg l as the permissible limits of f intake into the human body who 2008 any intake of f concentration below or above these limits will result in the associated negative health impacts the most common impact is fluorosis a health condition caused by intake of f greater than 1 5 mg l children below the age of eight are the most affected antwi et al 2011 fluorosis comes in different forms dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis narbutaitė et al 2007 antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 ijumulana et al 2021 dental fluorosis 1 5 4 mg l of f is characterised by staining and pitting of the teeth and may eventually lead to damage of the enamel in severe cases who 2008 antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 a further accumulation of f 4 mg l in the bones over years will lead to skeletal fluorosis crippling fluorosis 10 mg l thyroid changes 50 mg l growth retardation 100 mg l and kidney problems 120 mg l as they facilitate the formation of kidney stones who 2001 2002 antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 also an intake of f concentration of 0 5 mg l or less into the human body has the potential of causing dental caries antwi et al 2011 annan 2018 other health implications that could occur owing to the intake of highly fluoridated water include low haemoglobin levels muscle fibre degeneration excessive thirst deformities in rbcs skin rashes headache nervousness depression neurological manifestations gastrointestinal problems urinary tract malfunctioning nausea abdominal pain reduced immunity tingling sensation in fingers and toes low iq male sterility repeated abortions or still births and other genotoxic effects li et al 1988 tang et al 2008 brindha and elango 2011 6 groundwater fluoride hotspots in ghana a summary of the groundwater f concentrations in northern ghana is given in table 1 the occurrence of high f concentrations in groundwater has been reported in parts of the savelugu municipality tay 2017 and parts of the gushiegu municipality maxwell et al 2012 both in the northern region of ghana fig 1 table 1 the bongo district and its surrounding areas parts of the bolgatanga municipality in the upper east region of ghana northeastern ghana are of epidemic levels apambire et al 1997 pelig ba 1987 apambire et al 1997 abugri and pelig ba 2011 antwi et al 2011 yidana et al 2012 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 fig 1 recently zango et al 2019 reported extremely high f concentrations 0 05 13 29 mg l in groundwater resources within the newly created north east region of ghana fig 1 table 1 they suggested that the high groundwater f is due to the semi arid climatic conditions of the region alkaline nature of the water water rock interaction mineral dissolution and ion exchange reactions tay 2017 found high concentrations of f in the northern part of the savelugu municipality from zoosali to nyoglo in the range of 1 5 3 0 mg l high above the who accepted maximum value of 1 5 mg l fig 1 table 1 anim gyampo et al 2018 established the relation between f concentration and sericite composition they established a positive relationship between f concentration and modal composition of sericite and as such sericite is the major contributor of f contamination with carbonate minerals been the minor contributors in parts of the gushiegu municipality they concluded that the voltaian supergroup is of marine environment as suggested by affaton et al 1990 high f contamination 1 71 4 4 mg l in groundwater has been reported in the bongo district and surrounding communities fig 1 table 1 which is significantly higher than the who 2017 standard value of 1 5 mg l for drinking water smedley et al 1995 atipoka 2009 abugri and pelig ba 2011 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 abanyie et al 2020 zango et al 2021 the bongo district forms part of the birimian supergroup of ghana with the bongo granitoids been the major rocks outcropping there there are high and low fluoride concentrations in the birimian supergroup fig 1 due to the variation in composition of the brimian rocks areas dominated by the birimian metavolcanic and intrusive rocks that contain abundant micas biotite and muscovite show higher groundwater fluoride concentrations than those largely overlain by birimian metasediments that contain lesser amounts of micas sunkari et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 the topography of the area is generally flat about 40 of the land surface is covered with granite outcrops thereby making farming and other activities very difficult bongo district assembly the major minerals in the granite are quartz plagioclase microcline muscovite and biotite with considerable amounts of amphiboles especially hornblende zirconium and apatite occur as accessory minerals whereas sericite and epidote are also reported locally as secondary minerals sunkari et al 2018 the mechanism of the release of f from the f bearing minerals is explained using a model by sunkari et al 2018 the f released from the regolith can be drained into neighbouring catchments and may remain within the regolith for a long time this may eventually pollute water being tapped from such reservoirs aquifers ozsvath 2006 also indicated that albite dissolution and ion exchange reactions can result in high f levels in groundwater thus the positive relationship of f with na and k na k na ca2 mg2 ratio reveal the influence of f mobility sunkari et al 2018 hence the high concentration of f in groundwater in the bongo district could be as a result of the presence of albite accounting for pinkish colouration and biotite in the bongo granitoids and pegmatite veins in the granitoids ozsvath 2009 sunkari et al 2018 7 human health risks associated with fluoridated groundwater in ghana studies on human health risk assessment of fluoridated groundwater in ghana are not readily available most of the studies only predict the presence of dental fluorosis without a detailed health risk assessment however at the time of writing this review only ganyaglo et al 2019 and zango et al 2019 conducted human health risk assessment of high groundwater fluoride in the fluorosis endemic parts of ghana whilst ganyaglo et al 2019 studied the upper east region zango et al 2019 studied the north east region of ghana these studies generally appraised the estimated daily intake of fluoridated water and the non carcinogenic human health risks associated with the various age groups infants children teenagers and adults accordingly children in northern ghana drink more fluoridated water 0 00 1 13 mg kg day than the other age groups fig 2 this implies that children are more exposed to the human health risks associated with fluoridated groundwater than the other age groups as a result previous studies have indicated that children are exposed to higher non carcinogenic human health risks like dental fluorosis in northern ghana than the other age groups fig 3 the non carcinogenic human health risks were assessed by computing the hazard quotients ganyaglo et al 2019 zango et al 2019 where if the hazard quotient exceeds 1 a potential non carcinogenic human health risk is envisaged for the consumption of fluoridated water therefore children in northern ghana who have hazard quotients ranging from 0 07 to 18 8 fig 3 are the hypersensitive population although almost all the age groups show evidence of dental fluorosis children are the most affected since they drink more fluoridated groundwater 8 sustainable mitigation measures various measures proposed by researchers for mitigation of f contamination in water are summarised in a schematic chart in fig 4 they are classified into in situ and ex situ measures fig 4 in situ methods aim at mitigating the concentration of f in the aquifer through artificial recharge bhagavan and raghu 2005 brindha and elango 2011 the ex situ methods aim at the decontamination of water at the household or community level brindha and elango 2011 8 1 in situ treatment methods check dams constructed in anantapur district india were useful in reducing f content in groundwater bhagavan and raghu 2005 according to brindha and elango 2011 rainfall recharge or rainwater harvesting can be adopted using percolation tanks and recharge pits recharge of rainwater after filtration through the existing wells can also be planned to improve the groundwater quality of a particular aquifer this method may prove useful if it is carefully planned and constructed 8 2 ex situ treatment methods the most common ex situ techniques for defluoridation are adsorption membrane separation precipitation and ion exchange abugri and pelig ba 2011 brindha and elango 2011 8 2 1 adsorption technique this method of f decontamination involves channelling water via a contact bed in which the f is adsorbed onto the matrix chidambaram et al 2003 and chauhan et al 2007 intimated that the commonly used absorbents are activated charcoal and activated alumina other absorbents that have the potential of de fluoridating groundwater are char brick bone serpentine waste mud red mud rice husk charfines bentonite kaolinite and ceramic brindha and elango 2011 effective de fluoridation by these absorbents is contingent on the initial f concentration ph contact time absorbent type and its size 8 2 2 precipitation technique this method involves addition of calcium to fluoride contaminated waters which precipitate fluoride as fluorite an alternative is the use of aluminium salts lime or alum precipitation methods are simple and cost effective brindha and elango 2011 8 2 3 membrane separation technique membrane separation technique comprises of reverse osmosis and electrodialysis both methods employ the use of a semi permeable membranes that are capable of eliminating dissolved solutes from the water when they pass through them however the two techniques are quite distinct because reverse osmosis operates with pressure whereas electrodialysis operates with direct potential reverse osmosis is also economical and the equipment can be installed at homes but electrodialysis involves a complex and massive set up and hence more expensive it is best fit for the community level both membrane techniques involve the removal of essential ions for the human body brindha and elango 2011 abugri and pelig ba 2011 are of the opinion that the membrane techniques are the appropriate technology for poor rural areas in developing countries due to their cost fouling issues operational sophistication and difficulty of intermittent operation meanwhile brindha and elango 2011 are suggested that membrane techniques are comparatively costly due to their nature 8 2 4 ion exchange technique according to brindha and elango 2011 in this method of defluoridation water passed through a column containing ion exchange resin which enables the fluoride ions to replace calcium ions in the resin when the resin is saturated with the fluoride ions it is backwashed with solution containing chloride such as sodium chloride the chloride ions will then replace the fluoride ions in the resin and the water is ready for reuse however the backwash is rich in fluoride and hence care should be taken in disposing this solution so that it does not re contaminate the defluoridated water 8 3 advantages and disadvantages of sustainable groundwater fluoride mitigation measures the proposed sustainable groundwater fluoride mitigation measures have both advantages and disadvantages ingle et al 2014 which are summarised in table 2 therefore adoption of any of them should be with caution both the advantages and disadvantages should be a guide to which technique is suitable for mitigating high groundwater fluoride menace in aquifers 9 conclusion recommendations and research gaps the presence of f bearing minerals in the host rocks and water rock interactions in an alkaline environment under dry climatic conditions have been established to be the main causes of f enrichment and contamination in groundwater chemical processes such as decomposition dissociation and dissolution are also responsible for the mobility and transport of fluoride in groundwater chemical weathering under arid to semi arid conditions with relatively high alkalinity and long residence time favours high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater the high groundwater f contamination in northern ghana can be attributed to the above mechanism due to the presence of albite and biotite in the bongo granitoids and pegmatite veins the bongo granitoids contain from 2 to more than 20 times the amount of fluorine in the surrounding rock formations the groundwater fluoride contamination has resulted in dental fluorosis particularly in children since they drink more fluoridated water than other age groups the following are recommended to mitigate high fluoride concentrations in groundwater and their impact on human health in ghana and other high fluoride zones worldwide 1 the people of northern ghana should avoid the use of phosphate fertilizers as they contribute to the anthropogenic sources of groundwater fluoride contamination they should adopt organic farming 2 afforestation should be encouraged a good vegetation cover will reduce evapotranspiration and hence deposition of fluoride bearing salts in the unsaturated zone and their subsequent infiltration into groundwater will be impeded 3 the people of northern ghana and other similar high fluoride zones should resort to the use of fluoride free toothpaste this will reduce the amount of fluoride intake into their bodies 4 the government should complement the efforts of researchers and non governmental organizations to establish defluoridation plants in northern ghana a lot of research has been done on fluoride contamination in groundwater and in identifying high fluoride zones globally but the problem of defluoridation of these fluoride waters especially groundwater still remains unsolved to a large extent especially how to reduce the high cost of the sustainable fluoride mitigation measures and make them affordable to households most of these defluoridation methods are ex situ measures with the accompanying high cost a careful look into the in situ measures where the problem is solved from the source can be of great help since fluoride contamination in groundwater is largely confined to arid and semi arid regions globally especially africa and asia future research should clearly establish the link between climate change and fluoride contamination the cost of analysing water samples is increasingly high and overburdens the limited resources of researchers as such future research should consider coming out with models to predict levels of fluoride in groundwater mobilization of fluoride residence time and fluoride migration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
