17140,efficient management of sewer blockages requires increased preventive maintenance planning conventional approaches to the management of blockages in sewer pipe networks constitute largely unplanned maintenance stemming from a lack of adequate information and diagnosis of blockage causative mechanisms this study mainly investigated a spatial statistical approach to determine the influence of explanatory factors on increased blockage propensity in sewers based on spatial heterogeneity the approach consisted of the network k function analysis which provided an understanding of the significance of the spatial variation of blockages a geographically weighted poisson regression then showed the degree of influence that explanatory factors had on increased blockage propensity in differentiated segments of the sewer pipe network lastly blockage recurrence predictions were carried out with random forest ensembles this approach was applied to three municipalities explanatory factors such as material type number of service connections self cleaning velocity sagging pipes root intrusion risk closed circuit television inspection grade and distance to restaurants showed significant spatial heterogeneity and varying impacts on blockage propensity the random forest ensemble predicted blockage recurrence with 60 80 accuracy for data from two municipalities and below 50 for the last this approach provides knowledge that supports proactive maintenance planning in the management of blockages in sewer pipe networks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords network k function geographically weighted poisson regression random forest ensembles maintenance prioritisation proactive maintenance 1 introduction sewer pipe network blockages are one of the challenges faced by municipalities and water authorities fontecha et al 2016 maintenance of sewer blockages can be made more efficient by planning preventive maintenance operations fontecha et al 2016 however preventive maintenance planning and execution are difficult to perform effectively because blockage failures often result from a combination of factors or processes that are challenging to isolate jin and mukherjee 2010 recent findings indicate that random and recurrent sewer blockages are increasing despite municipalities attempts to implement preventive maintenance xie et al 2017 previous research regarding the identification of causative mechanisms of sewer pipe blockages has been performed using either physical or stochastic models santos et al 2017 stochastic models have shown improved results mainly in attempts to predict blockage related failures in sewer pipes santos et al 2017 another benefit of stochastic models is their capability of managing data scarcity and the complexity of sewer blockage occurrence pulido et al 2019 stochastic models developed which have had some measure of success characterising blockages in sewer pipe networks include the non homogeneous poisson process rostum 2000 evolutionary polynomial regression savić et al 2006 zero inflated non homogeneous poisson process rajani and kleiner 2001 weibull accreted lifetime model and linear extended yule process le gat 2014 martins et al 2013 key factors that have shown a strong correlation to increased incidents of sewer blockages include but are not limited to pipe age diameter material length gradient slope sagging tree root intrusion presence of fats oils and grease fog construction quality and human behavioural patterns savic et al 2006 cook et al 2008 ugarelli et al 2009 jin and mukherjee 2010 rodríguez et al 2012 mattsson et al 2014 cherqui et al 2015 santos et al 2017 xie et al 2017 nieuwenhuis et al 2018 pulido et al 2019 however blockage occurrence persists due to a complex combination of factors and isolation of the most prevalent factors or set of factors is critical to the development of efficient maintenance solutions rodríguez et al 2012 in addition correlations between sewer blockage propensity and external environmental factors such as foodservice outlets high density dwellings and potential tree root intrusion have not been adequately corroborated by statistical methods reasons why such analyses have not been explored thoroughly includes the lack of historical failure data and necessary geographical data such as the location proximity of trees to the sewer pipes and proximity of food service establishments to pipes as well as a lack of digitalisation of these types of data previous approaches used to investigate the spatial variability of blockages by hotspot analysis with kernel density estimation kde cook et al 2008 cherqui et al 2015 agnone et al 2017 assumed blockages to occur on a continuously plane lamb et al 2016 this assumption leads to an overestimation of clustering of blockages or false conclusions because blockages do not occur anywhere on a continuous plane only in pipes on sewer networks the network k function was developed to overcome this limitation and has been applied in a few studies such as traffic collision incidents on a road network fan et al 2018 however it has not yet been applied to assess the spatial variability of blockages and its link to factors affecting blockages statistical approaches are reportedly preferred for modelling sewer blockages due to the extensive and complex amount of factors influencing blockages post et al 2017 previous approaches employed were generally a form of multilevel model regression global regression these approaches estimated blockage and blockage patterns using associated explanatory variables which imply global relationships although reasonable these global relationships may mask some local relationships which can provide more in depth insight into the occurrence of random and recurring blockages bui et al 2018 geographically weighted regression gwr is a spatial statistical approach which models local relationships an initial attempt to investigate factors affecting blockages with a generalised form of gwr was carried out by kimani ngaruiya and ngigi 2014 however the investigation only considered a limited number of factors income vandalism number of households and areas with high low water supply due to rationing and did not include the physical properties of sewer pipes furthermore the generalised form of gwr assumes a gaussian distribution for blockages which has been reported as not being a strictly accurate way to characterise blockages for stochastic modelling xie et al 2017 the geographically weighted poisson regression gwpr variant assumes a poisson distribution for blockages rather than a gaussian distribution and has been reported to be more appropriate for modelling count data nakaya et al 2005 gwpr has been used in various contexts including traffic collision prediction modelling hadayeghi et al 2010 analysis of food malnutrition saefuddin et al 2013 and country level vehicle crash modelling zhibin li et al 2013 however none of the previous studies on sewer pipe blockages has used gwpr to model the intensity of blockages or assess the impact of factors affecting blockages on a sewer network due to its applicability to large datasets and nil requirement for conformance to particular statistical distributions jin and mukherjee 2010 random forest rf ensembles breiman 2001 have increasingly been investigated for predicting blockages bailey et al 2016 hassouna et al 2019 however the results of those studies have shown that the performance of rf ensembles for blockage predictions can be improved therefore santos et al 2017 and hassouna et al 2019 have suggested investigations with datasets consisting of different factors towards improved robustness of blockage predictions furthermore there is a need to assess the efficiency use of rf ensembles for blockage predictions this study s main objective was to evaluate a procedure for analysing sewer blockages using the network k function and gwpr the procedure captures the spatial heterogeneity between blockages and factors that necessitate the occurrence of blockages and works towards improving the understanding of influential factors affecting blockages in sewers the increased robustness of random forest rf ensembles via prediction of blockage recurrence and determination of the most important variables for predicting blockages were also investigated in this study 2 materials and methods data methods analysis steps and expected outcomes of the evaluated procedure for analysing sewer blockages are summarised and presented in fig 1 data collected to evaluate the procedure was sourced from both the physical properties of the pipe network and external environmental factors potentially influencing increased blockage propensity the procedure presented in fig 1 was demonstrated in three municipalities a b and c the characteristics of the sewer systems and summary of blockage records in these municipalities are presented in table 1 figs 1 3 in supplementary data provide schematic representations of the sewer networks blockage rates for the three municipalities are reported to be about twice the swedish average hedström et al 2016 and less than greater or equal to the recommended threshold value of 0 25 no km year annika malm et al 2012 for the municipalities a b and c respectively furthermore when compared with blockage rates reported in other locations blockage rates in the investigated municipalities were found to be higher than rates reported in norway trondheim 0 096 per km year hafskjold et al 2002 and oslo 0 176 per km year ugarelli et al 2009 and lower than rates reported in australia 0 3 0 65 per km year marlow et al 2011 the united kingdom 0 2 0 9 per km year hillas 2014 bailey et al 2015 and bogota 1 5 per km year rodríguez et al 2012 the main reasons for blockages reported in these studies included age diameter material type gradient flow regime property density non disposables wet wipes and sediment deposition 2 1 data the factors investigated in the study were selected based on data availability in municipalities where the procedure was demonstrated table 2 the factors are categorised into the physical properties of the pipe network ppn and external environmental factors eef table 2 also includes the description unit range and availability status of factors the data for these factors are sourced from municipal databases for water and wastewater as well as publicly available external databases with data such as population census information e g statistics sweden scb the completeness of the datasets available for municipality a b and c was assessed and is presented in table 3 only factors with incomplete data are presented in table 3 along with the corresponding percentages of incompleteness factors with 35 and above missing data were excluded to decrease the uncertainty bold in table 3 2 2 methods sewer blockage data and its influential factors were analysed following the procedure described in fig 1 the procedure first investigated the presence of spatial variability of blockages observed in the sewer pipe network using the network k function method section 2 2 1 subsequently the relative degree of impact of factors influencing blockages was determined using gwpr section 2 2 2 finally blockage recurrence predictions were performed with the aim of improving the robustness of random forest ensembles described in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 network k function the network k function was used in this study to analyse the spatial variability of random and recurrent blockages in the sewer pipe network the spatial variability assessment was performed by testing the null hypotheses that blockages were independently uniformly distributed over the sewer pipe network the network k function k n e t is defined and described based on yamada and okabe 2000 see eq 1 1 k n e t r ι l n n 1 i 1 n j 0 n 1 d l x i x j r ι l denotes the total length of the network the pipe locations where blockages have occurred are denoted by x 1 x n with n denoting the total number of pipes with blockages d l x i x j denotes an observation window with all network pipe locations that can be reached which are shorter than the shortest path distance r which replaces the euclidean planar distance on the sewer pipe network in essence d l x i x j represents a two dimensional area of an observation window by a one dimensional length of the network the network k function assumes random arbitrary points chosen via a homogeneous binomial point process and computes a theoretical pattern across the sewer pipe network fan et al 2018 this theoretical pattern indicates statistically significant spatial independence of observations at a 95 confidence interval computed via monte carlo simulations yamada and okabe 2000 the knet is compared with the theoretical pattern to evaluate spatial variability the results of the network k function analysis were plotted with spatstat package in r statistical software baddeley et al 2016 2 2 2 geographical weighted poisson regression gwpr gwpr is a spatial statistical method for investigating non stationary spatial processes alves et al 2016 in this study gwpr was used to identify the strength of the association significance and magnitude of impact between blockages and factors table 2 gwpr modelling was performed separately for each of the three municipalities evaluated the coefficients obtained from the gwpr modelling parameter estimates were estimated by applying a poisson regression model where the likelihood estimation was geographically weighted with weights defined by a kernel function centred on pipe location coordinates nakaya et al 2005 the gwpr model expression for this study is presented in eq 2 2 i n y i p o i s s o n k 1 m β k c i x i k ε i i 1 2 3 n where c i u i v i denotes the coordinates of a pipe within the network at an ith location y i describes the total number of blockages per pipe over the assessment period β k is the parameter estimates unique to sewer pipes within the pipe network for a factor x i k table 2 at the ith location and ε represents an error term noise respectively m is the total number of independent variables factors as per tables 2 and 3 evaluated for each municipality the spatial heterogeneity is then investigated expressed as a matrix as shown in eq 3 3 β β i o c 1 β i 1 c 1 β k c 1 β i o c 2 β i 1 c 2 β k c 2 β i o c n β i 1 c n β k c n where n is the number of pipes in the analysed pipe network and its distance is determined by each pipe weight wn to the regression point pipes closest to the regression points have a higher weight compared to pipes further away the parameters for each pipe forming a row in the matrix are described by eq 4 4 β x t w c 1 1 x t w c 1 y where xt is a matrix of the independent variables with a column of 1 s for the intercept y is the dependant variable vector and w c 1 denotes an x by x geographical diagonal spatial weights matrix which is expressed as w 5 w w 1 0 0 w n w 1 is the weight given for each pipe in the network during the calibration of the model weights were applied through a smoothly decaying function of the distance between pipes in the network according to a bi square kernel function because it supports minimisation of errors nakaya et al 2005 alves et al 2016 spatial variability maps parameter estimates between factors and increased blockage propensity were developed these maps showed the degree of influence of these factors on the network as percentages determined through the interpretation of parameter estimates based on hilbe 2014 a threshold of 10 and above was used to indicate significant and impactful factors the standalone software gwr4 mgwr mgwr 1 0 sparc website developed by oshan et al 2019 was used for this analysis in conjunction with the gw model package in r statistical software and qgis 3 84 the gwpr modelling results were calibrated by bandwidth size determined by the corrected akaike information criterion aicc comparison pirdavani et al 2014 the optimal aicc value for the most suitable bandwidth for the modelling was determined by successively narrowing the range of values inside the window in which the optimal value exists for each municipality model bivand 2017 the results were first validated using the variance inflation factor vif to diagnose the presence of multicollinearity in the gwpr results parameter estimates nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the presence of multicollinearity amongst the parameter estimates implies that estimates are not unique and as such no convincing interpretation can be drawn pirdavani et al 2014 vif values less than or equal to 10 have been reported as a reasonable cut off threshold indicating the presence of no multicollinearity pirdavani et al 2014 secondly a calculated pseudo p value smaller than 0 05 indicated statistically significant spatial relationships between the factors and the sewer blockages in the network at a 95 confidence level i e non random statistically significant relationships parameter estimates were determined during the modelling process via a spatial variability test that shuffled observations in space then re calibrated the gwpr model on randomised data while keeping the model specification constant furthermore the test then compared the parameter estimates from the randomised observations to the parameter estimates for each pipe in the network this process was repeated 1000 times via a monte carlo simulation the number of times the parameter estimates of the fitted model was higher than that of the randomised data was used to construct pseudo p values for hypothesis testing oshan et al 2019 when presenting the gwpr results maps of parameter estimates for each factor mennis 2006 recommended approaches to mitigate the challenge of misinterpreting mapped results these approaches were incorporated into the gwpr modelling process and mapping 2 2 3 random forest ensembles the critical parameters for rf prediction include the number of trees 1000 trees used here the trees were generated through bagging and a random subset of the data trained each node the out of bag oob error was used to minimise the generalisation error breiman 2001 four factors were selected randomly by the random forest algorithm based on importance ranking i e mean gini decrease the rf modelling dataset was randomly divided into one training and one validation set for each municipality using a 70 30 split training validation the data consisted of all the pipes in the sewer pipe network with the total number of blockages experienced for each of the three municipalities along with factors previously presented in tables 2 and 3 the accuracy of the blockage recurrence predictions in this study was presented using receiver operating characteristic roc curves and area under the roc curve auc percentages rahmati et al 2016 an auc value of 100 indicates perfect prediction capability while 50 represents an accuracy which is entirely a random predictor shaikhina et al 2019 random forest predictions were carried out using mob forest package in r statistical software garge et al 2019 3 results 3 1 spatial variability in blockage occurrence using cluster analysis the network k function analysis results indicated the strongest degree of non independence in municipality a implying that the most substantial evidence of the spatial relationship between blockages in the sewer pipe network compared to b and c table 4 detailed network k function plots are presented in supplementary data fig 4 the network k function analysis is mainly a descriptive measure for testing for the presence of complete spatial randomness on a network prompting an exploratory investigation of reasons for the observed spatial variability of blockages in the sewer network furthermore clustering or dispersion may be due to multiple factors in varying locations the results of the network k function therefore require further investigation to determine the influential factors which drive the spatial variability of blockages observed in this study in municipalities a b and c 3 2 factors influencing the occurrence of blockages in the sewer pipe network the significance and magnitude degree of influence of the spatial distribution for each factor influencing increased sewer blockages in the sewer network are presented below the spatial changes positive negative in the magnitude of parameter estimates across the pipe networks indicate the local influence of the factors on blockage propensity fotheringham 2009 fig 2 shows the maps of parameter estimates for ten factors including three sub factors different pipe materials evaluated for the sewer pipe network of municipality a the maps show that parameter estimates are not global therefore indicating spatial heterogeneity of the factors locations where the magnitude of the parameter estimates are zero irrespective of colour indicate locations where the relationship between factors and blockage occurrence propensity is statistically insignificant parameter estimates of zero indicate that measures taken to change these factors would not affect blockage propensity in the sewer pipes in these locations within the municipality pipe age self cleaning velocity number of service connections and clay pipe material showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity from the municipality centre marked with red black dot towards the south and southwest of municipality a concrete poly pe pipe materials and pipes in close proximity to restaurant locations showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity in the city centre of municipality a fig 2 root intrusion cctv grade and sagging potential showed a positive correlation to blockage propensity with a sort of gradient effect from the centre towards the north northwest and northeast peripheries of municipality a fig 2 other factors assessed for municipality a which are not presented in fig 2 include length which showed a positive correlation to an increased blockage propensity increased northwards of municipality a neighbourhood population density of the age group 85 100 years also showed a positive correlation to an increased blockage propensity in the centre of municipality a pipe depth showed a negative correlation to increased blockage propensity in northeast and north of municipality a fig 3 shows the maps of parameter estimates for the three factors which showed the most significant heterogeneity in the sewer pipe network of municipality b the parameter estimates were observed to vary and were zero in locations of statistically insignificant relationships pipe age showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity from the municipality centre marked with a red black dot towards the west and east the number of service connections showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity towards the west from the centre distance to restaurants showed a negative correlation to increased blockage propensity in the central parts other factors assessed for municipality b which are not presented in fig 3 included pipe depth which showed a negative correlation to increased blockage propensity in the east central parts fig 4 shows the mapped parameter estimates for four factors which showed the most significant heterogeneity to blockage propensity in the sewer pipe network of municipality c the centre of the municipality is marked with a red black dot pipe length in the immediate vicinity north pipe material concrete in the centre of the municipality number of service connections in the northern periphery and pipes in close proximity to restaurants food service locations in the centre of the municipality all showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity similar patterns of the investigated factors that influenced blockage propensity could be observed in all three municipalities indicating that the patterns might represent relationships to blockages that may exist holistically fewer factors appear to be significant in municipalities b and c compared to a which may generally be attributed to data quality and strength of spatial variability the aicc calibration results are presented in section 3 of the supplementary data the estimated distribution of vif values for the parameter estimates of each factor evaluated for the sewer pipe networks in municipalities a b and c are presented in fig 5 vif values did not exceed 10 for all factors except one indicating no multicollinearity however the vif values for neighbourhood population density for some parameter estimates exceeded 10 indicating some multicollinearity in gwpr results which implies no dependencies were found amongst the parameter estimates wheeler 2006 therefore the parameter estimates are uniquely defined and as such conclusive interpretations may be derived from them more specifically the vif values for neighbourhood population density for municipalities a and c were higher than 10 for an estimated 25 50 of parameter estimates table 5 summaries the statistically significant factors along with their degrees of influence magnitude of parameter estimates the geographical parts of the sewer pipe networks where these factors were found to be both significant and show relatively strong influence are also highlighted finally table 5 presents an indication of which factors are important for blockage recurrence predictions based on random forest ensemble mean gini decrease values 3 3 blockage predictions roc curves showing auc values are presented in fig 6 the roc curves for municipality a yielded an auc of 76 with a confidence interval between 73 and 80 illustrating a mean recurrence prediction accuracy of 76 for municipality b an auc of 68 with a confidence interval between 65 and 74 was observed the estimated auc value for municipality c was below 50 indicating low prediction accuracy data quality was suspected as one of the possible reasons for the low auc values observed in the dataset for municipality c 4 discussion 4 1 significance of spatial variation the spatial variability of blockages when assessed with the ordinary kernel density estimation kde method ngaruiya and ngigi 2014 cherqui et al 2015 post et al 2017 pulido et al 2019 is reported to yield biased estimates okabe et al 2009 to overcome this the network kde was developed yu et al 2015 however the network kde does not adequately consider geometric network characteristics such as topology and connectivity lamb et al 2016 okabe 2017 the network k function accounts for both the bias and network geometric characteristics when compared the results of the analyses using the network k function supplementary data fig 4 and network kde supplementary data fig 5 showed that the network kde indicated clustering of blockages in municipalities a b and c the influence of the geometric characteristics of the network can be observed with the results from network k function hence it could be observed that municipalities b and c had significantly less clustering and dispersion compared to municipality a to support the effect of geometric characteristics of the network it could be observed that fewer factors were able to explain the spatial variability observed in municipalities b and c with gwpr results unknown uncertainties data availability and completeness may also contribute to the strength of spatial association observable oort 2006 4 2 influence of factors on increased blockage propensity and location variability the magnitude degree of influence between factors and increased blockage propensity provided strong evidence that these relationships were not global not the same in all locations along the sewer network and may vary between networks these non stationary relationships were observed to occur in various forms explicitly different factors showed a strong degree of influence in different locations single factors showed both positive and negative influence in different locations and different factors showed significant correlations in the same location with varying degree of influence this provides evidence that holistic network wide blockage maintenance approaches treatments may be ineffective more tailored cluster based approaches would therefore be required specific examples illustrating the above are presented below in municipality a the factors aged pipes smaller diameters clay pipes and increased number of service connections all showed a significant correlation to increased blockage propensity in the southern part of the network however the percentage of the degree of influence on increased blockage propensity ranges from 0 4 0 5 0 1 49 65 and 11 15 respectively deduction indicates clay pipes and trunk sewers with multiple joints bends are most susceptible to blockages in the southern part of municipality a from the centre towards the northern peripheries in municipality a except the northwest pipes with increased sagging potential showed a stronger degree of influence 11 15 more compared to pipes with higher root intrusion risk and higher cctv grades this explains to some degree why pipes in this area may be plagued with structural problems which may result in increased sediment deposition and higher vulnerability with close proximity to trees ultimately leading to the occurrence of blockages marlow et al 2011 desilva et al 2011 torres et al 2017 reduced depth of pipes correlating to increased blockage propensity is also observed in this area further reinforcing that structural problems which may arise from traffic wheels loads and shifting soil are also contributory in this part of municipality a davies et al 2001 pipes having higher self cleaning velocities showed a strong degree of influence 65 80 in the northeast of municipality a while pipes with lower self cleaning velocities in the south showed a degree of influence of 10 all towards increased blockage propensity it may generally be inferred that only pipes with lower self cleaning velocities experience sediment deposition hillas 2014 xie et al 2017 i e as observed in the south however pipes with higher self cleaning velocities have also been reported to experience sediment deposition suspected to result from the accumulation of coarser sediment particles at the head of sewer pipe networks bachoc 1992 ashley and hvitved jacobsen 2005 in the central parts of the municipalities concrete and plastic pipes showed a strong degree of influence to increased blockage propensity 28 50 in municipality a and with the exception of plastic pipes 65 82 in municipality c decreased distance of pipes to restaurants also showed a relatively strong degree of influence namely 45 55 in municipality b and 22 26 in municipality c this provides some evidence to support the susceptibility of pipes in close proximity to restaurants to fog build up or low operation and maintenance of grease interceptors reinforcing findings from mattsson et al 2014 and nieuwenhuis et al 2018 holistic trends from the gwpr results indicated that specific factors i e pipe age length depth and diameter were observed to have a significant correlation to increased blockage propensity similar to previous studies which reported significant correlations pohls et al 2004 savic et al 2006 arthur et al 2008 ugarelli et al 2009 jin and mukherjee 2010 ugarelli et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2012 marlow et al 2011 post et al 2017 xie et al 2017 in addition malek mohammadi et al 2020 reported these factors amongst others to be able to indicate the most statistical significance for sewer pipe blockages and are the most available in municipal databases however in the present study these factors showed a low and varying degree of influence on increased blockage propensity within each municipality evaluated previous stochastic approaches presented by cherqui et al 2015 post et al 2017 and pulido et al 2019 have mainly focused on global relationships with spatial representations attempting to highlight the contributions of factors to the variability of blockages observed furthermore these studies only considered the environmental factors for population density and ground settlement due to data availability in the present study especially the environmental factors distance to restaurants and risk of tree root intrusion showed significant spatial variability and influence to increased blockage propensity which shows that environmental factors are significant parameters which should be taken into consideration when modelling blockages 4 3 robustness of rf ensembles for predicting blockages the mean proportion of correctly classified blockages to falsely classified blockages for the municipalities a b and c were 77 68 and below 50 respectively based on the municipal datasets consisting of factors previously described in tables 2 and 3 bailey 2016 used a similar set of factors with rf ensembles and reported similar accuracies between 68 and 71 hassouna et al 2019 used other factors weather data pollution events and event duration monitors with rf to predict sediment related blockages and reported an accuracy of 95 weather rainfall and temperature and pollution related events have been reported to have higher variability courty et al 2018 compared to the factors evaluated in this study furthermore it was observed that the network k function and rf results indicated that prediction accuracy and the strength of spatial variability of blockages appeared to decrease between municipalities a b and c in a similar trend this prompts the presumption that improved accuracy of blockage recurrence predictions may be related to the strength of spatial variability in blockage occurrence pattern 4 4 further development of the analysis procedure factors listed in table 3 having more than 35 missing data were not included in the models for each municipality however these factors may have shown significance and impact to increased blockage propensity if included along with other factors not available in municipalities where the procedure was demonstrated therefore further research is required to determine the threshold of data sufficiency secondly the application of the procedure could also be expanded to other factors especially environmental factors such as groundwater level water depth in pipes infiltration and inflow ground settlement and a more in depth evaluation of the effects of restaurants proximity on increased fog accumulation in sewer pipes upstream vs downstream located pipes etc these factors are known to affect blockages davies et al 2001 malek mohammadi et al 2020 and if included in the analysis procedure new insights may complement the existing knowledge on mechanisms of blockages furthermore the application of the demonstrated procedure is highly dependant on the available datasets the spatial variability of blockages and the local mechanisms driving blockage occurrence for instance soil subsistence data could be used as an indicator for sagging potential of sewer pipes however the choice of datasets utilisation remains highly dependant on availability consequently the results from one type of location may not be spatially transferable gwpr and geographically weighted binomial negative binomial regression gwnbr have both been reported to be appropriate for count data such as blockages da silva and rodrigues 2014 therefore an evaluation and comparison of both methods for improved heterogeneity assessment of blockages may yield improved results 4 5 application of the procedure to support sewer asset management based on discussions of results with managers of the sewer networks in municipalities a b and c it was gleaned that municipalities b and c were proactively targeting known blockage hotspots with thoroughly planned pipe flushing activities however municipality a only performed reactive flushing of blockages these two different management strategies may explain why more clustering of blockages was found in municipality a along with a higher mean prediction accuracy with rf ensembles therefore a cluster assessment with the network k function may be considered as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the proactive blockage management efforts i e proactive flushing for recurrent blockages secondly according to müller 2007 the inspection of sewers i e via cctv may be carried out via fixed intervals or need orientated strategies bin ali et al 2011 further stated that need orientated strategies were more effective for sewer inspections requiring sewer managers to identify critical sewers for selective inspection therefore in municipalities such as municipality a where a network wide inspection program is underway the network k function and gwpr results may be used to support the planning of need orientated cctv inspection to identify critical sewers the gwpr results may also be used to identify pipes or areas where recurring blockages may occur i e the location of sewers where factors such as root tree intrusion or sagging correlate with a high propensity to blockages recurrence for proactive maintenance planning in addition gwpr results may further be used as input for planning and scheduling maintenance operations in sewers such as the proposed combined maintenance and routing optimisation procedure fontecha et al 2020 the gwpr results in combination with other tools e g hydraulic models risk and cost assessments may also be used to decide which pipes or in which areas a redesign of the sewers would be a more viable option compared to proactive flushing or other maintenance activities in addition when gwpr results are considered together with factors observed to be important for blockage predictions table 5 the spatial heterogeneity of parameter estimates seems to potentially be a suitable identifier for predictors of blockages within clusters on the network 5 conclusions a procedure that captures the spatial heterogeneity between sewer pipe blockages and factors which influence blockages occurrence was evaluated the procedure includes the following methods network k function geographically weighted poisson regression and random forest ensembles the procedure showed high capability for assessing spatial variability and illustrating the degree of influence for factors influencing blockages within the sewer pipe network and resulted in blockage recurrence predictions in varying degree more specifically accessing spatial variability using the network k function recurrent blockages showed most significant clustering in municipalities a and c and no clustering was observed in b the network k function also took into consideration the overestimation bias and geometric characteristics of the network discussions with sewer pipe network managers indicated rigorously rigorous flushing activities in certain areas in municipalities b and c where the blockages were not as clustered as in municipality a it is therefore suspected that the presence of significant clustering of recurrent blockages may be linked to an increased need for flushing related maintenance in sewer pipe networks the gwpr captured the spatial heterogeneity significance and degree of influence in the relationships between sewer pipe blockages and all associated factors evaluated furthermore the results showed the sewer pipe networks as differentiated segments highlighting the most prevalent factors for increased blockage propensity in these segments gwpr results and rf predictions together suggest that cluster based maintenance approaches and predictions may yield better results compared to a network wide approach rf ensembles demonstrated relatively good predictions for blockage recurrence in municipalities a and b compared to municipality c municipalities a and b also showed the strongest evidence of spatial variability with the network k function it can therefore be inferred that stronger spatial variability of blockages could improve the predictability of pipes with high susceptibility to recurrent blockages the procedure elucidated in this study provides support for pipe inspection prioritisation proactive maintenance planning and redesign of sewer pipe networks specifically the percentage degree of influence serves as a parameter which can provide input to maintenance prioritisation planning and

network k function geographically weighted poisson regression random forest ensembles maintenance prioritisation proactive maintenance 1 introduction sewer pipe network blockages are one of the challenges faced by municipalities and water authorities fontecha et al 2016 maintenance of sewer blockages can be made more efficient by planning preventive maintenance operations fontecha et al 2016 however preventive maintenance planning and execution are difficult to perform effectively because blockage failures often result from a combination of factors or processes that are challenging to isolate jin and mukherjee 2010 recent findings indicate that random and recurrent sewer blockages are increasing despite municipalities attempts to implement preventive maintenance xie et al 2017 previous research regarding the identification of causative mechanisms of sewer pipe blockages has been performed using either physical or stochastic models santos et al 2017 stochastic models have shown improved results mainly in attempts to predict blockage related failures in sewer pipes santos et al 2017 another benefit of stochastic models is their capability of managing data scarcity and the complexity of sewer blockage occurrence pulido et al 2019 stochastic models developed which have had some measure of success characterising blockages in sewer pipe networks include the non homogeneous poisson process rostum 2000 evolutionary polynomial regression savić et al 2006 zero inflated non homogeneous poisson process rajani and kleiner 2001 weibull accreted lifetime model and linear extended yule process le gat 2014 martins et al 2013 key factors that have shown a strong correlation to increased incidents of sewer blockages include but are not limited to pipe age diameter material length gradient slope sagging tree root intrusion presence of fats oils and grease fog construction quality and human behavioural patterns savic et al 2006 cook et al 2008 ugarelli et al 2009 jin and mukherjee 2010 rodríguez et al 2012 mattsson et al 2014 cherqui et al 2015 santos et al 2017 xie et al 2017 nieuwenhuis et al 2018 pulido et al 2019 however blockage occurrence persists due to a complex combination of factors and isolation of the most prevalent factors or set of factors is critical to the development of efficient maintenance solutions rodríguez et al 2012 in addition correlations between sewer blockage propensity and external environmental factors such as foodservice outlets high density dwellings and potential tree root intrusion have not been adequately corroborated by statistical methods reasons why such analyses have not been explored thoroughly includes the lack of historical failure data and necessary geographical data such as the location proximity of trees to the sewer pipes and proximity of food service establishments to pipes as well as a lack of digitalisation of these types of data previous approaches used to investigate the spatial variability of blockages by hotspot analysis with kernel density estimation kde cook et al 2008 cherqui et al 2015 agnone et al 2017 assumed blockages to occur on a continuously plane lamb et al 2016 this assumption leads to an overestimation of clustering of blockages or false conclusions because blockages do not occur anywhere on a continuous plane only in pipes on sewer networks the network k function was developed to overcome this limitation and has been applied in a few studies such as traffic collision incidents on a road network fan et al 2018 however it has not yet been applied to assess the spatial variability of blockages and its link to factors affecting blockages statistical approaches are reportedly preferred for modelling sewer blockages due to the extensive and complex amount of factors influencing blockages post et al 2017 previous approaches employed were generally a form of multilevel model regression global regression these approaches estimated blockage and blockage patterns using associated explanatory variables which imply global relationships although reasonable these global relationships may mask some local relationships which can provide more in depth insight into the occurrence of random and recurring blockages bui et al 2018 geographically weighted regression gwr is a spatial statistical approach which models local relationships an initial attempt to investigate factors affecting blockages with a generalised form of gwr was carried out by kimani ngaruiya and ngigi 2014 however the investigation only considered a limited number of factors income vandalism number of households and areas with high low water supply due to rationing and did not include the physical properties of sewer pipes furthermore the generalised form of gwr assumes a gaussian distribution for blockages which has been reported as not being a strictly accurate way to characterise blockages for stochastic modelling xie et al 2017 the geographically weighted poisson regression gwpr variant assumes a poisson distribution for blockages rather than a gaussian distribution and has been reported to be more appropriate for modelling count data nakaya et al 2005 gwpr has been used in various contexts including traffic collision prediction modelling hadayeghi et al 2010 analysis of food malnutrition saefuddin et al 2013 and country level vehicle crash modelling zhibin li et al 2013 however none of the previous studies on sewer pipe blockages has used gwpr to model the intensity of blockages or assess the impact of factors affecting blockages on a sewer network due to its applicability to large datasets and nil requirement for conformance to particular statistical distributions jin and mukherjee 2010 random forest rf ensembles breiman 2001 have increasingly been investigated for predicting blockages bailey et al 2016 hassouna et al 2019 however the results of those studies have shown that the performance of rf ensembles for blockage predictions can be improved therefore santos et al 2017 and hassouna et al 2019 have suggested investigations with datasets consisting of different factors towards improved robustness of blockage predictions furthermore there is a need to assess the efficiency use of rf ensembles for blockage predictions this study s main objective was to evaluate a procedure for analysing sewer blockages using the network k function and gwpr the procedure captures the spatial heterogeneity between blockages and factors that necessitate the occurrence of blockages and works towards improving the understanding of influential factors affecting blockages in sewers the increased robustness of random forest rf ensembles via prediction of blockage recurrence and determination of the most important variables for predicting blockages were also investigated in this study 2 materials and methods data methods analysis steps and expected outcomes of the evaluated procedure for analysing sewer blockages are summarised and presented in fig 1 data collected to evaluate the procedure was sourced from both the physical properties of the pipe network and external environmental factors potentially influencing increased blockage propensity the procedure presented in fig 1 was demonstrated in three municipalities a b and c the characteristics of the sewer systems and summary of blockage records in these municipalities are presented in table 1 figs 1 3 in supplementary data provide schematic representations of the sewer networks blockage rates for the three municipalities are reported to be about twice the swedish average hedström et al 2016 and less than greater or equal to the recommended threshold value of 0 25 no km year annika malm et al 2012 for the municipalities a b and c respectively furthermore when compared with blockage rates reported in other locations blockage rates in the investigated municipalities were found to be higher than rates reported in norway trondheim 0 096 per km year hafskjold et al 2002 and oslo 0 176 per km year ugarelli et al 2009 and lower than rates reported in australia 0 3 0 65 per km year marlow et al 2011 the united kingdom 0 2 0 9 per km year hillas 2014 bailey et al 2015 and bogota 1 5 per km year rodríguez et al 2012 the main reasons for blockages reported in these studies included age diameter material type gradient flow regime property density non disposables wet wipes and sediment deposition 2 1 data the factors investigated in the study were selected based on data availability in municipalities where the procedure was demonstrated table 2 the factors are categorised into the physical properties of the pipe network ppn and external environmental factors eef table 2 also includes the description unit range and availability status of factors the data for these factors are sourced from municipal databases for water and wastewater as well as publicly available external databases with data such as population census information e g statistics sweden scb the completeness of the datasets available for municipality a b and c was assessed and is presented in table 3 only factors with incomplete data are presented in table 3 along with the corresponding percentages of incompleteness factors with 35 and above missing data were excluded to decrease the uncertainty bold in table 3 2 2 methods sewer blockage data and its influential factors were analysed following the procedure described in fig 1 the procedure first investigated the presence of spatial variability of blockages observed in the sewer pipe network using the network k function method section 2 2 1 subsequently the relative degree of impact of factors influencing blockages was determined using gwpr section 2 2 2 finally blockage recurrence predictions were performed with the aim of improving the robustness of random forest ensembles described in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 network k function the network k function was used in this study to analyse the spatial variability of random and recurrent blockages in the sewer pipe network the spatial variability assessment was performed by testing the null hypotheses that blockages were independently uniformly distributed over the sewer pipe network the network k function k n e t is defined and described based on yamada and okabe 2000 see eq 1 1 k n e t r ι l n n 1 i 1 n j 0 n 1 d l x i x j r ι l denotes the total length of the network the pipe locations where blockages have occurred are denoted by x 1 x n with n denoting the total number of pipes with blockages d l x i x j denotes an observation window with all network pipe locations that can be reached which are shorter than the shortest path distance r which replaces the euclidean planar distance on the sewer pipe network in essence d l x i x j represents a two dimensional area of an observation window by a one dimensional length of the network the network k function assumes random arbitrary points chosen via a homogeneous binomial point process and computes a theoretical pattern across the sewer pipe network fan et al 2018 this theoretical pattern indicates statistically significant spatial independence of observations at a 95 confidence interval computed via monte carlo simulations yamada and okabe 2000 the knet is compared with the theoretical pattern to evaluate spatial variability the results of the network k function analysis were plotted with spatstat package in r statistical software baddeley et al 2016 2 2 2 geographical weighted poisson regression gwpr gwpr is a spatial statistical method for investigating non stationary spatial processes alves et al 2016 in this study gwpr was used to identify the strength of the association significance and magnitude of impact between blockages and factors table 2 gwpr modelling was performed separately for each of the three municipalities evaluated the coefficients obtained from the gwpr modelling parameter estimates were estimated by applying a poisson regression model where the likelihood estimation was geographically weighted with weights defined by a kernel function centred on pipe location coordinates nakaya et al 2005 the gwpr model expression for this study is presented in eq 2 2 i n y i p o i s s o n k 1 m β k c i x i k ε i i 1 2 3 n where c i u i v i denotes the coordinates of a pipe within the network at an ith location y i describes the total number of blockages per pipe over the assessment period β k is the parameter estimates unique to sewer pipes within the pipe network for a factor x i k table 2 at the ith location and ε represents an error term noise respectively m is the total number of independent variables factors as per tables 2 and 3 evaluated for each municipality the spatial heterogeneity is then investigated expressed as a matrix as shown in eq 3 3 β β i o c 1 β i 1 c 1 β k c 1 β i o c 2 β i 1 c 2 β k c 2 β i o c n β i 1 c n β k c n where n is the number of pipes in the analysed pipe network and its distance is determined by each pipe weight wn to the regression point pipes closest to the regression points have a higher weight compared to pipes further away the parameters for each pipe forming a row in the matrix are described by eq 4 4 β x t w c 1 1 x t w c 1 y where xt is a matrix of the independent variables with a column of 1 s for the intercept y is the dependant variable vector and w c 1 denotes an x by x geographical diagonal spatial weights matrix which is expressed as w 5 w w 1 0 0 w n w 1 is the weight given for each pipe in the network during the calibration of the model weights were applied through a smoothly decaying function of the distance between pipes in the network according to a bi square kernel function because it supports minimisation of errors nakaya et al 2005 alves et al 2016 spatial variability maps parameter estimates between factors and increased blockage propensity were developed these maps showed the degree of influence of these factors on the network as percentages determined through the interpretation of parameter estimates based on hilbe 2014 a threshold of 10 and above was used to indicate significant and impactful factors the standalone software gwr4 mgwr mgwr 1 0 sparc website developed by oshan et al 2019 was used for this analysis in conjunction with the gw model package in r statistical software and qgis 3 84 the gwpr modelling results were calibrated by bandwidth size determined by the corrected akaike information criterion aicc comparison pirdavani et al 2014 the optimal aicc value for the most suitable bandwidth for the modelling was determined by successively narrowing the range of values inside the window in which the optimal value exists for each municipality model bivand 2017 the results were first validated using the variance inflation factor vif to diagnose the presence of multicollinearity in the gwpr results parameter estimates nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the presence of multicollinearity amongst the parameter estimates implies that estimates are not unique and as such no convincing interpretation can be drawn pirdavani et al 2014 vif values less than or equal to 10 have been reported as a reasonable cut off threshold indicating the presence of no multicollinearity pirdavani et al 2014 secondly a calculated pseudo p value smaller than 0 05 indicated statistically significant spatial relationships between the factors and the sewer blockages in the network at a 95 confidence level i e non random statistically significant relationships parameter estimates were determined during the modelling process via a spatial variability test that shuffled observations in space then re calibrated the gwpr model on randomised data while keeping the model specification constant furthermore the test then compared the parameter estimates from the randomised observations to the parameter estimates for each pipe in the network this process was repeated 1000 times via a monte carlo simulation the number of times the parameter estimates of the fitted model was higher than that of the randomised data was used to construct pseudo p values for hypothesis testing oshan et al 2019 when presenting the gwpr results maps of parameter estimates for each factor mennis 2006 recommended approaches to mitigate the challenge of misinterpreting mapped results these approaches were incorporated into the gwpr modelling process and mapping 2 2 3 random forest ensembles the critical parameters for rf prediction include the number of trees 1000 trees used here the trees were generated through bagging and a random subset of the data trained each node the out of bag oob error was used to minimise the generalisation error breiman 2001 four factors were selected randomly by the random forest algorithm based on importance ranking i e mean gini decrease the rf modelling dataset was randomly divided into one training and one validation set for each municipality using a 70 30 split training validation the data consisted of all the pipes in the sewer pipe network with the total number of blockages experienced for each of the three municipalities along with factors previously presented in tables 2 and 3 the accuracy of the blockage recurrence predictions in this study was presented using receiver operating characteristic roc curves and area under the roc curve auc percentages rahmati et al 2016 an auc value of 100 indicates perfect prediction capability while 50 represents an accuracy which is entirely a random predictor shaikhina et al 2019 random forest predictions were carried out using mob forest package in r statistical software garge et al 2019 3 results 3 1 spatial variability in blockage occurrence using cluster analysis the network k function analysis results indicated the strongest degree of non independence in municipality a implying that the most substantial evidence of the spatial relationship between blockages in the sewer pipe network compared to b and c table 4 detailed network k function plots are presented in supplementary data fig 4 the network k function analysis is mainly a descriptive measure for testing for the presence of complete spatial randomness on a network prompting an exploratory investigation of reasons for the observed spatial variability of blockages in the sewer network furthermore clustering or dispersion may be due to multiple factors in varying locations the results of the network k function therefore require further investigation to determine the influential factors which drive the spatial variability of blockages observed in this study in municipalities a b and c 3 2 factors influencing the occurrence of blockages in the sewer pipe network the significance and magnitude degree of influence of the spatial distribution for each factor influencing increased sewer blockages in the sewer network are presented below the spatial changes positive negative in the magnitude of parameter estimates across the pipe networks indicate the local influence of the factors on blockage propensity fotheringham 2009 fig 2 shows the maps of parameter estimates for ten factors including three sub factors different pipe materials evaluated for the sewer pipe network of municipality a the maps show that parameter estimates are not global therefore indicating spatial heterogeneity of the factors locations where the magnitude of the parameter estimates are zero irrespective of colour indicate locations where the relationship between factors and blockage occurrence propensity is statistically insignificant parameter estimates of zero indicate that measures taken to change these factors would not affect blockage propensity in the sewer pipes in these locations within the municipality pipe age self cleaning velocity number of service connections and clay pipe material showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity from the municipality centre marked with red black dot towards the south and southwest of municipality a concrete poly pe pipe materials and pipes in close proximity to restaurant locations showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity in the city centre of municipality a fig 2 root intrusion cctv grade and sagging potential showed a positive correlation to blockage propensity with a sort of gradient effect from the centre towards the north northwest and northeast peripheries of municipality a fig 2 other factors assessed for municipality a which are not presented in fig 2 include length which showed a positive correlation to an increased blockage propensity increased northwards of municipality a neighbourhood population density of the age group 85 100 years also showed a positive correlation to an increased blockage propensity in the centre of municipality a pipe depth showed a negative correlation to increased blockage propensity in northeast and north of municipality a fig 3 shows the maps of parameter estimates for the three factors which showed the most significant heterogeneity in the sewer pipe network of municipality b the parameter estimates were observed to vary and were zero in locations of statistically insignificant relationships pipe age showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity from the municipality centre marked with a red black dot towards the west and east the number of service connections showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity towards the west from the centre distance to restaurants showed a negative correlation to increased blockage propensity in the central parts other factors assessed for municipality b which are not presented in fig 3 included pipe depth which showed a negative correlation to increased blockage propensity in the east central parts fig 4 shows the mapped parameter estimates for four factors which showed the most significant heterogeneity to blockage propensity in the sewer pipe network of municipality c the centre of the municipality is marked with a red black dot pipe length in the immediate vicinity north pipe material concrete in the centre of the municipality number of service connections in the northern periphery and pipes in close proximity to restaurants food service locations in the centre of the municipality all showed a positive correlation to increased blockage propensity similar patterns of the investigated factors that influenced blockage propensity could be observed in all three municipalities indicating that the patterns might represent relationships to blockages that may exist holistically fewer factors appear to be significant in municipalities b and c compared to a which may generally be attributed to data quality and strength of spatial variability the aicc calibration results are presented in section 3 of the supplementary data the estimated distribution of vif values for the parameter estimates of each factor evaluated for the sewer pipe networks in municipalities a b and c are presented in fig 5 vif values did not exceed 10 for all factors except one indicating no multicollinearity however the vif values for neighbourhood population density for some parameter estimates exceeded 10 indicating some multicollinearity in gwpr results which implies no dependencies were found amongst the parameter estimates wheeler 2006 therefore the parameter estimates are uniquely defined and as such conclusive interpretations may be derived from them more specifically the vif values for neighbourhood population density for municipalities a and c were higher than 10 for an estimated 25 50 of parameter estimates table 5 summaries the statistically significant factors along with their degrees of influence magnitude of parameter estimates the geographical parts of the sewer pipe networks where these factors were found to be both significant and show relatively strong influence are also highlighted finally table 5 presents an indication of which factors are important for blockage recurrence predictions based on random forest ensemble mean gini decrease values 3 3 blockage predictions roc curves showing auc values are presented in fig 6 the roc curves for municipality a yielded an auc of 76 with a confidence interval between 73 and 80 illustrating a mean recurrence prediction accuracy of 76 for municipality b an auc of 68 with a confidence interval between 65 and 74 was observed the estimated auc value for municipality c was below 50 indicating low prediction accuracy data quality was suspected as one of the possible reasons for the low auc values observed in the dataset for municipality c 4 discussion 4 1 significance of spatial variation the spatial variability of blockages when assessed with the ordinary kernel density estimation kde method ngaruiya and ngigi 2014 cherqui et al 2015 post et al 2017 pulido et al 2019 is reported to yield biased estimates okabe et al 2009 to overcome this the network kde was developed yu et al 2015 however the network kde does not adequately consider geometric network characteristics such as topology and connectivity lamb et al 2016 okabe 2017 the network k function accounts for both the bias and network geometric characteristics when compared the results of the analyses using the network k function supplementary data fig 4 and network kde supplementary data fig 5 showed that the network kde indicated clustering of blockages in municipalities a b and c the influence of the geometric characteristics of the network can be observed with the results from network k function hence it could be observed that municipalities b and c had significantly less clustering and dispersion compared to municipality a to support the effect of geometric characteristics of the network it could be observed that fewer factors were able to explain the spatial variability observed in municipalities b and c with gwpr results unknown uncertainties data availability and completeness may also contribute to the strength of spatial association observable oort 2006 4 2 influence of factors on increased blockage propensity and location variability the magnitude degree of influence between factors and increased blockage propensity provided strong evidence that these relationships were not global not the same in all locations along the sewer network and may vary between networks these non stationary relationships were observed to occur in various forms explicitly different factors showed a strong degree of influence in different locations single factors showed both positive and negative influence in different locations and different factors showed significant correlations in the same location with varying degree of influence this provides evidence that holistic network wide blockage maintenance approaches treatments may be ineffective more tailored cluster based approaches would therefore be required specific examples illustrating the above are presented below in municipality a the factors aged pipes smaller diameters clay pipes and increased number of service connections all showed a significant correlation to increased blockage propensity in the southern part of the network however the percentage of the degree of influence on increased blockage propensity ranges from 0 4 0 5 0 1 49 65 and 11 15 respectively deduction indicates clay pipes and trunk sewers with multiple joints bends are most susceptible to blockages in the southern part of municipality a from the centre towards the northern peripheries in municipality a except the northwest pipes with increased sagging potential showed a stronger degree of influence 11 15 more compared to pipes with higher root intrusion risk and higher cctv grades this explains to some degree why pipes in this area may be plagued with structural problems which may result in increased sediment deposition and higher vulnerability with close proximity to trees ultimately leading to the occurrence of blockages marlow et al 2011 desilva et al 2011 torres et al 2017 reduced depth of pipes correlating to increased blockage propensity is also observed in this area further reinforcing that structural problems which may arise from traffic wheels loads and shifting soil are also contributory in this part of municipality a davies et al 2001 pipes having higher self cleaning velocities showed a strong degree of influence 65 80 in the northeast of municipality a while pipes with lower self cleaning velocities in the south showed a degree of influence of 10 all towards increased blockage propensity it may generally be inferred that only pipes with lower self cleaning velocities experience sediment deposition hillas 2014 xie et al 2017 i e as observed in the south however pipes with higher self cleaning velocities have also been reported to experience sediment deposition suspected to result from the accumulation of coarser sediment particles at the head of sewer pipe networks bachoc 1992 ashley and hvitved jacobsen 2005 in the central parts of the municipalities concrete and plastic pipes showed a strong degree of influence to increased blockage propensity 28 50 in municipality a and with the exception of plastic pipes 65 82 in municipality c decreased distance of pipes to restaurants also showed a relatively strong degree of influence namely 45 55 in municipality b and 22 26 in municipality c this provides some evidence to support the susceptibility of pipes in close proximity to restaurants to fog build up or low operation and maintenance of grease interceptors reinforcing findings from mattsson et al 2014 and nieuwenhuis et al 2018 holistic trends from the gwpr results indicated that specific factors i e pipe age length depth and diameter were observed to have a significant correlation to increased blockage propensity similar to previous studies which reported significant correlations pohls et al 2004 savic et al 2006 arthur et al 2008 ugarelli et al 2009 jin and mukherjee 2010 ugarelli et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2012 marlow et al 2011 post et al 2017 xie et al 2017 in addition malek mohammadi et al 2020 reported these factors amongst others to be able to indicate the most statistical significance for sewer pipe blockages and are the most available in municipal databases however in the present study these factors showed a low and varying degree of influence on increased blockage propensity within each municipality evaluated previous stochastic approaches presented by cherqui et al 2015 post et al 2017 and pulido et al 2019 have mainly focused on global relationships with spatial representations attempting to highlight the contributions of factors to the variability of blockages observed furthermore these studies only considered the environmental factors for population density and ground settlement due to data availability in the present study especially the environmental factors distance to restaurants and risk of tree root intrusion showed significant spatial variability and influence to increased blockage propensity which shows that environmental factors are significant parameters which should be taken into consideration when modelling blockages 4 3 robustness of rf ensembles for predicting blockages the mean proportion of correctly classified blockages to falsely classified blockages for the municipalities a b and c were 77 68 and below 50 respectively based on the municipal datasets consisting of factors previously described in tables 2 and 3 bailey 2016 used a similar set of factors with rf ensembles and reported similar accuracies between 68 and 71 hassouna et al 2019 used other factors weather data pollution events and event duration monitors with rf to predict sediment related blockages and reported an accuracy of 95 weather rainfall and temperature and pollution related events have been reported to have higher variability courty et al 2018 compared to the factors evaluated in this study furthermore it was observed that the network k function and rf results indicated that prediction accuracy and the strength of spatial variability of blockages appeared to decrease between municipalities a b and c in a similar trend this prompts the presumption that improved accuracy of blockage recurrence predictions may be related to the strength of spatial variability in blockage occurrence pattern 4 4 further development of the analysis procedure factors listed in table 3 having more than 35 missing data were not included in the models for each municipality however these factors may have shown significance and impact to increased blockage propensity if included along with other factors not available in municipalities where the procedure was demonstrated therefore further research is required to determine the threshold of data sufficiency secondly the application of the procedure could also be expanded to other factors especially environmental factors such as groundwater level water depth in pipes infiltration and inflow ground settlement and a more in depth evaluation of the effects of restaurants proximity on increased fog accumulation in sewer pipes upstream vs downstream located pipes etc these factors are known to affect blockages davies et al 2001 malek mohammadi et al 2020 and if included in the analysis procedure new insights may complement the existing knowledge on mechanisms of blockages furthermore the application of the demonstrated procedure is highly dependant on the available datasets the spatial variability of blockages and the local mechanisms driving blockage occurrence for instance soil subsistence data could be used as an indicator for sagging potential of sewer pipes however the choice of datasets utilisation remains highly dependant on availability consequently the results from one type of location may not be spatially transferable gwpr and geographically weighted binomial negative binomial regression gwnbr have both been reported to be appropriate for count data such as blockages da silva and rodrigues 2014 therefore an evaluation and comparison of both methods for improved heterogeneity assessment of blockages may yield improved results 4 5 application of the procedure to support sewer asset management based on discussions of results with managers of the sewer networks in municipalities a b and c it was gleaned that municipalities b and c were proactively targeting known blockage hotspots with thoroughly planned pipe flushing activities however municipality a only performed reactive flushing of blockages these two different management strategies may explain why more clustering of blockages was found in municipality a along with a higher mean prediction accuracy with rf ensembles therefore a cluster assessment with the network k function may be considered as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the proactive blockage management efforts i e proactive flushing for recurrent blockages secondly according to müller 2007 the inspection of sewers i e via cctv may be carried out via fixed intervals or need orientated strategies bin ali et al 2011 further stated that need orientated strategies were more effective for sewer inspections requiring sewer managers to identify critical sewers for selective inspection therefore in municipalities such as municipality a where a network wide inspection program is underway the network k function and gwpr results may be used to support the planning of need orientated cctv inspection to identify critical sewers the gwpr results may also be used to identify pipes or areas where recurring blockages may occur i e the location of sewers where factors such as root tree intrusion or sagging correlate with a high propensity to blockages recurrence for proactive maintenance planning in addition gwpr results may further be used as input for planning and scheduling maintenance operations in sewers such as the proposed combined maintenance and routing optimisation procedure fontecha et al 2020 the gwpr results in combination with other tools e g hydraulic models risk and cost assessments may also be used to decide which pipes or in which areas a redesign of the sewers would be a more viable option compared to proactive flushing or other maintenance activities in addition when gwpr results are considered together with factors observed to be important for blockage predictions table 5 the spatial heterogeneity of parameter estimates seems to potentially be a suitable identifier for predictors of blockages within clusters on the network 5 conclusions a procedure that captures the spatial heterogeneity between sewer pipe blockages and factors which influence blockages occurrence was evaluated the procedure includes the following methods network k function geographically weighted poisson regression and random forest ensembles the procedure showed high capability for assessing spatial variability and illustrating the degree of influence for factors influencing blockages within the sewer pipe network and resulted in blockage recurrence predictions in varying degree more specifically accessing spatial variability using the network k function recurrent blockages showed most significant clustering in municipalities a and c and no clustering was observed in b the network k function also took into consideration the overestimation bias and geometric characteristics of the network discussions with sewer pipe network managers indicated rigorously rigorous flushing activities in certain areas in municipalities b and c where the blockages were not as clustered as in municipality a it is therefore suspected that the presence of significant clustering of recurrent blockages may be linked to an increased need for flushing related maintenance in sewer pipe networks the gwpr captured the spatial heterogeneity significance and degree of influence in the relationships between sewer pipe blockages and all associated factors evaluated furthermore the results showed the sewer pipe networks as differentiated segments highlighting the most prevalent factors for increased blockage propensity in these segments gwpr results and rf predictions together suggest that cluster based maintenance approaches and predictions may yield better results compared to a network wide approach rf ensembles demonstrated relatively good predictions for blockage recurrence in municipalities a and b compared to municipality c municipalities a and b also showed the strongest evidence of spatial variability with the network k function it can therefore be inferred that stronger spatial variability of blockages could improve the predictability of pipes with high susceptibility to recurrent blockages the procedure elucidated in this study provides support for pipe inspection prioritisation proactive maintenance planning and redesign of sewer pipe networks specifically the percentage degree of influence serves as a parameter which can provide input to maintenance prioritisation planning and

17141,the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl process is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop to remove organic contaminants in water treatment with radicals including hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive nitrogen species rns this study investigated the formation of nitro so and chlorinated products and toxicity alteration during the uv nh2cl treatment of phenol rns and or rcs induced the formation of nitro so chlorinated and polymeric compounds during phenol transformation by uv nh2cl these compounds dramatically increased the cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cells after 20 min uv nh2cl treatment which was 10 times higher than that after 24 h chloramination the increase of cytotoxicity in uv nh2cl was primarily attributable to 4 nitrosophenol and the cytotoxicity followed the order of 4 nitrosophenol 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol phenol 4 nitrosophenol was significantly generated by the combination of no and phenoxy radical where the maximum conversion rates of phenol to 4 nitrosophenol increased from 4 9 to 62 4 when ph increased from 5 to 10 the highest conversion rate was at ph 10 because the no concentration increased with increasing ph from 5 to 10 in uv nh2cl as verified by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis nitrophenols were also detected at much lower concentrations than 4 nitrosophenol which were mainly formed by the oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol and the combination of no2 with phenoxy radicals rcs was responsible for the formation of chlorinated products mainly through cl addition

byproducts toxicity 1 introduction the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl advanced oxidation process aop has gained increasing attention in recent years due to the wide presence in many actual water treatment scenarios such as the treatment of ammoniacal water by uv chlorine wu et al 2017 the application of nh2cl to minimize biofouling in potable water reuse xu et al 2010 and the uv treatment of chlorinated swimming pool water soltermann et al 2014 the uv photolysis of nh2cl produces amidogen radical nh2 and chlorine atom cl eq 1 li and blatchley iii 2009 which then transforms to no no2 ho and cl2 through the interaction with o2 h2o oh or cl eqs 2 12 de laat et al 2010 grebel et al 2010 wu et al 2019 nist 2020 the significant production of these radicals in uv nh2cl contributed to the efficient removal of organic pollutants such as 1 4 dioxane benzoate carbamazepine estradiol triclosan sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and naproxen bu et al 2018 chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2018 sun et al 2019a wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 however toxic nitro so and chlorinated products are likely generated during the uv nh2cl treatment due to the involvement of reactive nitrogen species rns and

organic radicals such as carbon and oxygen centered radicals to form nitroso compounds grisham et al 1999 for example no can combine with phenoxy radicals to generate nitrosophenol vione et al 2004 no2 was reported to selectively react with electron rich compounds such as phenolic groups anilines and thiols neta et al 1988 huang et al 2018 specifically no2 can react with unsaturated organic matter via addition such as olefins acetylenic compounds and aromatic compounds to form nitro compounds gray and yoffe 1955 no2 slowly reacts with phenolic compounds through hydrogen abstraction huie 1994 but it quickly combines with phenoxy radicals to form nitrophenolic compounds vione et al 2011 our previous study observed nitroso products in the transformation of ibuprofen and naproxen by uv nh2cl due to the involvement of no wu et al 2019 however the formation mechanism of nitro so products by rns in uv nh2cl has not been well clarified and requires further investigation rcs such as cl and cl2 have high redox potentials of 2 4 v cl and 2 0 v cl2 fang et al 2014 which can directly attack many pollutants alegre et al 2000 lei et al 2019 cl reacts with organic pollutants that bear electron rich moieties mainly through electron transfer to form corresponding cation radicals and it reacts with phenolic compounds to generate phenoxy radicals via electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction alfassi et al 1989 lei et al 2019 in addition cl addition was demonstrated to be an important reaction mechanism for the degradation of pollutants to generate chlorinated products wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 lei et al 2019 cl2 reacts with aromatics bearing electron donating groups aliphatic compounds and olefins mainly through electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and addition respectively hasegawa and neta 1978 additionally cl2 can react with phenoxy radicals to generate chlorophenols vione et al 2005 in the uv nh2cl aop chlorinated products were observed during the degradation of ibuprofen naproxen and carbamazepine bu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 therefore chlorinated products can be generated during the uv nh2cl treatment via the interaction of rcs which must be quantitatively investigated the roles of rcs in the formation of nitro so products by rns also need to be further investigated the toxicity alteration during the organic pollutants degradation is important for the evaluation of aops nitro so compounds and chlorinated aromatic compounds were reported to have high carcinogenicity mutagenicity and genotoxicity swann 1975 komulainen 2004 misaki et al 2008 for example n nitrosodimethylamine is a well known liver carcinogen for various animals liu and hotchkiss 1995 the nitro products of sulfamethoxazole and several β blockers have higher mutagenicity and carcinogenicity than their parent compounds osorio et al 2016 toolaram et al 2017 dinitrobisphenol a shows higher genotoxicity to goldfish than bisphenol a toyoizumi et al 2008 chloronitrophenols are more genotoxic and mutagenic to bacillus subtilis than chlorophenols heng et al 1996 the genotoxicity to salmonella typhimurium increased significantly during the chlorination of 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone due to the formation of chlorobenzoquinones sun et al 2019b similarly the genotoxicity in sos umu assay had an elevation after chlorination of cefazolin also related to the formation of chlorinated product li et al 2013 besides the toxicity of dichlorinated methyl and n propylparaben toward d magna was 3 9 and 2 8 fold of that of their corresponding parent compounds terasaki et al 2009 thus the toxicity of nitro so and chlorinated products produced during the transformation of organic compounds by the uv nh2cl aop should be comprehensively investigated therefore the objectives of this study are to quantify the rns and rcs controlling the production of nitro so and chlorinated products clarify their formation mechanisms during the uv nh2cl aop and evaluate the toxicity alteration phenol was selected as the target compound since phenolic compounds are common anthropogenic and natural chemicals and widely used in industries kolpin et al 2002 barnes et al 2008 ahmed et al 2010 which contaminate the sources of drinking water with trace concentrations prasse et al 2018 additionally phenolic compounds have poor biodegradability and are teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic thus they are harmful to humans animals and plants even at low concentrations huang et al 2007 the concentrations of phenolic compounds in industrial wastewater range from 20 to 1200 mg l kurzbaum et al 2017 moreover phenolic moieties are typical in natural organic matter nom which concentration in drinking water can reach 2 10 mg l levchuk et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all solutions were prepared with reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm sources of reagents are provided in text s1 the nh2cl solution was freshly prepared by adding naocl solution to an nh4cl solution at a chlorine to ammonia n mass ratio of 4 1 for over 40 min with rapid stirring and the naocl solution and nh4cl solution were adjusted to ph 10 by naoh solution before mixing shang and blatchley 1999 note that the excess ammonia concentration of ammonia 12 5 μm at 50 μm nh2cl has negligible effects on radical concentrations which was demonstrated by the kinetic modeling in our previous study wu et al 2019 2 2 experimental procedure the photochemical reactor was set up according to our previous study wu et al 2019 the uv photon flux i0 that entered the solution was determined to be 0 439 μe s 1 using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and linden 2003 the effective path length l was determined to be 2 43 cm by measuring the kinetics of the dilute h2o2 photolysis figure s1 garoma and gurol 2005 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep0 was estimated to be 0 72 mw cm 2 a 700 ml test solution containing 2 mm phosphate buffer 5 μm phenol and 1 μm nitrobenzene nb was dosed with 50 μm nh2cl and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation the effects of ph 5 7 and 10 were investigated control tests of phenol degradation by nh2cl alone and direct uv photolysis were similarly performed but without uv light and nh2cl respectively samples were collected at different time intervals and quenched with na2s2o3 at a molar ratio of na2s2o3 to nh2cl of 4 1 all tests were performed at least twice the error bars in all data plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the duplicated test results higher initial concentrations of phenol 50 μm and nh2cl 200 or 500 μm were used to identify and quantify the products and disinfection byproducts dbps formed during the phenol degradation by uv nh2cl the cytotoxicity of the degradation products was similarly investigated 2 3 analytical methods the analytical methods of phenol nb nitrophenols chlorophenols nitrosophenol and dbps are provided in text s2 the concentrations of naocl and nh2cl were determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the ph of the solution was measured with a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo no was measured by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr using diethyldithiocarbamate detc 2 fe2 as the spin trapping agent wu et al 2019 the intermediates and products of phenol degradation were identified by ultra high

tof ms analysis are described in text s3 samples for cytotoxicity evaluation were also concentrated by spe according to previous study du et al 2017 the cytotoxicity was evaluated by a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line with details shown in text s4 the ecotoxicity of specific product was calculated using the toxicity estimation software tool test details in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenol transformation kinetic by uv nh2cl fig 1 shows the pseudo first order rate constants k to degrade phenol by the uv nh2cl aop at ph 5 7 and 10 the overall k remained almost constant at 0 0016 cm2 mj when ph increased from 5 to 7 while k sharply decreased to 0 00096 cm2 mj at ph 10 based on the radical chemistry in uv nh2cl the overall k of phenol degradation can be attributed to uv ho rcs and rns eq 13 note that the degradation of phenol by nh2cl was negligible data not shown 13 k k uv k ho k rcs rns 14 k ho k ho ho ss k uv k ho and k rcs rns are defined as the specific k by uv direct photolysis ho and rcs rns respectively k uv can be obtained by uv direct photolysis k ho can be calculated by the steady state concentration of ho ho ss and second order rate constant of ho reacting with phenol eq 14 nb was used as a probe compound to determine ho ss figure s2 which only reacts with ho with a second order rate constant of 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 following the method described in literatures fang et al 2014 huang et al 2018 k ho is the second order rate constant of ho reacting with phenol which was determined to be 7 6 109 7 8 109 and 2 7 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 7 and 10 respectively by competition kinetics using p chlorobenzoic acid pcba as a reference compound figure s3 then k rcs rns can be determined by eq 13 pk a of phenol is 9 89 dzengel et al 1999 which indicates that more phenol is transformed to phenolate at ph 10 than that at ph 5 and 7 for a specific k when ph increased from 5 to 7 k ho increased by 60 0 while k rcs rns decreased by 20 0 however when ph further increased from 7 to 10 k ho significantly decreased by 65 7 and k rcs rns slightly decreased by 13 0 the concentrations of ho were determined to be 5 5 10 14 m 8 3 10 14 m and 8 6 10 14 m at ph 5 7 and 10 figure s2 respectively since cl transforms to ho via the reaction with oh eqs 10 and 11 thus k ho at ph 7 was higher than ph 5 however k ho at ph 10 significantly decreased due to the low second order rate constant of ho reacting with phenolate the roles of rcs to phenol degradation at ph 10 were negligible as indicated by the undetectable chlorinated products at ph 10 figs 4 and 5 however when the ph increased from 7 to 10 k rcs rns only slightly decreased by 13 0 which was very likely responsible for the increase in k rns at ph 10 which compensated for the decrease in k rcs due to the following reasons 1 the concentration of no increased with increasing ph which was proved by the epr analysis the epr signal of no was almost undetectable at ph 5 while it increased by 150 from ph 7 to ph 10 fig 2 2 the second order rate constant of no2 reacting with phenolate was 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 which was much higher than that with phenol 3 103 m 1 s 1 vione et al 2011 3 2 formation of nitrosophenol and nitrophenols by rns the involvement of rns in phenol transformation by uv nh2cl results in the formation of 4 nitrosophenol and nitrophenols i e 2 nitrophenol 4 nitrophenol fig 3 for 4 nitrosophenol the concentration continuously increased and reached the maximum 2 45 µm at 30 min then it slightly decreased to 2 05 µm at 60 min during the treatment of 50 µm phenol by uv nh2cl at ph 7 for nitrophenols the concentrations of 4 nitrophenol and 2 nitrophenol monotonically increased over 60 min and reached the maxima of 0 13 µm and 0 37 µm respectively apparently the formation of 4 nitrosophenol was much higher than that of nitrophenols which indicates that no had a more significant role in the transformation of phenol than no2 since much more no was produced than no2 in uv nh2cl wu et al 2019 ph can significantly affect the formation kinetics of 4 nitrosophenol and nitrophenols but the effects were inconsistent with the degradation kinetics of phenol the degradation rates of phenol followed the order of ph 5 ph 7 ph 10 figure s4 however the formation of 4 nitrosophenol and conversion rates of 4 nitrosophenol i e the ratio of the formed 4 nitrosophenol to the degraded phenol followed the order of ph 10 ph 7 ph 5 with the concentrations of 5 49 µm 2 05 µm and 0 44 µm at 60 min respectively fig 3a the higher formation of 4 nitrosophenol at ph 10 can be mainly due to the higher concentration of no fig 2 when the reaction time increased from 5 to 60 min the conversion rates from phenol to 4 nitrosophenol at ph 5 7 and 10 decreased from 4 9 to 1 2 from 8 1 to 5 8 and from 62 4 to 20 3 respectively which indicates that 4 nitrosophenol was initially produced and subsequently transformed to other products for nitrophenols the formation of 4 nitrophenol at 60 min followed the order of ph 10 0 25 µm ph 5 0 19 µm ph 7 0 13 µm while that of 2 nitrophenol was ph 5 0 44 µm ph 7 0 37 µm ph 10 0 09 µm the formation of 2 nitrophenol was higher than 4 nitrophenol at ph 5 and ph 7 while it was opposite at ph 10 the conversion rates from phenol to nitrophenols at 5 60 min changed slightly from 1 8 to 1 7 at ph 5 from 1 1 to 1 4 at ph 7 and from 1 0 to 1 3 at ph 10 figure s5 note that the removal rates of phenol at 60 min were 73 71 and 54 at ph 5 7 and 10 respectively figure s5 1 formation mechanism of nitrosophenol only 4 nitrosophenol was detected in the uv nh2cl aop and its formation trend with ph coincided with the yields of no fig 2 the reaction mechanism of no with phenol was confirmed by purging no gas to a deoxygenated solution that contained 50 μm phenol figure s6 in which phenol degradation was only ascribed to no the transformed phenol was entirely converted into 4 nitrosophenol at 5 min with the conversion rate of 100 figure s6 which indicates that no can attack phenol to form 4 nitrosophenol as the only product it has been reported that no can react with phenolic antioxidants such as 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenol 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol and α tocopherol to produce phenoxy radicals janzen et al 1993 which then react with excess no to form no adducts janzen et al 1993 vione et al 2004 thus the initial reaction of no gas with phenol was proposed to generate phenoxy radical in analogy to phenolic antioxidants which then combined with no to form 4 nitrosophenol also phenoxy radicals can be formed in uv nh2cl through the reactions of phenol with cl via electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction and with cl2 via electron transfer eqs 15 and 16 alfassi et al 1989 das 2005 lei et al 2019 thus 4 nitrosophenol was generated from the combination of no with phenoxy radicals which can be formed by the reactions of phenol with no or rcs scheme 1 15 16 2 formation mechanism of nitrophenols the formation of nitrophenols is hypothesized to follow three mechanisms oxidation of nitrosophenol to nitrophenol reaction between no2 and phenol combination of no2 with phenoxy radicals 1 the highest formation of 4 nitrophenol at ph 10 coincides with that of 4 nitrosophenol which indicates that 4 nitrophenol can be mainly generated via further oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol as reported 4 nitrosophenol can be oxidized to 4 nitrophenol in the no2 photolysis system in the presence of o2 vione et al 2001a also the conversion rate from 4 nitrosophenol to 4 nitrophenol can be reached 7 during the uv nh2cl aop at 15 min figure s7 2 the second order rate constants of no2 reacting with phenol and phenolate are 3 103 m 1 s 1 and 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 respectively vione et al 2011 vione et al 2001b which indicates that the contribution of no2 to the transformation of phenol phenolate at ph 10 can be considerable but not at ph 5 and ph 7 however nitrophenols were not detectable at ph 9 during the phenol degradation by the uv no3 process where no2 was produced dzengel et al 1999 vione et al 2001b mainly since no2 reacts with phenolate via electron transfer to form phenoxy radicals but not no2 addition thus nitrophenols cannot be produced via the direct reaction between no2 and phenol 3 no2 quickly reacts with phenoxy radicals at 109 m 1 s 1 vione et al 2011 according to eqs 15 and 16 phenoxy radicals can be generated by rcs in uv nh2cl then no2 can combine with phenoxy radicals the slightly higher concentrations of nitrophenols at ph 5 than ph 7 coincide with the slightly higher concentration of rcs at ph 5 which also indicates that the formation of nitrophenols was related to phenoxy radicals therefore nitrophenols were mainly formed by the oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol and the combination of no2 with phenoxy radicals generated by rcs scheme 1 3 3 formation of chlorophenols by rcs fig 4 shows the formation of chlorophenols during phenol degradation by the uv nh2cl aop at ph 5 and 7 and note that their formation was undetectable at ph 10 the formation of chlorinated products can be attributable to rcs since nh2cl does not react with phenol within the reaction time for monochlorophenol 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp were detected at ph 7 the concentrations of 2 cp 4 cp quickly increased before decreasing and reached the maxima of 2 8 1 4 µm at 10 min for dichlorophenol the formation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp was slightly slower than those of monochlorophenols which suggests that they were likely the further transformation products of 2 cp and 4 cp whose concentrations continuously increased and reached the maxima of 0 67 0 72 µm at 20 min and subsequently decreased to 0 28 0 25 µm at 60 min the formation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp reached the maximum of 0 54 µm at 20 min and decreased to 0 15 µm at 60 min ph affected the formation of chlorophenols the total formation of chlorophenols was slightly lower at ph 5 compared to ph 7 and that was undetectable at ph 10 at ph 5 and 7 the conversion rates from phenol to chlorophenols reached the maxima of 25 9 and 33 9 at 5 min and then decreased to 6 1 and 6 9 at 60 min respectively figure s5 both formation trends of chlorophenols at ph 5 and ph 7 first increased and subsequently decreased over the reaction time while the transformation rate of monochlorophenol to dichlorophenol was slightly faster at ph 5 than ph 7 specifically 2 6 dcp at ph 5 quickly increased to the maximum of 0 70 µm at 5 min while that at ph 7 reached the maximum of 0 72 µm at 20 min as mentioned the concentrations of rcs decreased with increasing ph due to the transformation of cl to ho via the reaction with oh therefore the slightly higher concentrations of rcs at ph 5 than ph 7 resulted in the slightly faster transformation rates of monochlorophenols which further confirms that rcs play important roles in the formation of chlorophenols no chlorophenol formed at ph 10 which indicates that the roles of rcs at ph 10 are negligible two formation mechanisms of chlorophenols are hypothesized cl addition to the aromatic ring reactions between phenoxy radicals and cl or cl2 the density functional theory dft calculations text s6 show that cl can react with phenol through addition hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer with the low activation free energies δ g r of 4 2 10 7 and 0 7 kcal mol 1 respectively table s1 indicating that cl can readily react with phenol to form chlorophenols via addition and to generate phenoxy radicals through hydrogen abstraction or electron transfer the specific rate constant of cl reacting with phenol through hydrogen abstraction or electron transfer was reported to be 9 109 m 1s 1 which was 80 of the overall rate constant 1 12 1010 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 suggesting that the specific rate constant via addition can be 2 2 109 m 1s 1 cl2 was reported to react with phenol mainly through electron transfer with a second order rate constant of 2 2 108 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 meanwhile the dft calculations show that cl can combine with phenoxy radicals to form chlorophenols with negative gibbs free energy change δ g r table s1 cl2 can also quickly react with phenoxy radicals to generate chlorinated compounds vione et al 2005 liu et al 2009 therefore chlorophenols are mainly generated by the cl addition and reactions between cl cl2 and phenoxy radicals scheme 1 3 4 transformation pathways of phenol degradation by uv nh2cl based on the products identified by uplc q tof ms with negative mode detailed information for the products is provided in table s2 the total ion chromatogram of phenol is shown in figure s8 the main products were confirmed by ms and ms2 spectra figure s9 the time dependent evolution profiles of the major products of phenol degradation by uv nh2cl at ph 7 and ph 10 are provided in figures s10 and s11 respectively chlorinated products were confirmed by the relative abundance ratio of chlorine isotopes 35cl and 37cl at 3 1 figure s9 the effect of ph on the products species was significant at ph 7 the predominant products identified were nitro so products m z 122 c6h5no2 and m z 138 c6h5no3 chloro nitroso products m z 156 c6h4no2cl and m z 190 c6h3no2cl2 hydroxyl chloro nitroso products m z 206 c6h3no3cl2 and m z 172 c6h4no3cl and polymers m z 185a b c12h10o2 m z 219 c12h9o2cl and m z 253c c12h8o2cl2 differently at ph 10 in addition to nitro so products of m z 122 c6h5no2 and m z 138 c6h5no3 the other products were mainly polymers such as m z 185b c12h10o2 m z 277b f c18h14o3 m z 306b c18h13no4 and m z 369c c24h18o4 in contrast no chlorinated product was identified which further indicates the negligible roles of rcs at ph 10 interestingly more polymers were identified at ph 10 than at ph 7 specifically the maximum intensities of dimers of m z 185 m z 219 and m z 253 at ph 7 were 5 9 105 4 6 105 and 3 9 105 respectively while that of trimer of m z 277 was low at 3 7 104 at ph 10 the maximum intensity of dimer of m z 185 was 2 5 106 those of trimers of m z 277 and m z 306 were 3 6 105 and 2 1 105 respectively and that of tetramer of m z 369 was also as high as 5 3 105 the formation of polymers depends on the yields of phenoxy radicals which can be formed from the reactions of rcs and no with phenol and the reaction between no2 and phenolate at ph 10 no2 rapidly reacts with phenolate instead of phenol to form phenoxy radicals which quickly combines with other phenoxy radicals to form polymers ji et al 2019a jiang et al 2014 at ph 7 phenoxy radicals can be formed by rcs and then they prefer to react with rcs and no2 to generate chlorophenols and nitrophenols respectively therefore more polymeric products were detected at ph 10 than at ph 7 due to the enhanced combination of phenoxy radicals according to the identified products the degradation pathways of phenol by the uv nh2cl aop at ph 7 and ph 10 are proposed in fig 5 at ph 7 phenol could be initially nitrosated nitrated or chlorinated to form 4 nitrosophenol m z 122 nitrophenols m z 138 and chlorophenols m z 127 respectively at ph 10 phenol was predominantly nitrosated in the first step the polymerization of phenol through the combination of phenoxy radicals was observed at both ph 7 and ph 10 which primarily formed dimers of m z 185 at ph 7 but formed dimers trimers and tetramers of m z 185 m z 277 and m z 369 respectively at ph 10 then at ph 7 the nitrosation of chlorophenol m z 127a or chlorine substitution of 4 nitrosophenol m z 122 formed chloro nitrosophenol m z 156 further the hydroxylation and chlorine substitution of chloro nitrosophenol m z 156 generated m z 172 and m z 190 respectively hydroxylation was also observed for m z 190 to form m z 206 however hydroxylated products at ph 10 was negligible mainly due to the lower reactivity of ho with phenolate additionally chlorinated dimers of m z 219 and m z 253 were formed at ph 7 by the combination between the phenoxy radicals of chlorophenols m z 127 and that of phenol at ph 10 4 nitrosophenol m z 122 could also form phenoxy radicals which combined with the phenoxy radicals of dimer m z 185 to generate nitrosated trimers m z 306 the carbon mass balance decreased with time by only considering the formation of 4 nitrosophenol nitrophenols and chlorophenols in figs 3 and 4 figure s12 indicating that the unquantified products determined by q tof ms were significant specifically the recovery of carbon considering phenol 4 nitrosophenol nitrophenols and chlorophenols were 33 58 at ph 5 10 and 60 min 3 5 formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps fig 6 shows the dbp formation after the treatment of phenol by 24 h dark chloramination 30 min uv followed by 24 h chloramination 30 min uv nh2cl and that followed by 24 h dark chloramination the time dependent dbp formation is shown in figure s13 the formation of dbps such as chloroform tcm chloral hydrate ch dichloroacetaldehyde dcal dichloroacetonitrile dcan dichloronitromethane dcnm and trichloronitromethane tcnm were significantly enhanced during 30 min uv nh2cl and that followed by 24 h dark chloramination compared to chloramination alone the concentrations of tcm ch dcal dcan and tcnm were 42 5 9 6 4 1 6 2 and 6 8 μg l respectively after 30 min uv nh2cl treatment which significantly increased to 228 5 20 6 19 4 36 9 and 17 3 μg l respectively followed with 24 h chloramination the concentrations of dcnm were approximately 1 0 μg l after 30 min uv nh2cl treatment and that followed by post chloramination the concentrations of tcm ch dcal dcan tcnm and dcnm were only 3 8 0 7 4 6 10 1 0 5 and 0 3 μg l respectively after 24 h dark chloramination and those after 30 min uv treatment with 24 h post chloramination were similar the significant increase in carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps after the uv nh2cl treatment indicates that rcs and rns significantly promoted the dbp and dbp precursors formation 3 6 toxicity evaluation the cho cell cytotoxicities of nitro so phenols and chlorophenols are shown in fig 7 a figure s14 and table s3 4 nitrosophenol shows the highest cytotoxicity with the smallest lc50 of 5 5 mg l meanwhile 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp also show higher cytotoxicity than phenol lc50 394 6 mg l which lc50 was 95 2 224 3 and 132 2 mg l respectively however the lc50 of 2 nitrophenol and 2 chlorophenol were both higher than 1000 mg l indicating the decreased cytotoxicity compared to phenol thus considering the concentrations of different products figs 3 and 4 and their cytotoxicities as lc50 4 nitrosophenol primarily contributed to the overall cytotoxicity during the uv nh2cl treatment of phenol followed by 4 nitrophenol and then chlorophenols such as 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp to further evaluate the uv nh2cl aop the cytotoxicity after chloramination uv followed by 24 h post chloramination uv nh2cl and that followed by 24 h post chloramination at ph 7 were investigated fig 7b after 24 h chloramination the cytotoxicity to cho cells was 13 9 mg phenol l which was 29 3 higher than that after the combination of uv and 24 h post chloramination 10 7 mg phenol l after 20 min uv nh2cl treatment the cytotoxicity sharply increased to 153 9 mg phenol l and continuously increased to 232 0 mg phenol l after 24 h post chloramination the results further indicate that the transformation products of phenol during the uv nh2cl treatment significantly increased the cytotoxicity to cho cells additionally the cytotoxicity increased first and then decreased during the uv nh2cl treatment of phenol the cell viability decreased by 51 1 and 22 8 at 20 min and 30 min respectively fig 7c the longer treatment time eventually reduced the cytotoxicity due to that the formed toxic products were further degraded by uv nh2cl figure s10 the increase of cytotoxicity after the uv nh2cl treatment was partly ascribed to the formation of 4 nitrosophenol 4 nitrophenol and chlorophenols 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp fig 7a in addition chloronitrophenols were reported to have high mutagenicity and genotoxicity ji et al 2019b and the toxicity will increase with an increasing number of aromatic rings of the compounds ritchie and macdonald 2009 therefore the significantly increased cytotoxicity may be also due to the formation of various choro nitro so and polymeric products in the phenol degradation table s2 additionally the cell viability at 88 phenol removal completely decreased to 0 in uv nh2cl while those of uv h2o2 and uv cl2 were 0 29 and 0 38 respectively figure s15 this result indicates that the cytotoxicity of products formed by uv nh2cl was higher than those by uv h2o2 and uv cl2 further confirming the high toxic of nitro so products in uv nh2cl the test calculations also show that 4 nitrosophenol chlorophenols chloro nitrosophenols hydroxylated chloro nitrosophenols and poly chloro aromatic compounds have higher ecotoxicological effects on daphnia and or fish than phenol table s3 in addition the increase in cytotoxicity after post chloramination fig 7b indicates that more toxic products can be generated through the oxidation of nh2cl the cytotoxicity after the uv and chloramination treatment was much lower than that of uv nh2cl mainly due to the small yields of nitrogen and or chlorine containing products which was consistent with the dbp formation fig 6 thus the involvement of rns and rcs during the uv nh2cl aop induces higher toxicity which should be considered as a serious issue in water treatment to mimic the toxicity alteration in real water after the uv nh2cl treatment nom was spiked to simulate drinking water figure s16 similarly the cytotoxicity significantly increased after 30 min uv nh2cl treatment and lc50 decreased by 44 5 this result also indicates that the application of uv nh2cl in real water would increase toxicity which should be evaluated comprehensively 4 conclusions and engineering implications the uv nh2cl aop is a promising technology to degrade emerging organic contaminants while the involvement of rcs and rns in the transformation of organic contaminants results in the formation of chlorinated and nitro so products no can directly attack phenol to form phenoxy radical which then combined with no to generate 4 nitrosophenol the formation of nitrophenols involved two pathways oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol to form 4 nitrophenol and combination of phenoxy radicals and no2 to form both 2 and 4 nitrophenol importantly the cytotoxicity to cho cells of phenol after the uv nh2cl treatment increased by more than 100 times due to the formation of nitro so chloro products and polymers among these products 4 nitrosophenol primarily contributed to the increase of toxicity and the cho cell cytotoxicity followed the order of 4 nitrosophenol 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol phenol also the cytotoxicity increased after the uv nh2cl treatment of nom indicating the risks of uv nh2cl application in real water treatment previous study has shown that the formation of toxic n nitrosamines was enhanced during the uv irradiation of nh2cl soltermann et al 2013 this indicates that no may play a crucial role in the formation of n nitrosamines in uv nh2cl especially in alkaline conditions which requires further evaluation additionally rns are also formed in the treatment of no3 or no2 containing water by uv based aops such as uv chlorine uv h2o2 and uv persulfate mack and bolton 1999 fang et al 2014 chen et al 2020 which toxicity alteration should be evaluated declaration of competing interest the

17141,the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl process is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop to remove organic contaminants in water treatment with radicals including hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive nitrogen species rns this study investigated the formation of nitro so and chlorinated products and toxicity alteration during the uv nh2cl treatment of phenol rns and or rcs induced the formation of nitro so chlorinated and polymeric compounds during phenol transformation by uv nh2cl these compounds dramatically increased the cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cells after 20 min uv nh2cl treatment which was 10 times higher than that after 24 h chloramination the increase of cytotoxicity in uv nh2cl was primarily attributable to 4 nitrosophenol and the cytotoxicity followed the order of 4 nitrosophenol 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol phenol 4 nitrosophenol was significantly generated by the combination of no and phenoxy radical where the maximum conversion rates of phenol to 4 nitrosophenol increased from 4 9 to 62 4 when ph increased from 5 to 10 the highest conversion rate was at ph 10 because the no concentration increased with increasing ph from 5 to 10 in uv nh2cl as verified by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis nitrophenols were also detected at much lower concentrations than 4 nitrosophenol which were mainly formed by the oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol and the combination of no2 with phenoxy radicals rcs was responsible for the formation of chlorinated products mainly through cl addition and the reactions of cl cl2 with phenoxy radicals also rcs and rns significantly enhanced the formation of carbonaceous i e chloroform and chloral hydrate and nitrogenous disinfection byproducts i e chloropicrin and dichloroacetonitrile in uv nh2cl this study indicates that the uv nh2cl treatment significantly increased toxicity and validates the roles of rns and rcs in producing toxic nitro so and chlorinated products graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords the uv monochloramine advanced oxidation process hydroxyl radicals halogen radicals reactive nitrogen species disinfection byproducts toxicity 1 introduction the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl advanced oxidation process aop has gained increasing attention in recent years due to the wide presence in many actual water treatment scenarios such as the treatment of ammoniacal water by uv chlorine wu et al 2017 the application of nh2cl to minimize biofouling in potable water reuse xu et al 2010 and the uv treatment of chlorinated swimming pool water soltermann et al 2014 the uv photolysis of nh2cl produces amidogen radical nh2 and chlorine atom cl eq 1 li and blatchley iii 2009 which then transforms to no no2 ho and cl2 through the interaction with o2 h2o oh or cl eqs 2 12 de laat et al 2010 grebel et al 2010 wu et al 2019 nist 2020 the significant production of these radicals in uv nh2cl contributed to the efficient removal of organic pollutants such as 1 4 dioxane benzoate carbamazepine estradiol triclosan sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and naproxen bu et al 2018 chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2018 sun et al 2019a wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 however toxic nitro so and chlorinated products are likely generated during the uv nh2cl treatment due to the involvement of reactive nitrogen species rns and

organic radicals such as carbon and oxygen centered radicals to form nitroso compounds grisham et al 1999 for example no can combine with phenoxy radicals to generate nitrosophenol vione et al 2004 no2 was reported to selectively react with electron rich compounds such as phenolic groups anilines and thiols neta et al 1988 huang et al 2018 specifically no2 can react with unsaturated organic matter via addition such as olefins acetylenic compounds and aromatic compounds to form nitro compounds gray and yoffe 1955 no2 slowly reacts with phenolic compounds through hydrogen abstraction huie 1994 but it quickly combines with phenoxy radicals to form nitrophenolic compounds vione et al 2011 our previous study observed nitroso products in the transformation of ibuprofen and naproxen by uv nh2cl due to the involvement of no wu et al 2019 however the formation mechanism of nitro so products by rns in uv nh2cl has not been well clarified and requires further investigation rcs such as cl and cl2 have high redox potentials of 2 4 v cl and 2 0 v cl2 fang et al 2014 which can directly attack many pollutants alegre et al 2000 lei et al 2019 cl reacts with organic pollutants that bear electron rich moieties mainly through electron transfer to form corresponding cation radicals and it reacts with phenolic compounds to generate phenoxy radicals via electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction alfassi et al 1989 lei et al 2019 in addition cl addition was demonstrated to be an important reaction mechanism for the degradation of pollutants to generate chlorinated products wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 lei et al 2019 cl2 reacts with aromatics bearing electron donating groups aliphatic compounds and olefins mainly through electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and addition respectively hasegawa and neta 1978 additionally cl2 can react with phenoxy radicals to generate chlorophenols vione et al 2005 in the uv nh2cl aop chlorinated products were observed during the degradation of ibuprofen naproxen and carbamazepine bu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 therefore chlorinated products can be generated during the uv nh2cl treatment via the interaction of rcs which must be quantitatively investigated the roles of rcs in the formation of nitro so products by rns also need to be further investigated the toxicity alteration during the organic pollutants degradation is important for the evaluation of aops nitro so compounds and chlorinated aromatic compounds were reported to have high carcinogenicity mutagenicity and genotoxicity swann 1975 komulainen 2004 misaki et al 2008 for example n nitrosodimethylamine is a well known liver carcinogen for various animals liu and hotchkiss 1995 the nitro products of sulfamethoxazole and several β blockers have higher mutagenicity and carcinogenicity than their parent compounds osorio et al 2016 toolaram et al 2017 dinitrobisphenol a shows higher genotoxicity to goldfish than bisphenol a toyoizumi et al 2008 chloronitrophenols are more genotoxic and mutagenic to bacillus subtilis than chlorophenols heng et al 1996 the genotoxicity to salmonella typhimurium increased significantly during the chlorination of 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone due to the formation of chlorobenzoquinones sun et al 2019b similarly the genotoxicity in sos umu assay had an elevation after chlorination of cefazolin also related to the formation of chlorinated product li et al 2013 besides the toxicity of dichlorinated methyl and n propylparaben toward d magna was 3 9 and 2 8 fold of that of their corresponding parent compounds terasaki et al 2009 thus the toxicity of nitro so and chlorinated products produced during the transformation of organic compounds by the uv nh2cl aop should be comprehensively investigated therefore the objectives of this study are to quantify the rns and rcs controlling the production of nitro so and chlorinated products clarify their formation mechanisms during the uv nh2cl aop and evaluate the toxicity alteration phenol was selected as the target compound since phenolic compounds are common anthropogenic and natural chemicals and widely used in industries kolpin et al 2002 barnes et al 2008 ahmed et al 2010 which contaminate the sources of drinking water with trace concentrations prasse et al 2018 additionally phenolic compounds have poor biodegradability and are teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic thus they are harmful to humans animals and plants even at low concentrations huang et al 2007 the concentrations of phenolic compounds in industrial wastewater range from 20 to 1200 mg l kurzbaum et al 2017 moreover phenolic moieties are typical in natural organic matter nom which concentration in drinking water can reach 2 10 mg l levchuk et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all solutions were prepared with reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm sources of reagents are provided in text s1 the nh2cl solution was freshly prepared by adding naocl solution to an nh4cl solution at a chlorine to ammonia n mass ratio of 4 1 for over 40 min with rapid stirring and the naocl solution and nh4cl solution were adjusted to ph 10 by naoh solution before mixing shang and blatchley 1999 note that the excess ammonia concentration of ammonia 12 5 μm at 50 μm nh2cl has negligible effects on radical concentrations which was demonstrated by the kinetic modeling in our previous study wu et al 2019 2 2 experimental procedure the photochemical reactor was set up according to our previous study wu et al 2019 the uv photon flux i0 that entered the solution was determined to be 0 439 μe s 1 using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and linden 2003 the effective path length l was determined to be 2 43 cm by measuring the kinetics of the dilute h2o2 photolysis figure s1 garoma and gurol 2005 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep0 was estimated to be 0 72 mw cm 2 a 700 ml test solution containing 2 mm phosphate buffer 5 μm phenol and 1 μm nitrobenzene nb was dosed with 50 μm nh2cl and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation the effects of ph 5 7 and 10 were investigated control tests of phenol degradation by nh2cl alone and direct uv photolysis were similarly performed but without uv light and nh2cl respectively samples were collected at different time intervals and quenched with na2s2o3 at a molar ratio of na2s2o3 to nh2cl of 4 1 all tests were performed at least twice the error bars in all data plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the duplicated test results higher initial concentrations of phenol 50 μm and nh2cl 200 or 500 μm were used to identify and quantify the products and disinfection byproducts dbps formed during the phenol degradation by uv nh2cl the cytotoxicity of the degradation products was similarly investigated 2 3 analytical methods the analytical methods of phenol nb nitrophenols chlorophenols nitrosophenol and dbps are provided in text s2 the concentrations of naocl and nh2cl were determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the ph of the solution was measured with a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo no was measured by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr using diethyldithiocarbamate detc 2 fe2 as the spin trapping agent wu et al 2019 the intermediates and products of phenol degradation were identified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms waters synapt g2 si usa which was equipped with an electrospray interface esi the samples 500 ml for products analysis were concentrated to 2 ml by solid phase extraction spe following the procedure in a literature michael et al 2012 details of the chromatographic and mass conditions of the uplc q tof ms analysis are described in text s3 samples for cytotoxicity evaluation were also concentrated by spe according to previous study du et al 2017 the cytotoxicity was evaluated by a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line with details shown in text s4 the ecotoxicity of specific product was calculated using the toxicity estimation software tool test details in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenol transformation kinetic by uv nh2cl fig 1 shows the pseudo first order rate constants k to degrade phenol by the uv nh2cl aop at ph 5 7 and 10 the overall k remained almost constant at 0 0016 cm2 mj when ph increased from 5 to 7 while k sharply decreased to 0 00096 cm2 mj at ph 10 based on the radical chemistry in uv nh2cl the overall k of phenol degradation can be attributed to uv ho rcs and rns eq 13 note that the degradation of phenol by nh2cl was negligible data not shown 13 k k uv k ho k rcs rns 14 k ho k ho ho ss k uv k ho and k rcs rns are defined as the specific k by uv direct photolysis ho and rcs rns respectively k uv can be obtained by uv direct photolysis k ho can be calculated by the steady state concentration of ho ho ss and second order rate constant of ho reacting with phenol eq 14 nb was used as a probe compound to determine ho ss figure s2 which only reacts with ho with a second order rate constant of 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 following the method described in literatures fang et al 2014 huang et al 2018 k ho is the second order rate constant of ho reacting with phenol which was determined to be 7 6 109 7 8 109 and 2 7 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 7 and 10 respectively by competition kinetics using p chlorobenzoic acid pcba as a reference compound figure s3 then k rcs rns can be determined by eq 13 pk a of phenol is 9 89 dzengel et al 1999 which indicates that more phenol is transformed to phenolate at ph 10 than that at ph 5 and 7 for a specific k when ph increased from 5 to 7 k ho increased by 60 0 while k rcs rns decreased by 20 0 however when ph further increased from 7 to 10 k ho significantly decreased by 65 7 and k rcs rns slightly decreased by 13 0 the concentrations of ho were determined to be 5 5 10 14 m 8 3 10 14 m and 8 6 10 14 m at ph 5 7 and 10 figure s2 respectively since cl transforms to ho via the reaction with oh eqs 10 and 11 thus k ho at ph 7 was higher than ph 5 however k ho at ph 10 significantly decreased due to the low second order rate constant of ho reacting with phenolate the roles of rcs to phenol degradation at ph 10 were negligible as indicated by the undetectable chlorinated products at ph 10 figs 4 and 5 however when the ph increased from 7 to 10 k rcs rns only slightly decreased by 13 0 which was very likely responsible for the increase in k rns at ph 10 which compensated for the decrease in k rcs due to the following reasons 1 the concentration of no increased with increasing ph which was proved by the epr analysis the epr signal of no was almost undetectable at ph 5 while it increased by 150 from ph 7 to ph 10 fig 2 2 the second order rate constant of no2 reacting with phenolate was 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 which was much higher than that with phenol 3 103 m 1 s 1 vione et al 2011 3 2 formation of nitrosophenol and nitrophenols by rns the involvement of rns in phenol transformation by uv nh2cl results in the formation of 4 nitrosophenol and nitrophenols i e 2 nitrophenol 4 nitrophenol fig 3 for 4 nitrosophenol the concentration continuously increased and reached the maximum 2 45 µm at 30 min then it slightly decreased to 2 05 µm at 60 min during the treatment of 50 µm phenol by uv nh2cl at ph 7 for nitrophenols the concentrations of 4 nitrophenol and 2 nitrophenol monotonically increased over 60 min and reached the maxima of 0 13 µm and 0 37 µm respectively apparently the formation of 4 nitrosophenol was much higher than that of nitrophenols which indicates that no had a more significant role in the transformation of phenol than no2 since much more no was produced than no2 in uv nh2cl wu et al 2019 ph can significantly affect the formation kinetics of 4 nitrosophenol and nitrophenols but the effects were inconsistent with the degradation kinetics of phenol the degradation rates of phenol followed the order of ph 5 ph 7 ph 10 figure s4 however the formation of 4 nitrosophenol and conversion rates of 4 nitrosophenol i e the ratio of the formed 4 nitrosophenol to the degraded phenol followed the order of ph 10 ph 7 ph 5 with the concentrations of 5 49 µm 2 05 µm and 0 44 µm at 60 min respectively fig 3a the higher formation of 4 nitrosophenol at ph 10 can be mainly due to the higher concentration of no fig 2 when the reaction time increased from 5 to 60 min the conversion rates from phenol to 4 nitrosophenol at ph 5 7 and 10 decreased from 4 9 to 1 2 from 8 1 to 5 8 and from 62 4 to 20 3 respectively which indicates that 4 nitrosophenol was initially produced and subsequently transformed to other products for nitrophenols the formation of 4 nitrophenol at 60 min followed the order of ph 10 0 25 µm ph 5 0 19 µm ph 7 0 13 µm while that of 2 nitrophenol was ph 5 0 44 µm ph 7 0 37 µm ph 10 0 09 µm the formation of 2 nitrophenol was higher than 4 nitrophenol at ph 5 and ph 7 while it was opposite at ph 10 the conversion rates from phenol to nitrophenols at 5 60 min changed slightly from 1 8 to 1 7 at ph 5 from 1 1 to 1 4 at ph 7 and from 1 0 to 1 3 at ph 10 figure s5 note that the removal rates of phenol at 60 min were 73 71 and 54 at ph 5 7 and 10 respectively figure s5 1 formation mechanism of nitrosophenol only 4 nitrosophenol was detected in the uv nh2cl aop and its formation trend with ph coincided with the yields of no fig 2 the reaction mechanism of no with phenol was confirmed by purging no gas to a deoxygenated solution that contained 50 μm phenol figure s6 in which phenol degradation was only ascribed to no the transformed phenol was entirely converted into 4 nitrosophenol at 5 min with the conversion rate of 100 figure s6 which indicates that no can attack phenol to form 4 nitrosophenol as the only product it has been reported that no can react with phenolic antioxidants such as 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenol 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol and α tocopherol to produce phenoxy radicals janzen et al 1993 which then react with excess no to form no adducts janzen et al 1993 vione et al 2004 thus the initial reaction of no gas with phenol was proposed to generate phenoxy radical in analogy to phenolic antioxidants which then combined with no to form 4 nitrosophenol also phenoxy radicals can be formed in uv nh2cl through the reactions of phenol with cl via electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction and with cl2 via electron transfer eqs 15 and 16 alfassi et al 1989 das 2005 lei et al 2019 thus 4 nitrosophenol was generated from the combination of no with phenoxy radicals which can be formed by the reactions of phenol with no or rcs scheme 1 15 16 2 formation mechanism of nitrophenols the formation of nitrophenols is hypothesized to follow three mechanisms oxidation of nitrosophenol to nitrophenol reaction between no2 and phenol combination of no2 with phenoxy radicals 1 the highest formation of 4 nitrophenol at ph 10 coincides with that of 4 nitrosophenol which indicates that 4 nitrophenol can be mainly generated via further oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol as reported 4 nitrosophenol can be oxidized to 4 nitrophenol in the no2 photolysis system in the presence of o2 vione et al 2001a also the conversion rate from 4 nitrosophenol to 4 nitrophenol can be reached 7 during the uv nh2cl aop at 15 min figure s7 2 the second order rate constants of no2 reacting with phenol and phenolate are 3 103 m 1 s 1 and 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 respectively vione et al 2011 vione et al 2001b which indicates that the contribution of no2 to the transformation of phenol phenolate at ph 10 can be considerable but not at ph 5 and ph 7 however nitrophenols were not detectable at ph 9 during the phenol degradation by the uv no3 process where no2 was produced dzengel et al 1999 vione et al 2001b mainly since no2 reacts with phenolate via electron transfer to form phenoxy radicals but not no2 addition thus nitrophenols cannot be produced via the direct reaction between no2 and phenol 3 no2 quickly reacts with phenoxy radicals at 109 m 1 s 1 vione et al 2011 according to eqs 15 and 16 phenoxy radicals can be generated by rcs in uv nh2cl then no2 can combine with phenoxy radicals the slightly higher concentrations of nitrophenols at ph 5 than ph 7 coincide with the slightly higher concentration of rcs at ph 5 which also indicates that the formation of nitrophenols was related to phenoxy radicals therefore nitrophenols were mainly formed by the oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol and the combination of no2 with phenoxy radicals generated by rcs scheme 1 3 3 formation of chlorophenols by rcs fig 4 shows the formation of chlorophenols during phenol degradation by the uv nh2cl aop at ph 5 and 7 and note that their formation was undetectable at ph 10 the formation of chlorinated products can be attributable to rcs since nh2cl does not react with phenol within the reaction time for monochlorophenol 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp were detected at ph 7 the concentrations of 2 cp 4 cp quickly increased before decreasing and reached the maxima of 2 8 1 4 µm at 10 min for dichlorophenol the formation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp was slightly slower than those of monochlorophenols which suggests that they were likely the further transformation products of 2 cp and 4 cp whose concentrations continuously increased and reached the maxima of 0 67 0 72 µm at 20 min and subsequently decreased to 0 28 0 25 µm at 60 min the formation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp reached the maximum of 0 54 µm at 20 min and decreased to 0 15 µm at 60 min ph affected the formation of chlorophenols the total formation of chlorophenols was slightly lower at ph 5 compared to ph 7 and that was undetectable at ph 10 at ph 5 and 7 the conversion rates from phenol to chlorophenols reached the maxima of 25 9 and 33 9 at 5 min and then decreased to 6 1 and 6 9 at 60 min respectively figure s5 both formation trends of chlorophenols at ph 5 and ph 7 first increased and subsequently decreased over the reaction time while the transformation rate of monochlorophenol to dichlorophenol was slightly faster at ph 5 than ph 7 specifically 2 6 dcp at ph 5 quickly increased to the maximum of 0 70 µm at 5 min while that at ph 7 reached the maximum of 0 72 µm at 20 min as mentioned the concentrations of rcs decreased with increasing ph due to the transformation of cl to ho via the reaction with oh therefore the slightly higher concentrations of rcs at ph 5 than ph 7 resulted in the slightly faster transformation rates of monochlorophenols which further confirms that rcs play important roles in the formation of chlorophenols no chlorophenol formed at ph 10 which indicates that the roles of rcs at ph 10 are negligible two formation mechanisms of chlorophenols are hypothesized cl addition to the aromatic ring reactions between phenoxy radicals and cl or cl2 the density functional theory dft calculations text s6 show that cl can react with phenol through addition hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer with the low activation free energies δ g r of 4 2 10 7 and 0 7 kcal mol 1 respectively table s1 indicating that cl can readily react with phenol to form chlorophenols via addition and to generate phenoxy radicals through hydrogen abstraction or electron transfer the specific rate constant of cl reacting with phenol through hydrogen abstraction or electron transfer was reported to be 9 109 m 1s 1 which was 80 of the overall rate constant 1 12 1010 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 suggesting that the specific rate constant via addition can be 2 2 109 m 1s 1 cl2 was reported to react with phenol mainly through electron transfer with a second order rate constant of 2 2 108 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 meanwhile the dft calculations show that cl can combine with phenoxy radicals to form chlorophenols with negative gibbs free energy change δ g r table s1 cl2 can also quickly react with phenoxy radicals to generate chlorinated compounds vione et al 2005 liu et al 2009 therefore chlorophenols are mainly generated by the cl addition and reactions between cl cl2 and phenoxy radicals scheme 1 3 4 transformation pathways of phenol degradation by uv nh2cl based on the products identified by uplc q tof ms with negative mode detailed information for the products is provided in table s2 the total ion chromatogram of phenol is shown in figure s8 the main products were confirmed by ms and ms2 spectra figure s9 the time dependent evolution profiles of the major products of phenol degradation by uv nh2cl at ph 7 and ph 10 are provided in figures s10 and s11 respectively chlorinated products were confirmed by the relative abundance ratio of chlorine isotopes 35cl and 37cl at 3 1 figure s9 the effect of ph on the products species was significant at ph 7 the predominant products identified were nitro so products m z 122 c6h5no2 and m z 138 c6h5no3 chloro nitroso products m z 156 c6h4no2cl and m z 190 c6h3no2cl2 hydroxyl chloro nitroso products m z 206 c6h3no3cl2 and m z 172 c6h4no3cl and polymers m z 185a b c12h10o2 m z 219 c12h9o2cl and m z 253c c12h8o2cl2 differently at ph 10 in addition to nitro so products of m z 122 c6h5no2 and m z 138 c6h5no3 the other products were mainly polymers such as m z 185b c12h10o2 m z 277b f c18h14o3 m z 306b c18h13no4 and m z 369c c24h18o4 in contrast no chlorinated product was identified which further indicates the negligible roles of rcs at ph 10 interestingly more polymers were identified at ph 10 than at ph 7 specifically the maximum intensities of dimers of m z 185 m z 219 and m z 253 at ph 7 were 5 9 105 4 6 105 and 3 9 105 respectively while that of trimer of m z 277 was low at 3 7 104 at ph 10 the maximum intensity of dimer of m z 185 was 2 5 106 those of trimers of m z 277 and m z 306 were 3 6 105 and 2 1 105 respectively and that of tetramer of m z 369 was also as high as 5 3 105 the formation of polymers depends on the yields of phenoxy radicals which can be formed from the reactions of rcs and no with phenol and the reaction between no2 and phenolate at ph 10 no2 rapidly reacts with phenolate instead of phenol to form phenoxy radicals which quickly combines with other phenoxy radicals to form polymers ji et al 2019a jiang et al 2014 at ph 7 phenoxy radicals can be formed by rcs and then they prefer to react with rcs and no2 to generate chlorophenols and nitrophenols respectively therefore more polymeric products were detected at ph 10 than at ph 7 due to the enhanced combination of phenoxy radicals according to the identified products the degradation pathways of phenol by the uv nh2cl aop at ph 7 and ph 10 are proposed in fig 5 at ph 7 phenol could be initially nitrosated nitrated or chlorinated to form 4 nitrosophenol m z 122 nitrophenols m z 138 and chlorophenols m z 127 respectively at ph 10 phenol was predominantly nitrosated in the first step the polymerization of phenol through the combination of phenoxy radicals was observed at both ph 7 and ph 10 which primarily formed dimers of m z 185 at ph 7 but formed dimers trimers and tetramers of m z 185 m z 277 and m z 369 respectively at ph 10 then at ph 7 the nitrosation of chlorophenol m z 127a or chlorine substitution of 4 nitrosophenol m z 122 formed chloro nitrosophenol m z 156 further the hydroxylation and chlorine substitution of chloro nitrosophenol m z 156 generated m z 172 and m z 190 respectively hydroxylation was also observed for m z 190 to form m z 206 however hydroxylated products at ph 10 was negligible mainly due to the lower reactivity of ho with phenolate additionally chlorinated dimers of m z 219 and m z 253 were formed at ph 7 by the combination between the phenoxy radicals of chlorophenols m z 127 and that of phenol at ph 10 4 nitrosophenol m z 122 could also form phenoxy radicals which combined with the phenoxy radicals of dimer m z 185 to generate nitrosated trimers m z 306 the carbon mass balance decreased with time by only considering the formation of 4 nitrosophenol nitrophenols and chlorophenols in figs 3 and 4 figure s12 indicating that the unquantified products determined by q tof ms were significant specifically the recovery of carbon considering phenol 4 nitrosophenol nitrophenols and chlorophenols were 33 58 at ph 5 10 and 60 min 3 5 formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps fig 6 shows the dbp formation after the treatment of phenol by 24 h dark chloramination 30 min uv followed by 24 h chloramination 30 min uv nh2cl and that followed by 24 h dark chloramination the time dependent dbp formation is shown in figure s13 the formation of dbps such as chloroform tcm chloral hydrate ch dichloroacetaldehyde dcal dichloroacetonitrile dcan dichloronitromethane dcnm and trichloronitromethane tcnm were significantly enhanced during 30 min uv nh2cl and that followed by 24 h dark chloramination compared to chloramination alone the concentrations of tcm ch dcal dcan and tcnm were 42 5 9 6 4 1 6 2 and 6 8 μg l respectively after 30 min uv nh2cl treatment which significantly increased to 228 5 20 6 19 4 36 9 and 17 3 μg l respectively followed with 24 h chloramination the concentrations of dcnm were approximately 1 0 μg l after 30 min uv nh2cl treatment and that followed by post chloramination the concentrations of tcm ch dcal dcan tcnm and dcnm were only 3 8 0 7 4 6 10 1 0 5 and 0 3 μg l respectively after 24 h dark chloramination and those after 30 min uv treatment with 24 h post chloramination were similar the significant increase in carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps after the uv nh2cl treatment indicates that rcs and rns significantly promoted the dbp and dbp precursors formation 3 6 toxicity evaluation the cho cell cytotoxicities of nitro so phenols and chlorophenols are shown in fig 7 a figure s14 and table s3 4 nitrosophenol shows the highest cytotoxicity with the smallest lc50 of 5 5 mg l meanwhile 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp also show higher cytotoxicity than phenol lc50 394 6 mg l which lc50 was 95 2 224 3 and 132 2 mg l respectively however the lc50 of 2 nitrophenol and 2 chlorophenol were both higher than 1000 mg l indicating the decreased cytotoxicity compared to phenol thus considering the concentrations of different products figs 3 and 4 and their cytotoxicities as lc50 4 nitrosophenol primarily contributed to the overall cytotoxicity during the uv nh2cl treatment of phenol followed by 4 nitrophenol and then chlorophenols such as 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp to further evaluate the uv nh2cl aop the cytotoxicity after chloramination uv followed by 24 h post chloramination uv nh2cl and that followed by 24 h post chloramination at ph 7 were investigated fig 7b after 24 h chloramination the cytotoxicity to cho cells was 13 9 mg phenol l which was 29 3 higher than that after the combination of uv and 24 h post chloramination 10 7 mg phenol l after 20 min uv nh2cl treatment the cytotoxicity sharply increased to 153 9 mg phenol l and continuously increased to 232 0 mg phenol l after 24 h post chloramination the results further indicate that the transformation products of phenol during the uv nh2cl treatment significantly increased the cytotoxicity to cho cells additionally the cytotoxicity increased first and then decreased during the uv nh2cl treatment of phenol the cell viability decreased by 51 1 and 22 8 at 20 min and 30 min respectively fig 7c the longer treatment time eventually reduced the cytotoxicity due to that the formed toxic products were further degraded by uv nh2cl figure s10 the increase of cytotoxicity after the uv nh2cl treatment was partly ascribed to the formation of 4 nitrosophenol 4 nitrophenol and chlorophenols 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp fig 7a in addition chloronitrophenols were reported to have high mutagenicity and genotoxicity ji et al 2019b and the toxicity will increase with an increasing number of aromatic rings of the compounds ritchie and macdonald 2009 therefore the significantly increased cytotoxicity may be also due to the formation of various choro nitro so and polymeric products in the phenol degradation table s2 additionally the cell viability at 88 phenol removal completely decreased to 0 in uv nh2cl while those of uv h2o2 and uv cl2 were 0 29 and 0 38 respectively figure s15 this result indicates that the cytotoxicity of products formed by uv nh2cl was higher than those by uv h2o2 and uv cl2 further confirming the high toxic of nitro so products in uv nh2cl the test calculations also show that 4 nitrosophenol chlorophenols chloro nitrosophenols hydroxylated chloro nitrosophenols and poly chloro aromatic compounds have higher ecotoxicological effects on daphnia and or fish than phenol table s3 in addition the increase in cytotoxicity after post chloramination fig 7b indicates that more toxic products can be generated through the oxidation of nh2cl the cytotoxicity after the uv and chloramination treatment was much lower than that of uv nh2cl mainly due to the small yields of nitrogen and or chlorine containing products which was consistent with the dbp formation fig 6 thus the involvement of rns and rcs during the uv nh2cl aop induces higher toxicity which should be considered as a serious issue in water treatment to mimic the toxicity alteration in real water after the uv nh2cl treatment nom was spiked to simulate drinking water figure s16 similarly the cytotoxicity significantly increased after 30 min uv nh2cl treatment and lc50 decreased by 44 5 this result also indicates that the application of uv nh2cl in real water would increase toxicity which should be evaluated comprehensively 4 conclusions and engineering implications the uv nh2cl aop is a promising technology to degrade emerging organic contaminants while the involvement of rcs and rns in the transformation of organic contaminants results in the formation of chlorinated and nitro so products no can directly attack phenol to form phenoxy radical which then combined with no to generate 4 nitrosophenol the formation of nitrophenols involved two pathways oxidation of 4 nitrosophenol to form 4 nitrophenol and combination of phenoxy radicals and no2 to form both 2 and 4 nitrophenol importantly the cytotoxicity to cho cells of phenol after the uv nh2cl treatment increased by more than 100 times due to the formation of nitro so chloro products and polymers among these products 4 nitrosophenol primarily contributed to the increase of toxicity and the cho cell cytotoxicity followed the order of 4 nitrosophenol 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol phenol also the cytotoxicity increased after the uv nh2cl treatment of nom indicating the risks of uv nh2cl application in real water treatment previous study has shown that the formation of toxic n nitrosamines was enhanced during the uv irradiation of nh2cl soltermann et al 2013 this indicates that no may play a crucial role in the formation of n nitrosamines in uv nh2cl especially in alkaline conditions which requires further evaluation additionally rns are also formed in the treatment of no3 or no2 containing water by uv based aops such as uv chlorine uv h2o2 and uv persulfate mack and bolton 1999 fang et al 2014 chen et al 2020 which toxicity alteration should be evaluated declaration of competing interest the

17142,nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo processes have been proven effective for nitrogen removal from synthetic wastewater however the demonstration using real wastewater has not been achieved yet to this end this study investigated the versatile applications of n damo process in real wastewater treatment for the first time two methane based membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs were employed to combine anammox and n damo microorganisms targeting nitrogen removal in mainstream i e domestic sewage and sidestream i e anaerobic digestion liquor respectively considering various technologies in sewage treatment three different technical routes including nitritation methane based mbfr partial nitritation methane based mbfr and partial nitritation anammox methane based mbfr were investigated comprehensively all producing effluent quality with total nitrogen tn at 5 mg n l or less regarding the sidestream treatment the methane based mbfr also removed up to 96 tn from the partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor at a practically useful rate of 0 5 kg n m3 d microbial communities revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing indicated the dominance of n damo archaea in both reactors along with the existence of anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria as the first demonstration of n damo process in real wastewater this study comprehensively confirmed the applicability of using methane as carbon source to remove nitrogen from both mainstream and sidestream wastewater supporting their adoption by industries in practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox anaerobic methane oxidation n damo membrane biofilm reactor domestic sewage anaerobic digestion liquor 1 introduction conventional biological nitrogen removal processes which are widely established in wastewater treatment plants wwtps have the downsides of their owns nitrogen removal from wastewater is generally achieved using aerobic conversion of ammonium to nitrate via nitrification and anaerobic conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas via denitrification guo et al 2013 however this conventional nitrification denitrification n dn route requires high costs for aeration and chemical consumption which is expected to be upgraded using novel microbial processes over the years extensive studies have been performed on anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox an autotrophic nitrogen removal pathway with the advantages of lower organic carbon consumption less aeration demand up to 60 savings compared to n dn and sludge production kartal et al 2010 being coupled with partial nitritation pn anammox based processes have been widely established as an alternative to conventional n dn especially in treating high strength wastewater like anaerobic sludge digestion liquor lackner et al 2014 however every mole of ammonium oxidized would produce 0 26 mole of nitrate thus capping the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency at 89 based on the stoichiometry of the anammox process reaction 1 strous et al 1999 this poses several challenges including relatively poor effluent quality with nitrate accumulation and the stringent requirement for influent nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 32 1 de clippeleir et al 2013 lackner et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 1 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o the recent discovery of nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo process enabled nitrite and nitrate removal by utilizing electrons obtained from methane oxidation ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 two distinct microbial groups have been identified with the role in nitrate damo mediated by n damo archaea haroon et al 2013 and nitrite damo driven by n damo bacteria ettwig et al 2010 being coupled with anammox bacteria n damo archaea have the ability to reduce the nitrate produced by anammox reaction reaction 2 while n damo bacteria are able to consume the excess nitrite in the feed reaction 3 with these unique advantages of cross feeding and substrate competition anammox and n damo microorganisms could co exist and be enriched by providing substrates such as ammonium with nitrite or ammonium with nitrate luesken et al 2011 shi et al 2013 2 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o 3 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o previous studies have demonstrated n damo process in different reactor configurations including sequencing batch reactors sbr ding et al 2014 fu et al 2017 hu et al 2015 luesken et al 2011 and membrane bioreactor mbr with suspended sludge allegue et al 2018 kampman et al 2014 stultiens et al 2019 as well as methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr cai et al 2015 ding et al 2017 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020c shi et al 2013 xie et al 2018 among all methane based mbfrs are advantageous with the attachment of slow growing anammox and n damo microorganisms on the hollow fiber membrane surface enabling better biomass retention bubble less delivery of gas from hollow fibres on the other hand improves the mass transfer efficiency of the methane based application modin et al 2007 shi et al 2013 nonetheless synthetic wastewater with constant feeding was always used in these previous studies while the treatment of real wastewater with dynamics has not been reported yet in addition to the dynamics the complex matrix of real wastewater even after receiving a secondary treatment such as metals and remaining organic matter could also negatively impact the microbial activity for example reino et al 2018 reported a significant adverse impact on anammox activity when the feed was switched from synthetic to real wastewater attributing to several possible factors such as microbial population shift or inhibitory compounds in real wastewater similarly laureni et al 2015 also observed two to three folds increase in doubling time of anammox bacteria moving from synthetic media to municipal wastewater along with a decreased microbial activity thus prior to the upscaling of this methane based mbfr coupling anammox with n damo microorganisms it is of great significance to examine whether it is robust when treating real wastewater on the other hand due to the close collaboration among different microbial populations it was hypothesized that the combined anammox with n damo process is versatile which can be used to treat wastewater with different nitrogen compositions yet each of the previous mbfr studies only focused on one specific wastewater stream and there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation about the scope of n damo process in wwtps therefore the aim of this present study is to investigate the viability and versatility of this unique microbial coculture in treating real mainstream and sidestream wastewater two particular questions will be addressed 1 if this new technology coupling anammox and n damo process is robust when treating real wastewater and 2 can this methane based mbfr be applied in various treatment routes to this end two laboratory methane based mbfrs were assigned for mainstream i e domestic sewage and sidestream i e anaerobic digestion liquor examination respectively considering various treatment processes in domestic sewage the nitrogen removal from three different types of wastewater were tested including the effluent from nitritation partial nitritation and anammox process meanwhile the treatment route including partial nitritation and methane based mbfr was also assessed under sidestream condition microbial analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to identify the functional microbial communities in both reactors as the first demonstration of n damo process in real wastewater our results provide a comprehensive picture of its applicability in wwtps further supporting the concept of using methane as the carbon source to remove nitrogen from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors configuration and setup the mainstream reactor mbfr1 has a volume of 1150 ml consisting of 900 poly acrylonitrile hollow fibers aip 2013 pall japan with each fiber having 55 2 cm in length and an inner diameter of 0 8 mm the volume for the membrane fibers is 700 ml in total giving a working volume of 450 ml for the reactor with 1 m2 total surface area the biofilm reactor has a specific surface area membrane surface area reactor volume of 869 m2 m3 the sidestream reactor mbfr2 has a total volume of 2356 ml with 12 bundles of membrane modules for methane delivery the membrane bundle has 500 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan each with a length of 30 cm and an inner diameter of 0 09 mm all taking up a total volume of 56 ml 45 ml for fiber materials and 11 ml for interior fiber lumen for gas delivery this gives rise to an overall working volume of 2300 ml for the reactor with 1 13 m2 total membrane surface area the specific surface area of mbfr2 was observed to be 480 m2 m3 mbfr1 and mbfr2 shared similar experimental set up fig 1 briefly the bulk liquid in both mbfrs was recirculated from the top to the bottom via a peristaltic pump masterflex l s us the deoxygenated feeding stored in a 5 l drum was fed into the reactor by another peristaltic pump bt300 2j longer pump china an overflow bottle 330 ml was set up for liquid and gas sampling as well as monitoring the ph via probe implemented oakton australia gas bags filled with nitrogen gas and water seal bottles were used to ensure the systems were strictly anaerobic the membrane modules of both reactors were connected to a methane gas cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 allowing methane gas to permeate through the membrane lumens with a high driving force and without bubble formation gas pressure inside the membrane lumens was set at 160 kpa and 120 kpa for mbfr1 and mbfr2 respectively regulated and monitored with pressure gauges ross brown australia 2 2 operational strategies and conditions high rate activated sludge hras effluent with tn of 56 7 mg n l mainstream and partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor with tn of 986 81 mg n l sidestream were both collected from the luggage point sewage treatment plant queensland australia the feed compositions entering the mbfrs under different treatment routes are highlighted in table 1 in total four different applications of methane based mbfr were investigated including three scenarios for domestic sewage in mbfr1 fig 2 a and one for sidestream wastewater in mbfr2 fig 2b mbfr1 and mbfr2 were operated at 22 c and 35 c respectively all hydraulic retention time hrt mentioned below are calculated based on the working volumes of the reactors in scenario i the nitrogen removal by a two stage process consisting of nitritation followed by the methane based mbfr was demonstrated in the first stage the majority of ammonium was converted into nitrite 85 the produced nitrite together with the residual ammonium ph between 5 and 5 5 were then removed in the methane based mbfr as the second stage in scenario ii the nitritation unit was replaced by a partial nitritation system which converted about 50 ammonium to nitrite the feasibility to remove nitrogen from pn effluent ph between 5 and 5 5 using methane based mbfr was then investigated the hrt was maintained to be 1 d for scenarios i and ii in scenario iii we investigated whether n damo process can be used to polish the mainstream anammox effluent which is more relevant for a wwtp already possessing anammox reactors the effluent of anammox process ph between 7 and 7 5 usually contains residual nitrate and ammonium table 1 notably the hrt was shortened to 12 h on day 242 in scenario iv the nitrogen removal in anaerobic digestion liquor was studied in mbfr2 via a two stage configuration consisting of partial nitritation which then fed into ph between 7 and 7 5 methane based mbfr the hrt was set at 1 d initially which was prolonged to 2 d on day 112 following an incident broken membranes as all the upstream processes before mbfrs were aerobic e g partial nitritation and nitritation negligible biodegradable organic carbon or organic nitrogen was detected in the influent of mbfrs in addition a settler or a membrane separation system was in place between upstream reactors and mbfrs thus minimal suspended solids were observed in the wastewaters fed into the mbfrs 2 3 chemical analytical methods and microbial analysis liquid samples were taken from the overflow bottle using 3 ml syringe and being filtered through 0 22 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck the concentrations of the nitrogenous compounds no2 n nh4 n and no3 n were assayed using a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi for gas measurement 0 1 ml gas sample was taken through the rubber septum attached to the headspace of overflow bottle the methane concentration was then measured using a gas chromatograph agilent gc7890a with argon as the carrier gas biofilm samples were obtained via the sampling port on day 38 167 and 251 during three different phases for mbfr1 and on day 280 365 386 for mbfr2 the dna of samples were extracted using fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio medicals santa ana ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and analysis were carried out as described in the protocols reported in liu et al 2019 2 4 in situ batch tests batch tests were carried out at the end of every phase in mbfr1 to confirm the active bio reactions in the developed biofilm anammox and n damo reactions were being examined simultaneously by supplying the reactor with ammonium nitrite nitrate and methane before the batch tests the reactor feeding was stopped beforehand to ensure there was no residual nitrogen in the system methane supplied in the fiber lumen was also stopped and the system was completely sealed at the beginning of each test the initial concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were targeted at 60 mg n l by adding ammonium chloride sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate liquid samples 1 ml and gaseous samples 0 1 ml were taken at hour 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 8 10 and 12 to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species and methane by the linear regression of the concentration profile of each substrate the ammonium nitrite nitrate and methane consumption rates were determined based on the stoichiometry of reactions 1 3 the theoretical methane consumption rate can be calculated with the assumption that anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were the only contributors for nitrogen and methane removal by comparing the measured and predicted methane consumption rates this assumption could be verified to be true or false more details about the calculation are described in supplementary information si 3 results 3 1 mainstream mbfr1 mainstream mbfr1 was operated for 300 days with three scenarios representing different treatment routes fig 2a while the measured nitrogen profiles of influent and effluent were presented in fig 3 a the calculated nitrogen removal rate and removal efficiency were shown in fig 3b according to the stoichiometry of reactions 1 3 the species specific nitrogen conversion rate by each microbial population was calculated and illustrated in fig 3c meanwhile microbial community structure of each phase was revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 3d 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance by mbfr1 during scenario i the real wastewater from a nitritation reactor was fed into mbfr1 at hrt of 1 d which consisted of ammonium of 12 7 2 8 mg n l nitrite of 62 4 4 6 mg n l and nitrate of 7 8 4 7 mg n l fig 3a because of the dynamics in feeding the nitrite to ammonium ratio in influent varied in a broad range of 3 5 6 3 however the effluent of mbfr1 was stable with average ammonium concentration below 1 0 mg n l along with nearly no nitrite or nitrate accumulation 0 5 mg n l fig 3a indicating the robustness of mbfr1 with dynamic feeding of nitritation effluent correspondingly the ammonium and nitrite removal rates were averaged at around 12 0 mg n l d and 62 0 mg n l d respectively leading to a high level tn removal efficiency of 98 0 1 8 fig 3b in this phase n damo bacteria consumed nitrite at a rate of 56 4 4 6 mg n l d fig 3c being responsible for the majority of nitrite removed 80 in the reactor on the other hand the anammox reaction contributed to the other 20 of nitrite consumption fluctuating around 15 mg n l d during scenario i the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea was observed to be 10 0 3 6 mg n l d determined by the limited nitrate availability in influent and the cross feeding of nitrate produced by anammox reaction feeding for the mainstream mbfr1 was switched to partial nitritation effluent in scenario ii the nitrite loading rate was reduced to an average of 31 4 mg n l d while ammonium loading rate increased up to 19 7 mg n l d the feed nitrite to ammonium ratio during day 90 131 was fluctuating between 1 0 and 1 7 due to the unstable upstream pn process leading to a relatively high tn level of 9 3 2 5 mg n l in effluent fig 3a from day 131 onwards the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was well maintained between 1 6 1 9 improving the overall nitrogen removal with effluent ammonium significantly dropped to 5 4 1 3 mg n l p 0 01 all nitrites were removed during phase ii with no traces observed in the effluent which could then potentially limit the ammonium conversion in terms of microbial activities the nitrite removal rate by anammox activity increased to 17 2 2 8 mg n l d in scenario ii fig 3c due to the drop in nitrite loading rate the activity of n damo bacteria decreased to 22 9 4 2 mg n l d which accounted for 57 of the total nitrite removal the overall nitrogen removal efficiency was around 85 initially but gradually improved to above 90 on day 172 with effluent tn of 4 0 0 3 mg n l in scenario iii anammox effluent containing 4 6 0 8 mg n l of ammonium and 10 9 1 2 mg n l of nitrate was fed into mbfr1 fig 3a intriguingly there was no ammonium removed initially day 187 241 while up to 95 of nitrate removal was achieved instead the ammonium concentration in effluent was 5 8 1 6 mg n l which was higher than that in influent 5 0 0 8 mg n l there were two potential reasons for this unexpecting phenomenon on one hand the tn loading rate decreased dramatically from 83 0 6 5 mg n l d scenario i to only 16 2 1 9 mg n l d day 187 241 of scenario iii resulting in insufficient substrates for the microbial survival thus ammonium could be released from the cell lysis on the other hand the increased ammonium in effluent might be due to the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra similar phenomenon has been observed in a sequencing batch reactor with n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in which about 10 of nitrate was converted to ammonium under substrate limited condition ettwig et al 2016 in order to avoid the cell lysis or the dnra process the hrt was halved on day 242 to supply sufficient substrates for microbial growth following the increase in nitrogen loading rate the ammonium concentration in effluent decreased by more than 40 while the nitrate concentration in effluent remained to be below 3 0 mg n l fig 3a the elucidation of the improvement observed in nitrogen removal for mbfr1 would require further investigation nitrite was consumed completely in phase iii suggesting that it was still a limiting factor for complete ammonium removal similar to phase ii at the steady state of scenario iii day 261 300 the tn concentration in effluent was 5 1 0 4 mg n l 3 1 2 microbial community structure in mbfr1 microbial communities of mainstream mbfr1 at three different phases were analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 3d candidatus methanoperedens the genus identified under the family of methanoperedenaceae also known as n damo archaea haroon et al 2013 was found to account for 29 in both scenarios i and ii and 22 in scenario iii of the entire microbial community another dominant genus under the family of methylomirabilaceae in the biofilm candidatus methylomirabilis i e n damo bacteria ettwig et al 2010 was detected with relative abundance of 11 6 and 12 in the three scenarios respectively both n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were the primary driving force behind the nitrite and nitrate removal in mbfr1 anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia under the family of brocadiaceae were observed with low abundance in the microbial community around 1 in each of the three phases denitratisoma 4 7 belonging to the family of rhodocyclaceae was found in wwtps and indicated as a heterotrophic denitrifier depending on the organic carbon released by cell lysis xu et al 2017 notably the correlation between the microbial activity and microbial abundance could be weak ishii et al 2013 speth et al 2016 stewart et al 2012 other factors such as gene expression level could also affect the overall microbial activity 3 1 3 batch tests in order to further elucidate the active bioreactions within mbfr1 in situ batch tests were performed at the end of each scenario fig s1 in si with the substrate consumption rates tabulated below table 2 the ammonium consumption rates in scenario i ii and iii were 90 1 3 3 99 9 2 9 and 35 0 1 5 mg n l d respectively which was mainly attributed to the active anammox reaction meanwhile the nitrate removal rates were observed to be 60 6 4 3 52 0 0 7 and 23 1 1 0 mg n l d respectively indicating the active n damo archaea in the biofilms nitrite on the other hand was consumed at a rate of 113 2 3 6 135 8 2 4 and 31 4 1 6 mg n l d respectively in each of the three tests which accounted for the nitrite reduction by anammox bacteria reaction 1 and by n damo bacteria reaction 3 moreover both the nitrogen and methane consumption rates were observed to be significantly lower in scenario iii p 0 05 which could be due to the lower nitrogen loading rate in this period fig 3a the microbial reaction rates under unlimiting substrates condition were then calculated as described in si results showed that the anammox bacterial activity r an was higher than n damo archaeal activity r da and n damo bacterial activity r db in all three scenarios table 2 corresponding with the lower substrate consumption in scenario iii the microbial activities were also significantly lower than those in other two scenarios p 0 05 regarding the mass balance of mbfr1 the calculated methane consumption rates r ch4 calculated based on n damo activities were 57 6 3 4 57 4 0 5 and 16 9 1 2 mg ch4 l d in scenario i ii and iii respectively these values were close to the experimentally measured values 60 3 1 4 59 2 0 2 and 15 8 0 8 mg ch4 l d indicating that anammox and n damo microorganisms were the main contributors to the nitrogen and methane removal in mainstream mbfr1 table 2 comparing the results of batch tests and long term operation there are a few differences it should be firstly noted that the rates obtained in batch tests were maximal activities measured with unlimited substrates whereas the rates calculated in long term operation were under conditions with limited substrates thus the rates obtained in batch tests table 2 were higher than those in long term operation fig 3c additionally the rate of anammox bacteria was higher than n damo bacteria when feeding with unlimited nitrite table 2 which was not in accordance with the results obtained under conditions with limited nitrite fig 3c this disagreement could be due to the microbial stratification which will affect the microbial activities under substrate limited condition for example if n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria grow at the biofilm outer layer and inner layer respectively the limited nitrite would be consumed by n damo bacteria firstly before it penetrates into inner layer in this manner the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria would be higher than anammox bacteria under nitrite limited condition however the current microbial community analysis only showed the overall structure whereas the microbial stratification inside biofilm was unknown which needs further investigation 3 2 sidestream mbfr2 3 2 1 nitrogen removal performance by mbfr2 the sidestream mbfr2 was operated for 443 days fed with effluent from a partial nitritation reactor treating real anaerobic digestion liquor fig 2b before the experiment a preliminary test using real wastewater was performed in the sidestream mbfr2 to see whether there was any significant inhibition on the microbial activities fig s2 in si during this period the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were constantly below 5 0 and 25 0 mg n l corresponding to a high activity of n damo bacteria 67 9 24 2 mg n l d and n damo archaea 84 1 13 7 mg n l d the success in preliminary test indicated that mbfr2 was robust in treating real wastewater unfortunately there was an accident that three bundles of membranes were broken at the end of the preliminary test which were then completely sealed off to avoid gas leaking in this manner both the methane supply and active biofilms in mbfr2 were reduced by 25 three of twelve membranes were not working because of this accident the nitrate started to accumulate in the effluent 64 6 18 2 mg n l at the beginning of experiment day 0 111 fig 4 a indicating the activity of n damo archaea was sensitive to the reduction of methane supply in contrast the ammonium in effluent decreased dramatically from 104 8 29 2 mg n l in preliminary test to only 16 4 7 2 mg n l because of the increased influent nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 2 1 4 correspondingly the tn removal efficiency was determined to be 91 4 2 1 during this period fig 4b in an attempt to avoid the potential inhibition and to recover the microbial activities smoothly the hrt of mbfr2 was doubled from day 112 following this change the nitrate in effluent dropped to around 45 0 mg n l immediately which was then gradually reduced to below 20 0 mg n l at the steady state day 348 443 fig 4a during this period the nitrite to ammonium ratio in the feed ranged from 1 2 to 1 4 resulting in consistently low effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations of 6 1 3 1 mg n l and 9 6 2 4 mg n l respectively correspondingly the tn removal efficiency increased to 96 0 1 0 at the steady state fig 4b because of the doubled hrt the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria nearly halved 270 3 14 3 mg n l d fig 4c as observed in the decreased effluent nitrate concentration the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea was significantly enhanced p 0 01 from 34 7 8 5 mg n l d day 112 347 to 51 8 10 3 mg n l d day 348 443 this indicated the growth of n damo microorganisms especially n damo archaea since the disruption of broken membranes facilitating higher nitrate removal in the system 3 2 2 microbial community structure in mbfr2 similarly fig 4d presented the microbial community of mbfr2 through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the family level the dominant families in all three samples were methanoperedenaceae 20 3 brocadiaceae 12 3 methylomirabilaceae 5 4 and phycisphaeraceae 8 2 candidatus methanoperedens n damo archaea was observed as the most dominant genus with relative abundance of 23 18 and 19 for day 280 day 366 and day 385 respectively anammox bacteria under the family of brocadiaceae accounted for 13 of the overall microbial population in the sample taken on day 366 whereas its relative abundance was slightly lower in day 280 8 and day 385 9 on the other hand the presence of candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria fluctuated across the three samples obtained with relative abundance of 1 day 280 8 day 366 and 5 day 385 the relatively sparse population of n damo bacteria could be corroborated by the high nitrite removal by anammox bacteria fig 4c the functions of other microorganisms need more in depth investigation 4 discussion 4 1 real wastewater demonstration of n damo processes in the past two decades the discovery of nitrite nitrate reduction coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation has been widely studied haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 the two n damo groups namely nitrite damo bacteria and nitrate damo archaea are responsible for methane and nitrogen removal under anaerobic condition these new microbial processes provide a potential paradigm shift for the conventional n dn as no external carbon addition is needed with available biogas onsite and methane as electron donor and limited aeration required van kessel et al 2018 biogas generated in anaerobic digestion was reported to be practically feasible and sufficient for n damo technologies along with methane utilization efficiency in mbfr of more than 95 cai et al 2018 liu et al 2020d the unique inter dependence of n damo and anammox microorganisms makes this coculture a suitable candidate to achieve high level nitrogen removal compared with the previous investigations this present study is a milestone as the first real wastewater demonstration for n damo processes for the mainstream mbfr1 the total nitrogen removed via anammox n damo mechanisms in scenario i and ii was 81 2 5 8 mg n l d and 49 5 6 8 mg n l d respectively these values are comparable to the typical values achieved in partial nitritation with anammox pn a process using real wastewater laureni et al 2016 malovanyy et al 2015 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 notably superior effluent quality 5 mg tn l was achieved compared to anammox based processes table 3 which is mainly due to the ability of n damo archaea reaction 2 to remove nitrate produced by anammox bacteria reaction 1 in particular candidatus methanoperedens was responsible for the nitrate reduction fig 3a and 3c including nitrate residuals in the feed from upstream nitritation or partial nitritation and the nitrate produced by anammox bacteria it is also worth noting that low nitrite concentration in the feed would have limited the ammonium oxidation via anammox thus leftover ammonium was observed in the effluent during phases ii and iii fig 3a despite of that both the effluent qualities and nitrogen removal rates of the present study in treating real wastewater are comparable to previous n damo studies using synthetic wastewater liu et al 2020b xie et al 2018 feeding with partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor scenario iv the sidestream mbfr2 achieved a tn removal rate of 0 46 kg n m3 d higher nitrogen removal rates are reported in the widely implemented sidestream deammonification table 4 between 0 3 3 3 kg n m3 d in one stage or two stage pn a process joss et al 2009 lackner et al 2014 rezania et al 2015 however significant nitrogen including the theoretical 11 of nitrogen converted to nitrate was generally observed in anammox effluents lackner et al 2014 strous et al 1998 zhao et al 2014 hypothetically complete nitrogen removal could be achieved in high strength wastewater using anammox with n damo coculture which has been proven by using synthetic wastewater xie et al 2017 comparable nitrogen removal efficiency 96 0 1 0 was achieved in the current study mbfr2 in which the relatively lower rates could be attributed to the incidental broken membrane overall the low effluent tn observed in n damo systems provided an edge over the anammox only sidestream treatment as demonstrated in the long term operation and short term tests anammox bacteria n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were jointly responsible for the nitrogen removal in the systems the presence of both n damo microorganisms and anammox bacteria were validated by the microbial community analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing during the 300 days and 443 days of operation in mbfr1 and mbfr2 respectively the microbial communities maintained relatively stable with functional microorganisms dominating the biofilms consistently even with dramatic change in feeding compositions fig 3d and fig 4d the stability of these microbial structures are beneficial for their practical applications in treating real wastewater 4 2 versatility of methane based mbfr coupling anammox with n damo processes the proposed mbfr combining anammox and n damo processes is robust against dynamic influent flowrates and nitrogen compositions due to the overcapacity developed and the cooperation among different microbial groups liu et al 2020a the findings in this study reciprocated the observation by demonstrating both low strength mainstream and high strength sidestream wastewater applications fig 2 in addition to varying nitrogen loadings four different treatment routes were proposed using mbfrs to treat wastewater from the mainstream partial nitritation nitritation anammox and the sidestream partial nitritation the comprehensive investigation of the present study provided a more in depth insight into n damo applications in wwtps especially its versatility in treating different wastewater streams stability of partial nitritation or nitritation process remains a challenge in mainstream wastewater which led to complexity in downstream treatments such as anammox process pérez et al 2014 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob catalyze unwanted nitrate conversion and their suppression was attempted by various strategies such as intermittent aeration or sludge treatment ma et al 2015 malovanyy et al 2015 wang et al 2018 on the other hand fluctuating ammonium oxidation could also happen due to operational controls such as aerations which might not match the accidental or shock loading in the diurnal feed because of these problems the real wastewater is usually with dynamic nitrogen compositions such as varying nitrite to ammonium ratio which is a serious barrier for anammox process requiring a stringent nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 32 strous et al 1998 the cooperative nature of n damo and anammox processes in this study would provide the much needed versatility and tolerance to variable feed composition for example the mainstream mbfr1 showed stable nitrogen removal performance when treating three different types of wastewater evidenced by the consistently low tn concentration of below 5 mg n l in the effluent fig 3a despite the seemingly less significant contribution of n damo process in scenario iii of mbfr1 fig 3c the methane based mbfr proposes an alternative to use methane biogas to polish the anammox effluent in order to meet the discharge limit this would be especially useful for localities with strict nitrogen discharge limit for example in certain places in australia the tn concentration in discharging wastewater is required to be 5 mg n l where additional tertiary polishing stage with methanol acetate addition is necessary to remove any residual nitrogen in anammox effluent 5 conclusions in this study two methane based mbfrs with integrated anammox n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were employed to remove nitrogen from different wastewater streams under four scenarios being the first demonstration of n damo process on real wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes include by combining anammox and n damo process a practically useful nitrogen removal rate was achieved in the sidestream mbfr 0 46 kg n m3 d for anaerobic digestion liquor and good effluent quality was observed in the mainstream mbfr 5 mg tn l or less for domestic sewage the mbfr coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms is versatile evidenced by the examination on four different types of wastewater 1 mainstream nitritation effluent 2 mainstream partial nitritation effluent 3 mainstream anammox effluent and 4 sidestream partial nitritation effluent this versatility supports the adoption of this new technology by industries for different treatment routes the analysis of microbial community and the calculation of mass balance demonstrated that anammox and n damo microorganisms jointly contributed to the

17142,nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo processes have been proven effective for nitrogen removal from synthetic wastewater however the demonstration using real wastewater has not been achieved yet to this end this study investigated the versatile applications of n damo process in real wastewater treatment for the first time two methane based membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs were employed to combine anammox and n damo microorganisms targeting nitrogen removal in mainstream i e domestic sewage and sidestream i e anaerobic digestion liquor respectively considering various technologies in sewage treatment three different technical routes including nitritation methane based mbfr partial nitritation methane based mbfr and partial nitritation anammox methane based mbfr were investigated comprehensively all producing effluent quality with total nitrogen tn at 5 mg n l or less regarding the sidestream treatment the methane based mbfr also removed up to 96 tn from the partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor at a practically useful rate of 0 5 kg n m3 d microbial communities revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing indicated the dominance of n damo archaea in both reactors along with the existence of anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria as the first demonstration of n damo process in real wastewater this study comprehensively confirmed the applicability of using methane as carbon source to remove nitrogen from both mainstream and sidestream wastewater supporting their adoption by industries in practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox anaerobic methane oxidation n damo membrane biofilm reactor domestic sewage anaerobic digestion liquor 1 introduction conventional biological nitrogen removal processes which are widely established in wastewater treatment plants wwtps have the downsides of their owns nitrogen removal from wastewater is generally achieved using aerobic conversion of ammonium to nitrate via nitrification and anaerobic conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas via denitrification guo et al 2013 however this conventional nitrification denitrification n dn route requires high costs for aeration and chemical consumption which is expected to be upgraded using novel microbial processes over the years extensive studies have been performed on anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox an autotrophic nitrogen removal pathway with the advantages of lower organic carbon consumption less aeration demand up to 60 savings compared to n dn and sludge production kartal et al 2010 being coupled with partial nitritation pn anammox based processes have been widely established as an alternative to conventional n dn especially in treating high strength wastewater like anaerobic sludge digestion liquor lackner et al 2014 however every mole of ammonium oxidized would produce 0 26 mole of nitrate thus capping the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency at 89 based on the stoichiometry of the anammox process reaction 1 strous et al 1999 this poses several challenges including relatively poor effluent quality with nitrate accumulation and the stringent requirement for influent nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 32 1 de clippeleir et al 2013 lackner et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 1 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o the recent discovery of nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo process enabled nitrite and nitrate removal by utilizing electrons obtained from methane oxidation ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 two distinct microbial groups have been identified with the role in nitrate damo mediated by n damo archaea haroon et al 2013 and nitrite damo driven by n damo bacteria ettwig et al 2010 being coupled with anammox bacteria n damo archaea have the ability to reduce the nitrate produced by anammox reaction reaction 2 while n damo bacteria are able to consume the excess nitrite in the feed reaction 3 with these unique advantages of cross feeding and substrate competition anammox and n damo microorganisms could co exist and be enriched by providing substrates such as ammonium with nitrite or ammonium with nitrate luesken et al 2011 shi et al 2013 2 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o 3 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o previous studies have demonstrated n damo process in different reactor configurations including sequencing batch reactors sbr ding et al 2014 fu et al 2017 hu et al 2015 luesken et al 2011 and membrane bioreactor mbr with suspended sludge allegue et al 2018 kampman et al 2014 stultiens et al 2019 as well as methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr cai et al 2015 ding et al 2017 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020c shi et al 2013 xie et al 2018 among all methane based mbfrs are advantageous with the attachment of slow growing anammox and n damo microorganisms on the hollow fiber membrane surface enabling better biomass retention bubble less delivery of gas from hollow fibres on the other hand improves the mass transfer efficiency of the methane based application modin et al 2007 shi et al 2013 nonetheless synthetic wastewater with constant feeding was always used in these previous studies while the treatment of real wastewater with dynamics has not been reported yet in addition to the dynamics the complex matrix of real wastewater even after receiving a secondary treatment such as metals and remaining organic matter could also negatively impact the microbial activity for example reino et al 2018 reported a significant adverse impact on anammox activity when the feed was switched from synthetic to real wastewater attributing to several possible factors such as microbial population shift or inhibitory compounds in real wastewater similarly laureni et al 2015 also observed two to three folds increase in doubling time of anammox bacteria moving from synthetic media to municipal wastewater along with a decreased microbial activity thus prior to the upscaling of this methane based mbfr coupling anammox with n damo microorganisms it is of great significance to examine whether it is robust when treating real wastewater on the other hand due to the close collaboration among different microbial populations it was hypothesized that the combined anammox with n damo process is versatile which can be used to treat wastewater with different nitrogen compositions yet each of the previous mbfr studies only focused on one specific wastewater stream and there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation about the scope of n damo process in wwtps therefore the aim of this present study is to investigate the viability and versatility of this unique microbial coculture in treating real mainstream and sidestream wastewater two particular questions will be addressed 1 if this new technology coupling anammox and n damo process is robust when treating real wastewater and 2 can this methane based mbfr be applied in various treatment routes to this end two laboratory methane based mbfrs were assigned for mainstream i e domestic sewage and sidestream i e anaerobic digestion liquor examination respectively considering various treatment processes in domestic sewage the nitrogen removal from three different types of wastewater were tested including the effluent from nitritation partial nitritation and anammox process meanwhile the treatment route including partial nitritation and methane based mbfr was also assessed under sidestream condition microbial analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to identify the functional microbial communities in both reactors as the first demonstration of n damo process in real wastewater our results provide a comprehensive picture of its applicability in wwtps further supporting the concept of using methane as the carbon source to remove nitrogen from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors configuration and setup the mainstream reactor mbfr1 has a volume of 1150 ml consisting of 900 poly acrylonitrile hollow fibers aip 2013 pall japan with each fiber having 55 2 cm in length and an inner diameter of 0 8 mm the volume for the membrane fibers is 700 ml in total giving a working volume of 450 ml for the reactor with 1 m2 total surface area the biofilm reactor has a specific surface area membrane surface area reactor volume of 869 m2 m3 the sidestream reactor mbfr2 has a total volume of 2356 ml with 12 bundles of membrane modules for methane delivery the membrane bundle has 500 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan each with a length of 30 cm and an inner diameter of 0 09 mm all taking up a total volume of 56 ml 45 ml for fiber materials and 11 ml for interior fiber lumen for gas delivery this gives rise to an overall working volume of 2300 ml for the reactor with 1 13 m2 total membrane surface area the specific surface area of mbfr2 was observed to be 480 m2 m3 mbfr1 and mbfr2 shared similar experimental set up fig 1 briefly the bulk liquid in both mbfrs was recirculated from the top to the bottom via a peristaltic pump masterflex l s us the deoxygenated feeding stored in a 5 l drum was fed into the reactor by another peristaltic pump bt300 2j longer pump china an overflow bottle 330 ml was set up for liquid and gas sampling as well as monitoring the ph via probe implemented oakton australia gas bags filled with nitrogen gas and water seal bottles were used to ensure the systems were strictly anaerobic the membrane modules of both reactors were connected to a methane gas cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 allowing methane gas to permeate through the membrane lumens with a high driving force and without bubble formation gas pressure inside the membrane lumens was set at 160 kpa and 120 kpa for mbfr1 and mbfr2 respectively regulated and monitored with pressure gauges ross brown australia 2 2 operational strategies and conditions high rate activated sludge hras effluent with tn of 56 7 mg n l mainstream and partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor with tn of 986 81 mg n l sidestream were both collected from the luggage point sewage treatment plant queensland australia the feed compositions entering the mbfrs under different treatment routes are highlighted in table 1 in total four different applications of methane based mbfr were investigated including three scenarios for domestic sewage in mbfr1 fig 2 a and one for sidestream wastewater in mbfr2 fig 2b mbfr1 and mbfr2 were operated at 22 c and 35 c respectively all hydraulic retention time hrt mentioned below are calculated based on the working volumes of the reactors in scenario i the nitrogen removal by a two stage process consisting of nitritation followed by the methane based mbfr was demonstrated in the first stage the majority of ammonium was converted into nitrite 85 the produced nitrite together with the residual ammonium ph between 5 and 5 5 were then removed in the methane based mbfr as the second stage in scenario ii the nitritation unit was replaced by a partial nitritation system which converted about 50 ammonium to nitrite the feasibility to remove nitrogen from pn effluent ph between 5 and 5 5 using methane based mbfr was then investigated the hrt was maintained to be 1 d for scenarios i and ii in scenario iii we investigated whether n damo process can be used to polish the mainstream anammox effluent which is more relevant for a wwtp already possessing anammox reactors the effluent of anammox process ph between 7 and 7 5 usually contains residual nitrate and ammonium table 1 notably the hrt was shortened to 12 h on day 242 in scenario iv the nitrogen removal in anaerobic digestion liquor was studied in mbfr2 via a two stage configuration consisting of partial nitritation which then fed into ph between 7 and 7 5 methane based mbfr the hrt was set at 1 d initially which was prolonged to 2 d on day 112 following an incident broken membranes as all the upstream processes before mbfrs were aerobic e g partial nitritation and nitritation negligible biodegradable organic carbon or organic nitrogen was detected in the influent of mbfrs in addition a settler or a membrane separation system was in place between upstream reactors and mbfrs thus minimal suspended solids were observed in the wastewaters fed into the mbfrs 2 3 chemical analytical methods and microbial analysis liquid samples were taken from the overflow bottle using 3 ml syringe and being filtered through 0 22 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck the concentrations of the nitrogenous compounds no2 n nh4 n and no3 n were assayed using a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi for gas measurement 0 1 ml gas sample was taken through the rubber septum attached to the headspace of overflow bottle the methane concentration was then measured using a gas chromatograph agilent gc7890a with argon as the carrier gas biofilm samples were obtained via the sampling port on day 38 167 and 251 during three different phases for mbfr1 and on day 280 365 386 for mbfr2 the dna of samples were extracted using fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio medicals santa ana ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and analysis were carried out as described in the protocols reported in liu et al 2019 2 4 in situ batch tests batch tests were carried out at the end of every phase in mbfr1 to confirm the active bio reactions in the developed biofilm anammox and n damo reactions were being examined simultaneously by supplying the reactor with ammonium nitrite nitrate and methane before the batch tests the reactor feeding was stopped beforehand to ensure there was no residual nitrogen in the system methane supplied in the fiber lumen was also stopped and the system was completely sealed at the beginning of each test the initial concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were targeted at 60 mg n l by adding ammonium chloride sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate liquid samples 1 ml and gaseous samples 0 1 ml were taken at hour 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 8 10 and 12 to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species and methane by the linear regression of the concentration profile of each substrate the ammonium nitrite nitrate and methane consumption rates were determined based on the stoichiometry of reactions 1 3 the theoretical methane consumption rate can be calculated with the assumption that anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were the only contributors for nitrogen and methane removal by comparing the measured and predicted methane consumption rates this assumption could be verified to be true or false more details about the calculation are described in supplementary information si 3 results 3 1 mainstream mbfr1 mainstream mbfr1 was operated for 300 days with three scenarios representing different treatment routes fig 2a while the measured nitrogen profiles of influent and effluent were presented in fig 3 a the calculated nitrogen removal rate and removal efficiency were shown in fig 3b according to the stoichiometry of reactions 1 3 the species specific nitrogen conversion rate by each microbial population was calculated and illustrated in fig 3c meanwhile microbial community structure of each phase was revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 3d 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance by mbfr1 during scenario i the real wastewater from a nitritation reactor was fed into mbfr1 at hrt of 1 d which consisted of ammonium of 12 7 2 8 mg n l nitrite of 62 4 4 6 mg n l and nitrate of 7 8 4 7 mg n l fig 3a because of the dynamics in feeding the nitrite to ammonium ratio in influent varied in a broad range of 3 5 6 3 however the effluent of mbfr1 was stable with average ammonium concentration below 1 0 mg n l along with nearly no nitrite or nitrate accumulation 0 5 mg n l fig 3a indicating the robustness of mbfr1 with dynamic feeding of nitritation effluent correspondingly the ammonium and nitrite removal rates were averaged at around 12 0 mg n l d and 62 0 mg n l d respectively leading to a high level tn removal efficiency of 98 0 1 8 fig 3b in this phase n damo bacteria consumed nitrite at a rate of 56 4 4 6 mg n l d fig 3c being responsible for the majority of nitrite removed 80 in the reactor on the other hand the anammox reaction contributed to the other 20 of nitrite consumption fluctuating around 15 mg n l d during scenario i the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea was observed to be 10 0 3 6 mg n l d determined by the limited nitrate availability in influent and the cross feeding of nitrate produced by anammox reaction feeding for the mainstream mbfr1 was switched to partial nitritation effluent in scenario ii the nitrite loading rate was reduced to an average of 31 4 mg n l d while ammonium loading rate increased up to 19 7 mg n l d the feed nitrite to ammonium ratio during day 90 131 was fluctuating between 1 0 and 1 7 due to the unstable upstream pn process leading to a relatively high tn level of 9 3 2 5 mg n l in effluent fig 3a from day 131 onwards the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was well maintained between 1 6 1 9 improving the overall nitrogen removal with effluent ammonium significantly dropped to 5 4 1 3 mg n l p 0 01 all nitrites were removed during phase ii with no traces observed in the effluent which could then potentially limit the ammonium conversion in terms of microbial activities the nitrite removal rate by anammox activity increased to 17 2 2 8 mg n l d in scenario ii fig 3c due to the drop in nitrite loading rate the activity of n damo bacteria decreased to 22 9 4 2 mg n l d which accounted for 57 of the total nitrite removal the overall nitrogen removal efficiency was around 85 initially but gradually improved to above 90 on day 172 with effluent tn of 4 0 0 3 mg n l in scenario iii anammox effluent containing 4 6 0 8 mg n l of ammonium and 10 9 1 2 mg n l of nitrate was fed into mbfr1 fig 3a intriguingly there was no ammonium removed initially day 187 241 while up to 95 of nitrate removal was achieved instead the ammonium concentration in effluent was 5 8 1 6 mg n l which was higher than that in influent 5 0 0 8 mg n l there were two potential reasons for this unexpecting phenomenon on one hand the tn loading rate decreased dramatically from 83 0 6 5 mg n l d scenario i to only 16 2 1 9 mg n l d day 187 241 of scenario iii resulting in insufficient substrates for the microbial survival thus ammonium could be released from the cell lysis on the other hand the increased ammonium in effluent might be due to the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra similar phenomenon has been observed in a sequencing batch reactor with n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in which about 10 of nitrate was converted to ammonium under substrate limited condition ettwig et al 2016 in order to avoid the cell lysis or the dnra process the hrt was halved on day 242 to supply sufficient substrates for microbial growth following the increase in nitrogen loading rate the ammonium concentration in effluent decreased by more than 40 while the nitrate concentration in effluent remained to be below 3 0 mg n l fig 3a the elucidation of the improvement observed in nitrogen removal for mbfr1 would require further investigation nitrite was consumed completely in phase iii suggesting that it was still a limiting factor for complete ammonium removal similar to phase ii at the steady state of scenario iii day 261 300 the tn concentration in effluent was 5 1 0 4 mg n l 3 1 2 microbial community structure in mbfr1 microbial communities of mainstream mbfr1 at three different phases were analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 3d candidatus methanoperedens the genus identified under the family of methanoperedenaceae also known as n damo archaea haroon et al 2013 was found to account for 29 in both scenarios i and ii and 22 in scenario iii of the entire microbial community another dominant genus under the family of methylomirabilaceae in the biofilm candidatus methylomirabilis i e n damo bacteria ettwig et al 2010 was detected with relative abundance of 11 6 and 12 in the three scenarios respectively both n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were the primary driving force behind the nitrite and nitrate removal in mbfr1 anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia under the family of brocadiaceae were observed with low abundance in the microbial community around 1 in each of the three phases denitratisoma 4 7 belonging to the family of rhodocyclaceae was found in wwtps and indicated as a heterotrophic denitrifier depending on the organic carbon released by cell lysis xu et al 2017 notably the correlation between the microbial activity and microbial abundance could be weak ishii et al 2013 speth et al 2016 stewart et al 2012 other factors such as gene expression level could also affect the overall microbial activity 3 1 3 batch tests in order to further elucidate the active bioreactions within mbfr1 in situ batch tests were performed at the end of each scenario fig s1 in si with the substrate consumption rates tabulated below table 2 the ammonium consumption rates in scenario i ii and iii were 90 1 3 3 99 9 2 9 and 35 0 1 5 mg n l d respectively which was mainly attributed to the active anammox reaction meanwhile the nitrate removal rates were observed to be 60 6 4 3 52 0 0 7 and 23 1 1 0 mg n l d respectively indicating the active n damo archaea in the biofilms nitrite on the other hand was consumed at a rate of 113 2 3 6 135 8 2 4 and 31 4 1 6 mg n l d respectively in each of the three tests which accounted for the nitrite reduction by anammox bacteria reaction 1 and by n damo bacteria reaction 3 moreover both the nitrogen and methane consumption rates were observed to be significantly lower in scenario iii p 0 05 which could be due to the lower nitrogen loading rate in this period fig 3a the microbial reaction rates under unlimiting substrates condition were then calculated as described in si results showed that the anammox bacterial activity r an was higher than n damo archaeal activity r da and n damo bacterial activity r db in all three scenarios table 2 corresponding with the lower substrate consumption in scenario iii the microbial activities were also significantly lower than those in other two scenarios p 0 05 regarding the mass balance of mbfr1 the calculated methane consumption rates r ch4 calculated based on n damo activities were 57 6 3 4 57 4 0 5 and 16 9 1 2 mg ch4 l d in scenario i ii and iii respectively these values were close to the experimentally measured values 60 3 1 4 59 2 0 2 and 15 8 0 8 mg ch4 l d indicating that anammox and n damo microorganisms were the main contributors to the nitrogen and methane removal in mainstream mbfr1 table 2 comparing the results of batch tests and long term operation there are a few differences it should be firstly noted that the rates obtained in batch tests were maximal activities measured with unlimited substrates whereas the rates calculated in long term operation were under conditions with limited substrates thus the rates obtained in batch tests table 2 were higher than those in long term operation fig 3c additionally the rate of anammox bacteria was higher than n damo bacteria when feeding with unlimited nitrite table 2 which was not in accordance with the results obtained under conditions with limited nitrite fig 3c this disagreement could be due to the microbial stratification which will affect the microbial activities under substrate limited condition for example if n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria grow at the biofilm outer layer and inner layer respectively the limited nitrite would be consumed by n damo bacteria firstly before it penetrates into inner layer in this manner the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria would be higher than anammox bacteria under nitrite limited condition however the current microbial community analysis only showed the overall structure whereas the microbial stratification inside biofilm was unknown which needs further investigation 3 2 sidestream mbfr2 3 2 1 nitrogen removal performance by mbfr2 the sidestream mbfr2 was operated for 443 days fed with effluent from a partial nitritation reactor treating real anaerobic digestion liquor fig 2b before the experiment a preliminary test using real wastewater was performed in the sidestream mbfr2 to see whether there was any significant inhibition on the microbial activities fig s2 in si during this period the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were constantly below 5 0 and 25 0 mg n l corresponding to a high activity of n damo bacteria 67 9 24 2 mg n l d and n damo archaea 84 1 13 7 mg n l d the success in preliminary test indicated that mbfr2 was robust in treating real wastewater unfortunately there was an accident that three bundles of membranes were broken at the end of the preliminary test which were then completely sealed off to avoid gas leaking in this manner both the methane supply and active biofilms in mbfr2 were reduced by 25 three of twelve membranes were not working because of this accident the nitrate started to accumulate in the effluent 64 6 18 2 mg n l at the beginning of experiment day 0 111 fig 4 a indicating the activity of n damo archaea was sensitive to the reduction of methane supply in contrast the ammonium in effluent decreased dramatically from 104 8 29 2 mg n l in preliminary test to only 16 4 7 2 mg n l because of the increased influent nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 2 1 4 correspondingly the tn removal efficiency was determined to be 91 4 2 1 during this period fig 4b in an attempt to avoid the potential inhibition and to recover the microbial activities smoothly the hrt of mbfr2 was doubled from day 112 following this change the nitrate in effluent dropped to around 45 0 mg n l immediately which was then gradually reduced to below 20 0 mg n l at the steady state day 348 443 fig 4a during this period the nitrite to ammonium ratio in the feed ranged from 1 2 to 1 4 resulting in consistently low effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations of 6 1 3 1 mg n l and 9 6 2 4 mg n l respectively correspondingly the tn removal efficiency increased to 96 0 1 0 at the steady state fig 4b because of the doubled hrt the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria nearly halved 270 3 14 3 mg n l d fig 4c as observed in the decreased effluent nitrate concentration the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea was significantly enhanced p 0 01 from 34 7 8 5 mg n l d day 112 347 to 51 8 10 3 mg n l d day 348 443 this indicated the growth of n damo microorganisms especially n damo archaea since the disruption of broken membranes facilitating higher nitrate removal in the system 3 2 2 microbial community structure in mbfr2 similarly fig 4d presented the microbial community of mbfr2 through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the family level the dominant families in all three samples were methanoperedenaceae 20 3 brocadiaceae 12 3 methylomirabilaceae 5 4 and phycisphaeraceae 8 2 candidatus methanoperedens n damo archaea was observed as the most dominant genus with relative abundance of 23 18 and 19 for day 280 day 366 and day 385 respectively anammox bacteria under the family of brocadiaceae accounted for 13 of the overall microbial population in the sample taken on day 366 whereas its relative abundance was slightly lower in day 280 8 and day 385 9 on the other hand the presence of candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria fluctuated across the three samples obtained with relative abundance of 1 day 280 8 day 366 and 5 day 385 the relatively sparse population of n damo bacteria could be corroborated by the high nitrite removal by anammox bacteria fig 4c the functions of other microorganisms need more in depth investigation 4 discussion 4 1 real wastewater demonstration of n damo processes in the past two decades the discovery of nitrite nitrate reduction coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation has been widely studied haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 the two n damo groups namely nitrite damo bacteria and nitrate damo archaea are responsible for methane and nitrogen removal under anaerobic condition these new microbial processes provide a potential paradigm shift for the conventional n dn as no external carbon addition is needed with available biogas onsite and methane as electron donor and limited aeration required van kessel et al 2018 biogas generated in anaerobic digestion was reported to be practically feasible and sufficient for n damo technologies along with methane utilization efficiency in mbfr of more than 95 cai et al 2018 liu et al 2020d the unique inter dependence of n damo and anammox microorganisms makes this coculture a suitable candidate to achieve high level nitrogen removal compared with the previous investigations this present study is a milestone as the first real wastewater demonstration for n damo processes for the mainstream mbfr1 the total nitrogen removed via anammox n damo mechanisms in scenario i and ii was 81 2 5 8 mg n l d and 49 5 6 8 mg n l d respectively these values are comparable to the typical values achieved in partial nitritation with anammox pn a process using real wastewater laureni et al 2016 malovanyy et al 2015 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 notably superior effluent quality 5 mg tn l was achieved compared to anammox based processes table 3 which is mainly due to the ability of n damo archaea reaction 2 to remove nitrate produced by anammox bacteria reaction 1 in particular candidatus methanoperedens was responsible for the nitrate reduction fig 3a and 3c including nitrate residuals in the feed from upstream nitritation or partial nitritation and the nitrate produced by anammox bacteria it is also worth noting that low nitrite concentration in the feed would have limited the ammonium oxidation via anammox thus leftover ammonium was observed in the effluent during phases ii and iii fig 3a despite of that both the effluent qualities and nitrogen removal rates of the present study in treating real wastewater are comparable to previous n damo studies using synthetic wastewater liu et al 2020b xie et al 2018 feeding with partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor scenario iv the sidestream mbfr2 achieved a tn removal rate of 0 46 kg n m3 d higher nitrogen removal rates are reported in the widely implemented sidestream deammonification table 4 between 0 3 3 3 kg n m3 d in one stage or two stage pn a process joss et al 2009 lackner et al 2014 rezania et al 2015 however significant nitrogen including the theoretical 11 of nitrogen converted to nitrate was generally observed in anammox effluents lackner et al 2014 strous et al 1998 zhao et al 2014 hypothetically complete nitrogen removal could be achieved in high strength wastewater using anammox with n damo coculture which has been proven by using synthetic wastewater xie et al 2017 comparable nitrogen removal efficiency 96 0 1 0 was achieved in the current study mbfr2 in which the relatively lower rates could be attributed to the incidental broken membrane overall the low effluent tn observed in n damo systems provided an edge over the anammox only sidestream treatment as demonstrated in the long term operation and short term tests anammox bacteria n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were jointly responsible for the nitrogen removal in the systems the presence of both n damo microorganisms and anammox bacteria were validated by the microbial community analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing during the 300 days and 443 days of operation in mbfr1 and mbfr2 respectively the microbial communities maintained relatively stable with functional microorganisms dominating the biofilms consistently even with dramatic change in feeding compositions fig 3d and fig 4d the stability of these microbial structures are beneficial for their practical applications in treating real wastewater 4 2 versatility of methane based mbfr coupling anammox with n damo processes the proposed mbfr combining anammox and n damo processes is robust against dynamic influent flowrates and nitrogen compositions due to the overcapacity developed and the cooperation among different microbial groups liu et al 2020a the findings in this study reciprocated the observation by demonstrating both low strength mainstream and high strength sidestream wastewater applications fig 2 in addition to varying nitrogen loadings four different treatment routes were proposed using mbfrs to treat wastewater from the mainstream partial nitritation nitritation anammox and the sidestream partial nitritation the comprehensive investigation of the present study provided a more in depth insight into n damo applications in wwtps especially its versatility in treating different wastewater streams stability of partial nitritation or nitritation process remains a challenge in mainstream wastewater which led to complexity in downstream treatments such as anammox process pérez et al 2014 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob catalyze unwanted nitrate conversion and their suppression was attempted by various strategies such as intermittent aeration or sludge treatment ma et al 2015 malovanyy et al 2015 wang et al 2018 on the other hand fluctuating ammonium oxidation could also happen due to operational controls such as aerations which might not match the accidental or shock loading in the diurnal feed because of these problems the real wastewater is usually with dynamic nitrogen compositions such as varying nitrite to ammonium ratio which is a serious barrier for anammox process requiring a stringent nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 32 strous et al 1998 the cooperative nature of n damo and anammox processes in this study would provide the much needed versatility and tolerance to variable feed composition for example the mainstream mbfr1 showed stable nitrogen removal performance when treating three different types of wastewater evidenced by the consistently low tn concentration of below 5 mg n l in the effluent fig 3a despite the seemingly less significant contribution of n damo process in scenario iii of mbfr1 fig 3c the methane based mbfr proposes an alternative to use methane biogas to polish the anammox effluent in order to meet the discharge limit this would be especially useful for localities with strict nitrogen discharge limit for example in certain places in australia the tn concentration in discharging wastewater is required to be 5 mg n l where additional tertiary polishing stage with methanol acetate addition is necessary to remove any residual nitrogen in anammox effluent 5 conclusions in this study two methane based mbfrs with integrated anammox n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were employed to remove nitrogen from different wastewater streams under four scenarios being the first demonstration of n damo process on real wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes include by combining anammox and n damo process a practically useful nitrogen removal rate was achieved in the sidestream mbfr 0 46 kg n m3 d for anaerobic digestion liquor and good effluent quality was observed in the mainstream mbfr 5 mg tn l or less for domestic sewage the mbfr coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms is versatile evidenced by the examination on four different types of wastewater 1 mainstream nitritation effluent 2 mainstream partial nitritation effluent 3 mainstream anammox effluent and 4 sidestream partial nitritation effluent this versatility supports the adoption of this new technology by industries for different treatment routes the analysis of microbial community and the calculation of mass balance demonstrated that anammox and n damo microorganisms jointly contributed to the

van der kooij and veenendaal 2001 tsvetanova and hoekstra 2009 learbuch et al 2019 besides determining the bpp of materials research has also focused on the microbial diversity in water and biofilms of pipe materials that are in contact with water this microbial diversity was investigated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis yu et al 2010 jang et al 2011 or direct sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene fragments amplified by pcr aggarwal et al 2018 buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 ginige et al 2017 the studies that used dgge showed that the microbial diversity differed between materials with the highest microbial diversity on stainless steel and the lowest diversity on copper yu et al 2010 jang et al 2011 in addition buse et al 2014 observed significant differences in the bacterial and eukaryotic community members between pvc u and copper copper biofilms displayed lower eukaryotic diversity than pvc u biofilms and bacterial composition was less diverse in pvc u biofilms comparably chao et al 2015 found considerable differences in bacterial diversity and taxonomic structure between biofilms on stainless steel and pe materials indicating that stainless steel facilitated the formation of biofilms with a higher bacterial diversity chao et al 2015 in contrast ginige et al 2017 observed no influence of concrete pe or stainless steel on the bacterial diversity in the biofilms on these materials the main taxa that were found in biofilm of all materials were alpha beta gamma and deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteriodetes aggarwal et al 2018 buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 ginige et al 2017 yu et al 2010 in all those studies the main focus was on biofilm and not on the water phase although the above mentioned studies gave information about differences in microbial diversity between material types it remains unclear to what extent the pipe material affects the microbial diversity in the distributed water itself and how microorganisms are distributed among the water and biofilm phase moreover most of these studies only compared two to four materials and some materials that are generally used in both distribution and premise plumbing system e g pe xb pe xc and pe 100 have not been investigated finally the previous mentioned studies used drinking water with a disinfection residual buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 yu et al 2010 and it remains uncertain if similar results will be obtained with unchlorinated drinking water these considerations urge the need for additional research into the effects of pipe materials on the microbial community in the biofilm and unchlorinated drinking water therefore the aim of our study was to determine the influence of six different pipe materials that are commonly used in drinking water distribution or premise plumbing systems on the microbial community in biofilm and drinking water without a disinfectant residual using a slightly modified bpp test which mimics a worst case

en16421 with slight modifications no inoculum was added and a lower incubation temperature of 25 c instead of 30 c was used in short 900 ml unchlorinated drinking water was added to a flask containing 150 cm2 of each material and incubated for 16 weeks at 25 c all materials were tested in duplicate every week the drinking water in the flask was replaced with fresh unchlorinated drinking water from the distribution system obtained after flushing the tap for at least 60 min after 1 4 8 12 and 16 weeks a material piece 25 cm2 and water 150 ml were taken from each flask the surface of each material piece was swabbed at room temperature using a cotton swab which was subsequently placed in 40 ml of sterile tap water together with the swabbed material piece and then stored on ice next the mixture of material piece cotton swab and 40 ml of water was sonicated once on ice with high energy for 2 min amplitude of 45 30 w the water and biofilm samples after swabbing and sonication were used to determine i the concentration of adenosine triphosphate atp as a measure of active biomass van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 and ii the composition of the bacterial community after week 1 8 and 16 using illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing and iii the number of several specific microbial groups using qpcr after week 1 4 8 and 16 2 2 atp the atp concentration was determined in all drinking water and biofilm samples by measuring the amount of light produced in a luciferin luciferase assay cen en 16241 2014 a nucleotide releasing buffer celsis international b v maastricht airport the

luminometer celsis advance ii celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands the concentration of atp is calculated from the rlu values using a conversion factor determined in calibration measurements the detection limit of the celsis advance luminometer was 1 ng atp l 1 a more detailed description of the method to measure atp in drinking water associated environments including calibration curves and the use of standards is given in cen en 16421 the atp data from water are expressed in ng l 1 and from biofilm in pg cm 2 to be able to compare water and biofilm concentrations directly the atp data of the water samples was also calculated to pg cm 2 this was done by multiplying the atp concentration in water pg ml 1 with the amount of water in ml present and subsequently divided by the total amount of material surface present in cm2 2 3 microbial community analysis 2 3 1 dna isolation water 130 ml and biofilm suspension 30 ml samples were vacuum filtered through polycarbonate track etch membrane filters with a diameter of 50 mm and a pore size of 0 22 µm sartorius göttingen germany filters were then transferred to a bead tube of the powerbiofilm dna isolation

2013 and summarized in the miseq standard operating procedure http www mothur org wiki miseq sop june 2016 the sequences were quality filtered by removing sequences containing ambiguous bases and sequences with an average quality score below 35 paired end reads were first assembled into contigs the quality of the quality filtered reads and the assembled reads was further improved by i removing sequences containing homopolymers of minimally 8 nucleotides ii removing sequences with ambiguous bases and iii by using a 1 precluster error the remaining sequences were aligned to the silvav128 16s rna gene sequence database pruesse et al 2007 and chimeric sequences were removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 the retained high quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an identity cut off of 97 the r package phyloseq was used to generate abundance bar graphs at class and genus level in addition community differences between samples were determined by calculating otu based bray curtis distances which were subsequently used as input for the constrained ordination canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap analysis mcmurdie and holmes 2013 a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was done on the constrained axes used in ordination the online tool microbiome analyst with default settings was used for determining the α diversities dhariwal et al 2017 3 results 3 1 influence of material type on biomass and microbial community composition the average atp concentration calculated from the different time points differed for each material the lowest atp concentration was found in the presence of glass 10 2 0 6 pg ml 1 and 21 8 7 9 pg atp cm 2 for water and biofilm respectively table 1 closely followed by copper 14 2 7

glass and copper besides the material pvc p 1 2 103 1 6 103 pg ml 1 and 9 1 103 1 5 103 pg atp cm 2 the materials pe 100 18 1 4 6 pg ml 1 and 381 5 58 0 pg atp cm 2 and pe xb 20 6 19 8 pg ml 1 and 465 2 343 8 pg atp cm 2 had the highest atp concentration it was found that water and biofilm in contact with the different materials have a diverse more than 65 classes bacterial community at class level fig 1 several bacterial classes alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria were among the predominant ones above 2 relative abundance in all samples other bacterial classes could only be observed for specific materials at specific times for instance flavobacteriia were only observed above 2 relative abundance in water with the materials pe xb week 1 pvc p week 2 and glass week 16 but not for the other materials likewise deltaproteobacteria were only observed above 2 relative abundance after week 8 in the biofilm and water of pvcc and in the water of pvc p the dis similarity of bacterial communities between materials at the otu level were determined using cap based on bray curtis distances fig 2 the ordination plot shows that the bacterial community with pvc p and copper except for week 1 form two distinct clusters from the bacterial communities of the other materials and each other fig 2 to study the differences between the seven materials in more detail the bacterial community compositions of week 8 and 16 were compared at class genus and otu level fig 3 4 figure s2 ten different bacterial classes had a relative abundance of more than 2 in the biofilm samples fig 3 acidobacteria alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria were found in the 16 week old biofilm and water of all the materials unclassified proteobacteria were not found above 2 relative abundance in the biofilm of copper but this class was present in all other water samples actinobacteria were only found in the biofilm and or water of most plasticized pipe materials pe 100 pe xb and pvcc and thus might be a specific marker for plasticized pipe materials with low concentrations of plasticizers planctomycetacia were only predominant in biofilm and water of pvc p which could make it a marker for plasticized materials with high concentrations of plasticizers sphingobacteria were only predominant in the water and biofilm of copper glass and pvc p and in the water of pe 100 whereas unclassified bacteroidetes were predominant in the biofilm but not in the water with copper and pvc p finally flavobacteriia were only predominant in the water that was in contact with glass similar observations were made at genus level figure s2 and it is concluded that overall these results demonstrate that pipe materials select for general and material specific bacterial classes and genera when in contact with drinking water the cap of water and biofilm samples of week 8 and 16 indicated that the bacterial community at otu level in water and biofilms differed between most materials fig 4 as also indicated by the length of the arrows and the permanova p 0 001 as observed with data from all time points fig 2 the materials pvc p and copper formed distinct clusters separated from each other and the other materials glass pe 100 pe xb pe xc and pvcc which grouped more together when only data from week 8 and16 were used than when all data week 1 8 and 16 were used in addition the bacterial community in biofilm and water samples of pe 100 glass pe xb and pvcc were more similar to each other than to pe xc in all samples gene copies of total bacteria legionella spp the protozoan v vermiformis fungi mycobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp were detected fig 5 and s6 however gene copies of aeromonas spp were not detected in the samples figure s6 the gene copy number of all bacteria legionella spp v vermiformis fungi mycobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp in the biofilm on pvc p were 1 3 log units higher compared to those observed for the other materials the difference in gene copy numbers of these organisms between these other materials remained low 3 2 influence of incubation time on the biomass and community composition of materials in contact with drinking water the amount of atp in water for all materials tested was relatively stable over time except for the atp concentration in water in the presence of pvc p which declined over time table 1 for both water and biofilm the atp concentrations at the first week was often higher than at other time points and were often also the highest measured during the incubation period the amount of atp in biofilm on glass and pvcc increased with time for the other materials it decreased with time in addition for most materials it was observed that the atp concentrations in water and or biofilm were comparable after eight and 16 weeks table 1 the bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers in water increased from week 1 to week 4 for all materials except pvc p and subsequently declined steadily for all materials from week 4 to 16 table s3 after 16 weeks samples had lower 16s rrna gene copy numbers than after one week the bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers in biofilm declined from week 1 to week 16 for all materials except for glass and copper the log 16s rrna gene copy numbers n 28 correlated significantly p 0 05 with the log atp concentrations n 28 water r2 0 91 biofilm r2 0 68 pearson linear correlation figure s1 demonstrating that 16s rrna gene copy numbers are a reliable indicator for active biomass in this study the bacterial community composition at class level also differed in time fig 1 for instance after week 1 betaproteobacteria were abundant in water and biofilm for all materials 2 5 to 3 9 but their relative abundance declined in time to 0 8 in both water and biofilm whereas the opposite occurred for the unclassified proteobacteria furthermore after eight and 16 weeks there were more different bacterial classes present in water and biofilm at relative abundances above 2 than after one week sometimes bacterial classes that were present after one week were not detected after eight or 16 weeks for instance flavobacteria in water samples from pe xb and pvc p were only present after week 1 also the otu diversity shows in general an increase in time table 2 these results demonstrate that bacterial diversity at the class and otu level in water and biofilm increased during the first eight weeks that the materials were in contact with water after which it stabilized the cap results for the bacterial communities at otu level in the biofilms of the different materials showed that most of the samples taken after week 1 formed a distinct cluster from the other time points week 8 and 16 irrespective of the material investigated as indicated by the length of the arrows and the permanova p 0 001 fig 2 furthermore the samples taken after week 8 and 16 clustered together for each material meaning that the community composition after week 8 and 16 are more similar to each other than after week 1 the permanova analysis indicated that week was still different p 0 006 but the length of the arrows were much shorter when compared to the other arrows the numbers of legionella spp found in the presence of four of the materials were stable in time around 103 gc cm 2 namely glass copper pe xc and pe 100 for pe xb and pvcc it was observed that the amount of gene copies after one week were 1 3 log units higher than after the other time points fig 5a b for pvc p the amount of gene copies of legionella spp in the biofilm increased with time the numbers of v vermiformis in biofilm were relatively stable in time with a small peak after four weeks for most of the materials fig 5c d an exception to this was the observation that the numbers of v vermiformis in the biofilm of pvc p increased until four weeks and remained stable afterwards after one week the numbers of v vermiformis in the water of pe xb and pvcc were higher compared to the other materials but this difference disappeared during longer incubations when numbers became more similar to the other materials besides a small peak after four weeks the gene copy numbers of mycobacterium spp with the materials glass copper pe xc pe xb and pvcc in both water and biofilm stayed relatively stable between week 1 and 16 fig 5e f in the water and biofilm of pvc p and pe 100 mycobacterial gene copy numbers increased 1 to 4 log units between week 1 and 16 in both water and biofilm gene copy numbers of pseudomonas spp with materials pvcc pe xb and pvc p declined in time fig 5g h the pseudomonas spp numbers in water and biofilm of the other materials were stable except in the water of pe xc which peaked after four weeks 1 2 log units higher during the first four to eight weeks the gene copy numbers of aeromonas spp in water varied for each material but numbers stabilized after eight weeks at relatively low numbers 102 103 gc l 1 sup figure 6 a b furthermore aeromonas spp gene copy numbers in the biofilm of all materials except pvc p were always low 102 gc cm 2 there was some variation in fungal gene copies between the time points but in general the numbers were stable sup figure 6 c d the exception were numbers in the biofilm of pvc p which increased over time while in the biofilm of pvcc and pe 100 the numbers declined over time 3 3 difference in biomass and community composition between water and biofilm the atp ratio between water and biofilm was calculated to determine the active biomass differences between water and biofilm on the different materials in contact with drinking water table 1 glass showed a water biofilm ratio above one 2 1 4 9 which means that more biomass was present in the water phase than in the biofilm phase copper and pvcc had a water biofilm ratio that was close to one 0 6 to 1 2 meaning that the biomass is relatively equally distributed between the water and biofilm phase pvc p pe xb pe xc and pe 100 had a ratio lower than one 0 6 demonstrating that with these materials more biomass was present in the biofilm phase than in the water phase cap of water and biofilm samples of week 8 and 16 indicated that material and matrix biofilm versus drinking water are the strongest determinants for the bacterial community composition as indicated by the length of the arrows and the results of the permanova analysis p 0 001 fig 4 the ratio of the gene copies of legionella spp for all materials were higher than one meaning that more legionella spp were present in the water this was generally the case after week 1 but over time the ratio became closer to one showing that legionella spp shifted from a free planktonic presence to a more biofilm associated presence on the materials table s4 the water biofilm ratio of the gene copies v vermiformis and fungi were often lower than one meaning that more v vermiformis and fungi were present in the biofilm than in the water however there were some exceptions especially after the first week with pvc p table s4 the water biofilm ratio of the gene copies of mycobacterium spp were for most materials between 1 and 17 so most of the mycobacterium spp were present in the water and not in the biofilm the water biofilm ratio of the gene copies of pseudomonas spp were in general between 1 and 12 for the materials glass and copper and between 1 and 100 for pvc p pvcc and pe 100 for the other two materials the ratio was much higher especially after week 1 and 4 these results demonstrate that most of pseudomonas spp were present in the water the water biofilm ratio for the gene copies of aeromonas spp could not be calculated for several time points due to absence of aeromonas spp in the biofilm the ratios that could be calculated for aeromonas spp were all higher than one confirming that more aeromonas spp were in the water than in the biofilm 4 discussion the aim of our study was to determine what the influence is of different pipe materials that are used in drinking water systems on the bacterial communities in water and biofilm under worst case conditions i e semi stagnant water at 25 c without a disinfection residual the biomass concentrations of materials have been studied before and our results confirm those previously published results namely that pvc p has the highest biomass glass copper and pvcc the lowest and pe having an intermediate biomass van der kooij et al 2006 hambsch et al 2014 learbuch et al 2019 moreover the permanova and cap analyses of the 16s rrna gene data at the otu level showed that material type was one of the drivers that explains the observed differences between the bacterial community compositions previous research has investigated the influence of materials on community composition but those studies only compared two four different material types and did not investigate generally used specific pipe materials like pe xb pe xc and pe 100 making it difficult to draw general conclusions about the influence of all commonly used material types in drinking water systems on the bacterial community composition buse et al 2014 also found significant differences between the bacterial communities in drinking water biofilms on pvc u and copper that were grown during a year in biofilm reactors in the 1 year old pvc u biofilm burkholderiales predominated whereas with copper sediminibacterium and lacibacter predominated in the biofilm we also observed that burkholderiales were among the predominant members of the biofilm community on pvcc however they were only predominant after the first week in our study whereas after 16 weeks other members were more predominant we also found sediminibacterium to be predominant in both the water and biofilm of copper but lacibacter was not among the taxa with a relative abundance 2 others found differences in bacterial diversity between biofilms formed on stainless steel and pe chao et al 2015 they found that after 60 days the genus sphingomonas and the genus nevskia represented the two most abundant genera on both materials and decreased over time other bacteria members of the family hyphomicrobiaceae and the genus bradyrhizobium increased during biofilm ripening in our study the order sphingomonadales and family sphingomonadaceae were found above 2 relative abundance in the biofilm of some of the tested pe materials pe xb and pe xc but the genus sphingomonas was not observed furthermore hyphomicrobiaceae were also found in our study above 2 relative abundance in the biofilm of two of the three tested pe materials pe 100 and pe xc but only after week 16 these comparisons indicate that our results are largely comparable to earlier studies as indicated before some specific pe materials pe xb pe xc and pe 100 have not yet been investigated as previous studies have not specified the type of pe that was investigated chao et al 2015 although the production process is different between pe types which could also influence the biomass production or bacterial community composition that develops on each pe type our study showed that both microbial biomass concentration and the bacterial community composition were similar between pe xb and pe 100 whereas pe xc had a lower microbial biomass concentration and a slightly different community composition than the other two pe types this result indicates that the type of pe can have some influence on the microbial community that develops in the biofilm when these materials are exposed to drinking water it also stresses the need to specify the pe material used when studying the influence of pe material on microbial growth in drinking water systems as opposed to our study chlorinated drinking water and drinking water with a higher growth potential was used in the other two studies buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 the similarity between the results obtained in those studies with the results obtained in our study could indicate that a disinfectant residual seems to have less influence on the community composition in the biofilm than the material type however additional experiments using both drinking water with and without different disinfectant residual e g chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide and with different water chemistry are needed to reliable conclude on the influence of different disinfection residuals and water chemistry in drinking water on the biofilm concentration and composition on pipe materials the results from our study demonstrated that the bacterial community composition in biofilm and water in contact with copper and pvc p was different from the other materials but also from each other apparently the growth conditions induced by copper or pvc p are different from those induced by glass pvcc and pe copper can be toxic for some microorganisms borkow and gabbay 2005 and studies that investigated the effect of copper on microbial growth have demonstrated that copper repressed biofilm growth yu et al 2010 morvay et al 2011 lehtola et al 2005 it can therefore be assumed that the bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect that copper has on several bacterial species resulted in an aberrant community composition in biofilm and water in contact with copper when compared to the microbiota in contact with the other material types microbial data shows that some unknown genera of gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria rhizobiales and sphingomonadales and the genus sediminibacterium are elevated on copper as mentioned before buse et al 2014 also observed higher sediminibacterium numbers on copper in contact with drinking water furthermore this genus was also observed in copper contaminated soil kou et al 2018 this indicates that copper induced the development of a copper tolerant microbial community in drinking water systems with copper pipes however others have implied that it might not be specific copper tolerant or resistant microorganisms that are present in drinking water that is in contact with copper but that the organisms normally present in drinking water environments could develop resistance dietrich et al 2004 in our study we have found indications for both hypotheses first specific bacteria sediminibacterium and sphaerotilus in the microbial community colonized the biofilm and drinking water in contact with copper suggesting the development of a copper resistant community second bacteria that have also been observed on other materials than copper are also present indicating that these bacteria that are normally present have developed copper tolerance although further research is needed to look into bacteria developing tolerance or not to copper pvc p showed both a distinct bacterial community composition and a high biomass concentration compared to the other materials the fact that the highest biomass concentrations were found with the material pvc p was expected since pvc p contains high concentrations of plasticizers that can promote growth of bacteria flemming et al 2014 these high concentrations are likely the cause for the aberrant community composition observed on pvc p compared to the other materials although the microbial degradation of compounds released from plasticized materials has been studied ryssel et al 2015 corfitzen 2004 characterizing the bacterial community involved in this biodegradation has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge the results of our study showed that genera belonging to proteobacteria bacteriodetes bradyrhizobiaceae burkholderiales chitinophagaceae acidobacteria gp6 planctomyceteae and rhodobacteraceae predominate the pvc p biofilm and water samples implying that members of these genera can degrade organic compounds released from pvc p some of these taxa also predominated in the biofilm and water of pvcc and the pe materials but the bacterial otu composition clearly differed between pvc p and the other plasticized materials demonstrating that pvc p apparently selects for specific bacterial species within these genera such differences are probably caused by a different plasticizer composition and or concentration that is released from pvc p compared to the other plastic materials future research that studies in more detail the metabolic capacities of the bacterial species that we identified to be involved in degradation of the biodegradable migrating plasticizers from pvc p pe and pvcc can help elucidate which specific compounds from these plastic materials cause microbial growth such information will provide an opportunity to optimize these pipe materials towards a lower growth potential for microorganisms the different specific microbial groups were quantified using qpcr to determine the effect of the material on the numbers of the different microbial groups these groups were chosen because they have to be monitored according to the legislation in the netherlands legionella spp and aeromonas spp they are known early colonizers of the biofilm pseudomonas spp and mycobacterium spp douterelo et al 2014 furthermore these four genera contain known opportunistic pathogens for some of which vermamoeba vermiformis can serve as a host e g l pneumophila kuiper et al 2006 recently the growth potential of different pipe materials for l pneumophila was determined for materials in contact with drinking water that was produced by reverse osmosis and a remineralization step learbuch et al 2019 a high growth potential for l pneumophila was observed with pvc p in that study in the present study we observed high numbers of legionella spp and the protozoan v vermiformis with pvc p confirming that this material could pose a risk for growth of l pneumophila since l pneumophila is a species within the genus legionella that uses v vermiformis as a host protozoan for growth in drinking water systems kuiper et al 2006 based on these studies it is concluded that the use of pvc p should be avoided as much as possible in drinking water systems we also observed that mycobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp numbers were higher on pvc p the detection of these genera might indicate that growth conditions might also be favorable for growth of opportunistic pathogenic species within these genera e g pseudomonas aeruginosa mycobacterium avium or mycobacterium kansasii although further research is needed to specifically study the growth potential of these pathogenic species on different material types before definite conclusions can be made our study also focused on the microbial community development over time in the biofilm and drinking water that were in contact with the different material types the results showed that atp and the different microbial groups quantified with qpcr in general had higher concentrations at the beginning after week one to four but stabilized after four to eight weeks the microbial profiling showed differences between the different weeks specifically the community that had developed after one week was different from the communities present after week 8 and 16 which were more similar to each other these results imply that after 4 to 8 weeks a stable situation arose previous studies have shown that the atp concentration stabilized after seven to eight weeks in the biofilm when seven to nine different materials were tested with the bpp test van der kooij and veenendaal 2014 learbuch et al 2019 the results from our study are in accordance with the results from these previous studies but expanded these findings not only to the biomass but also to the community composition that stabilized after eight weeks of incubation martiny et al 2003 sampled drinking water biofilm obtained from a model drinking water distribution system from day one to 156 1 weeks and classified the biofilm into a young 0 13 4 weeks and old 81 6 156 1 weeks biofilm in contrast to the young biofilm the old biofilm had a stable bacterial community composition which was also characterized by a greater richness of bacteria since others have observed that hydraulics can impact the microbial community in drinking water systems kirisits et al 2007 tsagkari and sloan 2018 the apparent difference of the observations made by martiny et al 2003 with our observations might have been caused by the fact that they used a model system in which drinking water had a retention time of two hours whereas in our study semi stagnant conditions for one week were used others have studied the bacterial community composition of 8 6 17 1 and 25 7 week old biofilms chao et al 2015 these authors observed that the bacterial diversity of the biofilms did not vary largely between 8 6 and 25 7 weeks although the structure of the bacterial community changed during the biofilm formation and development chao et al 2015 which might be in contrast with our findings where the community composition remained relatively stable between 8 and 16 weeks however chao et al studied biofilm formation under continuous flow which is different with the semi stagnant conditions we applied in our study and these differences in hydraulics could be an explanation for these possible differences there is a standard normalization protocol to determine the growth potential of materials and which includes three different methods bpp w270 and mean dissolved oxygen difference mdod cen en16421 a downside of these methods is that the duration of the tests are long 16 12 and 7 weeks respectively opening the question whether the incubation periods of these tests can be reduced however our results show that after eight weeks the atp concentration and bacterial community composition stabilized which indicates that the relatively long testing times of these three methods are required to reliably determine the growth potential of materials still our results indicate that the current incubation time of 16 weeks in the bpp test might be reduced to eight to ten weeks although dedicated validation studies on this topic are required before a definite decision can be taken by measuring the microbial parameters in water and biofilm we were able to study whether the different material types stimulate biofilm or planktonic growth the atp ratio between water and biofilm showed that when a material does not release growth promoting substances i e glass the atp ratio is relatively high this high ratio signifies that growth is caused by biodegradable substances present in the water and consequently most biomass is found in the water with pvcc which has a biomass concentration that is slightly higher than for glass indicating release of small amounts of growth promoting substances a lower water biofilm ratio for atp was observed demonstrating a shift of biomass from water to biofilm since the absolute atp concentration in water in contact with pvcc is the same as for glass the extra growth with pvcc only occurred in the biofilm pe and pvc p showed the highest biomass concentrations in our study indicating materials that release considerably more growth promoting compounds than glass as well as the lowest water biofilm biomass ratios this demonstrates that most of the extra growth caused by the growth promoting compounds from pe and pvc p occurred in the biofilm consequently the use of pe and pvc p and to a much lesser extend pvcc in drinking water systems results in an increase of biofilm biomass which might pose a risk because several opportunistic pathogens that can be present in drinking water e g certain non tuberculous mycobacterial species l pneumophila p aeruginosa stenotrophomonas maltophilia and aspergillus fumigatus can only multiply in the biofilm bartram et al 2003 feazel et al 2009 flemming et al 2002 moritz et al 2010 van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 wingender and flemming 2011 as a result based on the biomass and microbial diversity results of our study we conclude that pvcc is the preferred pipe material to limit microbial growth in drinking water systems as compared to the other plastic materials i e pe and pvc p analyzed in this study the results of the microbial profiling showed variation of the bacterial community composition between water and biofilm of each specific material but this variation was limited the results found here were opposite to what other studies have observed in full scale distribution systems henne et al 2012 roeselers et al 2015 those studies showed that the structure and composition of the bacterial core community in the bulk water was highly similar within a distribution system whereas all biofilm samples contained a unique bacterial community composition unfortunately the material type was not identified in those studies making it difficult to relate these differences in biofilm community composition to material type still the observed differences between those studies and our study might be explained by the fact that our study was done under controlled conditions in the laboratory whereas the other two studies were done in full scale distribution systems where many more variables can influence the microbial ecology most notably in our study water was stagnant for a week as a realistic worst case scenario whereas in the other two studies the distribution system had a semi continuous flow of drinking water due to the long contact time between water and biofilm under semi stagnant conditions there is most likely more time for exchange of microorganisms between biofilm and water under semi stagnant conditions than under semi continuous flow conditions which can explain the observed differences between these studies 5 conclusions pipe material type used in drinking water systems influences the biomass concentration numbers of specific microorganisms and the bacterial community composition the bacterial community composition in biofilm and water in contact with copper and pvc p was different from the five other materials but also differed between each other pvc p showed both a distinct bacterial community composition and a high biomass concentration compared to other materials the results of the microbial profiling showed variation of the bacterial community composition between water and biofilm of each specific material but this variation is limited pvcc is the preferred material to control microbial growth in drinking water systems compared to the other plastic materials analyzed in this study pvc p has the highest biomass concentration glass copper and pvcc the lowest whereas pe has a biomass concentration in between glass and pvc p

17143,biodegradable compounds can cause undesired microbial growth in drinking water systems and these compounds can originate from the water or pipe materials used in drinking water systems the aim of our study was to determine the influence of different pipe materials on the microbial populations in water and biofilm under semi stagnant conditions the microbial communities in biofilm and water which were in contact with seven different materials were characterized by determining atp concentrations microbial composition gene copy numbers of some specific microbial groups the atp concentration in water and biofilm varied between the different materials with glass negative control copper pvc c pe xc pe xb pe 100 pvc p gene copy numbers of legionella spp mycobacterium spp pseudomonas spp aeromonas spp fungi and vermamoeba vermiformis were also higher for pvc p and pe than for glass copper and pvcc the bacterial community composition in water and biofilm varied between materials as well permanova and cap analysis demonstrated that copper and pvc p are different when compared to the other materials furthermore bacterial community composition and atp concentrations in water and biofilm were similar after eight and 16 weeks incubation but differed from results obtained after one week finally the atp the specific microbial groups and the bacterial community composition also differed between water and biofilm on each material we conclude from our study that pipe material is an important factor that influences the biomass concentration abundance of

van der kooij and veenendaal 2001 tsvetanova and hoekstra 2009 learbuch et al 2019 besides determining the bpp of materials research has also focused on the microbial diversity in water and biofilms of pipe materials that are in contact with water this microbial diversity was investigated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis yu et al 2010 jang et al 2011 or direct sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene fragments amplified by pcr aggarwal et al 2018 buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 ginige et al 2017 the studies that used dgge showed that the microbial diversity differed between materials with the highest microbial diversity on stainless steel and the lowest diversity on copper yu et al 2010 jang et al 2011 in addition buse et al 2014 observed significant differences in the bacterial and eukaryotic community members between pvc u and copper copper biofilms displayed lower eukaryotic diversity than pvc u biofilms and bacterial composition was less diverse in pvc u biofilms comparably chao et al 2015 found considerable differences in bacterial diversity and taxonomic structure between biofilms on stainless steel and pe materials indicating that stainless steel facilitated the formation of biofilms with a higher bacterial diversity chao et al 2015 in contrast ginige et al 2017 observed no influence of concrete pe or stainless steel on the bacterial diversity in the biofilms on these materials the main taxa that were found in biofilm of all materials were alpha beta gamma and deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteriodetes aggarwal et al 2018 buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 ginige et al 2017 yu et al 2010 in all those studies the main focus was on biofilm and not on the water phase although the above mentioned studies gave information about differences in microbial diversity between material types it remains unclear to what extent the pipe material affects the microbial diversity in the distributed water itself and how microorganisms are distributed among the water and biofilm phase moreover most of these studies only compared two to four materials and some materials that are generally used in both distribution and premise plumbing system e g pe xb pe xc and pe 100 have not been investigated finally the previous mentioned studies used drinking water with a disinfection residual buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 yu et al 2010 and it remains uncertain if similar results will be obtained with unchlorinated drinking water these considerations urge the need for additional research into the effects of pipe materials on the microbial community in the biofilm and unchlorinated drinking water therefore the aim of our study was to determine the influence of six different pipe materials that are commonly used in drinking water distribution or premise plumbing systems on the microbial community in biofilm and drinking water without a disinfectant residual using a slightly modified bpp test which mimics a worst case scenario in the distribution or premises plumbing system 25 c and stagnant water for a week 2 material methods 2 1 biomass production potential bpp of materials the microbial growth potential of six different pipe materials copper pvcc pe xb pe xc pe 100 and pvc p and glass an inert material that served as an negative control were analyzed with the bpp test van der kooij and veenendaal 2001 cen en16421 with slight modifications no inoculum was added and a lower incubation temperature of 25 c instead of 30 c was used in short 900 ml unchlorinated drinking water was added to a flask containing 150 cm2 of each material and incubated for 16 weeks at 25 c all materials were tested in duplicate every week the drinking water in the flask was replaced with fresh unchlorinated drinking water from the distribution system obtained after flushing the tap for at least 60 min after 1 4 8 12 and 16 weeks a material piece 25 cm2 and water 150 ml were taken from each flask the surface of each material piece was swabbed at room temperature using a cotton swab which was subsequently placed in 40 ml of sterile tap water together with the swabbed material piece and then stored on ice next the mixture of material piece cotton swab and 40 ml of water was sonicated once on ice with high energy for 2 min amplitude of 45 30 w the water and biofilm samples after swabbing and sonication were used to determine i the concentration of adenosine triphosphate atp as a measure of active biomass van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 and ii the composition of the bacterial community after week 1 8 and 16 using illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing and iii the number of several specific microbial groups using qpcr after week 1 4 8 and 16 2 2 atp the atp concentration was determined in all drinking water and biofilm samples by measuring the amount of light produced in a luciferin luciferase assay cen en 16241 2014 a nucleotide releasing buffer celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands was added to the sample to release atp from the cells the generated light signal is measured as relative light units rlu after a 2 sec delay time and a 10 sec integration time with a luminometer celsis advance ii celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands the concentration of atp is calculated from the rlu values using a conversion factor determined in calibration measurements the detection limit of the celsis advance luminometer was 1 ng atp l 1 a more detailed description of the method to measure atp in drinking water associated environments including calibration curves and the use of standards is given in cen en 16421 the atp data from water are expressed in ng l 1 and from biofilm in pg cm 2 to be able to compare water and biofilm concentrations directly the atp data of the water samples was also calculated to pg cm 2 this was done by multiplying the atp concentration in water pg ml 1 with the amount of water in ml present and subsequently

with an identity cut off of 97 the r package phyloseq was used to generate abundance bar graphs at class and genus level in addition community differences between samples were determined by calculating otu based bray curtis distances which were subsequently used as input for the constrained ordination canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap analysis mcmurdie and holmes 2013 a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was done on the constrained axes used in ordination the online tool microbiome analyst with default settings was used for determining the α diversities dhariwal et al 2017 3 results 3 1 influence of material type on biomass and microbial community composition the average atp concentration calculated from the different time points differed for each material the lowest atp concentration was found in the presence of glass 10 2 0 6 pg ml 1 and 21 8 7 9 pg atp cm 2 for water and biofilm respectively table 1 closely followed by copper 14 2 7 0 pg ml 1 and 99 5 73 5 pg atp cm 2 the materials pvcc 19 8 19 4 pg ml 1 and 126 7 116 1 pg atp cm 2 and pe xc 19 5 6 9 pg ml 1 and 168 4 83 1 pg atp cm 2 had slightly higher atp concentrations than glass and copper besides the material pvc p 1 2 103 1 6 103 pg ml 1 and 9 1 103 1 5 103 pg atp cm 2 the materials pe 100 18 1 4 6 pg ml 1 and 381 5 58 0 pg atp cm 2 and pe xb 20 6 19 8 pg ml 1 and 465 2 343 8 pg atp cm 2 had the highest atp concentration it was found that water and biofilm in contact with the different materials have a diverse more than 65 classes bacterial community at class level fig 1 several bacterial classes alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria were among the predominant ones above 2 relative abundance in all samples other bacterial classes could only be observed for specific materials at specific times for instance flavobacteriia were only observed above 2 relative abundance in water with the materials pe xb week 1 pvc p week 2 and glass week 16 but not for the other materials likewise deltaproteobacteria were only observed above 2 relative abundance after week 8 in the biofilm and water of pvcc and in the water of pvc p the dis similarity of bacterial communities between materials at the otu level were determined using cap based on bray curtis distances fig 2 the ordination plot shows that the bacterial community with pvc p and copper except for week 1 form two distinct clusters from the bacterial communities of the other materials and each other fig 2 to study the differences between the seven materials in more detail the bacterial community compositions of week 8 and 16 were compared at class genus and otu level fig 3 4 figure s2 ten different bacterial classes had a relative abundance of more than 2 in the biofilm samples fig 3 acidobacteria alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria were found in the 16 week old biofilm and water of all the materials unclassified proteobacteria were not found above 2 relative abundance in the biofilm of copper but this class was present in all other water samples actinobacteria were only found in the biofilm and or water of most plasticized pipe materials pe 100 pe xb and pvcc and thus might be a specific marker for plasticized pipe materials with low concentrations of plasticizers planctomycetacia were only predominant in biofilm and water of pvc p which could make it a marker for plasticized materials with high concentrations of plasticizers sphingobacteria were only predominant in the water and biofilm of copper glass and pvc p and in the water of pe 100 whereas unclassified bacteroidetes were predominant in the biofilm but not in the water with copper and pvc p finally flavobacteriia were only predominant in the water that was in contact with glass similar observations were made at genus level figure s2 and it is concluded that overall these results demonstrate that pipe materials select for general and material specific bacterial classes and genera when in contact with drinking water the cap of water and biofilm samples of week 8 and 16 indicated that the bacterial community at otu level in water and biofilms differed between most materials fig 4 as also indicated by the length of the arrows and the permanova p 0 001 as observed with data from all time points fig 2 the materials pvc p and copper formed distinct clusters separated from each other and the other materials glass pe 100 pe xb pe xc and pvcc which grouped more together when only data from week 8 and16 were used than when all data week 1 8 and 16 were used in addition the bacterial community in biofilm and water samples of pe 100 glass pe xb and pvcc were more similar to each other than to pe xc in all samples gene copies of total bacteria legionella spp the protozoan v vermiformis fungi mycobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp were detected fig 5 and s6 however gene copies of aeromonas spp were not detected in the samples figure s6 the gene copy number of all bacteria legionella spp v vermiformis fungi mycobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp in the biofilm on pvc p were 1 3 log units higher compared to those observed for the other materials the difference in gene copy numbers of these organisms between these other materials remained low 3 2 influence of incubation time on the biomass and community composition of materials in contact with drinking water the amount of atp in water for all materials tested was relatively stable over time except for the atp concentration in water in the presence of pvc p which declined over time table 1 for both water and biofilm the atp concentrations at the first week was often higher than at other time points and were often also the highest measured during the incubation period the amount of atp in biofilm on glass and pvcc increased with time for the other materials it decreased with time in addition for most materials it was observed that the atp concentrations in water and or biofilm were comparable after eight and 16 weeks table 1 the bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers in water increased from week 1 to week 4 for all materials except pvc p and subsequently declined steadily for all materials from week 4 to 16 table s3 after 16 weeks samples had lower 16s rrna gene copy numbers than after one week the bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers in biofilm declined from week 1 to week 16 for all materials except for glass and copper the log 16s rrna gene copy numbers n 28 correlated significantly p 0 05 with the log atp concentrations n 28 water r2 0 91 biofilm r2 0 68 pearson linear correlation figure s1 demonstrating that 16s rrna gene copy numbers are a reliable indicator for active biomass in this study the bacterial community composition at class level also differed in time fig 1 for instance after week 1 betaproteobacteria were abundant in water and biofilm for all materials 2 5 to 3 9 but their relative abundance declined in time to 0 8 in both water and biofilm whereas the opposite occurred for the unclassified proteobacteria furthermore after eight and 16 weeks there were more different bacterial classes present in water and biofilm at relative abundances above 2 than after one week sometimes bacterial classes that were present after one week were not detected after eight or 16 weeks for instance flavobacteria in water samples from pe xb and pvc p were only present after week 1 also the otu diversity shows in general an increase in time table 2 these results demonstrate that bacterial diversity at the class and otu level in water and biofilm increased during the first eight weeks that the materials were in contact with water after which it stabilized the cap results for the bacterial communities at otu level in the biofilms of the different materials showed that most of the samples taken after week 1 formed a distinct cluster from the other time points week 8 and 16 irrespective of the material investigated as indicated by the length of the arrows and the permanova p 0 001 fig 2 furthermore the samples taken after week 8 and 16 clustered together for each material meaning that the community composition after week 8 and 16 are more similar to each other than after week 1 the permanova analysis indicated that week was still different p 0 006 but the length of the arrows were much shorter when compared to the other arrows the numbers of legionella spp found in the presence of four of the materials were stable in time around 103 gc cm 2 namely glass copper pe xc and pe 100 for pe xb and pvcc it was observed that the amount of gene copies after one week were 1 3 log units higher than after the other time points fig 5a b for pvc p the amount of gene copies of legionella spp in the biofilm increased with time the numbers of v vermiformis in biofilm were relatively stable in time with a small peak after four weeks for most of the materials fig 5c d an exception to this was the observation that the numbers of v vermiformis in the biofilm of pvc p increased until four weeks and remained stable afterwards after one week the numbers of v vermiformis in the water of pe xb and pvcc were higher compared to the other materials but this difference disappeared during longer incubations when numbers became more similar to the other materials besides a small peak after four weeks the gene copy numbers of mycobacterium spp with the materials glass copper pe xc pe xb and pvcc in both water and biofilm stayed relatively stable between week 1 and 16 fig 5e f in the water and biofilm of pvc p and pe 100 mycobacterial gene copy numbers increased 1 to 4 log units between week 1 and 16 in both water and biofilm gene copy numbers of pseudomonas spp with materials pvcc pe xb and pvc p declined in time fig 5g h the pseudomonas spp numbers in water and biofilm of the other materials were stable except in the water of pe xc which peaked after four weeks 1 2 log units higher during the first four to eight weeks the gene copy numbers of aeromonas spp in water varied for each material but numbers stabilized after eight weeks at relatively low numbers 102 103 gc l 1 sup figure 6 a b furthermore aeromonas spp gene copy numbers in the biofilm of all materials except pvc p were always low 102 gc cm 2 there was some variation in fungal gene copies between the time points but in general the numbers were stable sup figure 6 c d the exception were numbers in the biofilm of pvc p which increased over time while in the biofilm of pvcc and pe 100 the numbers declined over time 3 3 difference in biomass and community composition between water and biofilm the atp ratio between water and biofilm was calculated to determine the active biomass differences between water and biofilm on the different materials in contact with drinking water table 1 glass showed a water biofilm ratio above one 2 1 4 9 which means that more biomass was present in the water phase than in the biofilm phase copper and pvcc had a water biofilm ratio that was close to one 0 6 to 1 2 meaning that the biomass is relatively equally distributed between the water and biofilm phase pvc p pe xb pe xc and pe 100 had a ratio lower than one 0 6 demonstrating that with these materials more biomass was present in the biofilm phase than in the water phase cap of water and biofilm samples of week 8 and 16 indicated that material and matrix biofilm versus drinking water are the strongest determinants for the bacterial community composition as indicated by the length of the arrows and the results of the permanova analysis p 0 001 fig 4 the ratio of the gene copies of legionella spp for all materials were higher than one meaning that more legionella spp were present in the water this was generally the case after week 1 but over time the ratio became closer to one showing that legionella spp shifted from a free planktonic presence to a more biofilm associated presence on the materials table s4 the water biofilm ratio of the gene copies v vermiformis and fungi were often lower than one meaning that more v vermiformis and fungi were present in the biofilm than in the water however there were some exceptions especially after the first week with pvc p table s4 the water biofilm ratio of the gene copies of mycobacterium spp were for most materials between 1 and 17 so most of the mycobacterium spp were present in the water and not in the biofilm the water biofilm ratio of the gene copies of pseudomonas spp were in general between 1 and 12 for the materials glass and copper and between 1 and 100 for pvc p pvcc and pe 100 for the other two materials the ratio was much higher especially after week 1 and 4 these results demonstrate that most of pseudomonas spp were present in the water the water biofilm ratio for the gene copies of aeromonas spp could not be calculated for several time points due to absence of aeromonas spp in the biofilm the ratios that could be calculated for aeromonas spp were all higher than one confirming that more aeromonas spp were in the water than in the biofilm 4 discussion the aim of our study was to determine what the influence is of different pipe materials that are used in drinking water systems on the bacterial communities in water and biofilm under worst case conditions i e semi stagnant water at 25 c without a disinfection residual the biomass concentrations of materials have been studied before and our results confirm those previously published results namely that pvc p has the highest biomass glass copper and pvcc the lowest and pe having an intermediate biomass van der kooij et al 2006 hambsch et al 2014 learbuch et al 2019 moreover the permanova and cap analyses of the 16s rrna gene data at the otu level showed that material type was one of the drivers that explains the observed differences between the bacterial community compositions previous research has investigated the influence of materials on community composition but those studies only compared two four different material types and did not investigate generally used specific pipe materials like pe xb pe xc and pe 100 making it difficult to draw general conclusions about the influence of all commonly used material types in drinking water systems on the bacterial community composition buse et al 2014 also found significant differences between the bacterial communities in drinking water biofilms on pvc u and copper that were grown during a year in biofilm reactors in the 1 year old pvc u biofilm burkholderiales predominated whereas with copper sediminibacterium and lacibacter predominated in the biofilm we also observed that burkholderiales were among the predominant members of the biofilm community on pvcc however they were only predominant after the first week in our study whereas after 16 weeks other members were more predominant we also found sediminibacterium to be predominant in both the water and biofilm of copper but lacibacter was not among the taxa with a relative abundance 2 others found differences in bacterial diversity between biofilms formed on stainless steel and pe chao et al 2015 they found that after 60 days the genus sphingomonas and the genus nevskia represented the two most abundant genera on both materials and decreased over time other bacteria members of the family hyphomicrobiaceae and the genus bradyrhizobium increased during biofilm ripening in our study the order sphingomonadales and family sphingomonadaceae were found above 2 relative abundance in the biofilm of some of the tested pe materials pe xb and pe xc but the genus sphingomonas was not observed furthermore hyphomicrobiaceae were also found in our study above 2 relative abundance in the biofilm of two of the three tested pe materials pe 100 and pe xc but only after week 16 these comparisons indicate that our results are largely comparable to earlier studies as indicated before some specific pe materials pe xb pe xc and pe 100 have not yet been investigated as previous studies have not specified the type of pe that was investigated chao et al 2015 although the production process is different between pe types which could also influence the biomass production or bacterial community composition that develops on each pe type our study showed that both microbial biomass concentration and the bacterial community composition were similar between pe xb and pe 100 whereas pe xc had a lower microbial biomass concentration and a slightly different community composition than the other two pe types this result indicates that the type of pe can have some influence on the microbial community that develops in the biofilm when these materials are exposed to drinking water it also stresses the need to specify the pe material used when studying the influence of pe material on microbial growth in drinking water systems as opposed to our study chlorinated drinking water and drinking water with a higher growth potential was used in the other two studies buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 the similarity between the results obtained in those studies with the results obtained in our study could indicate that a disinfectant residual seems to have less influence on the community composition in the biofilm than the material type however additional experiments using both drinking water with and without different disinfectant residual e g chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide and with different water chemistry are needed to reliable conclude on the influence of different disinfection residuals and water chemistry in drinking water on the biofilm concentration and composition on pipe materials the results from our study demonstrated that the bacterial community composition in biofilm and water in contact with copper and pvc p was different from the other materials but also from each other apparently the growth conditions induced by copper or pvc p are different from those induced by glass pvcc and pe copper can be toxic for some microorganisms borkow and gabbay 2005 and studies that investigated the effect of copper on microbial growth have demonstrated that copper repressed biofilm growth yu et al 2010 morvay et al 2011 lehtola et al 2005 it can therefore be assumed that the bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect that copper has on several bacterial species resulted in an aberrant community composition in biofilm and water in contact with copper when compared to the microbiota in contact with the other material types microbial data shows that some unknown genera of gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria rhizobiales and sphingomonadales and the genus sediminibacterium are elevated on copper as mentioned before buse et al 2014 also observed higher sediminibacterium numbers on copper in contact with drinking water furthermore this genus was also observed in copper contaminated soil kou et al 2018 this indicates that copper induced the development of a copper tolerant microbial community in drinking water systems with copper pipes however others have implied that it might not be specific copper tolerant or resistant microorganisms that are present in drinking water that is in contact with copper but that the organisms normally present in drinking water environments could develop resistance dietrich et al 2004 in our study we have found indications for both hypotheses first specific bacteria sediminibacterium and sphaerotilus in the microbial community colonized the biofilm and drinking water in contact with copper suggesting the development of a copper resistant community second bacteria that have also been observed on other materials than copper are also present indicating that these bacteria that are normally present have developed copper tolerance although further research is needed to look into bacteria developing tolerance or not to copper pvc p showed both a distinct bacterial community composition and a high biomass concentration compared to the other materials the fact that the highest biomass concentrations were found with the material pvc p was expected since pvc p contains high concentrations of plasticizers that can promote growth of bacteria flemming et al 2014 these high concentrations are likely the cause for the aberrant community composition observed on pvc p compared to the other materials although the microbial degradation of compounds released from plasticized materials has been studied ryssel et al 2015 corfitzen 2004 characterizing the bacterial community involved in this biodegradation has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge the results of our study showed that genera belonging to proteobacteria bacteriodetes bradyrhizobiaceae burkholderiales chitinophagaceae acidobacteria gp6 planctomyceteae and rhodobacteraceae predominate the pvc p biofilm and water samples implying that members of these genera can degrade organic compounds released from pvc p some of these taxa also predominated in the biofilm and water of pvcc and the pe materials but the bacterial otu composition clearly differed between pvc p and the other plasticized materials demonstrating that pvc p apparently selects for specific bacterial species within these genera such differences are probably caused by a different plasticizer composition and or concentration that is released from pvc p compared to the other plastic materials future research that studies in more detail the metabolic capacities of the bacterial species that we identified to be involved in degradation of the biodegradable migrating plasticizers from pvc p pe and pvcc can help elucidate which specific compounds from these plastic materials cause microbial growth such information will provide an opportunity to optimize these pipe materials towards a lower growth potential for microorganisms the different specific microbial groups were quantified using qpcr to determine the effect of the material on the numbers of the different microbial groups these groups were chosen because they have to be monitored according to the legislation in the netherlands legionella spp and aeromonas spp they are known early colonizers of the biofilm pseudomonas spp and mycobacterium spp douterelo et al 2014 furthermore these four genera contain known opportunistic pathogens for some of which vermamoeba vermiformis can serve as a host e g l pneumophila kuiper et al 2006 recently the growth potential of different pipe materials for l pneumophila was determined for materials in contact with drinking water that was produced by reverse osmosis and a remineralization step learbuch et al 2019 a high growth potential for l pneumophila was observed with pvc p in that study in the present study we observed high numbers of legionella spp and the protozoan v vermiformis with pvc p confirming that this material could pose a risk for growth of l pneumophila since l pneumophila is a species within the genus legionella that uses v vermiformis as a host protozoan for growth in drinking water systems kuiper et al 2006 based on these studies it is concluded that the use of pvc p should be avoided as much as possible in drinking water systems we also observed that mycobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp numbers were higher on pvc p the detection of these genera might indicate that growth conditions might also be favorable for growth of opportunistic pathogenic species within these genera e g pseudomonas aeruginosa mycobacterium avium or mycobacterium kansasii although further research is needed to specifically study the growth potential of these pathogenic species on different material types before definite conclusions can be made our study also focused on the microbial community development over time in the biofilm and drinking water that were in contact with the different material types the results showed that atp and the different microbial groups quantified with qpcr in general had higher concentrations at the beginning after week one to four but stabilized after four to eight weeks the microbial profiling showed differences between the different weeks specifically the community that had developed after one week was different from the communities present after week 8 and 16 which were more similar to each other these results imply that after 4 to 8 weeks a stable situation arose previous studies have shown that the atp concentration stabilized after seven to eight weeks in the biofilm when seven to nine different materials were tested with the bpp test van der kooij and veenendaal 2014 learbuch et al 2019 the results from our study are in accordance with the results from these previous studies but expanded these findings not only to the biomass but also to the community composition that stabilized after eight weeks of incubation martiny et al 2003 sampled drinking water biofilm obtained from a model drinking water distribution system from day one to 156 1 weeks and classified the biofilm into a young 0 13 4 weeks and old 81 6 156 1 weeks biofilm in contrast to the young biofilm the old biofilm had a stable bacterial community composition which was also characterized by a greater richness of bacteria since others have observed that hydraulics can impact the microbial community in drinking water systems kirisits et al 2007 tsagkari and sloan 2018 the apparent difference of the observations made by martiny et al 2003 with our observations might have been caused by the fact that they used a model system in which drinking water had a retention time of two hours whereas in our study semi stagnant conditions for one week were used others have studied the bacterial community composition of 8 6 17 1 and 25 7 week old biofilms chao et al 2015 these authors observed that the bacterial diversity of the biofilms did not vary largely between 8 6 and 25 7 weeks although the structure of the bacterial community changed during the biofilm formation and development chao et al 2015 which might be in contrast with our findings where the community composition remained relatively stable between 8 and 16 weeks however chao et al studied biofilm formation under continuous flow which is different with the semi stagnant conditions we applied in our study and these differences in hydraulics could be an explanation for these possible differences there is a standard normalization protocol to determine the growth potential of materials and which includes three different methods bpp w270 and mean dissolved oxygen difference mdod cen en16421 a downside of these methods is that the duration of the tests are long 16 12 and 7 weeks respectively opening the question whether the incubation periods of these tests can be reduced however our results show that after eight weeks the atp concentration and bacterial community composition stabilized which indicates that the relatively long testing times of these three methods are required to reliably determine the growth potential of materials still our results indicate that the current incubation time of 16 weeks in the bpp test might be reduced to eight to ten weeks although dedicated validation studies on this topic are required before a definite decision can be taken by measuring the microbial parameters in water and biofilm we were able to study whether the different material types stimulate biofilm or planktonic growth the atp ratio between water and biofilm showed that when a material does not release growth promoting substances i e glass the atp ratio is relatively high this high ratio signifies that growth is caused by biodegradable substances present in the water and consequently most biomass is found in the water with pvcc which has a biomass concentration that is slightly higher than for glass indicating release of small amounts of growth promoting substances a lower water biofilm ratio for atp was observed demonstrating a shift of biomass from water to biofilm since the absolute atp concentration in water in contact with pvcc is the same as for glass the extra growth with pvcc only occurred in the biofilm pe and pvc p showed the highest biomass concentrations in our study indicating materials that release considerably more growth promoting compounds than glass as well as the lowest water biofilm biomass ratios this demonstrates that most of the extra growth caused by the growth promoting compounds from pe and pvc p occurred in the biofilm consequently the use of pe and pvc p and to a much lesser extend pvcc in drinking water systems results in an increase of biofilm biomass which might pose a risk because several opportunistic pathogens that can be present in drinking water e g certain non tuberculous mycobacterial species l pneumophila p aeruginosa stenotrophomonas maltophilia and aspergillus fumigatus can only multiply in the biofilm bartram et al 2003 feazel et al 2009 flemming et al 2002 moritz et al 2010 van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 wingender and flemming 2011 as a result based on the biomass and microbial diversity results of our study we conclude that pvcc is the preferred pipe material to limit microbial growth in drinking water systems as compared to the other plastic materials i e pe and pvc p analyzed in this study the results of the microbial profiling showed variation of the bacterial community composition between water and biofilm of each specific material but this variation was limited the results found here were opposite to what other studies have observed in full scale distribution systems henne et al 2012 roeselers et al 2015 those studies showed that the structure and composition of the bacterial core community in the bulk water was highly similar within a distribution system whereas all biofilm samples contained a unique bacterial community composition unfortunately the material type was not identified in those studies making it difficult to relate these differences in biofilm community composition to material type still the observed differences between those studies and our study might be explained by the fact that our study was done under controlled conditions in the laboratory whereas the other two studies were done in full scale distribution systems where many more variables can influence the microbial ecology most notably in our study water was stagnant for a week as a realistic worst case scenario whereas in the other two studies the distribution system had a semi continuous flow of drinking water due to the long contact time between water and biofilm under semi stagnant conditions there is most likely more time for exchange of microorganisms between biofilm and water under semi stagnant conditions than under semi continuous flow conditions which can explain the observed differences between these studies 5 conclusions pipe material type used in drinking water systems influences the biomass concentration numbers of specific microorganisms and the bacterial community composition the bacterial community composition in biofilm and water in contact with copper and pvc p was different from the five other materials but also differed between each other pvc p showed both a distinct bacterial community composition and a high biomass concentration compared to other materials the results of the microbial profiling showed variation of the bacterial community composition between water and biofilm of each specific material but this variation is limited pvcc is the preferred material to control microbial growth in drinking water systems compared to the other plastic materials analyzed in this study pvc p has the highest biomass concentration glass copper and pvcc the lowest whereas pe has a biomass concentration in between glass and pvc p

17144,forward osmosis is an energy efficient process that is capable of recovering high quality water from secondary wastewater treatment however regeneration of the draw solution ds is a problem that needs to be addressed herein we developed and optimized a one step process that does not require additional treatment for the ds this process called pressure assisted volume retarded osmosis pa vro utilizes naturally occurring pressure with the aid of a small inlet pressure 1 bar poly styrenesulfonate was employed as the ds for its high solubility in water and large molecular size 70 000 da accordingly real wastewater was employed as the feed solution for 48 h to remove perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos through pa vro the rejection rates for pfoa pfos and poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss were observed to exceed 98 after 24 h and 99 after 48 h moreover there were no traceable amounts of pfoa pfos in the ds and hence the detected concentrations of pfoa and pfos can be attributed to the residuals from the equipment therefore this well optimized pa vro process can be utilized for potable water production from treated wastewater graphical abstract image

eps such as perfluoroalkyl substances pfass pfass have been in use since the 1940s for a wide range of industrial and commercial applications lei et al 2015 and have become an incipient concern hale et al 2017 loccisano et al 2011 further pfass demonstrate a high stability due to the presence of the bound fluorine key et al 1997 and their characteristics of lipophobicity and hydrophobicity and this results in these substances being non biodegradable zhou et al 2017 perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoate pfoa are the two most well known pfass which have been widely detected and are being increasingly recognized as environmental hazards brooke et al 2004 toward a new comprehensive global database of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass summary report on updating the oecd 2007 list of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass 2018 in previous studies pfoa and pfos were readily and globally found in almost all human blood samples in measurable ng ml levels lindh et al 2012 vassiliadou et al 2010 further studies suggest that this can increase the risk associated with the health of the human population joensen et al 2013 kennedy et al 2004 moreover it has been reported that the effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the main sources of contamination for both pfoa and pfos melissa m schultz et al 2005 therefore it is crucial that pfoa and pfos are removed from the wastewater especially for the potable water production as hong kong plans to modify its water supply to deal with climate change a range of possible developments have been put forward and these include reclaiming 15 of the wastewater of hong kong to provide approximately 165 million m3 of freshwater for non potable reuse adm capital foundation 2017 amongst all the existing water treatment processes membrane based water treatment processes are the most widely used because they are highly efficient and cost effective forward osmosis fo is recognized as a relatively more economical process and it has garnered significant interest over the past two decades fo is a process that uses the concentration difference between two solutions which are separated by a semi permeable membrane these two solutions are referred to as the feed solution fs and the draw solution ds the concentration difference between the two solutions produces an osmotic pressure gradient toward the ds which has a higher concentration distinct from other membrane processes the osmotic pressure gradient is the main driving force in fo and this renders fo to be more advantageous because it does not necessitate hydraulic pressure or heat garcia castello et al 2009 although the use of ds is a unique characteristic of fo and provides a significant advantage to the process the regeneration of ds remains a challenge alejo et al 2017 this has led to the research on the direct use of the ds and also on different hybrid processes to achieve the regeneration of the ds salcedo diaz et al 2014 xie et al 2013 volume retarded osmosis vro is one of the promising processes in terms of energy consumption because no pressure is required in the vro process choi et al 2019a 2019b im et al 2018 2017a vro is a process that uses naturally occurring pressure inside a closed cell as the driving force for the ds regeneration choi et al 2019a in vro two processes are combined together for developing a one cell system and these processes are fo and the low pressure membrane lpm process choi et al 2019b vro was first developed in 2017 im et al 2017 thus more studies are required to better understand and optimize the process because the vro process uses naturally developed pressure it only requires a single circulation pump to achieve feed circulation in the fo part of the process this allows the vro process to consume less energy as compared to the conventional processes and other hybrid fo processes choi et al 2019a 2019b im et al 2018 2017a therefore using a vro process can reduce energy consumption while achieving the simultaneous rejection of pollutants that are not removable by low pressure membranes due to the difference in pore sizes despite the numerous advantages of vro results from previous studies have demonstrated that the flux obtained is relatively low and further the reverse solute flux rsf through the fo membrane is much higher than it would be in a single fo process this can be significantly improved by using a minimal hydraulic pressure on the feed side of the membrane and this is aimed at matching the pressure inside the cell to render the net physical pressure to be zero therefore in this study the pressure inside the cell was measured which was a crucial factor that hindered the overall flux and rsf and further pressure was applied on the feed side correspondingly it is worth noting that the membrane area was not completely optimized the effective membrane areas used for the fo and lpm processes from a previous study were 70 and 32 cm2 respectively choi et al 2019b and this led to a higher permeation rate into the ds tank further this caused the pressure inside the cell to further increase which is a factor that has not been considered in previous studies therefore in this study we applied a small inlet pressure that was equal to the pressure inside the cell to the feed side of the vro process and this was aimed at sustaining the concentration inside the tank thereby minimizing the rsf and maximizing the permeate flux this pressure assisted pa vro process was also tested for its ability to permeate and reject pfass from real secondary wastewater the aims of this study are threefold namely 1 the optimization of the pa vro system for low pressure water production systems 2 determination of the applicability of pa vro processes for potable water production from real wastewater generated by the ngong ping sewage treatment works npstw and 3 determination of the ability of the pa vro process to remove pfass from real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design prior to cell customization stand alone fo and uf processes were carried out to determine the optimal membrane sizes the schematic diagrams for each of these processes can be found in fig 1 a and b respectively as shown in fig 6 a the single fo process comprised an fs tank a ds tank two gear pumps for the circulation of the fs and ds cole parmer il us a customized cross flow fo cell a balance to measure the weight change of the ds ohaus nj us and a computer for automatic logging of the variations in weight in the ds the dimension of the customized cell was 7 7 cm x 2 6 cm x 0 3 cm and the flow rates for both ds and fs were maintained at 250 ml min thin film composite polyamide tfc pa membranes were used which comprised an effective membrane area of 20 02 cm2 the process was conducted in the active layer facing feed solution al fs mode with initial volumes of 500 ml for both fs and ds the configuration of the set up for the single uf process can be seen in fig 1 b it consisted of a customized dead end uf cell digital pressure meter asmik hangzhou china nitrogen gas tank scale magnetic stirrer ika staufen germany and computer the pressure was monitored through a digital pressure meter and the pressure inside the cell was maintained at 3 0 bar through the injection of nitrogen gas it is worth noting that the dead end uf process was employed for a better representation of the uf part as it occurs in the pa vro process and further there was no flow of ds the effective membrane area of the uf membrane was 12 56 cm2 with a diameter of 4 cm the initial volume of the fs was 200 ml and weight changes in the permeate were measured using a digital balance every 5 s until the total permeate reached a volume of 10 ml using the flux data obtained from the single fo and uf experiments the effective membrane areas for the fo and uf part of the pa vro process were then determined the effective membrane areas determined for the fo and uf membrane were 10 and 12 56 cm2 respectively a smaller membrane area was employed for the fo membrane to prevent the unnecessary build up of pressure inside the ds chamber moreover minimizing the pressure inside the cell is crucial because an enhanced pressure inside the cell would require a higher feed inlet pressure this can be achieved using a relatively larger uf membrane area which would facilitate a larger volume of water thereby minimizing the pressure the graphical representation of the pa vro set up is depicted in fig 1 c and consists of an fs tank a permeate tank a circulation pump a magnetic stirrer the customized pa vro cell pressure meters and valves a valve was used to control the inlet pressure and pressure meters were used to measure the cell pressure as well as the inlet pressure of the fs the inlet pressure of the fs was set to match the pressure inside the cell which ensured that the net physical pressure was 0 this not only minimizes rsf but also allows the ds tank to exhibit a higher working pressure for the uf part of the process by sustaining the solute concentration as shown in fig 1 c fo and uf membranes are placed on the opposite side of the cell in order to prevent the damage to the uf cell from the pressure a porous disk like spacer was placed against the support layer of the membrane prior to the operation of the pa vro process for treating pfos pfoa in real secondary wastewater the system was operated for six consecutive days to remove pss in the lower mw range the water flux during this process was monitored and recorded using automatic logging software every 5 min furthermore the permeate and the fs were sampled every 24 h to determine the changes in the rejection rate and rsf after the 6 day pretreatment of the ds the pa vro process was operated using real secondary treatment wastewater and the rejection rates of pfoa pfos and pss were determined 2 2 draw solution and feed solution poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss was used as the ds because pa vro requires the ds with a large molecular size this specific requirement arises from the use of low pressure membranes among numerous available polymers pss was chosen as it possess relatively high solubility in water and has been proven to be an effective ds in the fo process tian et al 2015 based on previous studies on polymers high concentrations were not found to be linearly correlate with fo performance gwak et al 2015 in other words using a high concentration does not necessarily generate a higher flux therefore relatively low concentrations were chosen namely 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l it is worth noting that the concentrations are not expressed in terms of their molar concentration this is because the molecular weight of the polymer is expressed as the mean molecular weight as polymers do not exhibit a uniform configuration during their production meira and oliva 2011 for the fs the real secondary wastewater from npstw was used without any further treatment it is worth noting that due to the limitations in the detection range of the analytical equipment the concentrations of pfos and pfoa in the ww were both significantly increased to 2 μg l 2 3 statistical analyses the water flux in all the processes was determined using eq 4 where jw is the water flux lmh dv is the amount of the permeate that corresponds to the volume change in the ds l dt is the change in time or the operation time h and a is the effective membrane area m2 4 j w d v a d t the concentration of pss was measured with toc l shimadzu japan and the measured values were used in calculating the rsf values as well as the rejection rate for the stand alone processes the rsf was calculated using eq 5 5 j s d c t v t a d t where js is the rsf gmh and d ctvt is the difference in the product of solute concentration ct g l and the feed volume vt l at time t h the concentrations of pfos and pfoa were determined by employing the agilent 1290 infinity liquid chromatography agilent technologies usa which was coupled with a triple quad 5500 mass spectrometer ab sciex usa the rejection was calculated based on the toc measurements for pss liquid chromatography and mass spectrometer measurements for pfoa and pfos this was achieved by employing eq 6 where r is the rejection cp is the concentration of the permeate g l and cf g l is the concentration of the feed solution 6 r 1 c p c f 100 because the pa vro process was conducted continuously for 6 d with a sampling period of 1 day to achieve the removal of pss having a small mw the concentration of the ds varied each day therefore the following four equations were used to calculate the concentration of ds amount of pss in the permeate and fs at the start of each day 7 d t d t 1 p t f t 8 c d t d t v d t 9 p t c p t v p t 10 f t c f t v f t where dt pt and ft are the amount of draw solute in the ds permeate and fs at time t respectively cdt cpt and cft are the concentration of the ds permeate and fs at time t respectively further vdt vpt and vft are the amounts of solute in the ds permeate and fs respectively through these calculations the concentration of pss at the preliminary stage of the treatment process was more precisely and accurately determined herein the real secondary wastewater sww was used as the fs 3 results 3 1 stand alone processes fo and uf before designing the pa vro cell stand alone processes were investigated the fo process was completed using poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss and deionized di water as the ds and fs respectively the initial water fluxes and the rsf at five different concentrations are shown in fig 2 a accompanied by the increasing ds concentration 10 to 50 g l the flux values were also observed to rise from 3 2 to 6 6 lmh and this was a result of the increased osmotic pressure however the flux was not directly proportional to the concentration and it was observed that between the concentration of 40 and 50 g l 0 4 lmh the increase in the flux value was lower as compared to that between 10 and 20 g l 1 2 lmh this is due to the formation of the concentration polarization cp layer which is in agreement with previous studies which reported that higher viscosities tend to induce significant cp in the membrane processes wei et al 2015 additionally polymers tend to exhibit high viscosities owing to their large molecular sizes which increase exponentially with the rise in the concentrations for all the polymers colby1 et al 1987 therefore high viscosity leads to significant cp which hinders the performance of the process in addition to cp the boundary layer in proximity to the surface of the membrane also influences the performance of the process a boundary layer is a layer near the membrane surface wherein the flow velocity is relatively slower than the bulk solution this slower flow velocity is adjacent to the membrane surface and causes the intensification of cp which in turn reduces the flux further a more in depth explanation regarding the relationships between the cp molecular size viscosity and the boundary layer is outside the scope of this study and is well discussed elsewhere choi et al 2019a 2019b similar to flux rsf was observed to increase from 3 2 gmh to 3 9 gmh at 10 g l and 50 g l respectively however the increments and the differences in these increments were less apparent further incremental changes were found to be greater for the flux values that were between each of the five ds concentrations although both flux and rsf were observed to increase the mechanisms of each phenomenon are different because flux is driven by osmosis while rsf is driven by diffusion therefore because of the large molecular size of pss diffusion through the membrane could not occur as readily as osmosis following the single fo process a single ultrafiltration uf experiment was carried out using a pss solution at the same concentrations that were used in the previous fo experiment the corresponding flux and rejection values are shown in fig 2 b as depicted in fig 2 b the flux at 10 g l was 57 0 lmh but decreased to 22 9 lmh when the concentration was increased to 50 g l similar results were observed for the single fo experiment with the flux and the ds concentrations not showing a linear relationship and the decrement in the flux between 40 and 50 g l 12 7 lmh was less than that between 10 and 20 g l 6 9 lmh this non linear correlation can be ascribed to the effects of the size of the molecule viscosity and the cp layer on the membrane surface in addition the uf process was carried out in a dead end mode wherein the flow of the solution was imparted by a spinning magnetic bar further the lack of flow near the membrane surface was observed and this combined with the pressure led to an intensification of the cp this phenomenon was due to the higher concentration near the membrane surface as compared to that of the bulk solution as a higher concentration requires a higher pressure to maintain the same amount of flux this high concentration layer decreases the flux similar to the flux the rejection rate also decreased non linearly from 96 5 to 82 4 at 10 g l and 50 g l respectively due to a larger decrement observed between 10 and 20 g l 5 3 then at 40 and 50 g l 1 5 the rejection rate for pss 70 000 da should be 100 in theory for this study because the molecular weight cut off mwco of the uf membrane used in this study is 1000 da and the primary rejection mechanism employed by uf is size exclusion this low rejection is attributable to the inconsistencies in polymer sizes with an increase in the molecular size greater variations were observed with respect to the size and it is impossible to precisely control the polymerization physical thermal and mechanical properties of polymers a1 1 physical properties 2015 moreover it should be noted that the mw of a polymer given by the manufacturer represents the mean mw implying that a portion of the molecules will be small enough to pass through the membrane pores although the rejection is significantly influenced by the molecular weight mw of the solutes the non linear trend is the result of the dead end operation mode which is known to cause a more severe fouling ambrosi et al n d nagy 2019 as the higher concentration corresponds to a greater number of smaller molecules within the solution consequently the rejection decreases with the increasing concentration which is in good agreement with the previous studies on uf jiang et al 2018 the decrement between each concentration also decreases which results from the cake enhanced cp cecp layer near the membrane surface further cecp build up occurs when the retained molecules pile up on the membrane surface rice et al 2009 winter et al 2017 this cake layer of larger molecules results in a decreased unimpeded space for the smaller molecules to pass through and hence smaller decrements are observed to occur between increasing concentrations 3 2 optimization of pa vro cell and its performance previous studies have shown that with pss as the ds water flux can range between 0 05 to 0 12 lmh for the fo part and 0 17 to 0 19 lmh for the lpm part of the vro process choi et al 2019a 2019b on the other hand rsf was found to be relatively high between 0 0059 to 0 0145 mmol h 1 which is equivalent to 68 5 and 167 gmh compared to stand alone or other hybrid processes rsf was significantly higher whereas the flux was significantly lower this pattern was observed even though the pressure inside the vro cell had a substantial impact on both the rsf and the flux an increased pressure inside the cell impedes the osmotic pressure which ultimately causes the value of the pressure gradient across the membrane to drop to zero although there was little to no flux the rsf increased considerably due to the pressure acting toward the fs this pressure led to the stretching of the membrane the parts of the membrane that are not in contact with the spacer get stretched as seen in fig 3 the stretched membranes tend to have bigger pore sizes resulting in a high rsf despite the large molecular size of the polymer therefore the cell was designed to have an excessive uf membrane area in order to prevent the unnecessary buildup of pressure consequently the water moving from the fs to the ds could be readily removed from the ds as permeate because a larger membrane area results in a greater permeate volume thus the membrane areas for both fo and uf were determined based upon the data obtained from the stand alone experiments at a concentration of 50 g l where the flux was biased toward the fo process as mentioned herein the pressure inside the cell acts against the osmotic pressure which significantly decreases the net pressure in the fo part of the process to counteract this effect pressure was applied to the fs channel to match the pressure inside the cell and this allowed the osmotic pressure to function as the sole driving pressure for the fo part of the process as previously discussed a trade off exists between the fo and uf processes because an increasing concentration results in a better performance in the fo process but is detrimental to the uf performance accordingly a concentration that is not biased toward one process should be used for achieving optimal results for ds with higher concentrations the osmotic pressure required to draw the water into the cell would be high and the minimum pressure required for water permeation in the uf part of the process would also be high while both these values would consequently be low for a lower concentration of the ds thus in this study a concentration of 30 g l was used because the flux increment in the fo between 20 and 30 g l 1 0 lmh was larger than that between 30 and 40 g l 0 9 lmh nonetheless 30 g l was employed as the cell was designed to provide an excessive uf membrane area achieving the concentration that is relatively more favorable to the fo part of the process without affecting the end results 3 3 removal of small mw pss through pre treatment results of the pa vro process with a ds comprising 30 g l of pss are shown in fig 4 over the course of 6 d the flux decreased from 5 0 to 3 4 lmh for fo and 4 7 to 2 7 lmh for the uf part of the process although the decrement in flux was non linear it was observed to stabilize after 4 d and the flux decrement in both fo and uf was 0 1 lmh flux stabilization occurs due to the removal of smaller molecules within the solution as the larger molecules remaining in the ds cannot penetrate the membrane it is worth noting that the flux values of fo and uf did not match due to the different membrane sizes as noted earlier in this section the molecules in polymers can vary significantly in terms of size as time progresses the number of molecules with permeable sizes decreases which in turn leads to a reduction in the concentration of the ds consequentially the overall flux is decreased as the decreased ds concentration results in a reduced water permeation in the fo part and thus with less water moving into the cell less water is available for permeation in the uf part the flux in the fo and uf part with di as the feed can be calculated using the following equations 1 f 5 34 e 0 45 t 2 80 e 4 56 10 12 t 2 f 2 26 e 2 73 10 12 t 4 49 e 5 07 t where f is flux lmh and t is time d respectively eq 1 represents the fo part and eq 2 represents the uf part plotted flux values with the corresponding equation for the fo and uf part are depicted in fig 5 a and b at the same time the rejection rate increased from 94 8 to 98 8 after 6 d of operation it should be noted that instead of comparing the permeate concentration with the initial ds concentration the concentration at the start of each day was calculated and was used to determine the rejection rate for that day of operation this increase in the rejection rate can be attributed to the decrease in the overall ds concentration and the reduced number of smaller pss molecules within the ds furthermore the increase in rejection is not linear but logarithmic as depicted in figs 4 and 6 this is in agreement with the previously observed low rejection of 86 4 from the single uf process at the concentration of 30 g l however despite identical preliminary concentrations the rejection rate in the pa vro process was 8 4 higher than that from the single uf the difference in the rejection rate can also be explained using the equation of the rejection trend line 3 r 2 65 ln t 94 07 where r is rejection and t is time d plotted equation with the rejection rates can be found in fig 6 by substituting the sampling time for the single uf at 30 g l which was approximately 15 min a rejection rate of 85 6 was achieved and this value is comparable to the result shown in fig 2 unlike other parameters such as the fo flux uf flux and rejection rate rsf was rather stable exhibiting a range of values between 0 46 and 0 63 gmh which was significantly lower than the rsf in the previous studies the increase in the rejection can also be observed from the changes in the permeate color fig 7 depicts the color change of the permeate from 1 to 6 d it can be seen that the permeate from day 1 possessed a lighter color than that of the draw solution at the start however the color was observed to fade and have disappeared by day 5 this result also demonstrates that the pretreatment process is necessary as the rejection increases and the flux stabilizes over time to ensure a high quality permeate 3 4 treatment of real ww in pavro pfoa pfos rejection following the 6 day pa vro operation for the removal of small pss molecules real secondary ww sww containing pfoa and pfos was used as the fs with an aim to examine the performance of the pa vro system in treating real wastewater especially for treating pfoa pfos the results of pa vro for treating sww are depicted in fig 8 day 7 ww 1 and day 8 ww 2 denote the 7th and 8th day of operation which are also the 1st and 2nd day of pa vro using the real wastewater respectively as shown in fig 8 the flux for the fo and uf parts of the process were between 2 and 3 lmh respectively unlike the first 6 d the flux was constant over the last 48 h which was also attributable to the removal of smaller pss molecules as can be expected from the trendline shown in fig 6 the rejection of the pss increased from 99 0 on day 7 at 24 h to 99 3 on day 8 at 48 h both flux and rejection values shown in fig 8 are in complete agreement with the values shown in figs 4 and 6 furthermore the rejection rates of pfoa pfos were maintained well over 90 with the rejection rates of pfoa and pfos being 98 0 and 98 6 for day 7 and 98 2 and 98 7 for day 8 respectively while the rejection was not 100 in the permeate there were no detectable amounts of pfoa pfos in the ds which was sampled after completing the 8 day operation this suggests that the rejection of pfoa pfos by the fo membrane is approximately 100 and the detected concentration of pfoa and pfos may have been from the residual contaminants of the lab equipment such as the tubes fittings and parafilm 4 discussion in this study the pa vro process was optimized and its applicability for potable water production from real wastewater was tested and herein the emphasis was on the removal of pfoa and pfos the performance of pa vro was significantly improved in terms of the flux and the rejection rate and this was achieved with the aid of an inlet pressure of less than 1 bar in the fs in addition the low rejection of pss with the uf membrane was considerably enhanced through the 6 day pretreatment in the pa vro process further it was found that the relationship between the sampling time and the rejection of pss with an uf membrane is logarithmic and therefore a longer pretreatment time will facilitate a higher rejection rate for pss after the pretreatment the real secondary wastewater from npstw was used as the fs for a 2 day operation for the two days the flux remained consistently between 2 and 3 lmh for both the fo and uf parts of the process nonetheless the rejection rate of pss was improved over the 48 hour period from 99 0 to 99 3 moreover the rejection rates of pfos and pfoa during the 2 day treatment were also measured and observed to be 97 8 and 92 8 for day 1 and 94 3 and 98 8 for day 2 respectively although there were trace amounts of pfoa and pfos detected after the treatment it should be noted that there was no detectable amount of pfoa and pfos in the ds after the 2 day operation this result suggests the detected pfoa and pfos could be residual contaminants from the equipment used the high rejection of pfoa and pfos results from the electrostatic interaction adsorption and size exclusion as found in the study conducted by wang et al the pfass are negatively charged which results in electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged tfc pa fo membrane and the pfass wang et al 2018 the study also determined that the electrostatic repulsion is stronger at lower ionic strength the secondary wastewater effluent has relatively low ionic strength 420 mg l in hong kong which would have resulted in a further increased rejection efficiency chan 2018 in addition the molecular size of pfoa and pfos are around 1 20 and 1 32 nm which are much greater than 0 30 nm the average pore size distribution of the fo membrane chen et al 2017 fang et al 2014 this size difference prevents the pfass from passing through the membrane increasing the rejection at the fo part of the process based on these findings it can be concluded that pa vro can be applied to wastewater treatment for potable water production especially for the removal of pfos and pfoa however whether it can be applied in real world scenarios depends solely on the policies of each country and the perception of the citizens most countries do not allow wastewater reclamation for potable use moreover more studies should be conducted for other polymer based ds for pa vro and the resulting research can be used to verify that the logarithmic trend applies for all polymers this will facilitate the precise prediction of polymer rejection which is also important for ensuring that an effective pollutant removal is achieved furthermore if the logarithmic equation or formula based on the mw of each polymer can be found the selection of the ds will be simplified rendering the pa vro process more facile and applicable 5 conclusion in this study a proof of concept dual barrier one step process which does not require further treatment for regeneration of the ds was developed and optimized this developed process called pa vro process utilizes the naturally occurring pressure with the aid of a small inlet pressure 1 bar from the single fo and uf tests it was determined that pss concentration of 30 g l was the most suitable concentration to be used in the pa vro system in addition flux values of both fo and uf part of the pa vro process had negative logarithmic trend on the contrary the rejection efficiency of pss in pa vro had positive logarithmic trend and 6 day pre treatment period was deemed necessary this is attributed to the uneven size of polymer after 6 day pre treatment real wastewater was employed as the feed solution for 48 h to test the feasibility of pa vro in removing the pfoa and pfos within the wastewater observation showed that the rejection of pfoa pfos and pss were over 98 after 24 h and 99 after 48 h respectively additionally there was no traceable amount of pfoa or pfos in the ds after the completion of 48 h operation which means that the concentration of pfoa and pfos found in the permeate is attributed to the residuals from the equipment therefore pa vro process can be utilized for potable water production from treated wastewater and with more studies carried out to explore possible ds that can be used in the pa vro process pa vro

17144,forward osmosis is an energy efficient process that is capable of recovering high quality water from secondary wastewater treatment however regeneration of the draw solution ds is a problem that needs to be addressed herein we developed and optimized a one step process that does not require additional treatment for the ds this process called pressure assisted volume retarded osmosis pa vro utilizes naturally occurring pressure with the aid of a small inlet pressure 1 bar poly styrenesulfonate was employed as the ds for its high solubility in water and large molecular size 70 000 da accordingly real wastewater was employed as the feed solution for 48 h to remove perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos through pa vro the rejection rates for pfoa pfos and poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss were observed to exceed 98 after 24 h and 99 after 48 h moreover there were no traceable amounts of pfoa pfos in the ds and hence the detected concentrations of pfoa and pfos can be attributed to the residuals from the equipment therefore this well optimized pa vro process can be utilized for potable water production from treated wastewater graphical abstract image

economical process and it has garnered significant interest over the past two decades fo is a process that uses the concentration difference between two solutions which are separated by a semi permeable membrane these two solutions are referred to as the feed solution fs and the draw solution ds the concentration difference between the two solutions produces an osmotic pressure gradient toward the ds which has a higher concentration distinct from other membrane processes the osmotic pressure gradient is the main driving force in fo and this renders fo to be more advantageous because it does not necessitate hydraulic pressure or heat garcia castello et al 2009 although the use of ds is a unique characteristic of fo and provides a significant advantage to the process the regeneration of ds remains a challenge alejo et al 2017 this has led to the research on the direct use of the ds and also on different hybrid processes to achieve the regeneration of the ds salcedo diaz et al 2014 xie et al 2013 volume retarded osmosis vro is one of the promising processes in terms of energy consumption because no pressure is required in the vro process choi et al 2019a 2019b im et al 2018 2017a vro is a process that uses naturally occurring pressure inside a closed cell as the driving force for the ds regeneration choi et al 2019a in vro two processes are combined together for developing a one cell system and these processes are fo and the low pressure membrane lpm process choi et al 2019b vro was first developed in 2017 im et al 2017 thus more studies are required to better understand and optimize the process because the vro process uses naturally developed pressure it only requires a single circulation pump to achieve feed circulation in the fo part of the process this allows the vro process to consume less energy as compared to the conventional processes and other hybrid fo processes choi et al 2019a 2019b im et al 2018 2017a therefore using a vro process can reduce energy consumption while achieving the simultaneous rejection of pollutants that are not removable by low pressure membranes due to the difference in pore sizes despite the numerous advantages of vro results from previous studies have demonstrated that the flux obtained is relatively low and further the reverse solute flux rsf through the fo membrane is much higher than it would be in a single fo process this can be significantly improved by using a minimal hydraulic pressure on the feed side of the membrane and this is aimed at matching the pressure inside the cell to render the net physical pressure to be zero therefore in this study the pressure inside the cell was measured which was a crucial factor that hindered the overall flux and rsf and further pressure was applied on the feed side correspondingly it is worth noting that the membrane area was not completely optimized the effective membrane areas used for the fo and lpm processes from a previous study were 70 and 32 cm2 respectively choi et al 2019b and this led to a higher permeation rate into the ds tank further this caused the pressure inside the cell to further increase which is a factor that has not been considered in previous studies therefore in this study we applied a small inlet pressure that was equal to the pressure inside the cell to the feed side of the vro process and this was aimed at sustaining the concentration inside the tank thereby minimizing the rsf and maximizing the permeate flux this pressure assisted pa vro process was also tested for its ability to permeate and reject pfass from real secondary wastewater the aims of this study are threefold namely 1 the optimization of the pa vro system for low pressure water production systems 2 determination of the applicability of pa vro processes for potable water production from real wastewater generated by the ngong ping sewage treatment works npstw and 3 determination of the ability of the pa vro process to remove pfass from real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design prior to cell customization stand alone fo and uf processes were carried out to determine the optimal membrane sizes the schematic diagrams for each of these processes can be found in fig 1 a and b respectively as shown in fig 6 a the single fo process comprised an fs tank a ds tank two gear pumps for the circulation of the fs and ds cole parmer il us a customized cross flow fo cell a balance to measure the weight change of the ds ohaus nj us and a computer for automatic logging of the variations in weight in the ds the dimension of the customized cell was 7 7 cm x 2 6 cm x 0 3 cm and the flow rates for both ds and fs were maintained at 250 ml min thin film composite polyamide tfc pa membranes were used which comprised an effective membrane area of 20 02 cm2 the process was conducted in the active layer facing feed solution al fs mode with initial volumes of 500 ml for both fs and ds the configuration of the set up for the single uf process can be seen in fig 1 b it consisted of a customized dead end uf cell digital pressure meter asmik hangzhou china nitrogen gas tank scale magnetic stirrer ika staufen germany and computer the pressure was monitored through a digital pressure meter and the pressure inside the cell was maintained at 3 0 bar through the injection of nitrogen gas it is worth noting that the dead end uf process was employed for a better representation of the uf part as it occurs in the pa vro process and further there was no flow of ds the effective membrane area of the uf membrane was 12 56 cm2 with a diameter of 4 cm the initial volume of the fs was 200 ml and weight changes in the permeate were measured using a digital balance every 5 s until the total permeate reached a volume of 10 ml using the flux data obtained from the single fo and uf experiments the effective membrane areas for the fo and uf part of the pa vro process were then determined the effective membrane areas determined for the fo and uf membrane were 10 and 12 56 cm2 respectively a smaller membrane area was employed for the fo membrane to prevent the unnecessary build up of pressure inside the ds chamber moreover minimizing the pressure inside the cell is crucial because an enhanced pressure inside the cell would require a higher feed inlet pressure this can be achieved using a relatively larger uf membrane area which would facilitate a larger volume of water thereby minimizing the pressure the graphical representation of the pa vro set up is depicted in fig 1 c and consists of an fs tank a permeate tank a circulation pump a magnetic stirrer the customized pa vro cell pressure meters and valves a valve was used to control the inlet pressure and pressure meters were used to measure the cell pressure as well as the inlet pressure of the fs the inlet pressure of the fs was set to match the pressure inside the cell which ensured that the net physical pressure was 0 this not only minimizes rsf but also allows the ds tank to exhibit a higher working pressure for the uf part of the process by sustaining the solute concentration as shown in fig 1 c fo and uf membranes are placed on the opposite side of the cell in order to prevent the damage to the uf cell from the pressure a porous disk like spacer was placed against the support layer of the membrane prior to the operation of the pa vro process for treating pfos pfoa in real secondary wastewater the system was operated for six consecutive days to remove pss in the lower mw range the water flux during this process was monitored and recorded using automatic logging software every 5 min furthermore the permeate and the fs were sampled every 24 h to determine the changes in the rejection rate and rsf after the 6 day pretreatment of the ds the pa vro process was operated using real secondary treatment wastewater and the rejection rates of pfoa pfos and pss were determined 2 2 draw solution and feed solution poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss was used as the ds because pa vro requires the ds with a large molecular size this specific requirement arises from the use of low pressure membranes among numerous available polymers pss was chosen as it possess relatively high solubility in water and has been proven to be an effective ds in the fo process tian et al 2015 based on previous studies on polymers high concentrations were not found to be linearly correlate with fo performance gwak et al 2015 in other words using a high concentration does not necessarily generate a higher flux therefore relatively low concentrations were chosen namely 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l it is worth noting that the concentrations are not expressed in terms of their molar concentration this is because the molecular weight of the polymer is expressed as the mean molecular weight as polymers do not exhibit a uniform configuration during their production meira and oliva 2011 for the fs the real secondary wastewater from npstw was used without any further treatment it is worth noting that due to the limitations in the detection range of the analytical equipment the concentrations of pfos and pfoa in the ww were both significantly increased to 2 μg l 2 3 statistical analyses the water flux in all the processes was determined using eq 4 where jw is the water flux lmh dv is the amount of the permeate that corresponds to the volume change in the ds l dt is the change in time or the operation time h and a is the effective membrane area m2 4 j w d v a d t the concentration of pss was measured with toc l shimadzu japan and the measured values were used in calculating the rsf values as well as the rejection rate for the stand alone processes the rsf was calculated using eq 5 5 j s d c t v t a d t where js is the rsf gmh and d ctvt is the difference in the product of solute concentration ct g l and the feed volume vt l at time t h the concentrations of pfos and pfoa were determined by employing the agilent 1290 infinity liquid chromatography agilent technologies usa which was coupled with a triple quad 5500 mass spectrometer ab sciex usa the rejection was calculated based on the toc measurements for pss liquid chromatography and mass spectrometer measurements for pfoa and pfos this was achieved by employing eq 6 where r is the rejection cp is the concentration of the permeate g l and cf g l is the concentration of the feed solution 6 r 1 c p c f 100 because the pa vro process was conducted continuously for 6 d with a sampling period of 1 day to achieve the removal of pss having a small mw the concentration of the ds varied each day therefore the following four equations were used to calculate the concentration of ds amount of pss in the permeate and fs at the start of each day 7 d t d t 1 p t f t 8 c d t d t v d t 9 p t c p t v p t 10 f t c f t v f t where dt pt and ft are the amount of draw solute in the ds permeate and fs at time t respectively cdt cpt and cft are the concentration of the ds permeate and fs at time t respectively further vdt vpt and vft are the amounts of solute in the ds permeate and fs respectively through these calculations the concentration of pss at the preliminary stage of the treatment process was more precisely and accurately determined herein the real secondary wastewater sww was used as the fs 3 results 3 1 stand alone processes fo and uf before designing the pa vro cell stand alone processes were investigated the fo process was completed using poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss and deionized di water as the ds and fs respectively the initial water fluxes and the rsf at five different concentrations are shown in fig 2 a accompanied by the increasing ds concentration 10 to 50 g l the flux values were also observed to rise from 3 2 to 6 6 lmh and this was a result of the increased osmotic pressure however the flux was not directly proportional to the concentration and it was observed that between the concentration of 40 and 50 g l 0 4 lmh the increase in the flux value was lower as compared to that between 10 and 20 g l 1 2 lmh this is due to the formation of the concentration polarization cp layer which is in agreement with previous studies which reported that higher viscosities tend to induce significant cp in the membrane processes wei et al 2015 additionally polymers tend to exhibit high viscosities owing to their large molecular sizes which increase exponentially with the rise in the concentrations for all the polymers colby1 et al 1987 therefore high viscosity leads to significant cp which hinders the performance of the process in addition to cp the boundary layer in proximity to the surface of the membrane also influences the performance of the process a boundary layer is a layer near the membrane surface wherein the flow velocity is relatively slower than the bulk solution this slower flow velocity is adjacent to the membrane surface and causes the intensification of cp which in turn reduces the flux further a more in depth explanation regarding the relationships between the cp molecular size viscosity and the boundary layer is outside the scope of this study and is well discussed elsewhere choi et al 2019a 2019b similar to flux rsf was observed to increase from 3 2 gmh to 3 9 gmh at 10 g l and 50 g l respectively however the increments and the differences in these increments were less apparent further incremental changes were found to be greater for the flux values that were between each of the five ds concentrations although both flux and rsf were observed to increase the mechanisms of each phenomenon are different because flux is driven by osmosis while rsf is driven by diffusion therefore because of the large molecular size of pss diffusion through the membrane could not occur as readily as osmosis following the single fo process a single ultrafiltration uf experiment was carried out using a pss solution at the same concentrations that were used in the previous fo experiment the corresponding flux and rejection values are shown in fig 2 b as depicted in fig 2 b the flux at 10 g l was 57 0 lmh but decreased to 22 9 lmh when the concentration was increased to 50 g l similar results were observed for the single fo experiment with the flux and the ds concentrations not showing a linear relationship and the decrement in the flux between 40 and 50 g l 12 7 lmh was less than that between 10 and 20 g l 6 9 lmh this non linear correlation can be ascribed to the effects of the size of the molecule viscosity and the cp layer on the membrane surface in addition the uf process was carried out in a dead end mode wherein the flow of the solution was imparted by a spinning magnetic bar further the lack of flow near the membrane surface was observed and this combined with the pressure led to an intensification of the cp this phenomenon was due to the higher concentration near the membrane surface as compared to that of the bulk solution as a higher concentration requires a higher pressure to maintain the same amount of flux this high concentration layer decreases the flux similar to the flux the rejection rate also decreased non linearly from 96 5 to 82 4 at 10 g l and 50 g l respectively due to a larger decrement observed between 10 and 20 g l 5 3 then at 40 and 50 g l 1 5 the rejection rate for pss 70 000 da should be 100 in theory for this study because the molecular weight cut off mwco of the uf membrane used in this study is 1000 da and the primary rejection mechanism employed by uf is size exclusion this low rejection is attributable to the inconsistencies in polymer sizes with an increase in the molecular size greater variations were observed with respect to the size and it is impossible to precisely control the polymerization physical thermal and mechanical properties of polymers a1 1 physical properties 2015 moreover it should be noted that the mw of a polymer given by the manufacturer represents the mean mw implying that a portion of the molecules will be small enough to pass through the membrane pores although the rejection is significantly influenced by the molecular weight mw of the solutes the non linear trend is the result of the dead end operation mode which is known to cause a more severe fouling ambrosi et al n d nagy 2019 as the higher concentration corresponds to a greater number of smaller molecules within the solution consequently the rejection decreases with the increasing concentration which is in good agreement with the previous studies on uf jiang et al 2018 the decrement between each concentration also decreases which results from the cake enhanced cp cecp layer near the membrane surface further cecp build up occurs when the retained molecules pile up on the membrane surface rice et al 2009 winter et al 2017 this cake layer of larger molecules results in a decreased unimpeded space for the smaller molecules to pass through and hence smaller decrements are observed to occur between increasing concentrations 3 2 optimization of pa vro cell and its performance previous studies have shown that with pss as the ds water flux can range between 0 05 to 0 12 lmh for the fo part and 0 17 to 0 19 lmh for the lpm part of the vro process choi et al 2019a 2019b on the other hand rsf was found to be relatively high between 0 0059 to 0 0145 mmol h 1 which is equivalent to 68 5 and 167 gmh compared to stand alone or other hybrid processes rsf was significantly higher whereas the flux was significantly lower this pattern was observed even though the pressure inside the vro cell had a substantial impact on both the rsf and the flux an increased pressure inside the cell impedes the osmotic pressure which ultimately causes the value of the pressure gradient across the membrane to drop to zero although there was little to no flux the rsf increased considerably due to the pressure acting toward the fs this pressure led to the stretching of the membrane the parts of the membrane that are not in contact with the spacer get stretched as seen in fig 3 the stretched membranes tend to have bigger pore sizes resulting in a high rsf despite the large molecular size of the polymer therefore the cell was designed to have an excessive uf membrane area in order to prevent the unnecessary buildup of pressure consequently the water moving from the fs to the ds could be readily removed from the ds as permeate because a larger membrane area results in a greater permeate volume thus the membrane areas for both fo and uf were determined based upon the data obtained from the stand alone experiments at a concentration of 50 g l where the flux was biased toward the fo process as mentioned herein the pressure inside the cell acts against the osmotic pressure which significantly decreases the net pressure in the fo part of the process to counteract this effect pressure was applied to the fs channel to match the pressure inside the cell and this allowed the osmotic pressure to function as the sole driving pressure for the fo part of the process as previously discussed a trade off exists between the fo and uf processes because an increasing concentration results in a better performance in the fo process but is detrimental to the uf performance accordingly a concentration that is not biased toward one process should be used for achieving optimal results for ds with higher concentrations the osmotic pressure required to draw the water into the cell would be high and the minimum pressure required for water permeation in the uf part of the process would also be high while both these values would consequently be low for a lower concentration of the ds thus in this study a concentration of 30 g l was used because the flux increment in the fo between 20 and 30 g l 1 0 lmh was larger than that between 30 and 40 g l 0 9 lmh nonetheless 30 g l was employed as the cell was designed to provide an excessive uf membrane area achieving the concentration that is relatively more favorable to the fo part of the process without affecting the end results 3 3 removal of small mw pss through pre treatment results of the pa vro process with a ds comprising 30 g l of pss are shown in fig 4 over the course of 6 d the flux decreased from 5 0 to 3 4 lmh for fo and 4 7 to 2 7 lmh for the uf part of the process although the decrement in flux was non linear it was observed to stabilize after 4 d and the flux decrement in both fo and uf was 0 1 lmh flux stabilization occurs due to the removal of smaller molecules within the solution as the larger molecules remaining in the ds cannot penetrate the membrane it is worth noting that the flux values of fo and uf did not match due to the different membrane sizes as noted earlier in this section the molecules in polymers can vary significantly in terms of size as time progresses the number of molecules with permeable sizes decreases which in turn leads to a reduction in the concentration of the ds consequentially the overall flux is decreased as the decreased ds concentration results in a reduced water permeation in the fo part and thus with less water moving into the cell less water is available for permeation in the uf part the flux in the fo and uf part with di as the feed can be calculated using the following equations 1 f 5 34 e 0 45 t 2 80 e 4 56 10 12 t 2 f 2 26 e 2 73 10 12 t 4 49 e 5 07 t where f is flux lmh and t is time d respectively eq 1 represents the fo part and eq 2 represents the uf part plotted flux values with the corresponding equation for the fo and uf part are depicted in fig 5 a and b at the same time the rejection rate increased from 94 8 to 98 8 after 6 d of operation it should be noted that instead of comparing the permeate concentration with the initial ds concentration the concentration at the start of each day was calculated and was used to determine the rejection rate for that day of operation this increase in the rejection rate can be attributed to the decrease in the overall ds concentration and the reduced number of smaller pss molecules within the ds furthermore the increase in rejection is not linear but logarithmic as depicted in figs 4 and 6 this is in agreement with the previously observed low rejection of 86 4 from the single uf process at the concentration of 30 g l however despite identical preliminary concentrations the rejection rate in the pa vro process was 8 4 higher than that from the single uf the difference in the rejection rate can also be explained using the equation of the rejection trend line 3 r 2 65 ln t 94 07 where r is rejection and t is time d plotted equation with the rejection rates can be found in fig 6 by substituting the sampling time for the single uf at 30 g l which was approximately 15 min a rejection rate of 85 6 was achieved and this value is comparable to the result shown in fig 2 unlike other parameters such as the fo flux uf flux and rejection rate rsf was rather stable exhibiting a range of values between 0 46 and 0 63 gmh which was significantly lower than the rsf in the previous studies the increase in the rejection can also be observed from the changes in the permeate color fig 7 depicts the color change of the permeate from 1 to 6 d it can be seen that the permeate from day 1 possessed a lighter color than that of the draw solution at the start however the color was observed to fade and have disappeared by day 5 this result also demonstrates that the pretreatment process is necessary as the rejection increases and the flux stabilizes over time to ensure a high quality permeate 3 4 treatment of real ww in pavro pfoa pfos rejection following the 6 day pa vro operation for the removal of small pss molecules real secondary ww sww containing pfoa and pfos was used as the fs with an aim to examine the performance of the pa vro system in treating real wastewater especially for treating pfoa pfos the results of pa vro for treating sww are depicted in fig 8 day 7 ww 1 and day 8 ww 2 denote the 7th and 8th day of operation which are also the 1st and 2nd day of pa vro using the real wastewater respectively as shown in fig 8 the flux for the fo and uf parts of the process were between 2 and 3 lmh respectively unlike the first 6 d the flux was constant over the last 48 h which was also attributable to the removal of smaller pss molecules as can be expected from the trendline shown in fig 6 the rejection of the pss increased from 99 0 on day 7 at 24 h to 99 3 on day 8 at 48 h both flux and rejection values shown in fig 8 are in complete agreement with the values shown in figs 4 and 6 furthermore the rejection rates of pfoa pfos were maintained well over 90 with the rejection rates of pfoa and pfos being 98 0 and 98 6 for day 7 and 98 2 and 98 7 for day 8 respectively while the rejection was not 100 in the permeate there were no detectable amounts of pfoa pfos in the ds which was sampled after completing the 8 day operation this suggests that the rejection of pfoa pfos by the fo membrane is approximately 100 and the detected concentration of pfoa and pfos may have been from the residual contaminants of the lab equipment such as the tubes fittings and parafilm 4 discussion in this study the pa vro process was optimized and its applicability for potable water production from real wastewater was tested and herein the emphasis was on the removal of pfoa and pfos the performance of pa vro was significantly improved in terms of the flux and the rejection rate and this was achieved with the aid of an inlet pressure of less than 1 bar in the fs in addition the low rejection of pss with the uf membrane was considerably enhanced through the 6 day pretreatment in the pa vro process further it was found that the relationship between the sampling time and the rejection of pss with an uf membrane is logarithmic and therefore a longer pretreatment time will facilitate a higher rejection rate for pss after the pretreatment the real secondary wastewater from npstw was used as the fs for a 2 day operation for the two days the flux remained consistently between 2 and 3 lmh for both the fo and uf parts of the process nonetheless the rejection rate of pss was improved over the 48 hour period from 99 0 to 99 3 moreover the rejection rates of pfos and pfoa during the 2 day treatment were also measured and observed to be 97 8 and 92 8 for day 1 and 94 3 and 98 8 for day 2 respectively although there were trace amounts of pfoa and pfos detected after the treatment it should be noted that there was no detectable amount of pfoa and pfos in the ds after the 2 day operation this result suggests the detected pfoa and pfos could be residual contaminants from the equipment used the high rejection of pfoa and pfos results from the electrostatic interaction adsorption and size exclusion as found in the study conducted by wang et al the pfass are negatively charged which results in electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged tfc pa fo membrane and the pfass wang et al 2018 the study also determined that the electrostatic repulsion is stronger at lower ionic strength the secondary wastewater effluent has relatively low ionic strength 420 mg l in hong kong which would have resulted in a further increased rejection efficiency chan 2018 in addition the molecular size of pfoa and pfos are around 1 20 and 1 32 nm which are much greater than 0 30 nm the average pore size distribution of the fo membrane chen et al 2017 fang et al 2014 this size difference prevents the pfass from passing through the membrane increasing the rejection at the fo part of the process based on these findings it can be concluded that pa vro can be applied to wastewater treatment for potable water production especially for the removal of pfos and pfoa however whether it can be applied in real world scenarios depends solely on the policies of each country and the perception of the citizens most countries do not allow wastewater reclamation for potable use moreover more studies should be conducted for other polymer based ds for pa vro and the resulting research can be used to verify that the logarithmic trend applies for all polymers this will facilitate the precise prediction of polymer rejection which is also important for ensuring that an effective pollutant removal is achieved furthermore if the logarithmic equation or formula based on the mw of each polymer can be found the selection of the ds will be simplified rendering the pa vro process more facile and applicable 5 conclusion in this study a proof of concept dual barrier one step process which does not require further treatment for regeneration of the ds was developed and optimized this developed process called pa vro process utilizes the naturally occurring pressure with the aid of a small inlet pressure 1 bar from the single fo and uf tests it was determined that pss concentration of 30 g l was the most suitable concentration to be used in the pa vro system in addition flux values of both fo and uf part of the pa vro process had negative logarithmic trend on the contrary the rejection efficiency of pss in pa vro had positive logarithmic trend and 6 day pre treatment period was deemed necessary this is attributed to the uneven size of polymer after 6 day pre treatment real wastewater was employed as the feed solution for 48 h to test the feasibility of pa vro in removing the pfoa and pfos within the wastewater observation showed that the rejection of pfoa pfos and pss were over 98 after 24 h and 99 after 48 h respectively additionally there was no traceable amount of pfoa or pfos in the ds after the completion of 48 h operation which means that the concentration of pfoa and pfos found in the permeate is attributed to the residuals from the equipment therefore pa vro process can be utilized for potable water production from treated wastewater and with more studies carried out to explore possible ds that can be used in the pa vro process pa vro process may have a chance to be applied in places where only low amount of electricity can be provided declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
