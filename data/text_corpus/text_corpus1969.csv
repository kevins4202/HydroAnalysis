penman monteith fao56 pm equation but it requires commonly unavailable meteorological data therefore this study assessed different approaches to estimate eto based on temperature and relative humidity and temperature only across brazil as follows i using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on fao56 methodologies ii using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on machine learning and iii estimating eto directly using machine learning the fao56 pm equation was also calibrated through linear regression and by calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data the potential benefits of using multi task learning mtl and clustering were also investigated data from 437 weather stations were used artificial neural network ann random forest rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars were employed in both general and clustering scenarios calibrating the fao56 pm equation using linear regression provided slightly better results than calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data in contrast to temperature and relative humidity based fao56 pm equation its temperature based version performed better before both calibration types assessed the machine learning models performed the best to estimate eto and missing data combining the machine learning models with the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto performed similarly to using them individually mtl and single task learning stl provided similar results in the general scenario for the temperature based models using pm ann stl increased mean nse from 0 49 to 0 53 in relation to the non calibrated fao56 pm equation for the temperature and relative humidity based models using ann and rf developed with stl or mtl increased nse from 0 56 to 0 67 in relation to the fao56 pm equation calibrated using linear regression when using the clustering strategy performance gains were obtained in estimating eto with the temperature based models increasing mean nse up to 0 58 keywords generalizability mars neural networks solar radiation wind speed 1 introduction knowing evapotranspiration et is essential in hydrological studies agricultural planning water resource management and irrigation scheduling due to the difficulty in measuring et directly it is commonly obtained based on reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc pereira et al 2015 eto can be estimated using the fao 56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation however to use this equation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed measurements are required which are not fully available in some regions among the aforementioned data air temperature is the most commonly and easily measured which justifies the study of eto models based on this variable mattar et al 2016 paredes and pereira 2019 in addition to temperature the use of relative humidity promotes a better estimation of eto at a low additional cost ferreira et al 2019 exner kittridge 2012 valiantzas 2012 2018a to estimate eto under limited meteorological data availability several empirical equations with fewer data requirements have been studied ahmadi and javanbakht 2020 awal et al 2020 cunha et al 2017 djaman et al 2019 hadria et al 2021 valiantzas 2013 in addition to alternative equations the fao56 pm equation can be used by estimating missing data using methodologies proposed in the fao56 bulletin allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 overall this approach has shown good performance in brazil and other parts of the world ferreira et al 2019 in a study carried out in brazil reported that the fao56 pm equation with missing data performed better than most of the empirical equations assessed almorox et al 2018 found better results for the fao56 pm equation using only measured data on temperature in relation to the well known hargreaves samani equation similar results were also reported by alencar et al 2015 and ren et al 2016 these results are possibly related to the physical basis of the fao56 pm equation which is partially conserved when estimating missing data however it is fair to mention that the better performance of this equation may be related to the fact that the fao56 pm equation with full data set is commonly used as reference for the assessment of eto models in addition to empirical equations several studies have employed machine learning models to estimate eto ferreira et al 2019 huang et al 2019 kisi and alizamir 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 yu et al 2020 due to their superior modeling capabilities machine learning models generally show better performances than traditional empirical equations other alternatives to address meteorological data scarcity include the use of remote sensing data de bruin et al 2016 and reanalysis data paredes et al 2018b in brazil studies using machine learning to estimate eto are generally restricted to parts of the country althoff et al 2018 ferreira et al 2021 reis et al 2019 tangune and escobedo 2018 according to our knowledge only ferreira et al 2019 used machine learning models to estimate eto based on limited meteorological data considering the entirety of brazil this study evaluated artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm reporting better results for the first model brazil has a large territorial area 8 516 million km2 with several climate types thus studies that explore all the brazilian territory are encouraged since the results tend to have high representativeness in addition according to the national water and sanitation agency of brazil national water and sanitation agency ana 2021 brazil has an irrigated area of 8 2 million hectares with a prospect of incorporating 4 2 million hectares by 2040 which reinforces the need to develop reliable eto models even under data scarcity conditions therefore the assessment of state of the art machine learning models deserves special attention an important issue for eto models is their spatial generalization which refers to the ability of a model to perform well outside its development place ferreira et al 2021 kiafar et al 2017 many studies fail to address it since they assess the models using only data of the same weather station where the models were developed to improve the generalization of machine learning models regional models have a key role in contrast to local models which are developed using data from a single weather station regional models are developed using pooled data from several stations thus they can be applied in any place of a particular region making them more useful however most studies have applied only local models in brazil only a limited number of studies have investigated the potential of regional models ferreira et al 2019 2021 reis et al 2019 zanetti et al 2019 on the other hand when developing regional models for large areas such as the whole of brazil the high climatic variability can lead to poorer performances given the presence of different patterns between input variables and eto within the same region in this context the use of clustering algorithms can guide the definition of smaller regions with homogeneous climatic conditions clusters thus specific models can be developed for each region which can contribute to achieving better results as reported by ferreira et al 2019 previous studies have been limited to using machine learning models to estimate eto directly from the available data however it is also possible to use machine learning models to estimate missing data which can be used to estimate eto with the fao56 pm equation in this case the physical basis of the fao56 pm equation could be used to improve the performance of the estimation in addition it can also make the eto estimation process clearer in relation to the estimation performed using only machine learning models another advantage is that the meteorological data estimated can be used for other purposes despite these possible benefits according to our knowledge no study has investigated this strategy another approach that could improve the performance of machine learning models for the estimation of eto is multi task learning mtl caruana 1997 ng et al 2019 nunes et al 2019 padarian et al 2019 in mtl multiple related variables are predicted simultaneously thus the information shared among tasks can improve the overall performance in relation to individual predictions single task learning stl in this sense to take advantage of the potential of mtl the eto estimation task should be reframed estimating eto and related meteorological variables such as solar radiation and relative humidity together therefore the information learned by a machine learning model to estimate the related variables could improve the estimation of eto and vice versa mtl can be used focusing on the estimation of eto or the estimation of missing data for use in the fao56 pm equation according to our knowledge no study has investigated the use of mtl to estimate eto the present study aims to assess different approaches to estimate eto based on temperature and relative humidity and temperature only across brazil as follows i using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on methodologies proposed in fao56 ii using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on machine learning models and iii estimating eto directly using machine learning models in objective i two additional strategies are evaluated independently the calibration of the methodologies proposed in fao56 to estimate missing data and the calibration of the fao56 pm equation by means of linear regression we also investigated the potential of mtl and clustering to improve the estimation of eto and missing data 2 materials and methods 2 1 database and study sites hourly data from 437 weather stations of the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet distributed across brazil were used the period from 2004 to 2018 was considered however the data length varied among stations due to their different epochs of creation with a mean length of 10 5 2 6 years data on maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were obtained hourly data were transformed to a daily scale wind speed measured at 10 m height was converted to 2 m based on recommendations of allen et al 1998 daily records with missing or faulty data were removed faulty data were identified when at least one of the following conditions was met minimum temperature higher than maximum temperature relative humidity out of the range 0 100 minimum relative humidity higher than maximum relative humidity negative wind speed negative solar radiation and solar radiation higher than extraterrestrial radiation data quality was also assessed by means of careful visual inspection to accomplish this daily records over time were plotted with records on y axis and days on x axis periods with suspicious behavior such as long constant measurements or abrupt changes were removed in the case of solar radiation clear sky solar radiation rso envelope was also plotted to identify possible measurement errors allen et al 1998 the mean values and standard deviations over the entire dataset were 29 5 5 0 ºc for maximum temperature 18 6 4 5 ºc for minimum temperature 89 9 9 4 for maximum relative humidity 46 6 16 8 for minimum relative humidity 1 92 0 52 kpa for actual vapor pressure computed using maximum and minimum relative humidity 18 2 6 1 mj m 2 d 1 for solar radiation 1 53 0 94 m s 1 for wind speed and 4 13 1 54 mm d 1 for eto to develop and test the proposed models the dataset was split into training and test datasets the first one was used to develop the machine learning models and to calibrate the fao56 pm equation with missing data through linear regression and through the calibration of the fao methodologies used to estimate missing data the second dataset was used to assess the performance of the models studied to make the performance assessment more robust we considered data splitting in both time and space thus the training dataset was composed of 330 weather stations with data up to 2013 and the test dataset was composed of 107 stations with data from 2014 to 2018 the weather stations splitting and the köppen s climatic classification alvares et al 2013 for the study area are presented in fig 1 test stations were manually selected in order to provide a good distribution over the brazilian territory to produce models with high generalization ability the models were developed calibrated using pooled data from all the stations of the training dataset in addition after identifying the most promising models they were developed for specific regions of brazil clusters defined based on k means and data from worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 thus each set of training and test stations contained in each region cluster was independently used to develop and test the models the performance assessment of the models was performed individually for each weather station of the test dataset to divide brazil into climatic homogeneous regions gridded mean monthly historical data 1970 2000 from worldclim dataset version 2 1 fick and hijmans 2017 were used data were downloaded with a spatial resolution of 5 min maximum and minimum air temperature water vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed data were collected monthly vapor pressure deficit which was used to replace water vapor pressure was computed from maximum and minimum air temperature and water vapor pressure as suggested by allen et al 1998 mean annual data were computed from monthly data after that data were normalized according to eq 1 then the mentioned data i e maximum and minimum air temperature vapor pressure deficit solar radiation and wind speed were used as input for k means to define five clusters with similar characteristics climatic homogeneous regions the mentioned variables were selected because they are the base variables used in the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto the number of clusters was defined with support of the elbow method kodinariya and makwana 2013 after defining clusters the sieve tool of the rasterio library python was used to identify small isolated areas pixels and replaces their values with the pixel value of the largest neighbor cluster the procedure followed to define clusters is also presented in fig 2 1 x ni x i μ σ where xni is the standardized value xi is the observed value µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation 2 2 proposed modeling framework different approaches for estimating eto based on temperature and relative humidity and based on temperature only were assessed the first approach was to use the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies presented in the fao bulletin allen et al 1998 the equations used to estimate missing data were considered in their original and calibrated forms in addition a calibration of the fao56 pm equation using simple linear regression as presented in allen et al 1998 was performed in this case the equations used to estimate missing data were used in their original forms the second approach was similar to the first one but using machine learning models to estimate missing data the third approach was to estimate eto from limited data directly using machine learning models all the approaches were developed calibrated considering brazil as whole general scenario and for the first approach i e fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies and for the most promising models of the other approaches also considering individual clusters defined using k means clustering scenario to explore the potential of multi task learning mtl auxiliary target variables were added when estimating eto and missing data two mtl strategies were considered mtl1 models used eto solar radiation maximum and minimum relative humidity and wind speed as output variables in the case of temperature based models and these same variables except for maximum and minimum relative humidity in the case of temperature and relative humidity based models mtl2 models used the same output variables considered in mtl1 except for wind speed proposing these two mtl options is because wind speed has a weak relation with the input variables considered in the present study temperature relative humidity and extraterrestrial radiation thus trying to add it as an auxiliary target variable may decrease the performance of the models machine learning models based on single task learning stl were also assessed by developing individual models to estimate each variable of interest all the machine learning models developed were based on two types of input data temperature based which considers maximum and minimum temperature and extraterrestrial solar radiation as input and temperature and relative humidity based which consider also maximum and minimum relative humidity an overview of the use of stl and mtl to develop the machine learning models is shown in fig 3 the following machine learning models were used artificial neural network ann random forest rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars as mtl requires models that support multi output only ann and rf were used with mtl 2 3 reference model fao56 penman monteith with full data set to develop calibrate and assess the performance of the models eto computed using the fao56 pm equation eq 2 with full data set was used as reference all calculation procedures were performed following the fao56 bulletin allen et al 1998 2 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t avg 273 u

availability using the fao56 pm equation actual vapor pressure was estimated using eq 3 in case of missing data on relative humidity and solar radiation was estimated using eq 4 as suggested in the fao56 bulletin allen et al 1998 to estimate missing wind speed in addition to considering the world average wind speed value 2 0 m s 1 presented in the fao56 bulletin average wind speed over the training dataset was considered mean wind speed was obtained for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario maximum and minimum relative humidity which are used to compute actual vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed were also estimated using machine learning models as described later 3 e a e t dew 0 611 exp 17 27 t min a t t min a t 237 3 where ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa e is the saturation vapor pressure kpa tmin is the minimum air temperature c and at is a correction factor with a common range of 0 4 ºc paredes and pereira 2019 4 r s k

extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 tmax is the maximum air temperature c and tmin is the minimum air temperature c when estimating actual vapor pressure from temperature minimum temperature can be considered as an approximation of dew point temperature however this condition is not always met thus to better estimate actual vapor pressure a correction factor at can be subtracted from minimum temperature allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 mean temperature can also be used for humid regions paredes and pereira 2019 however according to our previous tests for the conditions of the present study using minimum temperature provided better results than using mean temperature both alternatives were evaluated adopting an optimal correction factor therefore the direct use of minimum temperature at 0 and the use of minimum temperature corrected at 0 were considered in the present study to define the optimal value of at an optimization algorithm was used to find the at value that minimizes the estimation error mean squared error of actual vapor pressure actual vapor pressure computed using maximum and minimum relative humidity was used as reference the optimization process was performed using data from the training set the optimization algorithm used was the function minimize from the scipy library for python the optimal at value was defined for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario to estimate solar radiation the default value 0 16 of the empirical radiation adjustment coefficient krs and a calibrated value of krs were considered to calibrate krs a procedure similar to the one described to calibrate at in the estimation of actual vapor pressure was followed thus krs value was defined in order to minimize the estimation error of solar radiation using measured solar radiation as reference the optimal krs value was defined for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using the original fao methodologies i e with default parameters was also calibrated using simple linear regression this type of calibration is suggested by allen et al 1998 and is very common in studies addressing empirical equations ferreira et al 2019 feng et al 2017 zanetti et al 2019 to perform this calibration eto computed using the fao56 pm equation with full data set was used as target variable y and eto computed using the fao56 pm equation with missing data was used as input variable x thus calibrated eto is obtained as shown in eq 5 this calibration was performed for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario 5 et o cal a b et o where eto cal is the calibrated reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 a and b are the calibration parameters and eto is the reference evapotranspiration estimated using the equation to be calibrated fao56 pm with missing data mm d 1 2 5 machine learning models and multi task learning four machine learning models which are presented in detail later were used ann rf xgboost and mars all the models were used to estimate eto and missing data on maximum and minimum relative humidity which are used to compute actual vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed based on two input data combinations temperature based and temperature and relative humidity based as shown in fig 3 all the models were developed considering stl ann and rf were developed also using mtl since among the models used only these two support mtl the missing data estimated using machine learning models were used to estimate eto with the fao56 pm equation the following libraries for the python programming language were used to develop the machine learning models tensorflow scikit learn xgboost and py earth to train the models and optimize their hyperparameters 40 of the training dataset was randomly selected to be used as a validation subset thus hyperparameters were optimized by grid search selecting the values of the hyperparameters that minimized the prediction errors in the validation subset 2 5 1 artificial neural network ann ann is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain and it is widely used in several applications including the estimation of eto more details on ann can be found in ferreira et al 2019 in the present study ann of the feed forward multilayer perceptron mlp type was used ann models were used considering both stl and mtl in stl one neuron is used in the output layer which is responsible to predict a single variable in mtl as multiple variables are predicted simultaneously the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the number of target variables an example of using stl and mtl is presented in fig 4 during the training of the models the number of hidden layers 1 and 2 and the number of neurons in each hidden layer 5 10 20 and 30 were optimized the adam training algorithm kingma and ba 2014 was employed to train the models hyperbolic tangent was used as activation function in hidden layers and linear function was used in the output layer learning rate was set to 0 001 and batch size was set to 512 the number of training epochs was defined using early stopping with maximum training epochs equal to 200 and patience equal to 20 epochs the restore best weights option was also used which restores the ann weights that promoted the smallest errors during the last 20 epochs with no performance improvement 2 5 2 random forest rf rf is a decision tree based model it combines several weak learners decision trees to produce a strong prediction ensemble which is obtained as the average prediction of all the decision trees in the case of regression more details on rf can be found in tyralis et al 2019 as for ann rf models were also developed based on stl and mtl to allow the estimation of multiple target variables each tree that composes a rf model has to predict all the target variables in its leaves instead of a single variable thus when building the decision trees a splitting criterion that considers all the target variables is used it is worth mentioning that not all rf implementations support mtl in the present study the implementation of scikit learn 0 23 1 was used to make the use of mtl in rf clearer an example of a decision tree with two target variables is presented in fig 5 in hyperparameter optimization the following hyperparameters with their respective candidate values were optimized number of trees 100 200 400 and 600 number of features considered for splitting at each node all features two thirds and one third of the features maximum tree depth 5 10 15 and 20 the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node was set to 10 2 5 3 extreme gradient boosting xgboost as rf xgboost is based on decision trees however it uses a different strategy to build the trees in this algorithm trees are created in sequence using a strategy called boosting more information on xgboost can be found in chen and guestrin 2016 in hyperparameter optimization the following hyperparameters with their respective candidate values were optimized number of trees 100 200 400 and 600 maximum tree depth 3 5 7 9 and 11 and learning rate 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 2 5 4 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars mars is a model composed of base functions which are functions fitted at different intervals of the input variables and combined to form a mars model unlike most machine learning models a mars model is expressed as an algebraic equation which can simplify its use for an end user more information on mars can be found in cheng and cao 2014 and ferreira et al 2021 in hyperparameter optimization the following hyperparameters with their respective candidate values were optimized penalty 3 5 10 and 20 endspan alpha 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 and minspan alpha 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 the order of interaction max degree was set to 3 to avoid extremely complex models 2 5 5 data normalization before training the models input and output variables were standardized according to eq 1 this process is essential for ann models to avoid data leakage from the test dataset to the training dataset the mean µ and standard deviation σ were computed using only data from the training subset not including data from the validation subset and test set data from the validation subset and test set were standardized using µ and σ obtained from the training subset 2 6 performance comparison criteria for all the variables estimated in the present study i e solar radiation actual vapor pressure wind speed and eto the models were evaluated at each weather station of the test dataset employing nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 which were calculated based on the following equations 6 nse 1 p i o i 2 o o i 2 7 rmse 1 n p i o i 2 8 mbe 1 n p i o i 9 r 2 p i p o i o p i p 2 o i o 2 2 where pi is the predicted value oi is the observed value p is the mean of the predicted values o is the mean of the observed values and n is the number of data pairs nse indicates the magnitude of the mean square error rmse2 in relation to the variance of the observed data rmse is a general error indicator that gives more weight to large errors mbe is used to represent the general tendency of a model to underestimate or overestimate observed values r2 indicates the association between observed and predicted values nse and r2 should be as close to one as possible and rmse and mbe should be as close to zero as possible 3 results and discussion 3 1 general scenario 3 1 1 solar radiation estimation the performance of the machine learning models and the original and calibrated fao 56 approach to estimate solar radiation is presented in fig 6 overall all the machine learning models performed similarly with slightly poorer results for the mars model in general the use of mtl showed results very close to those obtained using stl the use of relative humidity in addition to air temperature promoted performance gains increasing nse and r2 and decreasing rmse and mbe absolute values for the temperature based models the best performing options were the ann stl and ann mtl2 nse 0 55 rmse 3 38 and r2 0 65 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the ann stl ann mtl1 ann mtl2 exhibited the best performances both with nse 0 61 rmse 3 13 and r2 0 68 when compared with the original and calibrated fao approach all the machine learning models performed better regarding the calibration of the fao method in contrast to our initial expectations the original model nse 0 48 rmse 3 66 mbe 0 04 and r2 0 58 performed slightly better than its calibrated version nse 0 47 rmse 3 69 mbe 0 54 and r2 0 58 the change in krs value was small from 0 16 to 0 1643 the slight performance loss observed is probably due to some random differences between the training and test datasets thus even promoting better results in the training dataset the calibrated krs performed a little worse in the test dataset the performance improvement observed when adding relative humidity as input data was also observed in other studies he et al 2020 quej et al 2016 valiantzas 2018b valiantzas 2018b demonstrated empirically that mean relative humidity has an inverse relation with solar radiation lindauer et al 2017 provided evidence that relative humidity has a certain relation with cloud cover and atmospheric transmissivity which are directly related to solar radiation at the land surface 3 1 2 actual vapor pressure estimation the machine learning models showed similar performances to estimate actual vapor pressure computed from maximum and minimum relative humidity estimated by the machine learning models with only slightly poorer results for the mars model fig 7 when using mtl the results were very close to those obtained using stl the best performing model was the ann mtl2 nse 0 40 rmse 0 23 mbe 0 02 and r2 0 71 however the other models had similar results although the fao approach did not achieve the same performance obtained by the machine learning models it was benefited from the calibration increasing nse from 1 33 to 0 12 decreasing rmse from 0 42 to 0 32 and decreasing mbe from 0 32 to 0 02 it is observed that there was an actual vapor pressure overestimation mbe 0 32 before the calibration which was reduced by subtracting 2 21 c from minimum air temperature during actual vapor pressure computation eq 3 however even after the calibration a negative mean nse value was obtained which indicates that the overall performance was poor when estimating actual vapor pressure from air temperature minimum temperature is considered an approximation of dew point temperature however it should be adjusted according to the local climatic conditions by subtracting a constant value allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 according to our study overall for brazil subtracting 2 21 c improved the estimation however it is important to note that it is a general recommendation since this value varies according to the local climatic conditions being lower for humid regions and higher for dryer regions in addition in humid regions minimum temperature can be higher than dew point temperature paredes and pereira 2019 3 1 3 wind speed estimation the machine learning models performed similarly when predicting wind speed with slightly poorer results for the xgboost model fig 8 as observed for the previous variables in general the use of mtl promoted results similar to those found using stl the use of relative humidity in addition to air temperature promoted performance gains however all the models were not able to predict wind speed with adequate accuracy obtaining negative mean nse values for the temperature based models the best performing option was the ann stl nse 2 24 rmse 0 71 mbe 0 11 and r2 0 07 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the best performing options were the ann mtl1 and rf mtl1 nse 1 60 rmse 0 67 mbe 0 09 and r2 0 17 the use of the average wind speed obtained at the training stations 1 61 m s 1 promoted better results nse 3 03 rmse 0 75 and mbe 0 19 than the world average wind speed value 2 00 m s 1 proposed in the fao approach nse 6 68 rmse 0 93 and mbe 0 58 paredes et al 2018a and popova et al 2006 reported better results when using local regional average wind speed instead of the default value proposed in the fao approach in estimating eto the poor performance in estimating wind speed is associated with the low correlation between wind speed and the input data considered for developing the models i e air temperature relative humidity and extraterrestrial solar radiation however even with the aforementioned low correlation the machine learning models were able to capture some patterns between input and output data and produce lower errors than the simple use of a constant value fao and average wind speed approaches fig 8 3 1 4 reference evapotranspiration estimation 3 1 4 1 machine learning models the performance of the machine learning models used to estimate eto directly from air temperature and relative humidity or temperature only is presented in fig 9 the models performed similarly with a slight advantage for the ann and rf models as previously observed in general the use of mtl did not provide strong performance changes showing similar results to those obtained with stl adding relative humidity as input resulted in performance gains for the temperature based models the best performing models were the ann stl rf mtl1 and rf mtl2 nse 0 53 and rmse 0 79 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the ann and rf developed using stl mtl1 and mtl2 showed the best performances nse 0 67 and rmse 0 65 3 1 4 2 fao56 pm equation combined with machine learning models the performance of the fao56 pm equation combined with machine learning models used to estimate missing data is presented in fig 10 all the models had similar performance with a slight advantage for those that used ann and rf the models developed employing mtl and stl performed similarly as previously observed there were also performance gains by adding relative humidity as input for the temperature based models the best performing option was the pm ann stl fao56 pm combined with ann stl nse 0 53 rmse 0 78 mbe 0 15 and r2 0 74 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the fao56 pm combined with the ann models developed with stl mtl1 and mtl2 performed the best nse 0 66 rmse 0 65 and r2 0 80 3 1 5 overall evaluation as presented before the ann and rf models used individually or combined with the fao56 pm equation provided the best performances with a slight advantage for ann thus to better compare the different approaches used to estimate eto the performance of the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies and ann models developed considering single task and multi task learning individually used and combined with fao56 pm equation is presented in fig 11 when using only measured data on temperature the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on fao methodologies pm ori pm cal1 and pm cal2 in fig 11 performed better before both evaluated calibrations in contrast it performed better after the calibrations when using temperature and relative humidity as input data the performance loss observed for the temperature based equation is not expected since calibrations generally promote performance gains in addition regarding pm cal1 when evaluating the estimation of missing data after the calibrations although there was a slight decrease in the performance of the estimation of solar radiation the estimations of actual vapor pressure and wind speed were improved thus both calibration types evaluated pm cal1 and pm cal2 are expected to improve the estimation of eto to better investigate the cause of the performance loss in the temperature based fao56 pm equation after calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data pm cal1 fig 11 the performance of the fao56 pm equation using each one of the variables estimated i e solar radiation relative humidity actual vapor pressure and wind speed as the sole missing data was assessed fig 12 after the calibrations better eto estimates were obtained when considering actual vapor pressure and wind speed as missing data when considering solar radiation as missing data after the calibration a similar performance was observed with only a small increase in mbe 0 02 0 09 and a small decrease in r2 0 86 0 85 based on these results the calibrations are expected to improve the performance of the fao56 pm equation when using only measured data on temperature since only the performance of the estimation of solar radiation had a minimal decrease however a contrary behavior was observed fig 11 it is probably justified by the characteristics of the errors in the missing data estimated probably although the errors obtained with the non calibrated fao methodologies to estimate missing data are higher they were partially canceled out when considering the use of solar radiation actual vapor pressure and wind speed estimates simultaneously which justify the better performance of the fao56 pm equation with the non calibrated fao methodologies pm ori calibrating the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using the original fao methodologies through linear regression pm cal2 provided slightly better results in relation to pm cal1 in both temperature based and temperature and relative humidity based settings fig 11 although calibrating individual equations to estimate missing data can have a more in depth effect the calibration based on linear regression has the advantage of adjusting the model with a focus on the estimation of eto itself as previously mentioned in the temperature based setting even promoting better results than pm cal1 the pm cal2 model also performed slightly worse than the pm ori model it probably occurred due to some random difference between data used to calibrate and test the equation compared to the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using traditional methodologies i e pm ori pm cal1 and pm cal2 in fig 11 the machine learning models and their combinations with the fao56 pm equation performed better to estimate eto mainly the models based on temperature and relative humidity fig 11 for the temperature based models when comparing the non calibrated pm model pm ori which performed better than its calibrated versions pm cal1 and pm cal2 with the pm ann stl model which was the best machine learning model nse increased from 0 49 to 0 53 8 2 rmse decreased from 0 83 to 0 78 6 0 and r2 increased from 0 73 to 0 74 1 4 for the temperature and relative humidity based models when comparing the pm cal2 model which performed better than its other versions with the ann stl ann mtl1 and ann mtl2 models or rf stl rf mtl1 and rf mtl2 fig 9 which were the best machine learning models nse increased from 0 56 to 0 67 19 6 and rmse decreased from 0 74 to 0 65 12 2 overall the use of relative humidity in addition to temperature improved the performance of the models studied however for the non calibrated pm model pm ori although adding relative humidity decreased rmse from 0 83 to 0 80 3 6 nse reduced from 0 49 to 0 45 8 2 fig 11 this unexpected behavior observed for the pm ori model is probably due to the actual vapor pressure overestimation which occurred when using only temperature fig 7 mbe 0 32 which is at a certain point canceled out by the overestimated wind speed fig 8 mbe 0 58 it occurs since the actual vapor pressure overestimation led to eto underestimation and the wind speed overestimation led to eto overestimation canceling out part of the errors therefore when relative humidity data were added to the pm ori model the mentioned condition was no more achieved which can contribute to increase the errors in the estimation of eto at some weather stations however when a better wind speed value was considered i e pm cal1 adding relative humidity was translated into performance gains increasing nse from 0 44 to 0 55 25 0 similarly for the model calibrated using linear regression pm cal2 nse was increased from 0 46 to 0 56 21 7 when adding relative humidity by comparing the best temperature based and temperature and relative humidity based models to estimate eto i e pm ann stl and ann stl ann mtl1 ann mtl2 or rf developed with stl mtl1 and mtl2 respectively nse increased from 0 53 to 0 67 26 4 and rmse decreased from 0 78 to 0 65 16 7 3 2 clustering scenario as mentioned before ann and rf provided the best performances in estimating missing data and eto with a slight advantage for ann thus to better explore the potential of ann models and the fao56 pm equation we also developed calibrated them after dividing brazil into regions with similar climatic conditions clustering the clusters obtained using k means and data from worldclim are presented in fig 13 3 2 1 missing data and reference evapotranspiration the performance of the models developed for each cluster to estimate solar radiation actual vapor pressure and wind speed is presented in fig 14 as seen in the general scenario the ann models outperformed the fao methodologies used to estimate missing data in their original and calibrated forms and stl and mtl provided similar performances after the clustering similar results were found for solar radiation figs 6 and 14 for actual vapor pressure figs 7 and 14 there were considerable performance improvements increasing the best nse value from 0 40 to 0 53 however in the case of the calibrated fao methodology even increasing nse from 0 12 0 06 the performance was still poor since nse was very close to zero thus better approaches to calibrate the fao methodology used to estimate actual vapor pressure for brazil are necessary for wind speed figs 8 and 14 although the clustering increased nse and decreased rmse all models continued to have negative nse values which indicates their poor performance thus different approaches should be explored in the future to produce more reliable wind speed estimates by evaluating eto estimated after the clustering fig 15 as observed in the general scenario the ann models used individually and in combination with the fao56 pm equation outperformed the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies original and calibrated using stl and mtl provided similar results as found in the general scenario regarding the calibration of the fao56 pm equation as observed in the general scenario in the temperature based setting the original equation performed slightly better than its calibrated version however in the temperature and relative humidity based setting both calibrations strategies promoted performance gains although pm cal1 and pm cal2 performed similarly pm cal2 showed slightly lower rmse values the optimal values of the calibration parameters used with the fao56 pm equation are provided in table 1 cluster 5 showed the lowest values of at krs and u2 this cluster is located mainly in northern brazil where amazon rainforest predominates this region is characterized by af and am climates fig 1 and high relative humidity and rainfall in addition to low wind speed thus minimum temperature tends to better approximate dew point temperature which justify the lowest at value the high rainfall levels which are related to high cloud cover reduce the proportion of solar radiation at surface in relation to extraterrestrial solar radiation which corroborates the lower krs value on the other hand cluster 4 showed the highest values of at and krs this cluster is located in a dryer region with aw as and bsh climates fig 1 thus under these conditions at is expected to assume a higher value to make minimum temperature closer to dew point temperature as found in this study in addition due to the lower rainfall levels lower cloud cover the proportion of solar radiation at surface in relation to extraterrestrial solar radiation is expect to be higher which increases the krs value clusters 1 2 and 3 exhibited similar values of at krs and u2 3 3 comparison of the general and clustering scenarios to compare the performance of the models developed to estimate eto for brazil as a whole and for regions with similar climatic conditions clusters mean values of nse rmse mbe and r2 over test stations are presented in table 2 the temperature based models performed better after the clustering in general after the clustering mean nse over the models assessed increased from 0 50 to 0 54 8 0 rmse reduced from 0 81 to 0 78 3 7 mbe reduced from 0 17 to 0 14 17 6 and r2 increased from 0 73 to 0 74 1 4 the best performance was obtained by the pm ann stl model with nse equal to 0 58 and rmse equal to 0 75 in contrast the temperature and relative humidity based models had similar performances in the general and clustering scenarios models developed to estimate eto based on limited input data are influenced by the local climatic conditions therefore when developing models for regions with more homogeneous characteristics they tend to better capture the relations between input data and eto attaining better performance than models developed for heterogeneous regions ferreira et al 2019 also found better performances when using a clustering strategy in brazil these authors reported higher performance gains for temperature based models in relation to temperature and relative humidity based models as observed in the present study in contrast althoff et al 2019 reported only small gains by clustering weather stations however it may have occurred due to the smaller study area lower climatic variability considered in the mentioned study in relation to the one considered in the present study as the temperature and relative humidity based models used to estimate eto were little affected by the clustering it can indicate that the regions clusters created were not efficient to overcome the missing of solar radiation and wind speed data it is also supported by the results presented in figs 6 7 8 and 14 in which it can be noted that in contrast to actual vapor pressure solar radiation estimation was generally not improved after the clustering and although wind speed estimation had some improvement it continues to obtain poor predictions after the clustering on the other hand actual vapor pressure estimation had a considerable performance increase 3 4 overall evaluation in both general and clustering scenarios the use of mtl did not provide strong performance changes in estimating eto showing similar results to those found using stl figs 9 10 and 15 the same behavior was observed in estimating the missing data considered figs 6 7 8 and 14 however it is worth mentioning that when in addition to the estimation of eto the estimations of solar radiation actual vapor pressure or relative humidity and wind speed are of interest the use of mtl can reduce the time and computational resources required to develop the machine learning models since only a single model is required to estimate all these variables although some studies have demonstrated performance gains by using mtl ng et al 2019 padarian et al 2019 it does not promote gains in all cases as found in the present study and also for nunes et al 2019 thus mtl should be considered as a tool with potential benefits for some tasks but it needs to be evaluated for each particular case another way to explore possible advantages of mtl in the estimation of eto which can be assessed in future studies is to add past and or future eto values e g 1 day ahead eto as auxiliary target variables overall the combination between machine learning models and the fao56 pm equation performed similarly to the machine learning models individually used in both general and clustering scenarios figs 9 10 11 and 15 using machine learning models to estimate missing data and the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto instead of using machine learning models to estimate eto directly can make the eto estimation process a little clearer however it requires the development and use of more models although the mars models used in the general scenario to estimate eto and missing data were not so good as the ann and rf models figs 6 10 in contrast to most machine learning models they can be used in the form of an algebraic mathematical equation which can simplify its usage for an end user in addition the mars models used individually or in combination with the fao56 pm equation presented better performance to estimate eto than the fao56 pm equation with the same input data figs 9 11 in the temperature and relative humidity based setting for the mars model used individually in relation to pm cal2 nse increased from 0 56 to 0 65 16 1 and rmse decreased from 0 74 to 0 67 9 5 for the temperature based models in relation to the pm ori model the use of mars provided only slight performance gains to estimate solar radiation actual vapor pressure relative humidity and wind speed the mars models performed better than the fao methodologies mainly when using temperature and relative humidity as input figs 6 8 to make the mars models developed in the present study available to the reader they are provided equations and an example spreadsheet as supplementary data appendix a the distribution of nse and mbe values over the brazilian territory for eto estimated in the general and clustering scenarios is presented in fig 16 for the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using traditional methodologies original and the best calibrated version and the ann models developed using stl and their combinations with the fao56 pm equation similarly mean nse values for each cluster defined using k means are presented in table 3 for the mentioned models and pm cal1 as previously observed using relative humidity data in addition to temperature in the non calibrated fao56 pm equation pm ori resulted in worse eto estimation higher mbe values and lower nse values at some weather however it promoted better results higher nse values in both general and clustering scenarios when using the fao56 pm equation calibrated and the machine learning models used individually and in combination with the fao56 pm equation fig 16 and table 3 overall the temperature based models from the general scenario performed poorly in northern brazil fig 16 which is associated with clusters 1 and 5 table 3 it is probably associated with the lower weather stations density in this region which makes the models developed less adapted to this region however when considering the clustering approach better performances were obtained in this case the models were able to better capture the relations between the input variables and eto since they were developed for a more homogeneous region adding relative humidity data also improved the results found in northern brazil in the general scenario the use of relative humidity was an important factor in reducing eto overestimation high positive mbe values in northern brazil and reducing eto underestimation high negative mbe values in northeastern brazil keeping mbe values closer to zero overall the temperature and relative humidity based machine learning models and their combinations with the fao56 pm equation provided the best performances with higher nse values and lower mbe absolute values in both general and clustering scenarios the best performances were found for clusters 2 and 3 in both general and clustering approaches after the clustering cluster 4 had its performance reduced in relation to the general scenario which indicates that this cluster was not well defined for eto estimation purposes given the high climatic variability in the brazilian territory it is hard to develop general models to estimate eto with good accuracy in any part of the country especially when using temperature based models to achieve higher performances future studies could investigate the use of extra information as input for the models such as geographical coordinates elevation long term gridded data obtained from ground data interpolation or satellite data and other variables that can help the algorithms to achieve better performances defining regions with similar climatic conditions can also improve the performance of the models as found in the present study future studies can better explore different approaches to apply clustering such as choosing the best input variables and testing different clustering algorithms 4 conclusions in both general and clustering scenarios using simple linear regression to calibrate the fao56 pm equation provided slightly better results than calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data unexpectedly the temperature based fao56 pm equation provided better eto estimates before both calibration types assessed which may be due to some random difference between data used to calibrate and test the equation when using temperature and relative humidity data better results were observed after both calibration types reducing mean rmse from 0 80 up to 0 74 mm d 1 in the general and clustering scenarios overall the machine learning models performed better than the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto and better than the original and calibrated fao methodologies to estimate missing data in both general and clustering scenarios when combining machine learning models with the fao56 pm equation performance improvements were not observed obtaining results similar to those found using machine learning models individually using multi task learning mtl to develop ann and rf models did not provide strong performance changes similar results were obtained in relation to using single task learning stl in the general scenario for the temperature based models pm ann stl performed the best to estimate eto increasing mean nse from 0 49 to 0 53 8 2 and decreasing mean rmse from 0 83 to 0 78 6 0 in relation to the non calibrated fao56 pm equation which performed better than its calibrated versions for the temperature and relative humidity based models the ann and rf models developed using stl and mtl performed the best increasing nse from 0 56 to 0 67 19 6 and decreasing rmse from 0 74 to 0 65 12 2 in relation to the fao56 pm equation calibrated using linear regression which performed better than its other versions when dividing brazil into five climatically homogeneous groups clustering performance gains were obtained in estimating eto for the temperature based machine learning models and the calibrated fao56 pm equation the best model pm ann stl showed mean nse and rmse equal to 0 58 and 0 75 mm d 1 respectively the temperature and relative humidity based models were little affected by the clustering similarly better estimates of actual vapor pressure and wind speed were obtained after the clustering among the machine learning models assessed overall ann and rf performed the best with a slight advantage for ann although the mars models showed inferior performance they generally performed better than the original and calibrated fao approaches to estimate eto and missing data especially when using temperature and relative humidity data thus the mars models developed are made available as supplementary data appendix a equations and an example spreadsheet declaration of competing interest

penman monteith fao56 pm equation but it requires commonly unavailable meteorological data therefore this study assessed different approaches to estimate eto based on temperature and relative humidity and temperature only across brazil as follows i using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on fao56 methodologies ii using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on machine learning and iii estimating eto directly using machine learning the fao56 pm equation was also calibrated through linear regression and by calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data the potential benefits of using multi task learning mtl and clustering were also investigated data from 437 weather stations were used artificial neural network ann random forest rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars were employed in both general and clustering scenarios calibrating the fao56 pm equation using linear regression provided slightly better results than calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data in contrast to temperature and relative humidity based fao56 pm equation its temperature based version performed better before both calibration types assessed the machine learning models performed the best to estimate eto and missing data combining the machine learning models with the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto performed similarly to using them individually mtl and single task learning stl provided similar results in the general scenario for the temperature based models using pm ann stl increased mean nse from 0 49 to 0 53 in relation to the non calibrated fao56 pm equation for the temperature and relative humidity based models using ann and rf developed with stl or mtl increased nse from 0 56 to 0 67 in relation to the fao56 pm equation calibrated using linear regression when using the clustering strategy performance gains were obtained in estimating eto with the temperature based models increasing mean nse up to 0 58 keywords generalizability mars neural networks solar radiation wind speed 1 introduction knowing evapotranspiration et is essential in hydrological studies agricultural planning water resource management and irrigation scheduling due to the difficulty in measuring et directly it is commonly obtained based on reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc pereira et al 2015 eto can be estimated using the fao 56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation however to use this equation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed measurements are required which are not fully available in some regions among the aforementioned data air temperature is the most commonly and easily measured which justifies the study of eto models based on this variable mattar et al 2016 paredes and pereira 2019 in addition to temperature the use of relative humidity promotes a better estimation of eto at a low additional cost ferreira et al 2019 exner kittridge 2012 valiantzas 2012 2018a to estimate eto under limited meteorological data availability several empirical equations with fewer data requirements have been studied ahmadi and javanbakht 2020 awal et al 2020 cunha et al 2017 djaman et al 2019 hadria et al 2021 valiantzas 2013 in addition to alternative equations the fao56 pm equation can be used by estimating missing data using methodologies proposed in the fao56 bulletin allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 overall this approach has shown good performance in brazil and other parts of the world ferreira et al 2019 in a study carried out in brazil reported that the fao56 pm equation with missing data performed better than most of the empirical equations assessed almorox et al 2018 found better results for the fao56 pm equation using only measured data on temperature in relation to the well known hargreaves samani equation similar results were also reported by alencar et al 2015 and ren et al 2016 these results are possibly related to the physical basis of the fao56 pm equation which is partially conserved when estimating missing data however it is fair to mention that the better performance of this equation may be related to the fact that the fao56 pm equation with full data set is commonly used as reference for the assessment of eto models in addition to empirical equations several studies have employed machine learning models to estimate eto ferreira et al 2019 huang et al 2019 kisi and alizamir 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 yu et al 2020 due to their superior modeling capabilities machine learning models generally show better performances than traditional empirical equations other alternatives to address meteorological data scarcity include the use of remote sensing data de bruin et al 2016 and reanalysis data paredes et al 2018b in brazil studies using machine learning to estimate eto are generally restricted to parts of the country althoff et al 2018 ferreira et al 2021 reis et al 2019 tangune and escobedo 2018 according to our knowledge only ferreira et al 2019 used machine learning models to estimate eto based on limited meteorological data considering the entirety of brazil this study evaluated artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm reporting better results for the first model brazil has a large territorial area 8 516 million km2 with several climate types thus studies that explore all the brazilian territory are encouraged since the results tend to have high representativeness in addition according to the national water and sanitation agency of brazil national water and sanitation agency ana 2021 brazil has an irrigated area of 8 2 million hectares with a prospect of incorporating 4 2 million hectares by 2040 which reinforces the need to develop reliable eto models even under data scarcity conditions therefore the assessment of state of the art machine learning models deserves special attention an important issue for eto models is their spatial generalization which refers to the ability of a model to perform well outside its development place ferreira et al 2021 kiafar et al 2017 many studies fail to address it since they assess the models using only data of the same weather station where the models were developed to improve the generalization of machine learning models regional models have a key role in contrast to local models which are developed using data from a single weather station regional models are developed using pooled data from several stations thus they can be applied in any place of a particular region making them more useful however most studies have applied only local models in brazil only a limited number of studies have investigated the potential of regional models ferreira et al 2019 2021 reis et al 2019 zanetti et al 2019 on the other hand when developing regional models for large areas such as the whole of brazil the high climatic variability can lead to poorer performances given the presence of different patterns between input variables and eto within the same region in this context the use of clustering algorithms can guide the definition of smaller regions with homogeneous climatic conditions clusters thus specific models can be developed for each region which can contribute to achieving better results as reported by ferreira et al 2019 previous studies have been limited to using machine learning models to estimate eto directly from the available data however it is also possible to use machine learning models to estimate missing data which can be used to estimate eto with the fao56 pm equation in this case the physical basis of the fao56 pm equation could be used to improve the performance of the estimation in addition it can also make the eto estimation process clearer in relation to the estimation performed using only machine learning models another advantage is that the meteorological data estimated can be used for other purposes despite these possible benefits according to our knowledge no study has investigated this strategy another approach that could improve the performance of machine learning models for the estimation of eto is multi task learning mtl caruana 1997 ng et al 2019 nunes et al 2019 padarian et al 2019 in mtl multiple related variables are predicted simultaneously thus the information shared among tasks can improve the overall performance in relation to individual predictions single task learning stl in this sense to take advantage of the potential of mtl the eto estimation task should be reframed estimating eto and related meteorological variables such as solar radiation and relative humidity together therefore the information learned by a machine learning model to estimate the related variables could improve the estimation of eto and vice versa mtl can be used focusing on the estimation of eto or the estimation of missing data for use in the fao56 pm equation according to our knowledge no study has investigated the use of mtl to estimate eto the present study aims to assess different approaches to estimate eto based on temperature and relative humidity and temperature only across brazil as follows i using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on methodologies proposed in fao56 ii using the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on machine learning models and iii estimating eto directly using machine learning models in objective i two additional strategies are evaluated independently the calibration of the methodologies proposed in fao56 to estimate missing data and the calibration of the fao56 pm equation by means of linear regression we also investigated the potential of mtl and clustering to improve the estimation of eto and missing data 2 materials and methods 2 1 database and study sites hourly data from 437 weather stations of the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet distributed across brazil were used the period from 2004 to 2018 was considered however the data length varied among stations due to their different epochs of creation with a mean length of 10 5 2 6 years data on maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were obtained hourly data were transformed to a daily scale wind speed measured at 10 m height was converted to 2 m based on recommendations of allen et al 1998 daily records with missing or faulty data were removed faulty data were identified when at least one of the following conditions was met minimum temperature higher than maximum temperature relative humidity out of the range 0 100 minimum relative humidity higher than maximum relative humidity negative wind speed negative solar radiation and solar radiation higher than extraterrestrial radiation data quality was also assessed by means of careful visual inspection to accomplish this daily records over time were plotted with records on y axis and days on x axis periods with suspicious behavior such as long constant measurements or abrupt changes were removed in the case of solar radiation clear sky solar radiation rso envelope was also plotted to identify possible measurement errors allen et al 1998 the mean values and standard deviations over the entire dataset were 29 5 5 0 ºc for maximum temperature 18 6 4 5 ºc for minimum temperature 89 9 9 4 for maximum relative humidity 46 6 16 8 for minimum relative humidity 1 92 0 52 kpa for actual vapor pressure computed using maximum and minimum relative humidity 18 2 6 1 mj m 2 d 1 for solar radiation 1 53 0 94 m s 1 for wind speed and 4 13 1 54 mm d 1 for eto to develop and test the proposed models the dataset was split into training and test datasets the first one was used to develop the machine learning models and to calibrate the fao56 pm equation with missing data through linear regression and through the calibration of the fao methodologies used to estimate missing data the second dataset was used to assess the performance of the models studied to make the performance assessment more robust we considered data splitting in both time and space thus the training dataset was composed of 330 weather stations with data up to 2013 and the test dataset was composed of 107 stations with data from 2014 to 2018 the weather stations splitting and the köppen s climatic classification alvares et al 2013 for the study area are presented in fig 1 test stations were manually selected in order to provide a good distribution over the brazilian territory to produce models with high generalization ability the models were developed calibrated using pooled data from all the stations of the training dataset in addition after identifying the most promising models they were developed for specific regions of brazil clusters defined based on k means and data from worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 thus each set of training and test stations contained in each region cluster was independently used to develop and test the models the performance assessment of the models was performed individually for each weather station of the test dataset to divide brazil into climatic homogeneous regions gridded mean monthly historical data 1970 2000 from worldclim dataset version 2 1 fick and hijmans 2017 were used data were downloaded with a spatial resolution of 5 min maximum and minimum air temperature water vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed data were collected monthly vapor pressure deficit which was used to replace water vapor pressure was computed from maximum and minimum air temperature and water vapor pressure as suggested by allen et al 1998 mean annual data were computed from monthly data after that data were normalized according to eq 1 then the mentioned data i e maximum and minimum air temperature vapor pressure deficit solar radiation and wind speed were used as input for k means to define five clusters with similar characteristics climatic homogeneous regions the mentioned variables were selected because they are the base variables used in the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto the number of clusters was defined with support of the elbow method kodinariya and makwana 2013 after defining clusters the sieve tool of the rasterio library python was used to identify small isolated areas pixels and replaces their values with the pixel value of the largest neighbor cluster the procedure followed to define clusters is also presented in fig 2 1 x ni x i μ σ where xni is the standardized value xi is the observed value µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation 2 2 proposed modeling framework different approaches for estimating eto based on temperature and relative humidity and based on temperature only were assessed the first approach was to use the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies presented in the fao bulletin allen et al 1998 the equations used to estimate missing data were considered in their original and calibrated forms in addition a calibration of the fao56 pm equation using simple linear regression as presented in allen et al 1998 was performed in this case the equations used to estimate missing data were used in their original forms the second approach was similar to the first one but using machine learning models to estimate missing data the third approach was to estimate eto from limited data directly using machine learning models all the approaches were developed calibrated considering brazil as whole general scenario and for the first approach i e fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies and for the most promising models of the other approaches also considering individual clusters defined using k means clustering scenario to explore the potential of multi task learning mtl auxiliary target variables were added when estimating eto and missing data two mtl strategies were considered mtl1 models used eto solar radiation maximum and minimum relative humidity and wind speed as output variables in the case of temperature based models and these same variables except for maximum and minimum relative humidity in the case of temperature and relative humidity based models mtl2 models used the same output variables considered in mtl1 except for wind speed proposing these two mtl options is because wind speed has a weak relation with the input variables considered in the present study temperature relative humidity and extraterrestrial radiation thus trying to add it as an auxiliary target variable may decrease the performance of the models machine learning models based on single task learning stl were also assessed by developing individual models to estimate each variable of interest all the machine learning models developed were based on two types of input data temperature based which considers maximum and minimum temperature and extraterrestrial solar radiation as input and temperature and relative humidity based which consider also maximum and minimum relative humidity an overview of the use of stl and mtl to develop the machine learning models is shown in fig 3 the following machine learning models were used artificial neural network ann random forest rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars as mtl requires models that support multi output only ann and rf were used with mtl 2 3 reference model fao56 penman monteith with full data set to develop calibrate and assess the performance of the models eto computed using the fao56 pm equation eq 2 with full data set was used as reference all calculation procedures were performed following the fao56 bulletin allen et al 1998 2 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t avg 273 u

availability using the fao56 pm equation actual vapor pressure was estimated using eq 3 in case of missing data on relative humidity and solar radiation was estimated using eq 4 as suggested in the fao56 bulletin allen et al 1998 to estimate missing wind speed in addition to considering the world average wind speed value 2 0 m s 1 presented in the fao56 bulletin average wind speed over the training dataset was considered mean wind speed was obtained for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario maximum and minimum relative humidity which are used to compute actual vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed were also estimated using machine learning models as described later 3 e a e t dew 0 611 exp 17 27 t min a t t min a t 237 3 where ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa e is the saturation vapor pressure kpa tmin is the minimum air temperature c and at is a correction factor with a common range of 0 4 ºc paredes and pereira 2019 4 r s k

extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 tmax is the maximum air temperature c and tmin is the minimum air temperature c when estimating actual vapor pressure from temperature minimum temperature can be considered as an approximation of dew point temperature however this condition is not always met thus to better estimate actual vapor pressure a correction factor at can be subtracted from minimum temperature allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 mean temperature can also be used for humid regions paredes and pereira 2019 however according to our previous tests for the conditions of the present study using minimum temperature provided better results than using mean temperature both alternatives were evaluated adopting an optimal correction factor therefore the direct use of minimum temperature at 0 and the use of minimum temperature corrected at 0 were considered in the present study to define the optimal value of at an optimization algorithm was used to find the at value that minimizes the estimation error mean squared error of actual vapor pressure actual vapor pressure computed using maximum and minimum relative humidity was used as reference the optimization process was performed using data from the training set the optimization algorithm used was the function minimize from the scipy library for python the optimal at value was defined for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario to estimate solar radiation the default value 0 16 of the empirical radiation adjustment coefficient krs and a calibrated value of krs were considered to calibrate krs a procedure similar to the one described to calibrate at in the estimation of actual vapor pressure was followed thus krs value was defined in order to minimize the estimation error of solar radiation using measured solar radiation as reference the optimal krs value was defined for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using the original fao methodologies i e with default parameters was also calibrated using simple linear regression this type of calibration is suggested by allen et al 1998 and is very common in studies addressing empirical equations ferreira et al 2019 feng et al 2017 zanetti et al 2019 to perform this calibration eto computed using the fao56 pm equation with full data set was used as target variable y and eto computed using the fao56 pm equation with missing data was used as input variable x thus calibrated eto is obtained as shown in eq 5 this calibration was performed for brazil as a whole general scenario and for individual clusters clustering scenario 5 et o cal a b et o where eto cal is the calibrated reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 a and b are the calibration parameters and eto is the reference evapotranspiration estimated using the equation to be calibrated fao56 pm with missing data mm d 1 2 5 machine learning models and multi task learning four machine learning models which are presented in detail later were used ann rf xgboost and mars all the models were used to estimate eto and missing data on maximum and minimum relative humidity which are used to compute actual vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed based on two input data combinations temperature based and temperature and relative humidity based as shown in fig 3 all the models were developed considering stl ann and rf were developed also using mtl since among the models used only these two support mtl the missing data estimated using machine learning models were used to estimate eto with the fao56 pm equation the following libraries for the python programming language were used to develop the machine learning models tensorflow scikit learn xgboost and py earth to train the models and optimize their hyperparameters 40 of the training dataset was randomly selected to be used as a validation subset thus hyperparameters were optimized by grid search selecting the values of the hyperparameters that minimized the prediction errors in the validation subset 2 5 1 artificial neural network ann ann is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain and it is widely used in several applications including the estimation of eto more details on ann can be found in ferreira et al 2019 in the present study ann of the feed forward multilayer perceptron mlp type was used ann models were used considering both stl and mtl in stl one neuron is used in the output layer which is responsible to predict a single variable in mtl as multiple variables are predicted simultaneously the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the number of target variables an example of using stl and mtl is presented in fig 4 during the training of the models the number of hidden layers 1 and 2 and the number of neurons in each hidden layer 5 10 20 and 30 were optimized the adam training algorithm kingma and ba 2014 was employed to train the models hyperbolic tangent was used as activation function in hidden layers and linear function was used in the output layer learning rate was set to 0 001 and batch size was set to 512 the number of training epochs was defined using early stopping with maximum training epochs equal to 200 and patience equal to 20 epochs the restore best weights option was also used which restores the ann weights that promoted the smallest errors during the last 20 epochs with no performance improvement 2 5 2 random forest rf rf is a decision tree based model it combines several weak learners decision trees to produce a strong prediction ensemble which is obtained as the average prediction of all the decision trees in the case of regression more details on rf can be found in tyralis et al 2019 as for ann rf models were also developed based on stl and mtl to allow the estimation of multiple target variables each tree that composes a rf model has to predict all the target variables in its leaves instead of a single variable thus when building the decision trees a splitting criterion that considers all the target variables is used it is worth mentioning that not all rf implementations support mtl in the present study the implementation of scikit learn 0 23 1 was used to make the use of mtl in rf clearer an example of a decision tree with two target variables is presented in fig 5 in hyperparameter optimization the following hyperparameters with their respective candidate values were optimized number of trees 100 200 400 and 600 number of features considered for splitting at each node all features two thirds and one third of the features maximum tree depth 5 10 15 and 20 the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node was set to 10 2 5 3 extreme gradient boosting xgboost as rf xgboost is based on decision trees however it uses a different strategy to build the trees in this algorithm trees are created in sequence using a strategy called boosting more information on xgboost can be found in chen and guestrin 2016 in hyperparameter optimization the following hyperparameters with their respective candidate values were optimized number of trees 100 200 400 and 600 maximum tree depth 3 5 7 9 and 11 and learning rate 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 2 5 4 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars mars is a model composed of base functions which are functions fitted at different intervals of the input variables and combined to form a mars model unlike most machine learning models a mars model is expressed as an algebraic equation which can simplify its use for an end user more information on mars can be found in cheng and cao 2014 and ferreira et al 2021 in hyperparameter optimization the following hyperparameters with their respective candidate values were optimized penalty 3 5 10 and 20 endspan alpha 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 and minspan alpha 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 the order of interaction max degree was set to 3 to avoid extremely complex models 2 5 5 data normalization before training the models input and output variables were standardized according to eq 1 this process is essential for ann models to avoid data leakage from the test dataset to the training dataset the mean µ and standard deviation σ were computed using only data from the training subset not including data from the validation subset and test set data from the validation subset and test set were standardized using µ and σ obtained from the training subset 2 6 performance comparison criteria for all the variables estimated in the present study i e solar radiation actual vapor pressure wind speed and eto the models were evaluated at each weather station of the test dataset employing nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 which were calculated based on the following equations 6 nse 1 p i o i 2 o o i 2 7 rmse 1 n p i o i 2 8 mbe 1 n p i o i 9 r 2 p i p o i o p i p 2 o i o 2 2 where pi is the predicted value oi is the observed value p is the mean of the predicted values o is the mean of the observed values and n is the number of data pairs nse indicates the magnitude of the mean square error rmse2 in relation to the variance of the observed data rmse is a general error indicator that gives more weight to large errors mbe is used to represent the general tendency of a model to underestimate or overestimate observed values r2 indicates the association between observed and predicted values nse and r2 should be as close to one as possible and rmse and mbe should be as close to zero as possible 3 results and discussion 3 1 general scenario 3 1 1 solar radiation estimation the performance of the machine learning models and the original and calibrated fao 56 approach to estimate solar radiation is presented in fig 6 overall all the machine learning models performed similarly with slightly poorer results for the mars model in general the use of mtl showed results very close to those obtained using stl the use of relative humidity in addition to air temperature promoted performance gains increasing nse and r2 and decreasing rmse and mbe absolute values for the temperature based models the best performing options were the ann stl and ann mtl2 nse 0 55 rmse 3 38 and r2 0 65 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the ann stl ann mtl1 ann mtl2 exhibited the best performances both with nse 0 61 rmse 3 13 and r2 0 68 when compared with the original and calibrated fao approach all the machine learning models performed better regarding the calibration of the fao method in contrast to our initial expectations the original model nse 0 48 rmse 3 66 mbe 0 04 and r2 0 58 performed slightly better than its calibrated version nse 0 47 rmse 3 69 mbe 0 54 and r2 0 58 the change in krs value was small from 0 16 to 0 1643 the slight performance loss observed is probably due to some random differences between the training and test datasets thus even promoting better results in the training dataset the calibrated krs performed a little worse in the test dataset the performance improvement observed when adding relative humidity as input data was also observed in other studies he et al 2020 quej et al 2016 valiantzas 2018b valiantzas 2018b demonstrated empirically that mean relative humidity has an inverse relation with solar radiation lindauer et al 2017 provided evidence that relative humidity has a certain relation with cloud cover and atmospheric transmissivity which are directly related to solar radiation at the land surface 3 1 2 actual vapor pressure estimation the machine learning models showed similar performances to estimate actual vapor pressure computed from maximum and minimum relative humidity estimated by the machine learning models with only slightly poorer results for the mars model fig 7 when using mtl the results were very close to those obtained using stl the best performing model was the ann mtl2 nse 0 40 rmse 0 23 mbe 0 02 and r2 0 71 however the other models had similar results although the fao approach did not achieve the same performance obtained by the machine learning models it was benefited from the calibration increasing nse from 1 33 to 0 12 decreasing rmse from 0 42 to 0 32 and decreasing mbe from 0 32 to 0 02 it is observed that there was an actual vapor pressure overestimation mbe 0 32 before the calibration which was reduced by subtracting 2 21 c from minimum air temperature during actual vapor pressure computation eq 3 however even after the calibration a negative mean nse value was obtained which indicates that the overall performance was poor when estimating actual vapor pressure from air temperature minimum temperature is considered an approximation of dew point temperature however it should be adjusted according to the local climatic conditions by subtracting a constant value allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 according to our study overall for brazil subtracting 2 21 c improved the estimation however it is important to note that it is a general recommendation since this value varies according to the local climatic conditions being lower for humid regions and higher for dryer regions in addition in humid regions minimum temperature can be higher than dew point temperature paredes and pereira 2019 3 1 3 wind speed estimation the machine learning models performed similarly when predicting wind speed with slightly poorer results for the xgboost model fig 8 as observed for the previous variables in general the use of mtl promoted results similar to those found using stl the use of relative humidity in addition to air temperature promoted performance gains however all the models were not able to predict wind speed with adequate accuracy obtaining negative mean nse values for the temperature based models the best performing option was the ann stl nse 2 24 rmse 0 71 mbe 0 11 and r2 0 07 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the best performing options were the ann mtl1 and rf mtl1 nse 1 60 rmse 0 67 mbe 0 09 and r2 0 17 the use of the average wind speed obtained at the training stations 1 61 m s 1 promoted better results nse 3 03 rmse 0 75 and mbe 0 19 than the world average wind speed value 2 00 m s 1 proposed in the fao approach nse 6 68 rmse 0 93 and mbe 0 58 paredes et al 2018a and popova et al 2006 reported better results when using local regional average wind speed instead of the default value proposed in the fao approach in estimating eto the poor performance in estimating wind speed is associated with the low correlation between wind speed and the input data considered for developing the models i e air temperature relative humidity and extraterrestrial solar radiation however even with the aforementioned low correlation the machine learning models were able to capture some patterns between input and output data and produce lower errors than the simple use of a constant value fao and average wind speed approaches fig 8 3 1 4 reference evapotranspiration estimation 3 1 4 1 machine learning models the performance of the machine learning models used to estimate eto directly from air temperature and relative humidity or temperature only is presented in fig 9 the models performed similarly with a slight advantage for the ann and rf models as previously observed in general the use of mtl did not provide strong performance changes showing similar results to those obtained with stl adding relative humidity as input resulted in performance gains for the temperature based models the best performing models were the ann stl rf mtl1 and rf mtl2 nse 0 53 and rmse 0 79 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the ann and rf developed using stl mtl1 and mtl2 showed the best performances nse 0 67 and rmse 0 65 3 1 4 2 fao56 pm equation combined with machine learning models the performance of the fao56 pm equation combined with machine learning models used to estimate missing data is presented in fig 10 all the models had similar performance with a slight advantage for those that used ann and rf the models developed employing mtl and stl performed similarly as previously observed there were also performance gains by adding relative humidity as input for the temperature based models the best performing option was the pm ann stl fao56 pm combined with ann stl nse 0 53 rmse 0 78 mbe 0 15 and r2 0 74 for the temperature and relative humidity based models the fao56 pm combined with the ann models developed with stl mtl1 and mtl2 performed the best nse 0 66 rmse 0 65 and r2 0 80 3 1 5 overall evaluation as presented before the ann and rf models used individually or combined with the fao56 pm equation provided the best performances with a slight advantage for ann thus to better compare the different approaches used to estimate eto the performance of the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies and ann models developed considering single task and multi task learning individually used and combined with fao56 pm equation is presented in fig 11 when using only measured data on temperature the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on fao methodologies pm ori pm cal1 and pm cal2 in fig 11 performed better before both evaluated calibrations in contrast it performed better after the calibrations when using temperature and relative humidity as input data the performance loss observed for the temperature based equation is not expected since calibrations generally promote performance gains in addition regarding pm cal1 when evaluating the estimation of missing data after the calibrations although there was a slight decrease in the performance of the estimation of solar radiation the estimations of actual vapor pressure and wind speed were improved thus both calibration types evaluated pm cal1 and pm cal2 are expected to improve the estimation of eto to better investigate the cause of the performance loss in the temperature based fao56 pm equation after calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data pm cal1 fig 11 the performance of the fao56 pm equation using each one of the variables estimated i e solar radiation relative humidity actual vapor pressure and wind speed as the sole missing data was assessed fig 12 after the calibrations better eto estimates were obtained when considering actual vapor pressure and wind speed as missing data when considering solar radiation as missing data after the calibration a similar performance was observed with only a small increase in mbe 0 02 0 09 and a small decrease in r2 0 86 0 85 based on these results the calibrations are expected to improve the performance of the fao56 pm equation when using only measured data on temperature since only the performance of the estimation of solar radiation had a minimal decrease however a contrary behavior was observed fig 11 it is probably justified by the characteristics of the errors in the missing data estimated probably although the errors obtained with the non calibrated fao methodologies to estimate missing data are higher they were partially canceled out when considering the use of solar radiation actual vapor pressure and wind speed estimates simultaneously which justify the better performance of the fao56 pm equation with the non calibrated fao methodologies pm ori calibrating the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using the original fao methodologies through linear regression pm cal2 provided slightly better results in relation to pm cal1 in both temperature based and temperature and relative humidity based settings fig 11 although calibrating individual equations to estimate missing data can have a more in depth effect the calibration based on linear regression has the advantage of adjusting the model with a focus on the estimation of eto itself as previously mentioned in the temperature based setting even promoting better results than pm cal1 the pm cal2 model also performed slightly worse than the pm ori model it probably occurred due to some random difference between data used to calibrate and test the equation compared to the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using traditional methodologies i e pm ori pm cal1 and pm cal2 in fig 11 the machine learning models and their combinations with the fao56 pm equation performed better to estimate eto mainly the models based on temperature and relative humidity fig 11 for the temperature based models when comparing the non calibrated pm model pm ori which performed better than its calibrated versions pm cal1 and pm cal2 with the pm ann stl model which was the best machine learning model nse increased from 0 49 to 0 53 8 2 rmse decreased from 0 83 to 0 78 6 0 and r2 increased from 0 73 to 0 74 1 4 for the temperature and relative humidity based models when comparing the pm cal2 model which performed better than its other versions with the ann stl ann mtl1 and ann mtl2 models or rf stl rf mtl1 and rf mtl2 fig 9 which were the best machine learning models nse increased from 0 56 to 0 67 19 6 and rmse decreased from 0 74 to 0 65 12 2 overall the use of relative humidity in addition to temperature improved the performance of the models studied however for the non calibrated pm model pm ori although adding relative humidity decreased rmse from 0 83 to 0 80 3 6 nse reduced from 0 49 to 0 45 8 2 fig 11 this unexpected behavior observed for the pm ori model is probably due to the actual vapor pressure overestimation which occurred when using only temperature fig 7 mbe 0 32 which is at a certain point canceled out by the overestimated wind speed fig 8 mbe 0 58 it occurs since the actual vapor pressure overestimation led to eto underestimation and the wind speed overestimation led to eto overestimation canceling out part of the errors therefore when relative humidity data were added to the pm ori model the mentioned condition was no more achieved which can contribute to increase the errors in the estimation of eto at some weather stations however when a better wind speed value was considered i e pm cal1 adding relative humidity was translated into performance gains increasing nse from 0 44 to 0 55 25 0 similarly for the model calibrated using linear regression pm cal2 nse was increased from 0 46 to 0 56 21 7 when adding relative humidity by comparing the best temperature based and temperature and relative humidity based models to estimate eto i e pm ann stl and ann stl ann mtl1 ann mtl2 or rf developed with stl mtl1 and mtl2 respectively nse increased from 0 53 to 0 67 26 4 and rmse decreased from 0 78 to 0 65 16 7 3 2 clustering scenario as mentioned before ann and rf provided the best performances in estimating missing data and eto with a slight advantage for ann thus to better explore the potential of ann models and the fao56 pm equation we also developed calibrated them after dividing brazil into regions with similar climatic conditions clustering the clusters obtained using k means and data from worldclim are presented in fig 13 3 2 1 missing data and reference evapotranspiration the performance of the models developed for each cluster to estimate solar radiation actual vapor pressure and wind speed is presented in fig 14 as seen in the general scenario the ann models outperformed the fao methodologies used to estimate missing data in their original and calibrated forms and stl and mtl provided similar performances after the clustering similar results were found for solar radiation figs 6 and 14 for actual vapor pressure figs 7 and 14 there were considerable performance improvements increasing the best nse value from 0 40 to 0 53 however in the case of the calibrated fao methodology even increasing nse from 0 12 0 06 the performance was still poor since nse was very close to zero thus better approaches to calibrate the fao methodology used to estimate actual vapor pressure for brazil are necessary for wind speed figs 8 and 14 although the clustering increased nse and decreased rmse all models continued to have negative nse values which indicates their poor performance thus different approaches should be explored in the future to produce more reliable wind speed estimates by evaluating eto estimated after the clustering fig 15 as observed in the general scenario the ann models used individually and in combination with the fao56 pm equation outperformed the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated based on traditional methodologies original and calibrated using stl and mtl provided similar results as found in the general scenario regarding the calibration of the fao56 pm equation as observed in the general scenario in the temperature based setting the original equation performed slightly better than its calibrated version however in the temperature and relative humidity based setting both calibrations strategies promoted performance gains although pm cal1 and pm cal2 performed similarly pm cal2 showed slightly lower rmse values the optimal values of the calibration parameters used with the fao56 pm equation are provided in table 1 cluster 5 showed the lowest values of at krs and u2 this cluster is located mainly in northern brazil where amazon rainforest predominates this region is characterized by af and am climates fig 1 and high relative humidity and rainfall in addition to low wind speed thus minimum temperature tends to better approximate dew point temperature which justify the lowest at value the high rainfall levels which are related to high cloud cover reduce the proportion of solar radiation at surface in relation to extraterrestrial solar radiation which corroborates the lower krs value on the other hand cluster 4 showed the highest values of at and krs this cluster is located in a dryer region with aw as and bsh climates fig 1 thus under these conditions at is expected to assume a higher value to make minimum temperature closer to dew point temperature as found in this study in addition due to the lower rainfall levels lower cloud cover the proportion of solar radiation at surface in relation to extraterrestrial solar radiation is expect to be higher which increases the krs value clusters 1 2 and 3 exhibited similar values of at krs and u2 3 3 comparison of the general and clustering scenarios to compare the performance of the models developed to estimate eto for brazil as a whole and for regions with similar climatic conditions clusters mean values of nse rmse mbe and r2 over test stations are presented in table 2 the temperature based models performed better after the clustering in general after the clustering mean nse over the models assessed increased from 0 50 to 0 54 8 0 rmse reduced from 0 81 to 0 78 3 7 mbe reduced from 0 17 to 0 14 17 6 and r2 increased from 0 73 to 0 74 1 4 the best performance was obtained by the pm ann stl model with nse equal to 0 58 and rmse equal to 0 75 in contrast the temperature and relative humidity based models had similar performances in the general and clustering scenarios models developed to estimate eto based on limited input data are influenced by the local climatic conditions therefore when developing models for regions with more homogeneous characteristics they tend to better capture the relations between input data and eto attaining better performance than models developed for heterogeneous regions ferreira et al 2019 also found better performances when using a clustering strategy in brazil these authors reported higher performance gains for temperature based models in relation to temperature and relative humidity based models as observed in the present study in contrast althoff et al 2019 reported only small gains by clustering weather stations however it may have occurred due to the smaller study area lower climatic variability considered in the mentioned study in relation to the one considered in the present study as the temperature and relative humidity based models used to estimate eto were little affected by the clustering it can indicate that the regions clusters created were not efficient to overcome the missing of solar radiation and wind speed data it is also supported by the results presented in figs 6 7 8 and 14 in which it can be noted that in contrast to actual vapor pressure solar radiation estimation was generally not improved after the clustering and although wind speed estimation had some improvement it continues to obtain poor predictions after the clustering on the other hand actual vapor pressure estimation had a considerable performance increase 3 4 overall evaluation in both general and clustering scenarios the use of mtl did not provide strong performance changes in estimating eto showing similar results to those found using stl figs 9 10 and 15 the same behavior was observed in estimating the missing data considered figs 6 7 8 and 14 however it is worth mentioning that when in addition to the estimation of eto the estimations of solar radiation actual vapor pressure or relative humidity and wind speed are of interest the use of mtl can reduce the time and computational resources required to develop the machine learning models since only a single model is required to estimate all these variables although some studies have demonstrated performance gains by using mtl ng et al 2019 padarian et al 2019 it does not promote gains in all cases as found in the present study and also for nunes et al 2019 thus mtl should be considered as a tool with potential benefits for some tasks but it needs to be evaluated for each particular case another way to explore possible advantages of mtl in the estimation of eto which can be assessed in future studies is to add past and or future eto values e g 1 day ahead eto as auxiliary target variables overall the combination between machine learning models and the fao56 pm equation performed similarly to the machine learning models individually used in both general and clustering scenarios figs 9 10 11 and 15 using machine learning models to estimate missing data and the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto instead of using machine learning models to estimate eto directly can make the eto estimation process a little clearer however it requires the development and use of more models although the mars models used in the general scenario to estimate eto and missing data were not so good as the ann and rf models figs 6 10 in contrast to most machine learning models they can be used in the form of an algebraic mathematical equation which can simplify its usage for an end user in addition the mars models used individually or in combination with the fao56 pm equation presented better performance to estimate eto than the fao56 pm equation with the same input data figs 9 11 in the temperature and relative humidity based setting for the mars model used individually in relation to pm cal2 nse increased from 0 56 to 0 65 16 1 and rmse decreased from 0 74 to 0 67 9 5 for the temperature based models in relation to the pm ori model the use of mars provided only slight performance gains to estimate solar radiation actual vapor pressure relative humidity and wind speed the mars models performed better than the fao methodologies mainly when using temperature and relative humidity as input figs 6 8 to make the mars models developed in the present study available to the reader they are provided equations and an example spreadsheet as supplementary data appendix a the distribution of nse and mbe values over the brazilian territory for eto estimated in the general and clustering scenarios is presented in fig 16 for the fao56 pm equation with missing data estimated using traditional methodologies original and the best calibrated version and the ann models developed using stl and their combinations with the fao56 pm equation similarly mean nse values for each cluster defined using k means are presented in table 3 for the mentioned models and pm cal1 as previously observed using relative humidity data in addition to temperature in the non calibrated fao56 pm equation pm ori resulted in worse eto estimation higher mbe values and lower nse values at some weather however it promoted better results higher nse values in both general and clustering scenarios when using the fao56 pm equation calibrated and the machine learning models used individually and in combination with the fao56 pm equation fig 16 and table 3 overall the temperature based models from the general scenario performed poorly in northern brazil fig 16 which is associated with clusters 1 and 5 table 3 it is probably associated with the lower weather stations density in this region which makes the models developed less adapted to this region however when considering the clustering approach better performances were obtained in this case the models were able to better capture the relations between the input variables and eto since they were developed for a more homogeneous region adding relative humidity data also improved the results found in northern brazil in the general scenario the use of relative humidity was an important factor in reducing eto overestimation high positive mbe values in northern brazil and reducing eto underestimation high negative mbe values in northeastern brazil keeping mbe values closer to zero overall the temperature and relative humidity based machine learning models and their combinations with the fao56 pm equation provided the best performances with higher nse values and lower mbe absolute values in both general and clustering scenarios the best performances were found for clusters 2 and 3 in both general and clustering approaches after the clustering cluster 4 had its performance reduced in relation to the general scenario which indicates that this cluster was not well defined for eto estimation purposes given the high climatic variability in the brazilian territory it is hard to develop general models to estimate eto with good accuracy in any part of the country especially when using temperature based models to achieve higher performances future studies could investigate the use of extra information as input for the models such as geographical coordinates elevation long term gridded data obtained from ground data interpolation or satellite data and other variables that can help the algorithms to achieve better performances defining regions with similar climatic conditions can also improve the performance of the models as found in the present study future studies can better explore different approaches to apply clustering such as choosing the best input variables and testing different clustering algorithms 4 conclusions in both general and clustering scenarios using simple linear regression to calibrate the fao56 pm equation provided slightly better results than calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data unexpectedly the temperature based fao56 pm equation provided better eto estimates before both calibration types assessed which may be due to some random difference between data used to calibrate and test the equation when using temperature and relative humidity data better results were observed after both calibration types reducing mean rmse from 0 80 up to 0 74 mm d 1 in the general and clustering scenarios overall the machine learning models performed better than the fao56 pm equation to estimate eto and better than the original and calibrated fao methodologies to estimate missing data in both general and clustering scenarios when combining machine learning models with the fao56 pm equation performance improvements were not observed obtaining results similar to those found using machine learning models individually using multi task learning mtl to develop ann and rf models did not provide strong performance changes similar results were obtained in relation to using single task learning stl in the general scenario for the temperature based models pm ann stl performed the best to estimate eto increasing mean nse from 0 49 to 0 53 8 2 and decreasing mean rmse from 0 83 to 0 78 6 0 in relation to the non calibrated fao56 pm equation which performed better than its calibrated versions for the temperature and relative humidity based models the ann and rf models developed using stl and mtl performed the best increasing nse from 0 56 to 0 67 19 6 and decreasing rmse from 0 74 to 0 65 12 2 in relation to the fao56 pm equation calibrated using linear regression which performed better than its other versions when dividing brazil into five climatically homogeneous groups clustering performance gains were obtained in estimating eto for the temperature based machine learning models and the calibrated fao56 pm equation the best model pm ann stl showed mean nse and rmse equal to 0 58 and 0 75 mm d 1 respectively the temperature and relative humidity based models were little affected by the clustering similarly better estimates of actual vapor pressure and wind speed were obtained after the clustering among the machine learning models assessed overall ann and rf performed the best with a slight advantage for ann although the mars models showed inferior performance they generally performed better than the original and calibrated fao approaches to estimate eto and missing data especially when using temperature and relative humidity data thus the mars models developed are made available as supplementary data appendix a equations and an example spreadsheet declaration of competing interest

bm280 and 46 71 and 40 7 for bm220 respectively as compared to bm160 the nue for bm280 decreased by 30 56 and 18 25 compared to bm160 and bm220 respectively the scenario simulations showed that 200 kg

sources dinnes et al 2002 albornoz et al 2016 li et al 2020 due to the high temperature and low precipitation in the arid region plastic film mulching pm is an important agricultural technique to preserve soil moisture berger et al 2013 dai et al 2021 liu et al 2021 and improve nue chen et al 2020 thus pm has been extensively used for crop production worldwide its use has increased from 4 4

al 2019 if the plastic film recovery system is not efficient mostly a third of plastic film gets accumulated into the soil adversely affecting agriculture and the environment jambeck et al 2015 the biodegradable film contains starch based material cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate which disintegrate into co2 and h2o after a certain period and have similar mulching effects to that of plastic films touchaleaume et al 2016 moreno et al 2017 khalil et al 2018 thus for the development of green agriculture it is crucial to replace plastic films with biodegradable film mulching bm moreno et al 2017 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b chen et al 2020 current bm studies are focusing primarily on the effects of bm on soil temperature water and crop yield saglam et al 2017 gu et al 2017 costa et al 2014 wang et al 2019a the n dynamics in a field for bm has not been well studied the n cycle in a field for bm was found to be more complex than pm as the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film increased dynamically with the crop season and the mulching duration was lower than that of pm during the later growth stage chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b multiple studies demonstrated an array of positive effects of pm on n utilization and mineralization hai et al 2015 for instance pm increased n retention within the root zone li et al 2017 which caused a higher n uptake and use efficiency by the crop for pm kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 however mulching during the whole growth season could lead to excessive n mineralization and decreased crop yields ghosh et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 bm and pm showed similar no3 n dynamics during the early growing season and through comparative analysis it was found that the no3 n leaching and uptake of pm were higher than that of bm chen et al 2020 however these studies overlooked the effects of bm on crop growth and only aimed at the dripped sandy field although no3 n leaching and uptake have been widely studied the n management optimization for specific conditions demands further investigation li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2020 field experiments are challenging due to several factors such as time labor and funding these challenges can be overcome by employing mathematical models several mathematical models such as crop environment resource synthesis ceres soil water atmosphere plant swap world food studies wofost aquacrop denitrification decomposition dndc models and so on can successfully simulate the effects of agriculture cultivation methods on crop growth and water and nutrition cycle and evaluate no3 n leaching uptake and nue jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the dndc model could well simulate hydrological and nutrient transport processes crop growth abdalla et al 2020 and accurately capture ch4 nh3 and n2o emissions zhao et al 2020 lv et al 2020 banger et al 2020 and no3 n leaching loss liu et al 2020a under different n treatments at the point scale and regional scale deng et al 2016 liu et al 2020b chi et al 2020 banger et al 2020 used dndc model to simulate different nitrogen application scenarios and found that when the traditional nitrogen application decreased by 23 32 the yield increased by 3 4 and the nitrogen loss n2o emissions nh3 volatilization and no3 n leaching decreased significantly besides it has been applied across multiple agroecosystems worldwide and encouraging results were seen giltrap and ausseil 2016 jungers et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 since the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film increased eventually from beginning to end period of growth wang et al 2019a most of the models were difficult to be simulated by the n dynamics for bm although no3 n content leaching and uptake were successfully simulated by hydrus 2d model chen et al 2020 it showed multiple limitations such as only passive no3 n uptake was considered crop growth was not stimulated and disintegration was discontinued through manual settings han et al 2014 improved the dndc model which can be used to evaluate the impact of film mulching on gas emissions soil environment and crop growth by adjusting the daily coverage fraction yu et al 2017 2018 at the same time chen et al 2019a successfully simulated soil temperature soil moisture content soil n2o emission and crop yield under different mulches no film mulching straw mulching and plastic film mulching using the improved dndc model these results demonstrated that the dndc model accurately predicted the nitrogen dynamic and crop growth under varied climate and film mulch conditions at the study site the traditional application amount of n fertilizer exceeds crop requirement zhang et al 2015 and so excessive n enters into the atmosphere or groundwater culminating in environmental pollution through simulation liu et al 2016 found that the optimized nitrogen application system could increase crop yield by 1 19 and reduce nitrogen leaching by 29 52 thus it is essential to determine the critical n amount to make higher nue and less n pollution although different n application amounts have been experimented and simulated liu et al 2016 very few studies have explored the effects of different topdressing n amounts on no3 n content leaching uptake and nue specifically for both experiments and simulation the strategy of topdressing n application was crucial in n management due to a higher impact on no3 n content leaching uptake and nue for topdressing n fertilizer than base n fertilizer during the crop growth stage wang et al 2019b gu et al 2019 singh et al 2020 however the effects of different mulching and topdressing n amount on the n cycle and utilization especially for both experiments and simulation for bm demands further investigation thus the novelty of this study is to systematically evaluate the difference of nitrogen dynamic e g no3 n content n leaching n uptake and n use efficiency among different mulching treatments and different topdressing n amount furthermore the topdressing n amount under biodegradable film mulching was further optimized using dndc model the primary objectives of this study are i to calibrate and validate the dndc model for an arid cornfield for different mulching treatments pm bm and nm and different topdressing n amounts for bm ii to evaluate no3 n content leaching uptake and nue for different mulching and topdressing n amounts and iii to identify critical topdressing n amount for bm 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field experiments were conducted during 2016 2017 at the muleitan water saving

wall corresponding to the measured depth and soil tensiometers were installed at a depth of 50 140 cm and 40 60 cm below the soil surface on film and between films before planting corn seedling these instruments were used to measure vertical water fluxes and collect soil solutions li et al 2015 chen et al 2020 iqbal et al 2020 the leached water samples were collected after irrigation and rainfall

affected by soil temperature soil moisture ph oxidation reduction potential eh and substrate concentration it calculates the nitrification and denitrification reactions and fermentation rates in different soil profiles based on various soil parameters and later estimates n content gas and methane emissions obtained by each reaction li et al 1992a 1992b jungers et al 2019 the dndc model uses generalized crop growth curves to estimate crop growth n balance and leaching water and no3 n uptake and the effects of water and n stress on crop growth intricately linking crop growth biogeochemistry and climatic factors it provides an excellent modeling framework for stimulating n processes in agroecosystems zhao et al 2020 dndc model requires input data including the geographical

on the climatic and irrigation data are shown in fig 2 a detailed description of the soil properties and fertilization is provided in the introduction of the field experiment in the simulation the disintegrated area of the film was considered and biodegradable and plastic film differed vastly chen et al 2019b the disintegrated and coverage fraction for plastic and biodegradable film was obtained by measurement and the average value from two measurements was used in the dndc model fig 3 the model parameters maximum biomass biomass fraction thermal degree days optimum temperature and n fixation index were determined using a manual reverse calibration method table 2 the method mainly includes three steps the first step the recommenced parameters in model were used to simulate soil no3 n concentration no3 n leaching and crop no3 n uptake the second step the statistical difference r 2 nse and rmse of simulated and observed value were calculated using the corresponding equations the third step when the error of simulated and observed value exceeds the standard value giltrap et al 2016 jungers et al 2019 lv et al 2020 the model parameters were further manually adjusted until the error meet the requirement of modeling 2 4 scenario simulation scenario simulation and prediction tests were carried out using the dndc model to explore the critical topdressing n amount for bm pm and nm the topdressing n amount used by local farmers was close to 300 kg ha 1 on this basis with 50 kg ha 1 as topdressing n application gradient decreased to 0 kg ha 1 and increased to 400 kg ha 1 respectively 0 50 100 150 200 250 350 and 400 kg ha 1 to select critical topdressing n amount the dndc model was used to simulate and predict the no3 n uptake leaching yield and nue for pm bm and nm in this study we defined the critical topdressing n amount as the no3 n uptake and yield of corn that did not increase clearly with continuously increasing topdressing n amount additionally the bm coverage fraction at harvest was measured at 30 cf30 to explore the effects of different degradation fraction of bm on no3 n uptake leaching yield and nue of corn under the critical topdressing n amount the film mulching scenarios with 0 cf0 no film mulching 10 cf10 50 cf50 70 cf70 89 cf89 no degradation coverage fraction at harvest were simulated and predicted using the dndc model 2 5

n where s i and m i are simulated and observed values respectively s m and m m are their average values n is the number of observed values rmse value closer to 0 is associated with better simulation outcomes as well as the nse and r 2 values closer to 1 indicating that the simulation values are more consistent with the measured values with higher accuracy of the model qiu et al 2021 3 results 3 1 dndc model calibration validation and performance evaluation the parameters of the dndc model were manually calibrated by the measured data in 2016 and then validated by the corresponding data in 2017 the specific optimization parameters were shown in table 3 the dndc model effectively captured the no3 n dynamics and corn yield for different topdressing n amounts and mulching conditions the simulation results of no3 n content in 0 50 cm soil layer no3 n leaching below 50 cm soil layer corn no3 n uptake and yield were in line with the manually observed data the determination coeﬃcient r 2 nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and rmse root mean square error for no3 n content during the calibration periods 2016 was 0 96 0 94 and 7 6 kg ha 1 respectively 0 98 0 96 and 3 0 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n leaching 0 98 0 98 and 0 1 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n uptake and 0 99 0 8 and 776 5 kg ha 1 respectively for yield table 4 average values for r 2 nse and rmse during the validation periods 2017 were 0 95 0 94 and 7 9 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n content 0 93 0 88 and 3 6 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n leaching 0 98 0 96 and 0 16 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n uptake 0 94 0 77 and 817 5 kg ha 1 respectively for yield thus the dndc model could be used to predict and evaluate the no3 n dynamics utilization and corn yield for different mulching conditions and different topdressing n amounts table 5 3 2 the differences of soil no3 n content under different treatments n fertilizer application markedly increased the no3 n content in the 0 50 cm soil layer and in the experiments it showed two peaks at the jointing stage and heading stage under topdressing n fertilizer fig 4 the average no3 n content for film mulching treatments pm280 and bm280 was higher by 19 52 than no film mulching treatment nm280 in 2016 and 2017 no remarkable differences in no3 n content between bm280 and pm280 were observed during the corn crop s early growth stage 0 60 days after sowing das with no disintegration of the biodegradable film and no3 n content was 57 11 and 57 28 kg ha 1 for bm280 and pm280 in 2016 and 2017 respectively during the middle growth stage 61 107 das of corn crops the biodegradable film had a small disintegration area the average no3 n content of bm280 was only 1 63 lower than that of pm280 in 2016 and 2017 after 108 das during corn s late growth stage the disintegration fraction of the biodegradable film was 59 26 which was markedly higher than plastic film 1 76 at the same time the no3 n content for bm280 decreased by an average of 8 81 in 2016 and 2017 compared to pm280 due to an increase of ammonia volatilization however the average no3 n content for bm280 increased by 59 7 in 2016 and 2017 compared to nm with the increase of topdressing n amount the no3 n content for bm increased fig 4 the no3 n content was the same before the first topdressing n fertilization 50 das application after topdressing n fertilizer application n moved into the soil with irrigation the two no3 n content peaks appeared and the average no3 n content was 67 13 97 06 and 126 49 kg ha 1 for bm160 bm220 and bm280 respectively with topdressing n of 80 110 and 140 kg ha 1 each time in 55 and 90 das in 2016 and 56 and 91 das in 2017 additionally the no3 n content in the 0 50 cm soil layer for bm160 was lower than other treatments it decreased by 53 91 and 66 79 for the first and second topdressing periods in the two years respectively as compared to the bm280 on average the no3 n content for bm280 was 46 71 higher than bm220 and 149 03 higher than the bm160 thus the no3 n content in the 50 cm soil layer was positively correlated with the topdressing n amount the correlation between soil layer no3 n content and topdressing n amount was established using the following formula y 0 27x 21 64 and r 2 0 99 y is average no3 n content during which period x is the amount of topdressing n for the period between first topdressing and corn harvest 3 3 the differences of soil no3 n leaching under different treatments the corn root zone is primarily located in a 0 50 cm deep soil layer and the dndc model can be employed to calculate soil no3 n leaching at 50 cm of soil depth zhang et al 2015 the no3 n leaching was primarily observed after irrigation or precipitation no apparent differences were observed during the early crop growth stage for no3 n leaching between pm280 bm280 and nm280 fig 5 however no3 n leaching for nm280 was lower than pm280 and bm280 after topdressing n fertilization and the difference was exceptionally low for no3 n leaching between pm280 and bm280 since the soil solute gradient under pm280 and bm280 was close for instance the no3 n leaching for bm280 pm280 and nm280 was 54 00 54 62 and 45 24 kg ha 1 respectively post first topdressing n fertilization and 49 73 50 21 and 32 76 kg ha 1 respectively post second topdressing n fertilization additionally intensive precipitation events occurred in late corn growth period in 2016 the no3 n leaching for bm280 increased by 23 46 as compared to pm280 and the cum nl difference for bm280 and pm280 was remarkably reduced cumulative no3 n leaching cum nl also was affected by film mulching and cum nl was lower for nm280 as compared to film mulching the cum nl of nm280 was 20 39 lower than that of pm280 and 19 79 lower than that of bm280 in 2016 and 2017 the no3 n leaching increased with increasing no3 n content in the 0 50 cm soil layer after first and second topdressing n fertilization fig 5 before topdressing n fertilization application the no3 n leaching in bm280 bm220 and bm160 were similar with increasing topdressing n fertilization the no3 n leaching also increased the average value of bm280 was 40 12 higher than that of bm220 114 91 of bm160 on das 67 84 and 97 in 2016 and 54 58 190 4 in 2017 respectively the relationship between no3 n leaching and the amount of topdressing n was estimated using the following equation y 0 22x 17 13 r 2 0 89 y is average no3 n leaching during the period x is the amount of topdressing n for cum nl when topdressing n amount increased from 160 to 280 kg ha 1 it increased by 78 71 kg ha 1 and more than 65 of nitrogen fertilizer was going to the groundwater as no3 n 3 4 the differences of n balance and use efficiency under different treatments compared with pm280 the no3 n uptake yield and cumulative no3 n leaching cum nl of bm280 decreased slightly which showed an average decrease of 1 44 4 and 0 75 respectively in both years table 3 with the decrease of film coverage fraction the n volatilized by gas in bm280 increased by 10 91 compared to pm280 but the residual soil nitrogen rn decreased by 10 09 as a whole film mulching bm280 and pm280 promoted no3 n uptake and increased corn yield during growth period the no3 n uptake and yield for pm280 were markedly higher than nm280 with an average increase of 11 05 and 13 76 and bm280 increased by 9 44 and 9 21 in both years respectively however as compared to nm280 cum nl and rn in the soil increased by 24 67 and 79 91 for bm280 and 25 61 and 81 88 for pm280 in 2016 and 2017 respectively and gas volatilization decreased by 78 and 81 34 for bm280 and pm280 respectively based on the simulation data of bm280 and pm280 nitrogen use efficiency nue nitrogen physiological use efficiency npue nitrogen uptake efficiency nute and nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp decreased by an average of 2 04 3 57 1 46 and 4 01 respectively and these factors did not differ markedly in both years for bm280 table 3 the nue npue nute and npfp increased remarkably for film mulching treatments as compared to nm280 nue npue nute and npfp increased with an average of 16 36 3 13 11 05 and 13 79 respectively for pm280 than nm280 and 13 98 0 55 9 43 and 9 22 respectively for bm280 the n balance component and yield for different topdressing n amounts showed remarkable differences when the topdressing n amount increased from 160 to 220 kg ha 1 the no3 n uptake cum nl gas volatilization and yield increased by 5 85 40 7 21 96 and 17 76 respectively in 2016 and 2017 besides when topdressing n amount was increased to 280 kg ha 1 the no3 n uptake and yield decreased by 0 33 and 0 76 respectively cum nl and gas volatilization increased by 33 14 and 16 86 respectively the soil rn for bm160 was exceptionally low and 98 42 lower than that of bm220 the soil rn was 64 77 lower for bm220 than bm280 however with increasing topdressing n amount nue decreased for bm280 nue decreased by 18 25 and 30 56 nute decreased by 18 14 and 32 19 and npfp decreased by 18 47 and 27 03 as compared to bm220 and bm160 respectively in both the years however the bm220 showed the highest npue with an average value of 72 47 kg kg 1 in 2016 and 2017 which was 0 56 higher than bm280 and 11 73 higher than bm160 in both years comprehensive nitrogen fertilizer efficiency for bm220 was higher with an average yield of 11 343 17 kg ha 1 nue of 40 49 npue of 72 47 nute of 57 56 and npfp of 41 1 were observed during 2016 and 2017 respectively thus it emerged as the most appropriate n fertilization management strategy for bm in the arid region by considering corn yield and nue 3 5 simulate and predict the fertilization system and the mulching film system the dndc model was used to construct various mulching film mulching crop growth models under different n application gradients fig 6 crop no3 n uptake cum nl yield and nue simulation results were compared to obtain the most suitable fertilization system there was no significant difference in no3 n uptake and yield between bm and pm but the no3 n uptake and yield of bm and pm were markedly higher than nm without n fertilizer application no3 n uptake and yield of film mulching pm bm treatments increased by 13 66 and 12 74 compared to nm with the increase of topdressing n amount from 0 to 400 kg ha 1 the no3 n uptake and yield difference among film mulching treatments and nm gradually decreased at the peak of no3 n uptake and yield film mulching treatments increased by 5 75 and 11 51 compared to nm respectively although the yield increasing effect of bm was lower than that of pm it was not significant at the same time compared with nm the cum nl of film mulching increased by 3 46 27 93 and nue increased by 2 59 14 2 with the increasing topdressing n amount no3 n uptake leaching and yield increased rapidly under different mulching treatments as per the outcomes of the multi scenario simulation 200 kg ha 1 topdressing n amount under biodegradable film mulching resulted in 11 366 53 kg ha 1 the yield 159 kg ha 1 no3 n uptake 122 02 kg ha 1 of cum nl and 43 14 nue which were 2 57 0 79 0 89 and 0 83 respectively when topdressing n amount continuously increased the no3 n uptake and corn yield did not change markedly but cum nl continued to increase linearly the linear relationship between cum nl and topdressing n amount was y 0 6x 5 96 r 2 0 95 however the changing trend of nue was opposite to that of no3 n leaching and it showed a downward trend therefore the critical topdressing n amount was 200 kg ha 1 under biodegradable film mulching in the arid region which was the most reasonable topdressing n fertilizer system in this area the above selected fertilization system was employed to adjust the film coverage fraction in different periods and establish crop growth models under film mulching with different degradation rates to simulate and predict the yield no3 n uptake cum nl and nue under 89 cf89 70 cf70 50 cf50 30 cf30 10 cf10 and no mulching cf0 film coverage fraction at harvest the yield no3 n uptake cum nl and nue values of film mulching treatments were markedly higher than those of cf0 with an average increase of 16 12 21 24 73 and 11 67 respectively fig 7 with the decreasing coverage fraction crop no3 n uptake yield cum nl and nue declined gradually but the cum nl difference in film mulching treatment was slightly less the decrease in no3 n uptake yield and nue plateaued under cf50 compared with cf50 no3 n uptake yield and nue in cf10 decreased by 1 13 2 37 and 1 44 respectively with 157 32 kg ha 1 of no3 n uptake 11 132 1 kg ha 1 of yield 121 33 kg ha 1 of cum nl and 42 54 of nue 4 discussion 4 1 soil n dynamics no 3n uptake and nue for different n fertilization management strategies there was no difference between no3 n content and no3 n leaching in the early stage of each treatment due to the same amount of nitrogen application in base fertilizer however the no3 n content increased with the increase of n application amount and the linear relationship was y 0 27x 21 64 r 2 0 99 fig 4 multiple studies have reported similar findings chakwizira et al 2015 holman et al 2019 for instance chen et al 2020 found that n application decreased by 25 and 50 and soil no3 n content decreased by 24 5 and 43 9 respectively the no3 n leaching also showed an upward trend in our study a linear correlation was observed between topdressing n amount and cum nl based on the following equation y 0 6x 5 96 r 2 0 95 fig 6 this is because no3 n with a negative charge is hardly adsorbed by clay minerals or organic matter no3 n exists in the liquid phase in soil or sediment which migrates easily and freely in soil resulting in larger no3 n leaching hou et al 2012 filipović et al 2016 and environmental pollution risks such as surface water and groundwater are high russo et al 2017 gao et al 2020 becker et al 2007 similarly found that the risk of n pollution in groundwater depends mainly on the input n into farmland in the form of inorganic fertilizers cui et al 2010 further found that the no3 n leaching pollution poses a serious concern for crop production specifically for intensive agricultural systems which are adversely affected by the excessive use of n fertilizers although the no3 n leaching in low n application amount was lower the yield was also lower preventing the full growth potential of crops thus no3 n leaching crop growth and nue should be considered while formulating an effective fertilization system crop no3 n uptake included active no3 n uptake related to the n assimilation ability of plants and passive no3 n uptake related to soil solute potential in general increased n fertilization application and no3 n content result in high soil solute potential increasing no3 n uptake when topdressing n amount was increased from 160 to 220 kg ha 1 crop no3 n uptake increased by 5 85 and yield increased by 17 76 table 3 however when topdressing n amount increased to 280 kg ha 1 no3 n uptake and yield decreased by 0 33 and 0 76 respectively in contrast in a study by xue et al 2017 when topdressing n amount increased from 0 to 300 kg ha 1 the castor seeds yield continuously increased and when n application amount increased to 400 kg ha 1 castor seeds yield continuously decreased by 7 24 this may be due to the different irrigation systems since the irrigation depth and n fertilizer application amount in a border irrigation field were obviously higher than that of dripped irrigation field moreover the irrigation times of border irrigation also was less than that of dripped irrigation thus soil no3 n content in root zone for a border irrigation field significantly decreased compared with dripped irrigation which avoiding the negative effects of n stress on crop growth osaki et al 1991 at the same time the nue decreased with the increasing n application amount thus the critical amount of n fertilizer is essential for increasing crop yield and decreasing cum nl in our study the scenario simulation based on the dndc model showed critical topdressing n amount to be 200 kg ha 1 for bm fig 6 in the arid region under this topdressing n fertilization system higher yield 11 366 53 kg ha 1 no3 n uptake 159 kg ha 1 and nue 43 14 and lower no3 n leaching 122 02 kg ha 1 can be guaranteed when the topdressing n amount was increased continuously the no3 n uptake and yield of corn remained unaffected while cum nl and nue showed a linear increase and decrease trend respectively the similar critical topdressing n amount also be recommended by previous literature for example jaime et al 2001 found that when the amount of topdressing n was 200 kg ha 1 no no3 n accumulation was found in the soil layer during the harvest period zhang et al 2015 estimated the acceptable yield and cum nl of the planting system according to the dndc model and found that the critical n fertilization amount for corn yield was found to be 150 240 kg ha 1 4 2 soil n dynamics crop n uptake and nue for different film mulching the film mulching markedly decreased n volatilization and increased no3 n uptake and no3 n content average no3 n content increased 19 52 than nm280 during whole growth period under film mulching fig 4 additionally different film mulching showed different effects on soil environment and crop growth in the study the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film was less in 0 107 days after sowing and there was no significant difference in no3 n content between bm280 and pm280 however the disintegration fraction of biodegradable film 59 26 was significantly higher than plastic film 1 76 at harvest which resulted in no3 n content of bm280 decreased by 8 81 compared with that of pm280 at the same time no3 n leaching was also related to the film coverage area although the biodegradable film disintegrated in large areas and increased gas volatilization it also increased water infiltration flux and no3 n leaching in 2016 the heavy precipitation events occurred in the late growth stage of corn resulting in a 23 46 increase in bm280 no3 n leaching compared to pm280 thus the cum nl difference between bm280 and pm280 was markedly reduced this was in line with a study by chen et al 2020 which reported that precipitation could lead to the migration of no3 n in surface soil layer to the deep soil layer no3 n leaching caused due to precipitation with biodegradable film mulching increased by 6 5 compared to plastic film mulching additionally no3 n uptake crop yield and nue under bm280 were decreased compared with pm280 but the difference was insignificant this was because with the growth period the soil environment under different film mulching changed the evapotranspiration of bm280 increased and soil water and no3 n uptake decreased zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2017 gu et al 2017 thus the biodegradable film is a perfect alternative to the plastic film although the no3 n content of nm280 was lower than bm280 but the no3 n uptake yield and nue of bm280 were also remarkably lower which decreased by 9 44 9 21 and 16 36 respectively than in bm280 besides the gas volatilization of bm280 was 78 lower than that of nm280 considering the four aspects of no3 n uptake leaching yield and nue it was found that biodegradable film mulching was a more reasonable agricultural measure the biodegradable film mulching with different degradation fraction will also cause differences in soil water n and crop growth according to the results of scenario simulations based on dndc model and this study found that yield nue and no3 n uptake decreased with the decrease in coverage fraction however yin et al 2019 found a different result that the yield for bm with a moderate degradation fraction was higher than bm with a slow degradation fraction this may be the result of the difference in climatic conditions in the current study the precipitation during the growth period was less only 89 mm and the supply of soil moisture was limited thus intense soil evaporation restricted root uptake ability and decreased corresponding crop yield in this region besides the coverage fraction decreased by 50 cf50 and the decline rate plateaued however the yield 2 37 nue 1 44 and no3 n uptake 1 13 of cf10 did not decrease remarkably compared to cf50 fig 7 the cum nl increased with an increase in coverage fraction but a 10 higher coverage fraction did not affect cum nl this was because the volatilization of n decreased and no3 n uptake increased to reach a perfect balance shahzad et al 2019 yin et al 2019 xu et al 2020 mo et al 2020 therefore the selection of biodegradable films with different degradation rates should consider the local climatic conditions 5 conclusions the results of the dndc simulation and experiment showed that during the early growth period the mulching effects between bm and pm were similar and the n dynamics showed insignificant differences however the differences increased gradually and insignificantly with increasing disintegration area of biodegradable film in the cornfield during the later growth stage thus the biodegradable film can be an excellent alternative to a plastic film in an arid region no3 n content uptake cum nl and yield increased with increasing topdressing n amount however for bm the yield and no3 n uptake did not change significantly at 200 kg ha 1 topdressing n additionally no3 n leaching increased linearly and nue decreased with increasing topdressing n amount thus the critical topdressing n amount was 200 kg ha 1 under biodegradable film mulching in the arid region this study provided insights into no3 n content leaching uptake balance and use efficiency in the arid cornfield under biodegradable film mulching these novel results of this study could help the personnel engaged in agro technical to better understand the mechanisms of difference in no3 n dynamics under bm and pm besides the critical topdressing n recommended by this study could

8 81 0 75 and 2 04 than pm280 respectively no3 n content and cum nl increased markedly with increasing concentration of topdressing n no3 n content and cum nl was increased by 149 03 and 87 33 for bm280 and 46 71 and 40 7 for bm220 respectively as compared to bm160 the nue for bm280 decreased by 30 56 and 18 25 compared to bm160 and bm220 respectively the scenario simulations showed that 200 kg

biodegradable film contains starch based material cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate which disintegrate into co2 and h2o after a certain period and have similar mulching effects to that of plastic films touchaleaume et al 2016 moreno et al 2017 khalil et al 2018 thus for the development of green agriculture it is crucial to replace plastic films with biodegradable film mulching bm moreno et al 2017 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b chen et al 2020 current bm studies are focusing primarily on the effects of bm on soil temperature water and crop yield saglam et al 2017 gu et al 2017 costa et al 2014 wang et al 2019a the n dynamics in a field for bm has not been well studied the n cycle in a field for bm was found to be more complex than pm as the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film increased dynamically with the crop season and the mulching duration was lower than that of pm during the later growth stage chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b multiple studies demonstrated an array of positive effects of pm on n utilization and mineralization hai et al 2015 for instance pm increased n retention within the root zone li et al 2017 which caused a higher n uptake and use efficiency by the crop for pm kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 however mulching during the whole growth season could lead to excessive n mineralization and decreased crop yields ghosh et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 bm and pm showed similar no3 n dynamics during the early growing season and through comparative analysis it was found that the no3 n leaching and uptake of pm were higher than that of bm chen et al 2020 however these studies overlooked the effects of bm on crop growth and only aimed at the dripped sandy field although no3 n leaching and uptake have been widely studied the n management optimization for specific conditions demands further investigation li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2020 field experiments are challenging due to several factors such as time labor and funding these challenges can be overcome by employing mathematical models several mathematical models such as crop environment resource synthesis ceres soil water atmosphere plant swap world food studies wofost aquacrop denitrification decomposition dndc models and so on can successfully simulate the effects of agriculture cultivation methods on crop growth and water and nutrition cycle and evaluate no3 n leaching uptake and nue jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the dndc model could well simulate hydrological and nutrient transport processes crop growth abdalla et al 2020 and accurately capture ch4 nh3 and n2o emissions zhao et al 2020 lv et al 2020 banger et al 2020 and no3 n leaching loss liu et al 2020a under different n treatments at the point scale and regional scale deng et al 2016 liu et al 2020b chi et al 2020 banger et al 2020 used dndc model to simulate different nitrogen application scenarios and found that when the traditional nitrogen application decreased by 23 32 the yield increased by 3 4 and the nitrogen loss n2o emissions nh3 volatilization and no3 n leaching decreased significantly besides it has been applied across multiple agroecosystems worldwide and encouraging results were seen giltrap and ausseil 2016 jungers et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 since the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film increased eventually from beginning to end period of growth wang et al 2019a most of the models were difficult to be simulated by the n dynamics for bm although no3 n content leaching and uptake were successfully simulated by hydrus 2d model chen et al 2020 it showed multiple limitations such as only passive no3 n uptake was considered crop growth was not stimulated and disintegration was discontinued through manual settings han et al 2014 improved the dndc model which can be used to evaluate the impact of film mulching on gas emissions soil environment and crop growth by adjusting the daily coverage fraction yu et al 2017 2018 at the same time chen et al 2019a successfully simulated soil temperature soil moisture content soil n2o emission and crop yield under different mulches no film mulching straw mulching and plastic film mulching using the improved dndc model these results demonstrated that the dndc model accurately predicted the nitrogen dynamic and crop growth under varied climate and film mulch conditions at the study site the traditional application amount of n fertilizer exceeds crop requirement zhang et al 2015 and so excessive n enters into the atmosphere or groundwater culminating in environmental pollution through simulation liu et al 2016 found that the optimized nitrogen application system could increase crop yield by 1 19 and reduce nitrogen leaching by 29 52 thus it is essential to determine the critical n amount to make higher nue and less n pollution although different n application amounts have been experimented and simulated liu et al 2016 very few studies have explored the effects of different topdressing n amounts on no3 n content leaching uptake and nue specifically for both experiments and simulation the strategy of topdressing n application was crucial in n management due to a higher impact on no3 n content leaching uptake and nue for topdressing n fertilizer than base n fertilizer during the crop growth stage wang et al 2019b gu et al 2019 singh et al 2020 however the effects of different mulching and topdressing n amount on the n cycle and utilization especially for both experiments and simulation for bm demands further investigation thus the novelty of this study is to systematically evaluate the difference of nitrogen dynamic e g no3 n content n leaching n uptake and n use efficiency among different mulching treatments and different topdressing n amount furthermore the topdressing n amount under biodegradable film mulching was further optimized using dndc model the primary objectives of this study are i to calibrate and validate the dndc model for an arid cornfield for different mulching treatments pm bm and nm and different topdressing n amounts for bm ii to evaluate no3 n content leaching uptake and nue for different mulching and topdressing n amounts and iii to identify critical topdressing n amount for bm 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field experiments were conducted during 2016 2017 at the muleitan water saving

irrigation and fertilization the no3 n content was determined using the semi micro kjeldahl method bremner and keeney 1965 soil samples were air dried crushed mixed and sifted using a 1 mm sieve later 5 g soil samples were extracted with 25 ml potassium chloride solution 2 mol l 1 subsequently the soil samples were filtered after oscillating soil samples for 1 h and no3 n in the soil was determined

during harvest to determine the grain number per corn the 100 grain weight and yield per hectare of farmland mueller and vyn 2018 self made field lysimeters a closed pvc tube with holes on its tube wall corresponding to the measured depth and soil tensiometers were installed at a depth of 50 140 cm and 40 60 cm below the soil surface on film and between films before planting corn seedling these instruments were used to measure vertical water fluxes and collect soil solutions li et al 2015 chen et al 2020 iqbal et al 2020 the leached water samples were collected after irrigation and rainfall and the remaining water samples were removed after each collection the no3 n leaching was determined by multiplying the average concentration of no3 n in two positions below the soil surface on film and between films with the corresponding leakage quantity three fixed areas were randomly arranged for each plot and a digital camera canon eosrebelt3 japan was used to capture images the distance between the camera and the surface of the film was about 25 cm images were processed by geometric correction and background subtraction and images were imported into autocad2010 software autodesk inc usa to calculate the coverage and disintegration fraction of the film chen et al 2020 the film coverage and disintegration fraction are shown in fig 3 four different types of n efficiencies nitrogen

from dndc model 2 3 denitrification decomposition dndc model han et al 2014 improved the dndc version 9 5 model by considering the changes of soil heat transfer runoff and evapotranspiration adding film coverage and mulching time parameters when the film is applied the soil surface temperature will be determined by the difference between the air and soil temperatures as well as by the film thickness and thermal conductivity formulas 5 and 6 and the model simulates impacts of film mulching on soil moisture by reducing soil evaporation so as to simulate the impact of film mulching on the

climate soil physical properties vegetation and human activities gilhespy et al 2014 the first part of dndc uses meteorological data land type data and crop management data to simulate the dynamic changes of various environmental factors in crop and soil systems the second part of dndc includes nitrification reaction denitrification reaction and fermentation reaction sub models that are mainly affected by soil temperature soil moisture ph oxidation reduction potential eh and substrate concentration it calculates the nitrification and denitrification reactions and fermentation rates in different soil profiles based on various soil parameters and later estimates n content gas and methane emissions obtained by each reaction li et al 1992a 1992b jungers et al 2019 the dndc model uses generalized crop growth curves to estimate crop growth n balance and leaching water and no3 n uptake and the effects of water and n stress on crop growth intricately linking crop growth biogeochemistry and climatic factors it provides an excellent modeling framework for stimulating n processes in agroecosystems zhao et al 2020 dndc model requires input data including the geographical

on the climatic and irrigation data are shown in fig 2 a detailed description of the soil properties and fertilization is provided in the introduction of the field experiment in the simulation the disintegrated area of the film was considered and biodegradable and plastic film differed vastly chen et al 2019b the disintegrated and coverage fraction for plastic and biodegradable film was obtained by measurement and the average value from two measurements was used in the dndc model fig 3 the model parameters maximum biomass biomass fraction thermal degree days optimum temperature and n fixation index were determined using a manual reverse calibration method table 2 the method mainly includes three steps the first step the recommenced parameters in model were used to simulate soil no3 n concentration no3 n leaching and crop no3 n uptake the second step the statistical difference r 2 nse and rmse of simulated and observed value were calculated using the corresponding equations the third step when the error of simulated and observed value exceeds the standard value giltrap et al 2016 jungers et al 2019 lv et al 2020 the model parameters were further manually adjusted until the error meet the requirement of modeling 2 4 scenario simulation scenario simulation and prediction tests were carried out using the dndc model to explore the critical topdressing n amount for bm pm and nm the topdressing n amount used by local farmers was close to 300 kg ha 1 on this basis with 50 kg ha 1 as topdressing n application gradient decreased to 0 kg ha 1 and increased to 400 kg ha 1 respectively 0 50 100 150 200 250 350 and 400 kg ha 1 to select critical topdressing n amount the dndc model was used to simulate and predict the no3 n uptake leaching yield and nue for pm bm and nm in this study we defined the critical topdressing n amount as the no3 n uptake and yield of corn that did not increase clearly with continuously increasing topdressing n amount additionally the bm coverage fraction at harvest was measured at 30 cf30 to explore the effects of different degradation fraction of bm on no3 n uptake leaching yield and nue of corn under the critical topdressing n amount the film mulching scenarios with 0 cf0 no film mulching 10 cf10 50 cf50 70 cf70 89 cf89 no degradation coverage fraction at harvest were simulated and predicted using the dndc model 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical difference among different experimental treatments was determined by analysis of variance anova with significance level of 0 05 simulated and observed no3 n

n where s i and m i are simulated and observed values respectively s m and m m are their average values n is the number of observed values rmse value closer to 0 is associated with better simulation outcomes as well as the nse and r 2 values closer to 1 indicating that the simulation values are more consistent with the measured values with higher accuracy of the model qiu et al 2021 3 results 3 1 dndc model calibration validation and performance evaluation the parameters of the dndc model were manually calibrated by the measured data in 2016 and then validated by the corresponding data in 2017 the specific optimization parameters were shown in table 3 the dndc model effectively captured the no3 n dynamics and corn yield for different topdressing n amounts and mulching conditions the simulation results of no3 n content in 0 50 cm soil layer no3 n leaching below 50 cm soil layer corn no3 n uptake and yield were in line with the manually observed data the determination coeﬃcient r 2 nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and rmse root mean square error for no3 n content during the calibration periods 2016 was 0 96 0 94 and 7 6 kg ha 1 respectively 0 98 0 96 and 3 0 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n leaching 0 98 0 98 and 0 1 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n uptake and 0 99 0 8 and 776 5 kg ha 1 respectively for yield table 4 average values for r 2 nse and rmse during the validation periods 2017 were 0 95 0 94 and 7 9 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n content 0 93 0 88 and 3 6 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n leaching 0 98 0 96 and 0 16 kg ha 1 respectively for no3 n uptake 0 94 0 77 and 817 5 kg ha 1 respectively for yield thus the dndc model could be used to predict and evaluate the no3 n dynamics utilization and corn yield for different mulching conditions and different topdressing n amounts table 5 3 2 the differences of soil no3 n content under different treatments n fertilizer application markedly increased the no3 n content in the 0 50 cm soil layer and in the experiments it showed two peaks at the jointing stage and heading stage under topdressing n fertilizer fig 4 the average no3 n content for film mulching treatments pm280 and bm280 was higher by 19 52 than no film mulching treatment nm280 in 2016 and 2017 no remarkable differences in no3 n content between bm280 and pm280 were observed during the corn crop s early growth stage 0 60 days after sowing das with no disintegration of the biodegradable film and no3 n content was 57 11 and 57 28 kg ha 1 for bm280 and pm280 in 2016 and 2017 respectively during the middle growth stage 61 107 das of corn crops the biodegradable film had a small disintegration area the average no3 n content of bm280 was only 1 63 lower than that of pm280 in 2016 and 2017 after 108 das during corn s late growth stage the disintegration fraction of the biodegradable film was 59 26 which was markedly higher than plastic film 1 76 at the same time the no3 n content for bm280 decreased by an average of 8 81 in 2016 and 2017 compared to pm280 due to an increase of ammonia volatilization however the average no3 n content for bm280 increased by 59 7 in 2016 and 2017 compared to nm with the increase of topdressing n amount the no3 n content for bm increased fig 4 the no3 n content was the same before the first topdressing n fertilization 50 das application after topdressing n fertilizer application n moved into the soil with irrigation the two no3 n content peaks appeared and the average no3 n content was 67 13 97 06 and 126 49 kg ha 1 for bm160 bm220 and bm280 respectively with topdressing n of 80 110 and 140 kg ha 1 each time in 55 and 90 das in 2016 and 56 and 91 das in 2017 additionally the no3 n content in the 0 50 cm soil layer for bm160 was lower than other treatments it decreased by 53 91 and 66 79 for the first and second topdressing periods in the two years respectively as compared to the bm280 on average the no3 n content for bm280 was 46 71 higher than bm220 and 149 03 higher than the bm160 thus the no3 n content in the 50 cm soil layer was positively correlated with the topdressing n amount the correlation between soil layer no3 n content and topdressing n amount was established using the following formula y 0 27x 21 64 and r 2 0 99 y is average no3 n content during which period x is the amount of topdressing n for the period between first topdressing and corn harvest 3 3 the differences of soil no3 n leaching under different treatments the corn root zone is primarily located in a 0 50 cm deep soil layer and the dndc model can be employed to calculate soil no3 n leaching at 50 cm of soil depth zhang et al 2015 the no3 n leaching was primarily observed after irrigation or precipitation no apparent differences were observed during the early crop growth stage for no3 n leaching between pm280 bm280 and nm280 fig 5 however no3 n leaching for nm280 was lower than pm280 and bm280 after topdressing n fertilization and the difference was exceptionally low for no3 n leaching between pm280 and bm280 since the soil solute gradient under pm280 and bm280 was close for instance the no3 n leaching for bm280 pm280 and nm280 was 54 00 54 62 and 45 24 kg ha 1 respectively post first topdressing n fertilization and 49 73 50 21 and 32 76 kg ha 1 respectively post second topdressing n fertilization additionally intensive precipitation events occurred in late corn growth period in 2016 the no3 n leaching for bm280 increased by 23 46 as compared to pm280 and the cum nl difference for bm280 and pm280 was remarkably reduced cumulative no3 n leaching cum nl also was affected by film mulching and cum nl was lower for nm280 as compared to film mulching the cum nl of nm280 was 20 39 lower than that of pm280 and 19 79 lower than that of bm280 in 2016 and 2017 the no3 n leaching increased with increasing no3 n content in the 0 50 cm soil layer after first and second topdressing n fertilization fig 5 before topdressing n fertilization application the no3 n leaching in bm280 bm220 and bm160 were similar with increasing topdressing n fertilization the no3 n leaching also increased the average value of bm280 was 40 12 higher than that of bm220 114 91 of bm160 on das 67 84 and 97 in 2016 and 54 58 190 4 in 2017 respectively the relationship between no3 n leaching and the amount of topdressing n was estimated using the following equation y 0 22x 17 13 r 2 0 89 y is average no3 n leaching during the period x is the amount of topdressing n for cum nl when topdressing n amount increased from 160 to 280 kg ha 1 it increased by 78 71 kg ha 1 and more than 65 of nitrogen fertilizer was going to the groundwater as no3 n 3 4 the differences of n balance and use efficiency under different treatments compared with pm280 the no3 n uptake yield and cumulative no3 n leaching cum nl of bm280 decreased slightly which showed an average decrease of 1 44 4 and 0 75 respectively in both years table 3 with the decrease of film coverage fraction the n volatilized by gas in bm280 increased by 10 91 compared to pm280 but the residual soil nitrogen rn decreased by 10 09 as a whole film mulching bm280 and pm280 promoted no3 n uptake and increased corn yield during growth period the no3 n uptake and yield for pm280 were markedly higher than nm280 with an average increase of 11 05 and 13 76 and bm280 increased by 9 44 and 9 21 in both years respectively however as compared to nm280 cum nl and rn in the soil increased by 24 67 and 79 91 for bm280 and 25 61 and 81 88 for pm280 in 2016 and 2017 respectively and gas volatilization decreased by 78 and 81 34 for bm280 and pm280 respectively based on the simulation data of bm280 and pm280 nitrogen use efficiency nue nitrogen physiological use efficiency npue nitrogen uptake efficiency nute and nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp decreased by an average of 2 04 3 57 1 46 and 4 01 respectively and these factors did not differ markedly in both years for bm280 table 3 the nue npue nute and npfp increased remarkably for film mulching treatments as compared to nm280 nue npue nute and npfp increased with an average of 16 36 3 13 11 05 and 13 79 respectively for pm280 than nm280 and 13 98 0 55 9 43 and 9 22 respectively for bm280 the n balance component and yield for different topdressing n amounts showed remarkable differences when the topdressing n amount increased from 160 to 220 kg ha 1 the no3 n uptake cum nl gas volatilization and yield increased by 5 85 40 7 21 96 and 17 76 respectively in 2016 and 2017 besides when topdressing n amount was increased to 280 kg ha 1 the no3 n uptake and yield decreased by 0 33 and 0 76 respectively cum nl and gas volatilization increased by 33 14 and 16 86 respectively the soil rn for bm160 was exceptionally low and 98 42 lower than that of bm220 the soil rn was 64 77 lower for bm220 than bm280 however with increasing topdressing n amount nue decreased for bm280 nue decreased by 18 25 and 30 56 nute decreased by 18 14 and 32 19 and npfp decreased by 18 47 and 27 03 as compared to bm220 and bm160 respectively in both the years however the bm220 showed the highest npue with an average value of 72 47 kg kg 1 in 2016 and 2017 which was 0 56 higher than bm280 and 11 73 higher than bm160 in both years comprehensive nitrogen fertilizer efficiency for bm220 was higher with an average yield of 11 343 17 kg ha 1 nue of 40 49 npue of 72 47 nute of 57 56 and npfp of 41 1 were observed during 2016 and 2017 respectively thus it emerged as the most appropriate n fertilization management strategy for bm in the arid region by considering corn yield and nue 3 5 simulate and predict the fertilization system and the mulching film system the dndc model was used to construct various mulching film mulching crop growth models under different n application gradients fig 6 crop no3 n uptake cum nl yield and nue simulation results were compared to obtain the most suitable fertilization system there was no significant difference in no3 n uptake and yield between bm and pm but the no3 n uptake and yield of bm and pm were markedly higher than nm without n fertilizer application no3 n uptake and yield of film mulching pm bm treatments increased by 13 66 and 12 74 compared to nm with the increase of topdressing n amount from 0 to 400 kg ha 1 the no3 n uptake and yield difference among film mulching treatments and nm gradually decreased at the peak of no3 n uptake and yield film mulching treatments increased by 5 75 and 11 51 compared to nm respectively although the yield increasing effect of bm was lower than that of pm it was not significant at the same time compared with nm the cum nl of film mulching increased by 3 46 27 93 and nue increased by 2 59 14 2 with the increasing topdressing n amount no3 n uptake leaching and yield increased rapidly under different mulching treatments as per the outcomes of the multi scenario simulation 200 kg ha 1 topdressing n amount under biodegradable film mulching resulted in 11 366 53 kg ha 1 the yield 159 kg ha 1 no3 n uptake 122 02 kg ha 1 of cum nl and 43 14 nue which were 2 57 0 79 0 89 and 0 83 respectively when topdressing n amount continuously increased the no3 n uptake and corn yield did not change markedly but cum nl continued to increase linearly the linear relationship between cum nl and topdressing n amount was y 0 6x 5 96 r 2 0 95 however the changing trend of nue was opposite to that of no3 n leaching and it showed a downward trend therefore the critical topdressing n amount was 200 kg ha 1 under biodegradable film mulching in the arid region which was the most reasonable topdressing n fertilizer system in this area the above selected fertilization system was employed to adjust the film coverage fraction in different periods and establish crop growth models under film mulching with different degradation rates to simulate and predict the yield no3 n uptake cum nl and nue under 89 cf89 70 cf70 50 cf50 30 cf30 10 cf10 and no mulching cf0 film coverage fraction at harvest the yield no3 n uptake cum nl and nue values of film mulching treatments were markedly higher than those of cf0 with an average increase of 16 12 21 24 73 and 11 67 respectively fig 7 with the decreasing coverage fraction crop no3 n uptake yield cum nl and nue declined gradually but the cum nl difference in film mulching treatment was slightly less the decrease in no3 n uptake yield and nue plateaued under cf50 compared with cf50 no3 n uptake yield and nue in cf10 decreased by 1 13 2 37 and 1 44 respectively with 157 32 kg ha 1 of no3 n uptake 11 132 1 kg ha 1 of yield 121 33 kg ha 1 of cum nl and 42 54 of nue 4 discussion 4 1 soil n dynamics no 3n uptake and nue for different n fertilization management strategies there was no difference between no3 n content and no3 n leaching in the early stage of each treatment due to the same amount of nitrogen application in base fertilizer however the no3 n content increased with the increase of n application amount and the linear relationship was y 0 27x 21 64 r 2 0 99 fig 4 multiple studies have reported similar findings chakwizira et al 2015 holman et al 2019 for instance chen et al 2020 found that n application decreased by 25 and 50 and soil no3 n content decreased by 24 5 and 43 9 respectively the no3 n leaching also showed an upward trend in our study a linear correlation was observed between topdressing n amount and cum nl based on the following equation y 0 6x 5 96 r 2 0 95 fig 6 this is because no3 n with a negative charge is hardly adsorbed by clay minerals or organic matter no3 n exists in the liquid phase in soil or sediment which migrates easily and freely in soil resulting in larger no3 n leaching hou et al 2012 filipović et al 2016 and environmental pollution risks such as surface water and groundwater are high russo et al 2017 gao et al 2020 becker et al 2007 similarly found that the risk of n pollution in groundwater depends mainly on the input n into farmland in the form of inorganic fertilizers cui et al 2010 further found that the no3 n leaching pollution poses a serious concern for crop production specifically for intensive agricultural systems which are adversely affected by the excessive use of n fertilizers although the no3 n leaching in low n application amount was lower the yield was also lower preventing the full growth potential of crops thus no3 n leaching crop growth and nue should be considered while formulating an effective fertilization system crop no3 n uptake included active no3 n uptake related to the n assimilation ability of plants and passive no3 n uptake related to soil solute potential in general increased n fertilization application and no3 n content result in high soil solute potential increasing no3 n uptake when topdressing n amount was increased from 160 to 220 kg ha 1 crop no3 n uptake increased by 5 85 and yield increased by 17 76 table 3 however when topdressing n amount increased to 280 kg ha 1 no3 n uptake and yield decreased by 0 33 and 0 76 respectively in contrast in a study by xue et al 2017 when topdressing n amount increased from 0 to 300 kg ha 1 the castor seeds yield continuously increased and when n application amount increased to 400 kg ha 1 castor seeds yield continuously decreased by 7 24 this may be due to the different irrigation systems since the irrigation depth and n fertilizer application amount in a border irrigation field were obviously higher than that of dripped irrigation field moreover the irrigation times of border irrigation also was less than that of dripped irrigation thus soil no3 n content in root zone for a border irrigation field significantly decreased compared with dripped irrigation which avoiding the negative effects of n stress on crop growth osaki et al 1991 at the same time the nue decreased with the increasing n application amount thus the critical amount of n fertilizer is essential for increasing crop yield and decreasing cum nl in our study the scenario simulation based on the dndc model showed critical topdressing n amount to be 200 kg ha 1 for bm fig 6 in the arid region under this topdressing n fertilization system higher yield 11 366 53 kg ha 1 no3 n uptake 159 kg ha 1 and nue 43 14 and lower no3 n leaching 122 02 kg ha 1 can be guaranteed when the topdressing n amount was increased continuously the no3 n uptake and yield of corn remained unaffected while cum nl and nue showed a linear increase and decrease trend respectively the similar critical topdressing n amount also be recommended by previous literature for example jaime et al 2001 found that when the amount of topdressing n was 200 kg ha 1 no no3 n accumulation was found in the soil layer during the harvest period zhang et al 2015 estimated the acceptable yield and cum nl of the planting system according to the dndc model and found that the critical n fertilization amount for corn yield was found to be 150 240 kg ha 1 4 2 soil n dynamics crop n uptake and nue for different film mulching the film mulching markedly decreased n volatilization and increased no3 n uptake and no3 n content average no3 n content increased 19 52 than nm280 during whole growth period under film mulching fig 4 additionally different film mulching showed different effects on soil environment and crop growth in the study the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film was less in 0 107 days after sowing and there was no significant difference in no3 n content between bm280 and pm280 however the disintegration fraction of biodegradable film 59 26 was significantly higher than plastic film 1 76 at harvest which resulted in no3 n content of bm280 decreased by 8 81 compared with that of pm280 at the same time no3 n leaching was also related to the film coverage area although the biodegradable film disintegrated in large areas and increased gas volatilization it also increased water infiltration flux and no3 n leaching in 2016 the heavy precipitation events occurred in the late growth stage of corn resulting in a 23 46 increase in bm280 no3 n leaching compared to pm280 thus the cum nl difference between bm280 and pm280 was markedly reduced this was in line with a study by chen et al 2020 which reported that precipitation could lead to the migration of no3 n in surface soil layer to the deep soil layer no3 n leaching caused due to precipitation with biodegradable film mulching increased by 6 5 compared to plastic film mulching additionally no3 n uptake crop yield and nue under bm280 were decreased compared with pm280 but the difference was insignificant this was because with the growth period the soil environment under different film mulching changed the evapotranspiration of bm280 increased and soil water and no3 n uptake decreased zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2017 gu et al 2017 thus the biodegradable film is a perfect alternative to the plastic film although the no3 n content of nm280 was lower than bm280 but the no3 n uptake yield and nue of bm280 were also remarkably lower which decreased by 9 44 9 21 and 16 36 respectively than in bm280 besides the gas volatilization of bm280 was 78 lower than that of nm280 considering the four aspects of no3 n uptake leaching yield and nue it was found that biodegradable film mulching was a more reasonable agricultural measure the biodegradable film mulching with different degradation fraction will also cause differences in soil water n and crop growth according to the results of scenario simulations based on dndc model and this study found that yield nue and no3 n uptake decreased with the decrease in coverage fraction however yin et al 2019 found a different result that the yield for bm with a moderate degradation fraction was higher than bm with a slow degradation fraction this may be the result of the difference in climatic conditions in the current study the precipitation during the growth period was less only 89 mm and the supply of soil moisture was limited thus intense soil evaporation restricted root uptake ability and decreased corresponding crop yield in this region besides the coverage fraction decreased by 50 cf50 and the decline rate plateaued however the yield 2 37 nue 1 44 and no3 n uptake 1 13 of cf10 did not decrease remarkably compared to cf50 fig 7 the cum nl increased with an increase in coverage fraction but a 10 higher coverage fraction did not affect cum nl this was because the volatilization of n decreased and no3 n uptake increased to reach a perfect balance shahzad et al 2019 yin et al 2019 xu et al 2020 mo et al 2020 therefore the selection of biodegradable films with different degradation rates should consider the local climatic conditions 5 conclusions the results of the dndc simulation and experiment showed that during the early growth period the mulching effects between bm and pm were similar and the n dynamics showed insignificant differences however the differences increased gradually and insignificantly with increasing disintegration area of biodegradable film in the cornfield during the later growth stage thus the biodegradable film can be an excellent alternative to a plastic film in an arid region no3 n content uptake cum nl and yield increased with increasing topdressing n amount however for bm the yield and no3 n uptake did not change significantly at 200 kg ha 1 topdressing n additionally no3 n leaching increased linearly and nue decreased with increasing topdressing n amount thus the critical topdressing n amount was 200 kg ha 1 under biodegradable film mulching in the arid region this study provided insights into no3 n content leaching uptake balance and use efficiency in the arid cornfield under biodegradable film mulching these novel results of this study could help the personnel engaged in agro technical to better understand the mechanisms of difference in no3 n dynamics under bm and pm besides the critical topdressing n recommended by this study could effectively promote the sustainable development of green agriculture by decreasing residual film and no3 n leaching declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9847,elevated atmospheric co2 concentration e co2 increases water use efficiency wue while reducing nitrogen n concentration of crops particularly under drought conditions yet the combined effects of e co2 and different n fertigation regimes on wue and crop n nutrition remain largely elusive in this experiment the growth and physiological responses of two barley genotypes wild type barley steptoe wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant barley az34 to three n fertigation regimes at ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm and e co2 800 ppm were investigated from tillering to grain filling stage the plants were subjected to three n fertigation regimes 1 n fertigation at full irrigation volume fin 2 n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume din 3 alternate n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume prdn although e co2 had little effect on gs tr and plant water use of wt especially under din and prdn it increased an resulting in an increased wue at stomatal leaf and whole plant levels for az34 the positive effect of e co2 on wue was attributed to both significantly enhanced an and lowered gs and tr for both genotypes e co2 increased 100 grain weight and shoot dry biomass but didn t affect grain yield and wue for grain production wueg prdn increased grain yield hi and wueg of both genotypes regardless of co2 compared to fin din and prdn increased n uptake of both genotypes at e co2 compared to fin compared to a co2 e co2 increased 15n uptake and 15n recovery rate of both genotypes by enhancing plant biomass in addition both genotypes grown under din and prdn allocated more n to the grain compared to the fin plants collectively n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume promoted n allocation to the grain and increased wue particularly under e co2 such information is conductive for optimizing wue and n nutrition of crops in a future water limited and co2 enriched environment keywords elevated co2 n fertigation water use efficiency growth n nutrition 1 introduction in recent years the effect of rising atmospheric co2 concentration co2 on crop yield and quality has received increased attention according to ipcc 2014 the co2 will rise to 720 ppm by the end of this century the elevated co2 e co2 in atmosphere may contribute to changes in global climate such as global warming and precipitation patterns which can reduce the availability of soil water in many regions of the world wigley and raper 1992 keeling et al 1995 widodo et al 2003 water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of photosynthetic carbon assimilation to transpiration rate or biomass accumulation to plant water consumption bacon 2004 which is affected by stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate tr and or photosynthetic rate an farquhar et al 1989 in most plant species notably c3 species e co2 increases an and growth while decreasing stomatal conductance gs hence transpiration rate tr hereby increases wue ainsworth and rogers 2007 leakey et al 2009 taub 2010 mamatha et al 2014 the enhanced an of plants grown under e co2 is due partially to the depressed photorespiration by increasing the ratio of co2 to o2 at the chloroplast which stimulates carboxylation reaction and inhibits oxygenation reaction of rubisco long et al 2004 ainsworth and rogers 2007 on the other hand the e co2 can decrease gs but the reduction in gs is greater under well watered conditions than under drought stress wall et al 2001 gunderson et al 2002 mamatha et al 2014 similarly a greater reduction in gs of maize plants was observed under drought at a co2 compared to that at e co2 leakey et al 2006 deficit irrigation di irrigating the crop with an amount of water less than potential evapotranspiration is considered as a water saving irrigation technique which can reduce crop water use with minor or no yield loss english and raja 1996 partial root zone drying prd irrigation is a method that irrigates half of the root system while the other half allows drying to a predetermined level before alternate irrigation liu et al 2006 although both di and prd are considered as water saving irrigation strategies many studies have shown that prd is superior to di in terms of maintaining yield and improving wue when the same amount water is applied kirda et al 2004 2007a 2007b dodd 2007 topcu et al 2007 wang et al 2010 kaman et al 2011 kaman and özbek 2016 kaman and kirda 2017 wang et al 2010 found that prd led to higher photosynthetic rate an xylem sap aba concentration and wue than di given a same irrigation volume sadras 2009 conducted a meta analysis to compare the irrigation water productivity iwp of prd and di and the results showed that both di and prd increased iwp on average by 76 and 82 respectively as compared to full irrigation controls previous studies have shown that the e co2 can decrease nitrogen n concentration of crops particularly under drought conditions taub and wang 2008 one reason for the lowered crop n concentration when grown at e co2 is the dilution of n by increased plant biomass accumulation gifford et al 2000 it is well known that the uptake of n through transpiration driven mass flow depends on the transpiration rate and n ion concentration in the rhizosphere barber 1995 plhak 2003 the e co2 could cause decrease in n uptake rate per unit mass or length of root due to decreased transpiration hence the mass flow of nitrate mcdonald et al 2002 nonetheless our previous studies have demonstrated that prd irrigation induced drying rewetting cycles of the soil profile could improve soil n availability and n uptake in tomato and potato plants especially n concentration of upper leaves leading to a higher an hence wue as compared with di wang et al 2010 2013a also kirda et al 2005 reported that prd had higher n fertiliser recovery of maize compared with di and fi thus it is plausible to suggest that prd irrigation might be able to ameliorate the negative effect of e co2 on crop n nutrition moreover the direct and simultaneous delivery of water and nutrients to plants through fertigation could improve both wue and nutrient use efficiency for instance wang et al 2018 reported that optimized water and n in fertigation improved wue and plant n nutrition therefore by application of prd in combination with n fertigation both water use efficiency wue and crop n uptake could be improved which may be used as novel water and n management strategies for sustainable agricultural development in future climate change scenarios it is well known that prd and di can induce root aba signal to regulate plant growth and water consumption thereby increasing wue wang et al 2010 however the role of endogenous aba signaling in e co2 induced gs reduction is controversial chater et al 2015 revealed that e co2 caused stomatal movement of arabidopsis thaliana involves aba signaling while hsu et al 2018 found that e co2 could induce stomatal closure of arabidopsis thaliana via an aba independent pathway downstream of ost1 kinase yan et al 2017 reported that the gs of tomato grown at moderate drought stress was mostly mediated by root to shoot aba signaling under a co2 while it became insensitive to aba and was regulated predominately by turgor pressure under e co2 in short term e co2 decreases gs mainly by inducing stomatal closure ainsworth and rogers 2007 chater et al 2015 in long term the decreased gs at e co2 is attributed to both the reduced stomatal density and stomatal aperture ainsworth and rogers 2007 moreover our recent studies have revealed that the endogenous aba level of plants played an essential role in modulating the response of gs to soil water deficits under e co2 though the effect was species dependent fang et al 2019 wei et al 2020 e co2 sensitized gs reduction in wild type barley but retarded it in wild type tomato plants whereas such effects were absent in their correspondent aba deficient mutants viz az34 and flacca earlier studies have shown that the wue of tomato plants could be enhanced by reduced irrigation combined with e co2 pazzagli et al 2016 however the combined effects of e co2 and different n fertigation regimes on wue and crop n nutrition remain largely elusive particularly the role of endogenous aba level in mediating those responses has not been researched in the present study two barley genotypes with contrasting endogenous aba levels viz wild type wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant az34 were used the objective was to explore the effect of three different n fertigation regimes in combination with two co2 concentrations 400 ppm and 800 ppm on wue and n uptake of barley plants differing in endogenous aba levels it was hypothesized that n fertigation in prd mode would further enhance wue while sustaining plant n nutrition under e co2 where endogenous aba level would play a role in modulating the effects of the fertigation regimes on plant wue and n nutrition under e co2 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted from january to june 2020 in two greenhouse cells with different co2 concentrations that was the control cell with ambient co2 400 ppm a co2 and a cell with elevated co2 800 ppm e co2 at university of copenhagen taastrup denmark 12 18 e 55 40 n in both greenhouse cells the co2 was monitored every six seconds by a co2 transmitter series gmt220 vaisala group helsinki finland the actual co2 concentrations during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 the climatic conditions in the greenhouse were set as the air temperature of 25 16 2 c day night 60 relative humidity 16 h photoperiod and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic active radiation par supplied by sunlight plus led lamps two barley genotypes were used as plant materials including wild type barley steptoe wt and aba deficient mutant barley az34 the mixed air dried clay soil and sandy loam soil 1 1 by mass was used in the present experiment with a ph of 6 35 total n 1 2 g kg 1 available p 22 mg kg 1 and available k 63 75 mg kg 1 the soil water holding capacity swhc and permanent wilting point calculated on the volumetric basis were 30 and 5 vol the size of the pots was 4 l 15 cm in diameter and 25 cm in depth a plastic sheet was used to divide the pots vertically into two equal compartments allowing no water exchange between them thus creating two separated irrigation compartments 60 barley seeds of each genotype were sown on 28th january 2020 30 seeds of each genotype in a co2 and 30 seeds of each genotype in e co2 in nursery trays and at four leaf stage fifteen uniform and robust barley seedlings for each genotype in each greenhouse cell total sixty plants were transplanted to the pots one plant per pot on 17th february 2020 2 2 n fertigation treatments the barley plants were well watered to 90 swhc in the first six weeks after transplanting from tillering to grain filling stage the plants were subjected to three n fertigation regimes 1 n fertigation at full irrigation volume fin in which the soil water holding capacity was maintained at 90 2 n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume din where 70 of water consumption of fin was irrigated to the whole pot 3 alternate n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume prdn where 70 of water consumption of fin was irrigated to only half of the pot until the soil water content of the dry side decreased to 7 10 then the irrigation was shifted to the dry side the experiment included 12 treatments in total and 5 replicates of each treatment every plant pot was applied with 1 g n fertilizer nh4no3 during the whole growth period to trace the uptake of n 15nh4 15no3 was used at the enrichment of 5 in addition each pot received 3 49 g kh2po4 1 g k pot 1 and 0 79 g p pot 1 to meet the macronutrient requirement for plant growth all the p and k fertilizers as well as 20 n fertilizer were applied as basal fertilizers and they were dissolved in tap water and irrigated evenly on both soil compartments after filling the pots the remaining n fertilizer 80 of n fertilizer 0 8 g n was applied during n fertigation treatment the n fertigation treatments were conducted from 31st march to 17th may and all of the plants were at the late grain filling stage by the end of the treatments although the plants consumed very litter amount of water per day in order to avoid severe soil water deficits that may damage the root system 50 ml water was supplied to each pot evenly every two days to maintain the soil water content at ca 12 on average until plant harvest on the 1st june during the n fertigation period n fertilizer was delivered with irrigation water on 7 10 13 15 22 27 days after n fertigation treatment dat 6 times in total during the experimental period soil water content θ of both compartments was recorded daily between 13 00 15 00 before irrigation using a time domain reflectometry tdr trase soil moisture equipment corp ca usa each compartment was installed with a soil moisture probe 20 cm in length to determine soil water content the water consumption of fin treatment was used to calculate irrigation amount of din and prdn treatments with consideration of genotype and co2 changes of averaged daily soil water content vol in the pots under different experimental treatments are shown in fig 2 2 3 sampling measurements and analysis net photosynthetic rate

yield level wueg were calculated as the ratio of aboveground dry biomass and grain yield to plant water use during the experimental period 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analyzed by three way analysis of variance anova using spss 25 0 ibm corporation new york usa for the independent variables genotype co2 and n fertigation regimes one way anova and duncan s multiple range test at the 5 confidence level was further used when their significant interactions between the independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments before any analysis we checked to make sure that the data was normally distributed by using the shapiro wilks test and to test homogeneity of variance we used levene s test 3 results 3 1 leaf gas exchange wueint and wueins an was significantly affected by co2 n fertigation and the interaction between genotype and co2 however gs and tr were significantly affected by all factors as well as the interaction between genotype and co2 fig 3 table 1 the an of wt and az34 increased by 68 3 and 30 1 respectively at e co2 compared to that at a co2 for n fertigation treatments din and prdn decreased an of wt by 31 and 24 6 at a co2 and by 19 7 and 10 7 at e co2 respectively compared to fin however an of az34 grown under din and prdn was decreased by 21 9 and 18 2 respectively at a co2 but only by 2 3 and 2 9 respectively at e co2 compared to that under fin fig 3a in addition e co2 significantly decreased gs and tr of az34 by 41 7 and 34 2 respectively while it had no significant effect on that of wt compared to a co2 gs and tr of az34 were on average 64 2 and 49 9 higher than that of wt respectively at a co2 but there was no significant difference in gs and tr between the two genotypes at e co2 however din and prdn significantly decreased gs and tr of both genotypes at a co2 compared to fin at e co2 a slight but not significant decrease in gs and tr of both genotypes was observed under din and prdn compared to fin fig 3b c wueint was significantly affected by all factors and wueins was significantly affected by genotype and co2 fig 3d e table 1 e co2 significantly increased wueint and wueins by 97 and 85 5 respectively compared to a co2 moreover wt had higher wueint and wueins than az34 wueint of fin treatment was significantly lower than that of din and prdn treatments 3 2 leaf water potential and leaf aba concentration leaf water potential lwp was significantly affected by co2 and n fertigation treatments table 1 plants grown under fin treatment had a higher lwp than that under din and prdn treatments when the plants suffered from drought stress e g under din or prdn treatments e co2 increased lwp of both genotypes compared to a co2 fig 4a leaf aba concentration aba leaf was significantly affected by n fertigation treatments and genotypes table 1 plants of both genotypes grown under n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume had higher aba leaf than fin plants fig 4b as expected wt had higher aba leaf than az34 at a co2 fig 4b 3 3 shoot dry biomass root dry biomass root shoot ratio plant water use and wueb shoot dry biomass was significantly affected by co2 and n fertigation treatments table 2 the e co2 improved shoot dry biomass by 20 1 compared to a co2 across the genotype and n fertigation regimes compared to fin plants a less reduction in shoot dry biomass caused by n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume of wt was observed at e co2 6 in din and 2 in prdn compared to that at a co2 23 in din and 8 in prdn table 2 root dry biomass was only affected by genotype with az34 having higher root dry biomass than wt table 2 root shoot ratio was affected by genotype co2 as well as the interaction between genotype and co2 at a co2 az34 had the highest root shoot ratio under din conditions among all treatments plant water use was significantly affected by all factors as well as the interaction between genotype and co2 table 2 the e co2 decreased plant water use of az34 by 10 3 while it had little effect on plant water use of wt compared to a co2 plants of both genotypes grown under din and prdn had a lower plant water use than that under fin treatment across the n fertigation treatments plant water use of az34 was on average 21 2 higher than that of wt at a co2 but there was no significant difference in plant water use between the two genotypes at e co2 table 2 wueb was significantly affected by all factors table 2 the e co2 increased wueb by 27 3 compared to a co2 wt had higher wueb than az34 6 2 at a co2 and 6 7 at e co2 wueb of plants treated with din and prdn treatments was 13 8 and 17 9 respectively higher than that of fin treatment table 2 in addition across all treatments wueb was significantly positively related to wueins and wueint fig 5 3 4 hundred grain weight grain yield harvest index and wueg hundred grain weight was only significantly affected by co2 being on average 8 higher at e co2 than that at a co2 table 3 grain yield was significantly affected by n fertigation regimes with din and prdn treatments increasing grain yield by 20 3 and 31 5 respectively compared to fin treatment across the co2 and genotypes table 3 harvest index hi was significantly affected by all factors the e co2 decreased hi by 22 4 compared to a co2 hi of plants grown under din and prdn was 29 4 and 39 7 higher than that under fin respectively across co2 and n fertigation treatments wt showed higher hi than az34 table 3 wueg was significantly affected by genotype and n fertigation din and prdn treatments improved wueg by 46 and 64 respectively compared to fin treatment across the co2 and genotypes wt had higher wueg than az34 across co2 and n fertigation treatments table 3 3 5 n 15n uptake 15n partitioning and 15n recovery rate compared to a co2 the e co2 increased n uptake of wt under din and prdn treatments fig 6a for wt din and prdn plants had lower n uptake than fin plants at a co2 but had a slight increase in n uptake compared to fin plants at e co2 the n uptake of az34 was not significantly affected by n fertigation regimes or co2 at a co2 wt had higher n uptake than az34 under fin treatment while there was no significant difference between two genotypes under din and prdn treatments at e co2 an increase in n uptake of wt was observed compared to that of az34 fig 6a 15n uptake was only affected by co2 across the genotypes and n fertigation regimes the e co2 increased 15n uptake of plants as compared with a co2 fig 6b 15n partitioning among plant organs in barley affected by genotypes n fertigation regimes and co2 is shown in fig 7 the percentage of 15n partitioned to the leaf of az34 was decreased by din and prdn while that of wt was not affected by n fertigation treatments the percentage of 15n partitioned to the leaf of az34 was higher than that of wt under fin treatment while that was similar in both genotypes under din and prdn the percentage of 15n partitioned to the leaf was not affected by co2 the percentage of 15n partitioned to the stem of az34 was significantly decreased by din and prdn while that of wt was not affected by n fertigation regimes under din and prdn az34 allocated more n to grain and a slight increase in the percentage of 15n partitioned to the grain of wt compared to fin plants in addition a slight decrease in the percentage of 15n partitioned to the grain of both genotypes at e co2 compared to that at a co2 was noticed 15n recovery rate was only significantly affected by co2 where e co2 increased 15n recovery rate compared to a co2 fig 8 4 discussion it is well known that soil water deficit can decrease gs of plants liu et al 2005 wang et al 2010 pazzagli et al 2016 consistent with this the results of the present study showed that din and prdn decreased gs of both genotypes compared to fin treatment especially at a co2 fig 3b as expected an of wt grown under din and prdn was significantly decreased compared to that under fin treatment regardless of co2 which was attributed mainly to stomatal limitation on the photosynthesis caused by the decrease in gs under soil water deficit fig 3b in line with the findings of previous studies liu et al 2006 wang et al 2013b the increased wue at stomatal level wueint was usually observed under reduced irrigation liu et al 2005 wang et al 2010 pazzagli et al 2016 owning to a relatively less reduction in an than in gs caused by soil water deficits likewise here a significant increase in wueint of both genotypes under din and prdn in relation to fin especially at e co2 was observed fig 3d most interestingly across the co2 treatments and genotypes prdn increased wueint by an average of 6 3 than din in accordance with the finding of previous studies wang et al 2010 pazzagli et al 2016 early studies have shown that the e co2 had a smaller effect on gs of c3 plants under soil water deficit than under well watered conditions gunderson et al 2002 in good agreement with this here the e co2 had little effect on gs of wt especially under din and prdn compared to a co2 fig 3b it is widely accepted that plants grown at e co2 had a higher an compared with that at a co2 ainsworth and rogers 2007 leakey et al 2009 mamatha et al 2014 consistent with this the results from the present study showed that e co2 significantly increased an compared with a co2 regardless of genotypes and n fertigation regimes fig 3a the e co2 can stimulate carboxylation reaction and inhibit oxygenation reaction of rubisco hereby enhancing an of c3 plants long et al 2004 ainsworth and rogers 2007 consequently the e co2 increased wue of both genotypes at stomatal level as well as at leaf level compared with a co2 in line with the finding of earlier studies pazzagli et al 2016 at e co2 the increased wue of wt at stomatal level and leaf level was attributed to enhanced an for az34 the positive effect of e co2 on wue was attributed to both significantly enhanced an and lowered gs and tr fig 3 briefly the reduced irrigation regimes combined with e co2 further enhanced wue of both genotypes at stomatal level at e co2 as a result of the increase in an and the decrease in gs fig 3 in line with the results of earlier studies on spring wheat and cotton kang et al 2002 webb and hetherington 1997 found that the stomatal closure induced by e co2 of arabidopsis thaliana aba deficient mutant aba1 was similar to wild type plants merilo et al 2013 observed that arabidopsis thaliana aba1 and aba3 mutants kept the stomatal closure in response to e co2 however the aba leaf of arabidopsis thaliana aba1 and aba3 are ca 17 and 33 of aba leaf of the corresponding wild type koornneef and jorna 1982 and the small amount of aba in these mutants may be enough to mediate the e co2 induced stomatal closure similarly chater et al 2015 reported that nced3 and nced5 aba deficient plants of arabidopsis thaliana with extremely low aba leaf ca 1 5 of its corresponding wild type could not close stomata in response to e co2 while the stomatal apertures of its corresponding wild type was decreased by 27 under e co2 thus aba is involved in the process of co2 induced stomatal closure and the sensitivity of stomatal closure to e co2 decreases in the case of reduced aba chater et al 2015 similarly our recent studies have revealed that the endogenous aba level of tomato and barley played an essential role in modulating the response of gs to soil water deficits under e co2 fang et al 2019 wei et al 2020 in the present study the endogenous aba levels of both genotypes were not affected by e co2 and the e co2 induced reduction of gs in az34 possibly indicated that the aba level in az34 was sufficient to mediate the e co2 induced stomatal closure figs 3b 4b also the decreased gs of az34 at e co2 was possibly related to an aba independent pathway hsu et al 2018 or to the increase in xylem sap ph which can intensify the root to shoot aba signaling fang et al 2019 the e co2 acted as c fertilizer can significantly improve shoot biomass of c3 plants wu et al 2004 ziska et al 2004 mamatha et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 consistent with this the results from the present study showed that the e co2 significantly enhanced shoot dry biomass of both genotypes compared to a co2 which was mainly attributed to the enhanced an increased net assimilation rate or improved relative growth rate under e co2 chowdhury et al 2005 yelle et al 1990 earlier studies have shown that the e co2 can improve plant water status by alleviating the negative effects of drought leading to an increase in carbon gain wall et al 2001 likewise the results from the present study showed a less reduction in shoot dry biomass due to reduced irrigation of wt at e co2 6 in din and 2 in prdn compared to that at a co2 23 in din and 8 in prdn table 2 at a co2 az34 had higher plant water use than wt as a result of larger gs and tr fig 3b c table 2 however the plant water use of az34 was reduced significantly under e co2 as a result of a decrease in gs and tr regulated by e co2 fig 3b c table 2 accumulated evidence has revealed that reduced irrigation can reduce plant water use compared to full irrigation by decreasing gs as well as tr of plants pazzagli et al 2016 li et al 2020 consistent with the results from the present study the increase of wueb of wt at e co2 was mainly due to the increased shoot dry biomass but not to the decreased plant water use table 2 for az34 increased wueb at e co2 was mainly attributed to enhanced shoot dry biomass as well as decreased plant water use table 2 previous studies have shown that plants grown under moderate drought stress had higher wueb than that under well watered conditions li et al 2020 owning to a less reduction in shoot dry biomass 11 9 in din and 6 9 in prdn than in plant water use 24 1 in din and 22 2 in prdn in line with the findings in the present study across the genotypes and co2 treatments wueb of plants grown under din and prdn treatments was 13 8 and 17 9 higher than that of fin treatment respectively obviously plants grown under prdn showed a slight enhancement of wueb compared to that under din and which was mainly due to the fact that the shoot dry biomass of prdn treatment was higher than that of din treatment under the similar amount of water consumption table 2 the improved shoot biomass of prdn plants could be related to the enhanced an by improving plant n status wang et al 2010 fig 3a in addition the significantly positive relationship between wueint and wueb or between wueins and wueb indicates that the changes of wue at whole plant level were closely related to stomatal control over gas exchange rates consistent with the findings reported in winter wheat wang et al 2013b the e co2 enhanced hundred grain weight of both genotypes in the present study which was similar to that reported in rice madan et al 2012 and wheat högy et al 2013 and such effect could be attributed to a faster grain filling rate li et al 2000 although the e co2 increased an as well as shoot dry biomass the grain yield was not affected by e co2 consequently the plants grown at e co2 possessed a lower hi than that at a co2 fig 3a tables 2 3 although excessive soil moisture 2400 m3 ha 1 could reduce wheat yield guo et al 2019 a moderate soil water deficit may promote the remobilization of carbon from vegetative tissues to grains hereby accelerating the grain filling rate of rice and wheat during the later grain filling period yang et al 2006 specifically the elevated aba levels of crops under drought stress could stimulate the activity of key enzymes involved in the sucrose to starch metabolic pathway in the grains promoting grain filling and partitioning of carbon into grains though a high concentration of aba caused by severe drought stress could be harmful to grain filling yang et al 2001 2002 2004 yang and zhang 2006 guo et al 2019 reported that reduced irrigation irrigated with 80 of the water consumed in the local conventional irrigation increased grain yield and hi by 4 3 and 8 9 respectively in accordance with this the results from the present study showed that din and prdn significantly enhanced grain yield as well as hi compared with fin table 3 such effect was most probably due to the acceleration of the grain filling rate and the enhanced remobilization of carbon from vegetative tissues to grains mediated by high aba level in the plants yang et al 2001 2002 2004 yang and zhang 2006 consequently plants grown under din and prdn had higher wueg than that under fin as a result of the improved grain yield and the reduced plant water use tables 2 3 consistent with the findings of earlier study wang et al 2013b across the genotype and co2 treatments wueg of plants grown under din and prdn treatments was 50 1 and 62 7 higher than that of fin treatment respectively compared to din plants the higher wueg of prdn plants was mainly attributed to the enhanced grain yield under prdn caused by the improved an fig 3a table 3 earlier studies have shown that the plant n concentration can be reduced by e co2 due to the dilution of tissue n by increased photosynthetic carbon assimilation or the decrease in n uptake by decreased transpiration taub et al 2008 also the decrease in plant n demand at e co2 has been reported by stitt and krapp 1999 in the present study n uptake of wt was decreased by din and prdn at a co2 while a slight increase in that was found at e co2 which could be attributed mainly to a higher n demand caused by the increase in plant biomass accumulation under e co2 table 2 this indicated that reduced irrigation regimes especially prdn had positively affected n uptake under e co2 and alleviated the negative effect of e co2 on plant n nutrition in addition partitioning of n between grain and straw is important in crops which mainly depends on the partitioning of dry matter between the vegetative and reproductive organs desai and bhatia 1978 in the present study plants of both genotypes grown under din and prdn allocated more n into the grain mainly due to high hi compared to the fin plants fig 7 15n recovery rate has been used to reflect plant ability to acquire applied n fertilizer from soil baligar et al 2001 here at e co2 plants of both genotypes had a slight greater 15n recovery rate under reduced irrigation regimes compared to fin which was attributed mainly to the increased n uptake under reduced irrigation regimes figs 6 8 5 conclusions the two genotypes showed different responses to reduced fertigation regimes especially at e co2 although e co2 had little effect on gs tr as well as plant water use of wt especially under din and prdn it increased an resulting in an increased wue at stomatal leaf and whole plant levels for az34 the positive effect of e co2 on wue was attributed to both significantly enhanced an and lowered gs and tr for both genotypes e co2 increased 100 grain weight and shoot dry biomass but didn t affect grain yield and wue for grain production prdn increased grain yield hi and wueg of both genotypes regardless of co2 compared to fin din and prdn increased n uptake of both genotypes at e co2 compared to fin likewise compared to a co2 e co2 increased 15n uptake and 15n recovery rate of both genotypes by enhancing biomass accumulation in addition both genotypes grown under din and prdn allocated more n to the grain compared to the fin plants collectively n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume promoted n allocation to the grain and increased wue particularly under e co2 reduced irrigation regimes especially prdn are recommended for optimizing wue and n nutrition of crops in a future water limited and co2

9847,elevated atmospheric co2 concentration e co2 increases water use efficiency wue while reducing nitrogen n concentration of crops particularly under drought conditions yet the combined effects of e co2 and different n fertigation regimes on wue and crop n nutrition remain largely elusive in this experiment the growth and physiological responses of two barley genotypes wild type barley steptoe wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant barley az34 to three n fertigation regimes at ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm and e co2 800 ppm were investigated from tillering to grain filling stage the plants were subjected to three n fertigation regimes 1 n fertigation at full irrigation volume fin 2 n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume din 3 alternate n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume prdn although e co2 had little effect on gs tr and plant water use of wt especially under din and prdn it increased an resulting in an increased wue at stomatal leaf and whole plant levels for az34 the positive effect of e co2 on wue was attributed to both significantly enhanced an and lowered gs and tr for both genotypes e co2 increased 100 grain weight and shoot dry biomass but didn t affect grain yield and wue for grain production wueg prdn increased grain yield hi and wueg of both genotypes regardless of co2 compared to fin din and prdn increased n uptake of both genotypes at e co2 compared to fin compared to a co2 e co2 increased 15n uptake and 15n recovery rate of both genotypes by enhancing plant biomass in addition both genotypes grown under din and prdn allocated more n to the grain compared to the fin plants collectively n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume promoted n allocation to the grain and increased wue particularly under e co2 such information is conductive for optimizing wue and n nutrition of crops in a future water limited and co2 enriched environment keywords elevated co2 n fertigation water use efficiency growth n nutrition 1 introduction in recent years the effect of rising atmospheric co2 concentration co2 on crop yield and quality has received increased attention according to ipcc 2014 the co2 will rise to 720 ppm by the end of this century the elevated co2 e co2 in atmosphere may contribute to changes in global climate such as global warming and precipitation patterns which can reduce the availability of soil water in many regions of the world wigley and raper 1992 keeling et al 1995 widodo et al 2003 water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of photosynthetic carbon assimilation to transpiration rate or biomass accumulation to plant water consumption bacon 2004 which is affected by stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate tr and or photosynthetic rate an farquhar et al 1989 in most plant species notably c3 species e co2 increases an and growth while decreasing stomatal conductance gs hence transpiration rate tr hereby increases wue ainsworth and rogers 2007 leakey et al 2009 taub 2010 mamatha et al 2014 the enhanced an of plants grown under e co2 is due partially to the depressed photorespiration by increasing the ratio of co2 to o2 at the chloroplast which stimulates carboxylation reaction and inhibits oxygenation reaction of rubisco long et al 2004 ainsworth and rogers 2007 on the other hand the e co2 can decrease gs but the reduction in gs is greater under well watered conditions than under drought stress wall et al 2001 gunderson et al 2002 mamatha et al 2014 similarly a greater reduction in gs of maize plants was observed under drought at a co2 compared to that at e co2 leakey et al 2006 deficit irrigation di irrigating the crop with an amount of water less than potential evapotranspiration is considered as a water saving irrigation technique which can reduce crop water use with minor or no yield loss english and raja 1996 partial root zone drying prd irrigation is a method that irrigates half of the root system while the other half allows drying to a predetermined level before alternate irrigation liu et al 2006 although both di and prd are considered as water saving irrigation strategies many studies have shown that prd is superior to di in terms of maintaining yield and improving wue when the same amount water is applied kirda et al 2004 2007a 2007b dodd 2007 topcu et al 2007 wang et al 2010 kaman et al 2011 kaman and özbek 2016 kaman and kirda 2017 wang et al 2010 found that prd led to higher photosynthetic rate an xylem sap aba concentration and wue than di given a same irrigation volume sadras 2009 conducted a meta analysis to compare the irrigation water productivity iwp of prd and di and the results showed that both di and prd increased iwp on average by 76 and 82 respectively as compared to full irrigation controls previous studies have shown that the e co2 can decrease nitrogen n concentration of crops particularly under drought conditions taub and wang 2008 one reason for the lowered crop n concentration when grown at e co2 is the dilution of n by increased plant biomass accumulation gifford et al 2000 it is well known that the uptake of n through transpiration driven mass flow depends on the transpiration rate and n ion concentration in the rhizosphere barber 1995 plhak 2003 the e co2 could cause decrease in n uptake rate per unit mass or length of root due to decreased transpiration hence the mass flow of nitrate mcdonald et al 2002 nonetheless our previous studies have demonstrated that prd irrigation induced drying rewetting cycles of the soil profile could improve soil n availability and n uptake in tomato and potato plants especially n concentration of upper leaves leading to a higher an hence wue as compared with di wang et al 2010 2013a also kirda et al 2005 reported that prd had higher n fertiliser recovery of maize compared with di and fi thus it is plausible to suggest that prd irrigation might be able to ameliorate the negative effect of e co2 on crop n nutrition moreover the direct and simultaneous delivery of water and nutrients to plants through fertigation could improve both wue and nutrient use efficiency for instance wang et al 2018 reported that optimized water and n in fertigation improved wue and plant n nutrition therefore by application of prd in combination with n fertigation both water use efficiency wue and crop n uptake could be improved which may be used as novel water and n management strategies for sustainable agricultural development in future climate change scenarios it is well known that prd and di can induce root aba signal to regulate plant growth and water consumption thereby increasing wue wang et al 2010 however the role of endogenous aba signaling in e co2 induced gs reduction is controversial chater et al 2015 revealed that e co2 caused stomatal movement of arabidopsis thaliana involves aba signaling while hsu et al 2018 found that e co2 could induce stomatal closure of arabidopsis thaliana via an aba independent pathway downstream of ost1 kinase yan et al 2017 reported that the gs of tomato grown at moderate drought stress was mostly mediated by root to shoot aba signaling under a co2 while it became insensitive to aba and was regulated predominately by turgor pressure under e co2 in short term e co2 decreases gs mainly by inducing stomatal closure ainsworth and rogers 2007 chater et al 2015 in long term the decreased gs at e co2 is attributed to both the reduced stomatal density and stomatal aperture ainsworth and rogers 2007 moreover our recent studies have revealed that the endogenous aba level of plants played an essential role in modulating the response of gs to soil water deficits under e co2 though the effect was species dependent fang et al 2019 wei et al 2020 e co2 sensitized gs reduction in wild type barley but retarded it in wild type tomato plants whereas such effects were absent in their correspondent aba deficient mutants viz az34 and flacca earlier studies have shown that the wue of tomato plants could be enhanced by reduced irrigation combined with e co2 pazzagli et al 2016 however the combined effects of e co2 and different n fertigation regimes on wue and crop n nutrition remain largely elusive particularly the role of endogenous aba level in mediating those responses has not been researched in the present study two barley genotypes with contrasting endogenous aba levels viz wild type wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant az34 were used the objective was to explore the effect of three different n fertigation regimes in combination with two co2 concentrations 400 ppm and 800 ppm on wue and n uptake of barley plants differing in endogenous aba levels it was hypothesized that n fertigation in prd mode would further enhance wue while sustaining plant n nutrition under e co2 where endogenous aba level would play a role in modulating the effects of the fertigation regimes on plant wue and n nutrition under e co2 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted from january to june 2020 in two greenhouse cells with different co2 concentrations that was the control cell with ambient co2 400 ppm a co2 and a cell with elevated co2 800 ppm e co2 at university of copenhagen taastrup denmark 12 18 e 55 40 n in both greenhouse cells the co2 was monitored every six seconds by a co2 transmitter series gmt220 vaisala group helsinki finland the actual co2 concentrations during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 the climatic conditions in the greenhouse were set as the air temperature of 25 16 2 c day night 60 relative humidity 16 h photoperiod and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic active radiation par supplied by sunlight plus led lamps two barley genotypes were used as plant materials including wild type barley steptoe wt and aba deficient mutant barley az34 the mixed air dried clay soil and sandy loam soil 1 1 by mass was used in the present experiment with a ph of 6 35 total n 1 2 g kg 1 available p 22 mg kg 1 and available k 63 75 mg kg 1 the soil water holding capacity swhc and permanent wilting point calculated on the volumetric basis were 30 and 5 vol the size of the pots was 4 l 15 cm in diameter and 25 cm in depth a plastic sheet was used to divide the pots vertically into two equal compartments allowing no water exchange between them thus creating two separated irrigation compartments 60 barley seeds of each genotype were sown on 28th january 2020 30 seeds of each genotype in a co2 and 30 seeds of each genotype in e co2 in nursery trays and at four leaf stage fifteen uniform and robust barley seedlings for each genotype in each greenhouse cell total sixty plants were transplanted to the pots one plant per pot on 17th february 2020 2 2 n fertigation treatments the barley plants were well watered to 90 swhc in the first six weeks after transplanting from tillering to grain filling stage the plants were subjected to three n fertigation regimes 1 n fertigation at full irrigation volume fin in which the soil water holding capacity was maintained at 90 2 n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume din where 70 of water consumption of fin was irrigated to the whole pot 3 alternate n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume prdn where 70 of water consumption of fin was irrigated to only half of the pot until the soil water content of the dry side decreased to 7 10 then the irrigation was shifted to the dry side the experiment included 12 treatments in total and 5 replicates of each treatment every plant pot was applied with 1 g n fertilizer nh4no3 during the whole growth period to trace the uptake of n 15nh4 15no3 was used at the enrichment of 5 in addition each pot received 3 49 g kh2po4 1 g k pot 1 and 0 79 g p pot 1 to meet the macronutrient requirement for plant growth all the p and k fertilizers as well as 20 n fertilizer were applied as basal fertilizers and they were dissolved in tap water and irrigated evenly on both soil compartments after filling the pots the remaining n fertilizer 80 of n fertilizer 0 8 g n was applied during n fertigation treatment the n fertigation treatments were conducted from 31st march to 17th may and all of the plants were at the late grain filling stage by the end of the treatments although the plants consumed very litter amount of water per day in order to avoid severe soil water deficits that may damage the root system 50 ml water was supplied to each pot evenly every two days to maintain the soil water content at ca 12 on average until plant harvest on the 1st june during the n fertigation period n fertilizer was delivered with irrigation water on 7 10 13 15 22 27 days after n fertigation treatment dat 6 times in total during the experimental period soil water content θ of both compartments was recorded daily between 13 00 15 00 before irrigation using a time domain reflectometry tdr trase soil moisture equipment corp ca usa each compartment was installed with a soil moisture probe 20 cm in length to determine soil water content the water consumption of fin treatment was used to calculate irrigation amount of din and prdn treatments with consideration of genotype and co2 changes of averaged daily soil water content vol in the pots under different experimental treatments are shown in fig 2 2 3 sampling measurements and analysis net photosynthetic rate an stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr were measured on upper fully expanded leaves using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor biosciences nb usa from 9 00 11 00 am once a week during the n fertigation treatment intrinsic water use efficiency wueint and instantaneous water use efficiency wueins were estimated as an gs and an tr respectively leaf water potential was measured by a scholander type pressure chamber model 3000f01h12g2p40 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa on the 18th and 38th dat fresh samples of leaves were collected on the 18th and 38th dat and immediately kept at 80 for aba analysis leaf aba concentrations aba leaf were measured by elisa method according to asch 2000 plants were harvested at maturity stage stems leaves kernels and roots were collected separately and then determined after oven drying at 70 stems leaves and roots or air drying kernels to constant weight water use efficiency at biomass level wueb and at grain yield level wueg were calculated as the ratio of aboveground dry biomass and grain yield to plant water use during the experimental period 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analyzed by three way analysis of variance anova using spss 25 0 ibm corporation new york usa for the independent variables genotype co2 and n fertigation regimes one way anova and duncan s multiple range test at the 5 confidence level was further used when their significant interactions between the independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments before any analysis we checked to make sure that the data was normally distributed by using the shapiro wilks test and to test homogeneity of variance we used levene s test 3 results 3 1 leaf gas exchange wueint and wueins an was significantly affected by co2 n fertigation and the interaction between genotype and co2 however gs and tr were significantly affected by all factors as well as the interaction between genotype and co2 fig 3 table 1 the an of wt and az34 increased by 68 3 and 30 1 respectively at e co2 compared to that at a co2 for n fertigation treatments din and prdn decreased an of wt by 31 and 24 6 at a co2 and by 19 7 and 10 7 at e co2 respectively compared to fin however an of az34 grown under din and prdn was decreased by 21 9 and 18 2 respectively at a co2 but only by 2 3 and 2 9 respectively at e co2 compared to that under fin fig 3a in addition e co2 significantly decreased gs and tr of az34 by 41 7 and 34 2 respectively while it had no significant effect on that of wt compared to a co2 gs and tr of az34 were on average 64 2 and 49 9 higher than that of wt respectively at a co2 but there was no significant difference in gs and tr between the two genotypes at e co2 however din and prdn significantly decreased gs and tr of both genotypes at a co2 compared to fin at e co2 a slight but not significant decrease in gs and tr of both genotypes was observed under din and prdn compared to fin fig 3b c wueint was significantly affected by all factors and wueins was significantly affected by genotype and co2 fig 3d e table 1 e co2 significantly increased wueint and wueins by 97 and 85 5 respectively compared to a co2 moreover wt had higher wueint and wueins than az34 wueint of fin treatment was significantly lower than that of din and prdn treatments 3 2 leaf water potential and leaf aba concentration leaf water potential lwp was significantly affected by co2 and n fertigation treatments table 1 plants grown under fin treatment had a higher lwp than that under din and prdn treatments when the plants suffered from drought stress e g under din or prdn treatments e co2 increased lwp of both genotypes compared to a co2 fig 4a leaf aba concentration aba leaf was significantly affected by n fertigation treatments and genotypes table 1 plants of both genotypes grown under n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume had higher aba leaf than fin plants fig 4b as expected wt had higher aba leaf than az34 at a co2 fig 4b 3 3 shoot dry biomass root dry biomass root shoot ratio plant water use and wueb shoot dry biomass was significantly affected by co2 and n fertigation treatments table 2 the e co2 improved shoot dry biomass by 20 1 compared to a co2 across the genotype and n fertigation regimes compared to fin plants a less reduction in shoot dry biomass caused by n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume of wt was observed at e co2 6 in din and 2 in prdn compared to that at a co2 23 in din and 8 in prdn table 2 root dry biomass was only affected by genotype with az34 having higher root dry biomass than wt table 2 root shoot ratio was affected by genotype co2 as well as the interaction between genotype and co2 at a co2 az34 had the highest root shoot ratio under din conditions among all treatments plant water use was significantly affected by all factors as well as the interaction between genotype and co2 table 2 the e co2 decreased plant water use of az34 by 10 3 while it had little effect on plant water use of wt compared to a co2 plants of both genotypes grown under din and prdn had a lower plant water use than that under fin treatment across the n fertigation treatments plant water use of az34 was on average 21 2 higher than that of wt at a co2 but there was no significant difference in plant water use between the two genotypes at e co2 table 2 wueb was significantly affected by all factors table 2 the e co2 increased wueb by 27 3 compared to a co2 wt had higher wueb than az34 6 2 at a co2 and 6 7 at e co2 wueb of plants treated with din and prdn treatments was 13 8 and 17 9 respectively higher than that of fin treatment table 2 in addition across all treatments wueb was significantly positively related to wueins and wueint fig 5 3 4 hundred grain weight grain yield harvest index and wueg hundred grain weight was only significantly affected by co2 being on average 8 higher at e co2 than that at a co2 table 3 grain yield was significantly affected by n fertigation regimes with din and prdn treatments increasing grain yield by 20 3 and 31 5 respectively compared to fin treatment across the co2 and genotypes table 3 harvest index hi was significantly affected by all factors the e co2 decreased hi by 22 4 compared to a co2 hi of plants grown under din and prdn was 29 4 and 39 7 higher than that under fin respectively across co2 and n fertigation treatments wt showed higher hi than az34 table 3 wueg was significantly affected by genotype and n fertigation din and prdn treatments improved wueg by 46 and 64 respectively compared to fin treatment across the co2 and genotypes wt had higher wueg than az34 across co2 and n fertigation treatments table 3 3 5 n 15n uptake 15n partitioning and 15n recovery rate compared to a co2 the e co2 increased n uptake of wt under din and prdn treatments fig 6a for wt din and prdn plants had lower n uptake than fin plants at a co2 but had a slight increase in n uptake compared to fin plants at e co2 the n uptake of az34 was not significantly affected by n fertigation regimes or co2 at a co2 wt had higher n uptake than az34 under fin treatment while there was no significant difference between two genotypes under din and prdn treatments at e co2 an increase in n uptake of wt was observed compared to that of az34 fig 6a 15n uptake was only affected by co2 across the genotypes and n fertigation regimes the e co2 increased 15n uptake of plants as compared with a co2 fig 6b 15n partitioning among plant organs in barley affected by genotypes n fertigation regimes and co2 is shown in fig 7 the percentage of 15n partitioned to the leaf of az34 was decreased by din and prdn while that of wt was not affected by n fertigation treatments the percentage of 15n partitioned to the leaf of az34 was higher than that of wt under fin treatment while that was similar in both genotypes under din and prdn the percentage of 15n partitioned to the leaf was not affected by co2 the percentage of 15n partitioned to the stem of az34 was significantly decreased by din and prdn while that of wt was not affected by n fertigation regimes under din and prdn az34 allocated more n to grain and a slight increase in the percentage of 15n partitioned to the grain of wt compared to fin plants in addition a slight decrease in the percentage of 15n partitioned to the grain of both genotypes at e co2 compared to that at a co2 was noticed 15n recovery rate was only significantly affected by co2 where e co2 increased 15n recovery rate compared to a co2 fig 8 4 discussion it is well known that soil water deficit can decrease gs of plants liu et al 2005 wang et al 2010 pazzagli et al 2016 consistent with this the results of the present study showed that din and prdn decreased gs of both genotypes compared to fin treatment especially at a co2 fig 3b as expected an of wt grown under din and prdn was significantly decreased compared to that under fin treatment regardless of co2 which was attributed mainly to stomatal limitation on the photosynthesis caused by the decrease in gs under soil water deficit fig 3b in line with the findings of previous studies liu et al 2006 wang et al 2013b the increased wue at stomatal level wueint was usually observed under reduced irrigation liu et al 2005 wang et al 2010 pazzagli et al 2016 owning to a relatively less reduction in an than in gs caused by soil water deficits likewise here a significant increase in wueint of both genotypes under din and prdn in relation to fin especially at e co2 was observed fig 3d most interestingly across the co2 treatments and genotypes prdn increased wueint by an average of 6 3 than din in accordance with the finding of previous studies wang et al 2010 pazzagli et al 2016 early studies have shown that the e co2 had a smaller effect on gs of c3 plants under soil water deficit than under well watered conditions gunderson et al 2002 in good agreement with this here the e co2 had little effect on gs of wt especially under din and prdn compared to a co2 fig 3b it is widely accepted that plants grown at e co2 had a higher an compared with that at a co2 ainsworth and rogers 2007 leakey et al 2009 mamatha et al 2014 consistent with this the results from the present study showed that e co2 significantly increased an compared with a co2 regardless of genotypes and n fertigation regimes fig 3a the e co2 can stimulate carboxylation reaction and inhibit oxygenation reaction of rubisco hereby enhancing an of c3 plants long et al 2004 ainsworth and rogers 2007 consequently the e co2 increased wue of both genotypes at stomatal level as well as at leaf level compared with a co2 in line with the finding of earlier studies pazzagli et al 2016 at e co2 the increased wue of wt at stomatal level and leaf level was attributed to enhanced an for az34 the positive effect of e co2 on wue was attributed to both significantly enhanced an and lowered gs and tr fig 3 briefly the reduced irrigation regimes combined with e co2 further enhanced wue of both genotypes at stomatal level at e co2 as a result of the increase in an and the decrease in gs fig 3 in line with the results of earlier studies on spring wheat and cotton kang et al 2002 webb and hetherington 1997 found that the stomatal closure induced by e co2 of arabidopsis thaliana aba deficient mutant aba1 was similar to wild type plants merilo et al 2013 observed that arabidopsis thaliana aba1 and aba3 mutants kept the stomatal closure in response to e co2 however the aba leaf of arabidopsis thaliana aba1 and aba3 are ca 17 and 33 of aba leaf of the corresponding wild type koornneef and jorna 1982 and the small amount of aba in these mutants may be enough to mediate the e co2 induced stomatal closure similarly chater et al 2015 reported that nced3 and nced5 aba deficient plants of arabidopsis thaliana with extremely low aba leaf ca 1 5 of its corresponding wild type could not close stomata in response to e co2 while the stomatal apertures of its corresponding wild type was decreased by 27 under e co2 thus aba is involved in the process of co2 induced stomatal closure and the sensitivity of stomatal closure to e co2 decreases in the case of reduced aba chater et al 2015 similarly our recent studies have revealed that the endogenous aba level of tomato and barley played an essential role in modulating the response of gs to soil water deficits under e co2 fang et al 2019 wei et al 2020 in the present study the endogenous aba levels of both genotypes were not affected by e co2 and the e co2 induced reduction of gs in az34 possibly indicated that the aba level in az34 was sufficient to mediate the e co2 induced stomatal closure figs 3b 4b also the decreased gs of az34 at e co2 was possibly related to an aba independent pathway hsu et al 2018 or to the increase in xylem sap ph which can intensify the root to shoot aba signaling fang et al 2019 the e co2 acted as c fertilizer can significantly improve shoot biomass of c3 plants wu et al 2004 ziska et al 2004 mamatha et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 consistent with this the results from the present study showed that the e co2 significantly enhanced shoot dry biomass of both genotypes compared to a co2 which was mainly attributed to the enhanced an increased net assimilation rate or improved relative growth rate under e co2 chowdhury et al 2005 yelle et al 1990 earlier studies have shown that the e co2 can improve plant water status by alleviating the negative effects of drought leading to an increase in carbon gain wall et al 2001 likewise the results from the present study showed a less reduction in shoot dry biomass due to reduced irrigation of wt at e co2 6 in din and 2 in prdn compared to that at a co2 23 in din and 8 in prdn table 2 at a co2 az34 had higher plant water use than wt as a result of larger gs and tr fig 3b c table 2 however the plant water use of az34 was reduced significantly under e co2 as a result of a decrease in gs and tr regulated by e co2 fig 3b c table 2 accumulated evidence has revealed that reduced irrigation can reduce plant water use compared to full irrigation by decreasing gs as well as tr of plants pazzagli et al 2016 li et al 2020 consistent with the results from the present study the increase of wueb of wt at e co2 was mainly due to the increased shoot dry biomass but not to the decreased plant water use table 2 for az34 increased wueb at e co2 was mainly attributed to enhanced shoot dry biomass as well as decreased plant water use table 2 previous studies have shown that plants grown under moderate drought stress had higher wueb than that under well watered conditions li et al 2020 owning to a less reduction in shoot dry biomass 11 9 in din and 6 9 in prdn than in plant water use 24 1 in din and 22 2 in prdn in line with the findings in the present study across the genotypes and co2 treatments wueb of plants grown under din and prdn treatments was 13 8 and 17 9 higher than that of fin treatment respectively obviously plants grown under prdn showed a slight enhancement of wueb compared to that under din and which was mainly due to the fact that the shoot dry biomass of prdn treatment was higher than that of din treatment under the similar amount of water consumption table 2 the improved shoot biomass of prdn plants could be related to the enhanced an by improving plant n status wang et al 2010 fig 3a in addition the significantly positive relationship between wueint and wueb or between wueins and wueb indicates that the changes of wue at whole plant level were closely related to stomatal control over gas exchange rates consistent with the findings reported in winter wheat wang et al 2013b the e co2 enhanced hundred grain weight of both genotypes in the present study which was similar to that reported in rice madan et al 2012 and wheat högy et al 2013 and such effect could be attributed to a faster grain filling rate li et al 2000 although the e co2 increased an as well as shoot dry biomass the grain yield was not affected by e co2 consequently the plants grown at e co2 possessed a lower hi than that at a co2 fig 3a tables 2 3 although excessive soil moisture 2400 m3 ha 1 could reduce wheat yield guo et al 2019 a moderate soil water deficit may promote the remobilization of carbon from vegetative tissues to grains hereby accelerating the grain filling rate of rice and wheat during the later grain filling period yang et al 2006 specifically the elevated aba levels of crops under drought stress could stimulate the activity of key enzymes involved in the sucrose to starch metabolic pathway in the grains promoting grain filling and partitioning of carbon into grains though a high concentration of aba caused by severe drought stress could be harmful to grain filling yang et al 2001 2002 2004 yang and zhang 2006 guo et al 2019 reported that reduced irrigation irrigated with 80 of the water consumed in the local conventional irrigation increased grain yield and hi by 4 3 and 8 9 respectively in accordance with this the results from the present study showed that din and prdn significantly enhanced grain yield as well as hi compared with fin table 3 such effect was most probably due to the acceleration of the grain filling rate and the enhanced remobilization of carbon from vegetative tissues to grains mediated by high aba level in the plants yang et al 2001 2002 2004 yang and zhang 2006 consequently plants grown under din and prdn had higher wueg than that under fin as a result of the improved grain yield and the reduced plant water use tables 2 3 consistent with the findings of earlier study wang et al 2013b across the genotype and co2 treatments wueg of plants grown under din and prdn treatments was 50 1 and 62 7 higher than that of fin treatment respectively compared to din plants the higher wueg of prdn plants was mainly attributed to the enhanced grain yield under prdn caused by the improved an fig 3a table 3 earlier studies have shown that the plant n concentration can be reduced by e co2 due to the dilution of tissue n by increased photosynthetic carbon assimilation or the decrease in n uptake by decreased transpiration taub et al 2008 also the decrease in plant n demand at e co2 has been reported by stitt and krapp 1999 in the present study n uptake of wt was decreased by din and prdn at a co2 while a slight increase in that was found at e co2 which could be attributed mainly to a higher n demand caused by the increase in plant biomass accumulation under e co2 table 2 this indicated that reduced irrigation regimes especially prdn had positively affected n uptake under e co2 and alleviated the negative effect of e co2 on plant n nutrition in addition partitioning of n between grain and straw is important in crops which mainly depends on the partitioning of dry matter between the vegetative and reproductive organs desai and bhatia 1978 in the present study plants of both genotypes grown under din and prdn allocated more n into the grain mainly due to high hi compared to the fin plants fig 7 15n recovery rate has been used to reflect plant ability to acquire applied n fertilizer from soil baligar et al 2001 here at e co2 plants of both genotypes had a slight greater 15n recovery rate under reduced irrigation regimes compared to fin which was attributed mainly to the increased n uptake under reduced irrigation regimes figs 6 8 5 conclusions the two genotypes showed different responses to reduced fertigation regimes especially at e co2 although e co2 had little effect on gs tr as well as plant water use of wt especially under din and prdn it increased an resulting in an increased wue at stomatal leaf and whole plant levels for az34 the positive effect of e co2 on wue was attributed to both significantly enhanced an and lowered gs and tr for both genotypes e co2 increased 100 grain weight and shoot dry biomass but didn t affect grain yield and wue for grain production prdn increased grain yield hi and wueg of both genotypes regardless of co2 compared to fin din and prdn increased n uptake of both genotypes at e co2 compared to fin likewise compared to a co2 e co2 increased 15n uptake and 15n recovery rate of both genotypes by enhancing biomass accumulation in addition both genotypes grown under din and prdn allocated more n to the grain compared to the fin plants collectively n fertigation at reduced irrigation volume promoted n allocation to the grain and increased wue particularly under e co2 reduced irrigation regimes especially prdn are recommended for optimizing wue and n nutrition of crops in a future water limited and co2

9848,available soil n is critical for n fertilizer management in crop production but the effects of alternate partial root zone drying prd on the dynamics of n and the impact of these effects on perennial crops such as alfalfa medicago sativa l have not been evaluated a field experiment was conducted to compare two irrigation modes prd and conventional furrow irrigation cfi in combination with four irrigation levels 70 etc evapotranspiration 85 etc 100 etc and 115 etc prd improved the mineralization of organic matter to increase available n and the no3 n nh4 n ratio thus it increased n uptake water productivity and maintained seasonal forage yield the combination of prd and irrigation level 100 etc produced maximum no3 n stock these results present an evaluation of how prd influences soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops keywords alternate partial root zone drying seasonal forage yield soil n stocks no3 n nh4 n ratio 1 introduction soil nitrogen n in cropland agroecosystems relates to crop productivity grahmann et al 2020 atmospheric n2o concentration bai et al 2020 gao et al 2020 and global biogeochemical cycles xu et al 2020 and its stocks are the main sources of n availability to crops alam et al 2020 franzluebbers et al 2000 therefore soil n availability to crops is an effective tool for properly managing n fertilizer application in cropland agroecosystems li et al 2019 mariano et al 2017 considering that excessive n fertilizer often has negative impacts on soil quality and the environment yin et al 2020 the definition of soil n availability varies with different sources and soil n availability has been estimated in previous studies by using various indicators mariano et al 2017 li et al 2019 in cropland ecosystems soil n availability is usually estimated by the soil nh4 n concentration and no3 n concentration stevens et al 2010 whereas some studies have considered the no3 n nh4 n ratio a better indicator than their concentrations to estimate the soil n availability to crops li et al 2019 considering the no3 n nh4 n ratio can not only reflect the soil no3 n and nh4 n supply for plant growth davidson et al 2007 and the dominant form of soil inorganic n xiao et al 2018 but may reflect the soil n in relation to c dynamics srivastava et al 2016 furthermore recent studies have argued that the soil no3 n stock and nh4 n stock are suitable for evaluating n availability to crops alam et al 2020 wang et al 2020c zhou et al 2020 since the soil no3 n stock and nh4 n stock represent the soil inorganic n supply in the long term bell et al 2012 these results demonstrate that the soil no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock can be used to estimate soil n availability to crops therefore it is necessary to simultaneously estimate the soil n availability to crops by using the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock which can provide more accurate information for n management in cropland agroecosystems soil n availability to crops has been verified to be affected by irrigation alrajhi et al 2015 bai et al 2020 wang et al 2017b alternate partial root zone drying prd induces plant root systems to enter a wet dry cycling soil environment wang et al 2007 which improves water productivity without yield loss this irrigation technique has been successfully applied to many crops because it saves irrigation water alrajhi et al 2015 wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 studies that have examined prd in relation to soil n have focused on the effect of prd on soil n availability to annual crops barzegari et al 2017 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 however how the prd influences soil n availability to perennial crops has received little attention alfalfa medicago sativa l a perennial and highly valued crop in various agroecosystems strullu et al 2020 is widely used to establish pastures which sustain animal production and control soil erosion throughout the world bhandari et al 2020 wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020 currently prd has been verified to be successful for application in alfalfa production in china with high water use efficiency xiao et al 2015 and economic benefits zhang et al 2020 however persistent production of alfalfa pasture is not only dependent on irrigation water but also relies on soil n availability strullu et al 2020 especially in regions with a shortage of soil n wang et al 2020c although alfalfa can fix n from the atmosphere bhandari et al 2020 therefore understanding the effect of prd on soil n availability to alfalfa is imperative to accurately manage soil n in alfalfa pastures where prd is applied which can highlight the dynamics of how prd influences soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops the aim of this study was to employ alfalfa as an example crop to investigate the effect of prd on soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops by using the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock through a three year field experiment here this study hypothesizes that 1 the prd maintains the seasonal forage yield of alfalfa pasture 2 the prd enhances the dominant form of soil no3 n of inorganic n and 3 the prd decreases soil n availability no3 n stock and nh4 n stock since the prd can encourage alfalfa to deplete more soil n 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experimental site was located in wuwei city 37 42 n 102 48 e elevation 1710 m in gansu province china the climate at the experimental site was typical continental temperate the average annual air temperature during the 1996 2015 period was 9 with a maximum in july 36 06 and a minimum in january 19 14 and the average annual precipitation was 175 mm most of which occurred from june to september while the mean annual pan evaporation was approximately 2000 mm the groundwater table was 30 m below the soil surface wang et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the mean monthly precipitation and air temperature during the experimental period 2017 2019 are shown in fig 1 the soil in this area is classified as irragric anthrosols world reference base for soil resources the soil bulk density field capacity and wilting point by weight g g 1 for the 0 200 cm soil layer was 1 49 0 05 g cm 3 0 2201 0 03 g g 1 and 0 0805 0 0003 g g 1 respectively which were measured by using the cutting ring method before 2017 five soil samples at 0 40 cm were randomly sampled by soil auger in the experimental field to measure basic chemical properties the soil chemical properties at the 0 40 cm layer was as follows ph 8 20 soil organic carbon 12 90 g kg 1 total n 0 86 g kg 1 total p with mo sb colorimetry 1 34 g kg 1 total k with flame photometry 11 92 g kg 1 hydrolysable n 33 50 mg kg 1 olsen p 28 39 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k 253 18 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design a three year field experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2019 the experiment included two factors irrigation mode and irrigation volume in a randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement assigning two irrigation modes as main factors and four irrigation volumes as subfactors the two irrigation modes were prd and conventional furrow irrigation cfi in the field the prd was practiced by alternate furrow irrigation barzegari et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 in which odd number furrows were irrigated for the first time and even number furrows were irrigated at the subsequent irrigation for prd treatment in contrast each furrow was irrigated at each irrigation time for cfi treatment the irrigation volumes were determined by alfalfa evapotranspiration etc which was calculated using the penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 which has been described in previous studies zhang et al 2020 results showed that the alfalfa etc was 943 mm at the experimental site during the whole alfalfa growth season the four irrigation volumes were 70 i1 85 i2 100 i3 and 115 i4 etc prd treatment plots received irrigation water amounts of 50 of cfi treatment plots therefore this experiment was designed with 8 treatments and each treatment contained three replicates areas of alfalfa pasture parcels usually range from 0 1 ha to 0 5 ha in northwestern china due to the household contract responsibility system implemented in the 1980s qu et al 1995 a cropland with 0 27 ha 45 m 59 m was selected as the experimental field and was divided into three blocks as replications with 1 m buffer zones fig 2 each block with a size of 855 m2 45 m 19 m included 8 subplots with dimensions of 10 m 8 m and each subplot consisted of 13 row ridges and 14 furrows to ensure uniform water application a 1 m wide isolation belt was placed among subplots to avoid lateral water movement in addition each subplot was surrounded by 30 cm wide and 30 cm high ridges to avoid surface runoff there was 24 subplots based on the experience of local farmers each subplot received the same amount of irrigation water 40 mm on march 25 and 75 kg ha 1 urea n 46 and 650 kg ha 1 calcium superphosphate p2o5 15 5 on april 7 2017 alternative ridges and furrows with a trapezoidal structure were constructed on the soil surface for each subplot fig 2 in which the alternative ridges were 0 5 m wide 0 3 m high and 8 m long since the 0 5 m ridge width between furrows ensured that intensified wetting and drying cycles under prd occurred barzegari et al 2017 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 zhang et al 2020 the alternative furrows had dimensions of 0 3 m top width 0 25 m bottom width and a 0 3 m depth all alternative furrows in each subplot were labeled with arabic numbers fig 2 alfalfa seeds were sown in two rows with 2 cm depth on ridges by a hole sowing machine on april 8 2017 the row spacing was 30 cm and the seeding density was 18 kg ha 1 the alfalfa cultivar was 8920 fm from canada which has been widely planted in the experimental region 2 3 irrigation treatments and field management alfalfa harvesting times are dependent on its early flowering stages 10 bloom in 2017 the first irrigation time was carried out when the alfalfa plants reached a height of 10 cm the second irrigation time was at the branch stage before the first harvest and the next irrigation times were at the end of each harvest and at each branch stage in 2018 2019 the irrigation times were at the regreening stage after winter and the branch stage before the first harvest and irrigation events were conducted after each harvest and at the branch stage which ensured that intensified wetting and drying cycles under prd occurred additionally the actual irrigation date was delayed by 3 7 d if it rained this irrigation arrangement followed the local farmers practices the detailed irrigation times and irrigation volumes are shown in table s1 and table 1 to ensure an accurate irrigation water amount in each subplot the water amount applied to each subplot was measured with a flow meter and detailed information concerning irrigation equipment was obtained from previous studies zhang et al 2020 identical field management such as manual fertilization weeding pests and disease control was applied to each subplot from 2017 to 2019 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 soil water content the soil water content was monitored at 20 cm depth intervals up to 200 cm and fresh soil with two replicates in each subplot was randomly collected by a soil auger with a 4 cm diameter and a 20 cm height to measure the gravimetric soil water content with conventional methods zhang et al 2020 soil sampling points were placed randomly in furrows irrigation and no irrigation and ridges and all soil samples in each subplot were mixed as composite soil samples to measure the soil water content the monitoring of soil water content was conducted at 10 day intervals from the first irrigation to the last harvest time in 2017 to 2019 after sampling the soil for the soil water content each hole created by the soil auger was filled with the experimental field soil to avoid the effect of the hole on water infiltration at each time the soil water content from 2017 to 2019 is shown in fig 3 2 4 2 plant and soil sampling to sample roots and soil in successive years a framework was developed to collect roots and soil sample for accurately measuring the forage yield of perennial plants in three years fig 4 referring to a previous study hakl et al 2018 first three permanent quadrats with a size of 1 m 1 m were set up in a relatively central area of each subplot to measure forage yield fig 4 second a circle with a 1 2 m radius was designed to ensure that the circle center coincided with the permanent quadrat center developing a protection area between the permanent quadrat and the circle edge which was beneficial in accurately to measure forage yield third 6 rays from the circle center were used to divide outside of the circle into six equal parts which were designated as the root and soil sampling area during the three years fourth two paired root and soil sampling quadrats of 25 cm 25 cm in the diagonal scheme were randomly put to sample roots and soil at each year the soil sampling quadrats for measuring the soil n and bulk density were collected from ridges and furrows in each subplot which encompasses the horizon differences of soil water between ridges and furrows this design can measure forage yield accurately and collect root and soil samples for each of the three years shoot biomass forage yield was harvested at the early flowering stage which was conducted three times in 2017 and four times in 2018 and 2019 table s1 root and soil samples were collected when the last harvest was carried out for each year root and soil samples were collected by a cube soil column with a size of 25 cm 25 cm 20 cm at 20 cm intervals up to 100 cm each cube soil column at each soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm was divided into root samples and soil samples by using a 2 mm sieve with the movement of some large particles stones and gravel and vegetative debris the root samples of each soil layer from 6 root and soil sampling quadrats were mixed into a representative sample for each subplot and was carefully washed with tap water and rinsed with deionized water the soil samples from 6 root and soil sampling quadrats in the same layer were thoroughly mixed to form one composite sample additionally the soil profile produced by collecting soil columns was used to analyze soil bulk density by using a stainless steel cutting ring volume 100 cm3 at 20 cm depth increments to a depth of 100 cm all plant and soil samples were transported and stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 3 sample analysis shoot samples were immediately overdried at 105 for 1 h to inactivate enzymes the inactivated shoot samples were dried at 65 to a constant weight and weighed the cleaned root samples were used to measure total root length cm and total root surface area cm2 using a scanner seiko epson corporation nagano japan and winrhizo software regents instruments inc quebec city canada then the roots were dried at 65 to a constant weight to obtain the weight of the root system finally the dried shoot and root samples were ground into powder and sieved with a 1 mm mesh screen to determine the total n concentration by the dumas dry combustion method and the alfalfa shoot n concentration from 2017 to 2019 is shown in fig s1 to fig s3 soil samples were air dried at room temperature to measure the soil organic carbon soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in addition soil samples for measuring soil bulk density were dried at 105 to a constant weight for weighing the soil organic carbon and soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were measured by using the method recommended by pang et al 2020 and yu et al 2017 2 5 the calculation of water productivity water productivity was expressed as the ratio of alfalfa seasonal forage yield kg ha 1 to the sum of irrigation amount mm and rainfall mm during the alfalfa growth period mohtashami et al 2020 the equation was as follows 1 water productivity alfalfa seasonal forage yield irrigation amount rainfall 2 6 soil n availability calculations the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock were used to estimate soil n availability in which the no3 n nh4 n ratio was the ratio of no3 n concentration to nh4 n concentration the soil n stocks were calculated as follows 2 s o i l n s t o c k s i 1 n b d i s o i l n i d i 0 01 where soil ni is the soil no3 n mg kg 1 and nh4 n mg kg 1 concentrations at depth i bdi is the soil bulk density at depth i g cm 3 which was calculated by dividing the weight of the dry soil by the volume of each core occupied by soil di is the depth of soil layers cm i represents the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 soil layers and 0 01 represents the unit conversion factor soil n availability in cropland agroecosystems was not only affected by agricultural management but also related to plant n uptake therefore alfalfa n uptake was calculated by alfalfa shoot biomass and n concentration in shoots which neglect root n uptake since it is impossible to select all roots in the field and the alfalfa n uptake was calculated as follows 3 a l f a l f a n u p t a k e j 1 n n c o n c e n t r a t i o n j s h o o t b i o m a s s j where n concentration j is the n concentration in the shoots at harvesting time j shoot biomass j is the shoot biomass at harvesting time j and j represents the harvesting times during each year 2 7 statistical analyses to determine the treatment effects the 2017 2019 data was analyzed separately using the following procedure to minimize variations in weather all data variables from 2017 to 2019 shoot biomass alfalfa n uptake water productivity soil organic matter soil nh4 n concentration soil no3 n concentration the soil no3 n nh4 n ratio soil nh4 n stocks and soil no3 n stocks were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity if necessary the data was base 10 log transformed to comply with the assumption of normality and homogeneity for further variance analysis to determine whether the irrigation modes irrigation volumes and the interactions between the irrigation modes and irrigation volumes affect forage yield alfalfa n uptake water productivity soil organic matter soil nh4 n concentration soil no3 n concentration the no3 n nh4 n ratio soil nh4 n stocks and soil no3 n stocks a generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the effect of irrigation modes irrigation volumes and their interaction on the above measured variables in the model the abovementioned variables acted as a response variable the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were treated as fixed effects and the subplots were treated as random factors when anova indicated a significant difference multiple comparisons among treatments were performed using tukey s test if an interaction variable was significant a multivariate polynomial regression model was used to find the optimal model based on the determination coefficient and p value a quadratic polynomial regression model was used to find the optimal combination between irrigation modes and irrigation volumes in the quadratic polynomial regression model the variable was defined as a dependent variable the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were defined as independent variables and the irrigation modes were assigned a numerical value when the coefficient of determination r2 of the regression model was significant p 0 01 the models accurately predicted the variables in this field experiment and reflected the variable response to the interaction between irrigation modes and irrigation volumes the multivariate quadratic polynomial regression model was created with matlab 2014 and other statistical analyses was performed with the spss 17 0 software package from spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 forage yield water productivity and alfalfa n uptake the responses of the seasonal forage yield water productivity alfalfa n uptake to the irrigation modes and the irrigation volumes were consistent among the three years table 2 fig 5 prd significantly increased water productivity fig 5 and alfalfa n uptake fig 6 p 0 05 the seasonal forage yield water productivity and alfalfa n uptake increased and then decreased as irrigation volume increased peaking under i3 irrigation conditions table 2 3 2 soil organic matter the effects of irrigation modes irrigation volume and their interaction on soil organic matter were consistent during the period of 2017 2019 prd significantly increased soil organic matter fig 7 p 0 05 as irrigation volume increased soil organic matter remained relatively stable 3 3 soil nh4 n and no3 n stocks the prd significantly increased the soil nh4 n concentration from the 0 60 cm depth table s2 and the no3 n concentration from the 0 80 cm depth table s3 p 0 05 the effects of irrigation modes and irrigation volumes on soil nh4 n and no3 n stocks and the no3 n nh4 n ratio was consistent in 2017 2019 the prd significantly increased the nh4 n stock fig 8 no3 n stocks fig 9 and the no3 n nh4 n ratio fig 10 p 0 05 with the increase in irrigation volume the nh4 n stock increased and then remained stable whereas the no3 n stock increased and then decreased the interaction between irrigation modes and irrigation volumes showed 3d response surface plots of no3 n stocks fig 11 the binary quadratic polynomial regression model was y 153 72 19 63 1 389 50 2 29 65 1 x 2 170 70 2 2 r2 0 38 p 0 001 where y x 1 and x 2 represent the no3 n stock irrigation modes and irrigation volumes respectively fitting results showed that the maximum no3 n stock was achieved when prd and 100 etc were applied 4 discussion many previous studies have shown that prd can increase consoli et al 2017 maintain xiao et al 2015 or slightly decrease crop yield hu et al 2009 and can alter the soil n availability to annual crops wang et al 2019 2020a these studies have focused on crop yield from one harvest in successive years barzegari et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 or multiple harvesting times in one year xiao et al 2015 in contrast to previous studies data from multiple harvesting times in three successive years were used to investigate the effect of prd on seasonal forage yield and soil n availability to alfalfa this study shows that prd can maintain stable seasonal forage yield since it does not affect the forage yield of each harvest which is in line with the first hypothesis this result agrees with the results from one harvest in successive years zhang et al 2019 yet differs from results with multiple harvesting times in one year xiao et al 2015 this difference is mainly ascribed to the interval period of the two irrigation times the interval period between the second harvesting and third harvesting in the study carried out by xiao et al 2015 is over 50 days in which a shortage of the water supply results in a reduction in forage yield in the third harvesting time under prd conditions leading to a decrease in seasonal forage yield however the interval period between two harvesting times in this experiment ranges from 25 days to 30 days table s1 and this interval period can decrease soil evaporation which in turn maintains relatively higher soil water content ensuring alfalfa health growth under prd conditions the results also show that prd increases water productivity since prd has a lower irrigation requirement with the maintenance of seasonal forage yield and this is also found in potato sarker et al 2019 these outcomes suggest that an appropriate irrigation interval is very important for the stable seasonal forage yield of alfalfa pasture in relation to prd in this case prd has been found to increase alfalfa n uptake which can be explained by alfalfa dry matter and n concentration first prd increased alfalfa dry biomass especially root biomass fig 12 since the cycling of drying and wetting under prd can increase total root length fig s4 and total root surface area fig s5 which enlarges the contact area between the soil n and root systems improving the n uptake by alfalfa second prd increased n concentration in alfalfa plant because prd encouraged the accumulation of soluble proteins in the plant raza et al 2017 this study also shows that prd increases soil organic matter since the soil drying process under prd conditions can lead to negative soil water potentials wang et al 2017b which encourages more microbial cells to die wang et al 2017b and these dead microbial cells increase the input resources of soil organic matter this study shows that the prd can increase the no3 n nh4 n ratio which is in accordance with the second hypothesis this can be ascribed to the fact that prd can reduce no3 n loss via runoff and leaching barzegari et al 2017 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 because of lower irrigation water under prd conditions in contrast to cfi although the no3 n nh4 n ratio is more than 1 in both the prd and cfi conditions the prd can maintain a higher no3 n concentration than the nh4 n concentration indicating that the prd can enhance the predominant form of no3 n the prd has been further verified to increase the soil no3 n stock and nh4 n stock which partly supports the third hypothesis the higher soil no3 n and nh4 n stocks can be explained in three ways first in contrast to cfi lower soil water and the cycling of drying under prd conditions can result in relatively normoxic conditions unconducive to denitrification han et al 2018 since prd can increase soil porosity and improve soil aeration wang et al 2017a which is disadvantageous to denitrification in addition previous studies have shown that prd can reduce soil evaporation han et al 2014 hu et al 2009 which leads to a decrease in nh3 volatilization second prd can increase no3 n and nh4 n concentrations by accelerating the mineralization rate of soil organic n gao et al 2020 shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2017b third higher organic matter under prd conditions leads to an increase in the mineralization rate wang et al 2017b since soil organic matter is positively correlated with soil no3 n and nh4 n fig s6 additionally the relationships among irrigation modes irrigation volumes and no3 n stock show that the optimal combination of prd and etc for no3 n stock is prd and 100 etc which is recommended as the optimal irrigation volume for prd and sustainable alfalfa production in an experimental environment this study demonstrates a strong link between prd and soil n availability to alfalfa prd can increase soil n availability to alfalfa when the soil n availability is estimated by the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock these results provide accurate information for soil n management in alfalfa pastures when prds are applied 5 conclusions this study employs alfalfa as a perennial crop to investigate the effect of prd on soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops by using the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n and nh4 n stocks through three year field plot experiments the results show that prd increases the no3 n stock nh4 n stock and no3 n nh4 n ratio this also increases alfalfa n uptake and water productivity contributing to the maintenance of alfalfa seasonal forage yield the optimal combination of prd and etc for maximizing the no3 n stock is 100 etc the findings of the

9848,available soil n is critical for n fertilizer management in crop production but the effects of alternate partial root zone drying prd on the dynamics of n and the impact of these effects on perennial crops such as alfalfa medicago sativa l have not been evaluated a field experiment was conducted to compare two irrigation modes prd and conventional furrow irrigation cfi in combination with four irrigation levels 70 etc evapotranspiration 85 etc 100 etc and 115 etc prd improved the mineralization of organic matter to increase available n and the no3 n nh4 n ratio thus it increased n uptake water productivity and maintained seasonal forage yield the combination of prd and irrigation level 100 etc produced maximum no3 n stock these results present an evaluation of how prd influences soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops keywords alternate partial root zone drying seasonal forage yield soil n stocks no3 n nh4 n ratio 1 introduction soil nitrogen n in cropland agroecosystems relates to crop productivity grahmann et al 2020 atmospheric n2o concentration bai et al 2020 gao et al 2020 and global biogeochemical cycles xu et al 2020 and its stocks are the main sources of n availability to crops alam et al 2020 franzluebbers et al 2000 therefore soil n availability to crops is an effective tool for properly managing n fertilizer application in cropland agroecosystems li et al 2019 mariano et al 2017 considering that excessive n fertilizer often has negative impacts on soil quality and the environment yin et al 2020 the definition of soil n availability varies with different sources and soil n availability has been estimated in previous studies by using various indicators mariano et al 2017 li et al 2019 in cropland ecosystems soil n availability is usually estimated by the soil nh4 n concentration and no3 n concentration stevens et al 2010 whereas some studies have considered the no3 n nh4 n ratio a better indicator than their concentrations to estimate the soil n availability to crops li et al 2019 considering the no3 n nh4 n ratio can not only reflect the soil no3 n and nh4 n supply for plant growth davidson et al 2007 and the dominant form of soil inorganic n xiao et al 2018 but may reflect the soil n in relation to c dynamics srivastava et al 2016 furthermore recent studies have argued that the soil no3 n stock and nh4 n stock are suitable for evaluating n availability to crops alam et al 2020 wang et al 2020c zhou et al 2020 since the soil no3 n stock and nh4 n stock represent the soil inorganic n supply in the long term bell et al 2012 these results demonstrate that the soil no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock can be used to estimate soil n availability to crops therefore it is necessary to simultaneously estimate the soil n availability to crops by using the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock which can provide more accurate information for n management in cropland agroecosystems soil n availability to crops has been verified to be affected by irrigation alrajhi et al 2015 bai et al 2020 wang et al 2017b alternate partial root zone drying prd induces plant root systems to enter a wet dry cycling soil environment wang et al 2007 which improves water productivity without yield loss this irrigation technique has been successfully applied to many crops because it saves irrigation water alrajhi et al 2015 wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 studies that have examined prd in relation to soil n have focused on the effect of prd on soil n availability to annual crops barzegari et al 2017 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 however how the prd influences soil n availability to perennial crops has received little attention alfalfa medicago sativa l a perennial and highly valued crop in various agroecosystems strullu et al 2020 is widely used to establish pastures which sustain animal production and control soil erosion throughout the world bhandari et al 2020 wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020 currently prd has been verified to be successful for application in alfalfa production in china with high water use efficiency xiao et al 2015 and economic benefits zhang et al 2020 however persistent production of alfalfa pasture is not only dependent on irrigation water but also relies on soil n availability strullu et al 2020 especially in regions with a shortage of soil n wang et al 2020c although alfalfa can fix n from the atmosphere bhandari et al 2020 therefore understanding the effect of prd on soil n availability to alfalfa is imperative to accurately manage soil n in alfalfa pastures where prd is applied which can highlight the dynamics of how prd influences soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops the aim of this study was to employ alfalfa as an example crop to investigate the effect of prd on soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops by using the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock through a three year field experiment here this study hypothesizes that 1 the prd maintains the seasonal forage yield of alfalfa pasture 2 the prd enhances the dominant form of soil no3 n of inorganic n and 3 the prd decreases soil n availability no3 n stock and nh4 n stock since the prd can encourage alfalfa to deplete more soil n 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experimental site was located in wuwei city 37 42 n 102 48 e elevation 1710 m in gansu province china the climate at the experimental site was typical continental temperate the average annual air temperature during the 1996 2015 period was 9 with a maximum in july 36 06 and a minimum in january 19 14 and the average annual precipitation was 175 mm most of which occurred from june to september while the mean annual pan evaporation was approximately 2000 mm the groundwater table was 30 m below the soil surface wang et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the mean monthly precipitation and air temperature during the experimental period 2017 2019 are shown in fig 1 the soil in this area is classified as irragric anthrosols world reference base for soil resources the soil bulk density field capacity and wilting point by weight g g 1 for the 0 200 cm soil layer was 1 49 0 05 g cm 3 0 2201 0 03 g g 1 and 0 0805 0 0003 g g 1 respectively which were measured by using the cutting ring method before 2017 five soil samples at 0 40 cm were randomly sampled by soil auger in the experimental field to measure basic chemical properties the soil chemical properties at the 0 40 cm layer was as follows ph 8 20 soil organic carbon 12 90 g kg 1 total n 0 86 g kg 1 total p with mo sb colorimetry 1 34 g kg 1 total k with flame photometry 11 92 g kg 1 hydrolysable n 33 50 mg kg 1 olsen p 28 39 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k 253 18 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design a three year field experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2019 the experiment included two factors irrigation mode and irrigation volume in a randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement assigning two irrigation modes as main factors and four irrigation volumes as subfactors the two irrigation modes were prd and conventional furrow irrigation cfi in the field the prd was practiced by alternate furrow irrigation barzegari et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 in which odd number furrows were irrigated for the first time and even number furrows were irrigated at the subsequent irrigation for prd treatment in contrast each furrow was irrigated at each irrigation time for cfi treatment the irrigation volumes were determined by alfalfa evapotranspiration etc which was calculated using the penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 which has been described in previous studies zhang et al 2020 results showed that the alfalfa etc was 943 mm at the experimental site during the whole alfalfa growth season the four irrigation volumes were 70 i1 85 i2 100 i3 and 115 i4 etc prd treatment plots received irrigation water amounts of 50 of cfi treatment plots therefore this experiment was designed with 8 treatments and each treatment contained three replicates areas of alfalfa pasture parcels usually range from 0 1 ha to 0 5 ha in northwestern china due to the household contract responsibility system implemented in the 1980s qu et al 1995 a cropland with 0 27 ha 45 m 59 m was selected as the experimental field and was divided into three blocks as replications with 1 m buffer zones fig 2 each block with a size of 855 m2 45 m 19 m included 8 subplots with dimensions of 10 m 8 m and each subplot consisted of 13 row ridges and 14 furrows to ensure uniform water application a 1 m wide isolation belt was placed among subplots to avoid lateral water movement in addition each subplot was surrounded by 30 cm wide and 30 cm high ridges to avoid surface runoff there was 24 subplots based on the experience of local farmers each subplot received the same amount of irrigation water 40 mm on march 25 and 75 kg ha 1 urea n 46 and 650 kg ha 1 calcium superphosphate p2o5 15 5 on april 7 2017 alternative ridges and furrows with a trapezoidal structure were constructed on the soil surface for each subplot fig 2 in which the alternative ridges were 0 5 m wide 0 3 m high and 8 m long since the 0 5 m ridge width between furrows ensured that intensified wetting and drying cycles under prd occurred barzegari et al 2017 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 zhang et al 2020 the alternative furrows had dimensions of 0 3 m top width 0 25 m bottom width and a 0 3 m depth all alternative furrows in each subplot were labeled with arabic numbers fig 2 alfalfa seeds were sown in two rows with 2 cm depth on ridges by a hole sowing machine on april 8 2017 the row spacing was 30 cm and the seeding density was 18 kg ha 1 the alfalfa cultivar was 8920 fm from canada which has been widely planted in the experimental region 2 3 irrigation treatments and field management alfalfa harvesting times are dependent on its early flowering stages 10 bloom in 2017 the first irrigation time was carried out when the alfalfa plants reached a height of 10 cm the second irrigation time was at the branch stage before the first harvest and the next irrigation times were at the end of each harvest and at each branch stage in 2018 2019 the irrigation times were at the regreening stage after winter and the branch stage before the first harvest and irrigation events were conducted after each harvest and at the branch stage which ensured that intensified wetting and drying cycles under prd occurred additionally the actual irrigation date was delayed by 3 7 d if it rained this irrigation arrangement followed the local farmers practices the detailed irrigation times and irrigation volumes are shown in table s1 and table 1 to ensure an accurate irrigation water amount in each subplot the water amount applied to each subplot was measured with a flow meter and detailed information concerning irrigation equipment was obtained from previous studies zhang et al 2020 identical field management such as manual fertilization weeding pests and disease control was applied to each subplot from 2017 to 2019 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 soil water content the soil water content was monitored at 20 cm depth intervals up to 200 cm and fresh soil with two replicates in each subplot was randomly collected by a soil auger with a 4 cm diameter and a 20 cm height to measure the gravimetric soil water content with conventional methods zhang et al 2020 soil sampling points were placed randomly in furrows irrigation and no irrigation and ridges and all soil samples in each subplot were mixed as composite soil samples to measure the soil water content the monitoring of soil water content was conducted at 10 day intervals from the first irrigation to the last harvest time in 2017 to 2019 after sampling the soil for the soil water content each hole created by the soil auger was filled with the experimental field soil to avoid the effect of the hole on water infiltration at each time the soil water content from 2017 to 2019 is shown in fig 3 2 4 2 plant and soil sampling to sample roots and soil in successive years a framework was developed to collect roots and soil sample for accurately measuring the forage yield of perennial plants in three years fig 4 referring to a previous study hakl et al 2018 first three permanent quadrats with a size of 1 m 1 m were set up in a relatively central area of each subplot to measure forage yield fig 4 second a circle with a 1 2 m radius was designed to ensure that the circle center coincided with the permanent quadrat center developing a protection area between the permanent quadrat and the circle edge which was beneficial in accurately to measure forage yield third 6 rays from the circle center were used to divide outside of the circle into six equal parts which were designated as the root and soil sampling area during the three years fourth two paired root and soil sampling quadrats of 25 cm 25 cm in the diagonal scheme were randomly put to sample roots and soil at each year the soil sampling quadrats for measuring the soil n and bulk density were collected from ridges and furrows in each subplot which encompasses the horizon differences of soil water between ridges and furrows this design can measure forage yield accurately and collect root and soil samples for each of the three years shoot biomass forage yield was harvested at the early flowering stage which was conducted three times in 2017 and four times in 2018 and 2019 table s1 root and soil samples were collected when the last harvest was carried out for each year root and soil samples were collected by a cube soil column with a size of 25 cm 25 cm 20 cm at 20 cm intervals up to 100 cm each cube soil column at each soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm was divided into root samples and soil samples by using a 2 mm sieve with the movement of some large particles stones and gravel and vegetative debris the root samples of each soil layer from 6 root and soil sampling quadrats were mixed into a representative sample for each subplot and was carefully washed with tap water and rinsed with deionized water the soil samples from 6 root and soil sampling quadrats in the same layer were thoroughly mixed to form one composite sample additionally the soil profile produced by collecting soil columns was used to analyze soil bulk density by using a stainless steel cutting ring volume 100 cm3 at 20 cm depth increments to a depth of 100 cm all plant and soil samples were transported and stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 3 sample analysis shoot samples were immediately overdried at 105 for 1 h to inactivate enzymes the inactivated shoot samples were dried at 65 to a constant weight and weighed the cleaned root samples were used to measure total root length cm and total root surface area cm2 using a scanner seiko epson corporation nagano japan and winrhizo software regents instruments inc quebec city canada then the roots were dried at 65 to a constant weight to obtain the weight of the root system finally the dried shoot and root samples were ground into powder and sieved with a 1 mm mesh screen to determine the total n concentration by the dumas dry combustion method and the alfalfa shoot n concentration from 2017 to 2019 is shown in fig s1 to fig s3 soil samples were air dried at room temperature to measure the soil organic carbon soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in addition soil samples for measuring soil bulk density were dried at 105 to a constant weight for weighing the soil organic carbon and soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were measured by using the method recommended by pang et al 2020 and yu et al 2017 2 5 the calculation of water productivity water productivity was expressed as the ratio of alfalfa seasonal forage yield kg ha 1 to the sum of irrigation amount mm and rainfall mm during the alfalfa growth period mohtashami et al 2020 the equation was as follows 1 water productivity alfalfa seasonal forage yield irrigation amount rainfall 2 6 soil n availability calculations the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock were used to estimate soil n availability in which the no3 n nh4 n ratio was the ratio of no3 n concentration to nh4 n concentration the soil n stocks were calculated as follows 2 s o i l n s t o c k s i 1 n b d i s o i l n i d i 0 01 where soil ni is the soil no3 n mg kg 1 and nh4 n mg kg 1 concentrations at depth i bdi is the soil bulk density at depth i g cm 3 which was calculated by dividing the weight of the dry soil by the volume of each core occupied by soil di is the depth of soil layers cm i represents the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 soil layers and 0 01 represents the unit conversion factor soil n availability in cropland agroecosystems was not only affected by agricultural management but also related to plant n uptake therefore alfalfa n uptake was calculated by alfalfa shoot biomass and n concentration in shoots which neglect root n uptake since it is impossible to select all roots in the field and the alfalfa n uptake was calculated as follows 3 a l f a l f a n u p t a k e j 1 n n c o n c e n t r a t i o n j s h o o t b i o m a s s j where n concentration j is the n concentration in the shoots at harvesting time j shoot biomass j is the shoot biomass at harvesting time j and j represents the harvesting times during each year 2 7 statistical analyses to determine the treatment effects the 2017 2019 data was analyzed separately using the following procedure to minimize variations in weather all data variables from 2017 to 2019 shoot biomass alfalfa n uptake water productivity soil organic matter soil nh4 n concentration soil no3 n concentration the soil no3 n nh4 n ratio soil nh4 n stocks and soil no3 n stocks were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity if necessary the data was base 10 log transformed to comply with the assumption of normality and homogeneity for further variance analysis to determine whether the irrigation modes irrigation volumes and the interactions between the irrigation modes and irrigation volumes affect forage yield alfalfa n uptake water productivity soil organic matter soil nh4 n concentration soil no3 n concentration the no3 n nh4 n ratio soil nh4 n stocks and soil no3 n stocks a generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the effect of irrigation modes irrigation volumes and their interaction on the above measured variables in the model the abovementioned variables acted as a response variable the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were treated as fixed effects and the subplots were treated as random factors when anova indicated a significant difference multiple comparisons among treatments were performed using tukey s test if an interaction variable was significant a multivariate polynomial regression model was used to find the optimal model based on the determination coefficient and p value a quadratic polynomial regression model was used to find the optimal combination between irrigation modes and irrigation volumes in the quadratic polynomial regression model the variable was defined as a dependent variable the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were defined as independent variables and the irrigation modes were assigned a numerical value when the coefficient of determination r2 of the regression model was significant p 0 01 the models accurately predicted the variables in this field experiment and reflected the variable response to the interaction between irrigation modes and irrigation volumes the multivariate quadratic polynomial regression model was created with matlab 2014 and other statistical analyses was performed with the spss 17 0 software package from spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 forage yield water productivity and alfalfa n uptake the responses of the seasonal forage yield water productivity alfalfa n uptake to the irrigation modes and the irrigation volumes were consistent among the three years table 2 fig 5 prd significantly increased water productivity fig 5 and alfalfa n uptake fig 6 p 0 05 the seasonal forage yield water productivity and alfalfa n uptake increased and then decreased as irrigation volume increased peaking under i3 irrigation conditions table 2 3 2 soil organic matter the effects of irrigation modes irrigation volume and their interaction on soil organic matter were consistent during the period of 2017 2019 prd significantly increased soil organic matter fig 7 p 0 05 as irrigation volume increased soil organic matter remained relatively stable 3 3 soil nh4 n and no3 n stocks the prd significantly increased the soil nh4 n concentration from the 0 60 cm depth table s2 and the no3 n concentration from the 0 80 cm depth table s3 p 0 05 the effects of irrigation modes and irrigation volumes on soil nh4 n and no3 n stocks and the no3 n nh4 n ratio was consistent in 2017 2019 the prd significantly increased the nh4 n stock fig 8 no3 n stocks fig 9 and the no3 n nh4 n ratio fig 10 p 0 05 with the increase in irrigation volume the nh4 n stock increased and then remained stable whereas the no3 n stock increased and then decreased the interaction between irrigation modes and irrigation volumes showed 3d response surface plots of no3 n stocks fig 11 the binary quadratic polynomial regression model was y 153 72 19 63 1 389 50 2 29 65 1 x 2 170 70 2 2 r2 0 38 p 0 001 where y x 1 and x 2 represent the no3 n stock irrigation modes and irrigation volumes respectively fitting results showed that the maximum no3 n stock was achieved when prd and 100 etc were applied 4 discussion many previous studies have shown that prd can increase consoli et al 2017 maintain xiao et al 2015 or slightly decrease crop yield hu et al 2009 and can alter the soil n availability to annual crops wang et al 2019 2020a these studies have focused on crop yield from one harvest in successive years barzegari et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 or multiple harvesting times in one year xiao et al 2015 in contrast to previous studies data from multiple harvesting times in three successive years were used to investigate the effect of prd on seasonal forage yield and soil n availability to alfalfa this study shows that prd can maintain stable seasonal forage yield since it does not affect the forage yield of each harvest which is in line with the first hypothesis this result agrees with the results from one harvest in successive years zhang et al 2019 yet differs from results with multiple harvesting times in one year xiao et al 2015 this difference is mainly ascribed to the interval period of the two irrigation times the interval period between the second harvesting and third harvesting in the study carried out by xiao et al 2015 is over 50 days in which a shortage of the water supply results in a reduction in forage yield in the third harvesting time under prd conditions leading to a decrease in seasonal forage yield however the interval period between two harvesting times in this experiment ranges from 25 days to 30 days table s1 and this interval period can decrease soil evaporation which in turn maintains relatively higher soil water content ensuring alfalfa health growth under prd conditions the results also show that prd increases water productivity since prd has a lower irrigation requirement with the maintenance of seasonal forage yield and this is also found in potato sarker et al 2019 these outcomes suggest that an appropriate irrigation interval is very important for the stable seasonal forage yield of alfalfa pasture in relation to prd in this case prd has been found to increase alfalfa n uptake which can be explained by alfalfa dry matter and n concentration first prd increased alfalfa dry biomass especially root biomass fig 12 since the cycling of drying and wetting under prd can increase total root length fig s4 and total root surface area fig s5 which enlarges the contact area between the soil n and root systems improving the n uptake by alfalfa second prd increased n concentration in alfalfa plant because prd encouraged the accumulation of soluble proteins in the plant raza et al 2017 this study also shows that prd increases soil organic matter since the soil drying process under prd conditions can lead to negative soil water potentials wang et al 2017b which encourages more microbial cells to die wang et al 2017b and these dead microbial cells increase the input resources of soil organic matter this study shows that the prd can increase the no3 n nh4 n ratio which is in accordance with the second hypothesis this can be ascribed to the fact that prd can reduce no3 n loss via runoff and leaching barzegari et al 2017 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 because of lower irrigation water under prd conditions in contrast to cfi although the no3 n nh4 n ratio is more than 1 in both the prd and cfi conditions the prd can maintain a higher no3 n concentration than the nh4 n concentration indicating that the prd can enhance the predominant form of no3 n the prd has been further verified to increase the soil no3 n stock and nh4 n stock which partly supports the third hypothesis the higher soil no3 n and nh4 n stocks can be explained in three ways first in contrast to cfi lower soil water and the cycling of drying under prd conditions can result in relatively normoxic conditions unconducive to denitrification han et al 2018 since prd can increase soil porosity and improve soil aeration wang et al 2017a which is disadvantageous to denitrification in addition previous studies have shown that prd can reduce soil evaporation han et al 2014 hu et al 2009 which leads to a decrease in nh3 volatilization second prd can increase no3 n and nh4 n concentrations by accelerating the mineralization rate of soil organic n gao et al 2020 shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2017b third higher organic matter under prd conditions leads to an increase in the mineralization rate wang et al 2017b since soil organic matter is positively correlated with soil no3 n and nh4 n fig s6 additionally the relationships among irrigation modes irrigation volumes and no3 n stock show that the optimal combination of prd and etc for no3 n stock is prd and 100 etc which is recommended as the optimal irrigation volume for prd and sustainable alfalfa production in an experimental environment this study demonstrates a strong link between prd and soil n availability to alfalfa prd can increase soil n availability to alfalfa when the soil n availability is estimated by the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n stock and nh4 n stock these results provide accurate information for soil n management in alfalfa pastures when prds are applied 5 conclusions this study employs alfalfa as a perennial crop to investigate the effect of prd on soil n availability to n fixing perennial crops by using the no3 n nh4 n ratio no3 n and nh4 n stocks through three year field plot experiments the results show that prd increases the no3 n stock nh4 n stock and no3 n nh4 n ratio this also increases alfalfa n uptake and water productivity contributing to the maintenance of alfalfa seasonal forage yield the optimal combination of prd and etc for maximizing the no3 n stock is 100 etc the findings of the

nutrient element that plants need in high quantities as it is a structural component of many cell metabolites including proteins chlorophylls amino acids nucleic acids alkaloids and hormones taiz and zeiger 2002 consequently a deficiency of n has a dramatic influence on crop yields in agricultural systems and this enforces farmers to apply worldwide over 100 million metric tons of n fertilizer per year to ensure that crops receive adequate n faostat 2018 however excessive or timely inefficient use of n fertilizers by many farmers results in different forms of nitrogen pollution including contamination of water resources by nitrates and gaseous emissions of nitrogen pollutants n2o no nh3 therefore sutton et al 2013 characterize n a key element in the united nations environment program anon 2019 thus a reduction in n supply without compromising yield and quality which increases nitrogen use efficiency i e plant yield per unit of applied n is a prerequisite for sustainability in modern agricultural systems eunep 2015 modern greenhouse installations occupy a significant part of agricultural land in mediterranean countries summing over 200 000 ha with soilless culture being increasingly used in these as a means to optimize root growth conditions and minimize infestation by soil borne pests and diseases gallardo et al 2013 savvas and neocleous 2019 nikolaou et al 2020 greenhouse cultivation relies on high addition of fertilizers to render high yields sonneveld and voogt 2009 leonardi and maggio 2013 however excess or timely inefficient n application in greenhouses results in high nitrate no3 concentrations in the fertigation effluents leaching to surface and ground water n gas emissions daum and schenk 1998 and high no3 levels in edible plant parts of leafy vegetables which entail health related risks gruda et al 2018 in cases that frequent discharge of fertigation effluents from these greenhouses is inevitable katsoulas et al 2015 substantial no3 n losses up to 380 kg ha 1 y 1 have been reported savvas and gruda 2018 in the past few years in northern european greenhouses annual n losses from open soilless systems 30 50 leachates approached 1000 kg ha 1 gianquinto et al 2013 to cope with nitrate related problems the european union eu has adopted the nitrates directive 91 676 eec which was complemented with the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and other regulations such as 1258 2011 for maximum levels of nitrates in certain vegetables and foodstuffs however recently it has been recognized that implementation actions such as accurate nutrient management need to be more efficiently adapted to different regional hotspots anon 2018 therefore the reduction of n supply in intensive production systems in mediterranean greenhouses without affecting yield and quality is of primary importance for the transition to a more circular economy characterized by less waste of nitrogen and improved nitrogen use efficiency nue at farm level eunep 2015 the switching to closed hydroponic systems chs offers excellent opportunities to meet these aims i e save and grow by recycling nutrients and water thereby reducing leaching of chemicals including nitrates and phosphates and saving precious water savvas and neocleous 2019 the collection and reuse of the excess nutrient solution ns that drains out of the roots in closed hydroponic systems chs is termed nutrient solution recycling and provides 40 50 savings in total supply of fertilizers varlagas et al 2010 furthermore chs combined with modern greenhouse technology offer great opportunities towards sustainable crop production that can contribute to mitigation of the global climate change in mediterranean greenhouses savvas 2002 medecc 2020 and promote new dietary societal demands sambo et al 2019 in chs the surplus nutrient solution that drains out of the root zone is replenished with nutrients and water prior to recycling the net supply of nutrients via concentrated stock solutions in chs is based on the concept of the expected nutrient uptake concentrations i e mass of nutrient per water volume absorbed sonneveld and voogt 2009 thus determining mean nutrient ucs for a crop species is the first step for both establishing a reference nutrient solution for chs and calculating target nutrient concentrations in the drip solution for open and closed soilless culture systems savvas and gruda 2018 however changes in the stage of crop development e g fruit setting or in environmental conditions e g light conditions root zone salinity require frequent adjustment of the nutrient injection rates to maintain target nutrient concentrations in the root zone benton jones 1997 adams 2002 neocleous and savvas 2016 an additional reason for frequent adjustment of the nutrient injection rates in chs is the composition of the reused drainage solution which is not constant but variable over time therefore nutrient recycling relies much more on scientific knowledge and skillful management of nutrition than the supply of a standard nutrient solution in open soilless systems and this is one of the main reasons that discourages growers in mediterranean greenhouses to switch to chs furthermore the uptake concentrations can be used through on line operating decision support systems such as nutrisense https nutrisense online which was developed by savvas et al 2020 to automatically calculate and readjust nutrient solutions for open and closed hydroponic cultivations in response to the growth stage and the prevailing environmental conditions the current n recommendation for open soilless greenhouse tomato production amounts to 16 mmol l 1 sonneveld and voogt 2009 because the nitrate ion no3 is needed to maintain charge balance with k ca2 and mg2 in the nutrient solution on the other hand the element chlorine found in the nutrient solution and plants as the chloride ion cl has been traditionally considered a harmful anion this is because cl which is abundant in soils and water and accumulates at excessive concentrations in the root zone is usually accompanied by sodium na furthermore many scientists only point to an antagonistic relationship between no3 and cl grattan and grieve 1998 cl as an essential micronutrient is required in the chloroplasts where it is involved in the oxidation of water in photosystem ii and might regulate the activity of some enzymes implicated in cell division although it is considered a trace element most plants generally absorb chlorine at levels much higher than those required for the essential micronutrient functions 0 1 0 2 mg g 1 dry weight wege et al 2017 reaching similar concentrations in plant tissues with those of macronutrients 2 20 mg g 1 dry weight colmenero flores et al 2019 thus new biological functions have been recently attributed to cl such as the regulation of cell osmosis electrical charge balance and enhanced co2 water and nitrogen use efficiency which are not essential but beneficial to plants raven 2017 chloride might function as the counter ion during rapid k fluxes contributing to maintenance of turgor in guard cells to maintain bulk electrical neutrality anions such as cl or no3 are transported from the cytoplasm into the vacuole through common transporters in the membrane wege et al 2017 most of cl absorbed by plants is located in the vacuole and cytosol as free anion contributing to cell osmoregulation similarly to no3 papadopoulos and hao 2002 thus the similar osmoregulation functions of these two ions may be the eliciting factor of competition in uptake between them on the other hand these similarities provide opportunities to reduce vacuolar nitrate accumulation while increasing nitrate availability for plant assimilation processes by substituting part of no3 with cl supply gianquinto et al 2013 colmenero flores et al 2019 these findings raise the question as to whether synchronic application of cl and no3 in closed hydroponic tomato crops up to certain levels is not antagonistic but synergistic providing substantial benefits to growers and the environment without detrimental effects on yield and quality franco navarro et al 2019 tomato large and small fruited tomato types is the most widely cultivated horticultural crop in greenhouses and occupies a dominant position in the modern human diet world vegetable center 2017 because of fruit sensorial e g sugars and acids and health properties e g vitamin c lycopene antioxidative potential in addition a shift to cultivating alternative types of tomatoes with a better taste appealing appearance more lycopene and vitamins a longer post harvest life etc increased global harvested area and production yield up to 40 in the last two decades faostat 2018 tomato is a crop characterized by high input of nutrients due to extensive vegetative biomass production a heavy fruit load and a long cultivation period chapagain and wiesman 2004 at the same time tomato has the lowest sensitivity to salinity high cl tolerance of all fruitιng vegetables grown in greenhouses thus in hydroponics a controlled increase of the total salt concentration in the supplied nutrient solution up to a certain level provides opportunities for managing fruit quality attributes such as their content in dry matter organic acid sugars vitamin c carotenoids and other bioactive compounds magán et al 2008 gruda et al 2018 also fruit physiological disorders in tomato crops such as blossom end rot white flecks and green spots were reduced by adding calcium chloride in the supplied nutrient solution aiming to maintain the cl concentration in the root zone to levels ranging from 8 to 10 mm schnitzler and gruda 2002 gruda 2009 when adequate nutrient concentrations are maintained an average accumulation of nacl in the root zone up to 22 mm has been considered acceptable in tomato crops sonneveld 2002 previous research has also shown that the exposure of fruiting vegetables to salinity in the recycled solution through a process of gradual salt accumulation is less detrimental than an abrupt increase of total salt concentration in the root zone savvas et al 2005 bar yosef 2008 thus shifting the occurrence of salt stress through a process of gradual accumulation to a later stage during the growth cycle i e at commencement of fruit setting may allow tomato plants to adjust their osmotic potential and deploy physiological mechanisms as a functional strategy that mitigates any adverse salinity effects neocleous et al 2017 in this context sonneveld and straver 1994 recommend the addition of extra major nutrients no3 n k and ca2 in the nutrient solution to increase total ionic concentration electrical conductivity ec aiming to increase fruit quality schnitzler and gruda 2002 adams 2002 with minimal or even no yield losses thus in some cases ec values up to 8 ds m 1 in the root zone of tomato may be employed sonneveld 2002 although the standard recommendation is 4 ds m 1 sonneveld and voogt 2009 however high supply levels of no3 n in practice increase no3 leaching as mentioned elsewhere and may induce physiological disorders susceptibility to fungal pathogens while in the fruiting stage can favor vegetative development and negatively affect product quality gianquinto et al 2013 to reduce n supply without reducing the target ec in the root zone and therefore without reducing the supply levels of cations k ca2 and mg2 part of the no3 supply might be replaced by another anion an increase of the h2po4 hpo4 2 supply is not recommended as high p levels in the external solution may result in p toxicity induce gold speck in tomato fruits and cause zn deficiency sonneveld 2002 the common practice to electrochemically balance increased cation concentrations is to use so4 2 as a moderate increase of this anion in the root zone beyond the standard levels does not cause direct ion toxicities sonneveld 2002 however a huge increase of so4 2 supply may result in its accumulation to levels that may interfere with the uptake of other nutrients forming precipitates or ion pairs lopez baltazar et al 2007 thus to electrochemically balance a further decrease of the no3 n supply to levels below the current recommendations without reducing the cation uptake cl may be the preferable option in support of this notion when the level of cl is not associated with that of na in the external solution and the no3 concentration is not high the uptake of cl by plants increases substantially colmenero flores et al 2019 considering this background an experiment with tomato was conducted in which a standard no3 n concentration in the supplied nutrient solution according to dutch recommendations sonneveld and straver 1994 was compared with a nutrient solution containing 33 less nitrates which were substituted by chlorides the chloride concentration in the supplied nutrient solution followed the levels considered beneficial for several species including tomato i e 5 mm as reported in previous works colmenero flores et al 2019 franco navarro et al 2019 physiological and agronomical responses were evaluated with the aim to study the underlying mechanisms of crop response and to quantify this recommendation in hydroponics 2 material and methods 2 1 cropping system two distinct experiments were carried out at the experimental farm of the cyprus agricultural research institute latitude 34 44 n longitude 33 19 e altitude 35 m above sea level in a plastic multi span greenhouse with maximum height 5 m gutter height 3 m under natural light conditions the greenhouse was north south oriented and the cover material consisted of transparent polyethylene sheets anti drip resistant to uv radiation 88 light transmission the greenhouse was equipped with an automated climate control system heating ventilation and cooling premises and a hydroponic installation constructed according to the principles of nft nutrient film technique twenty hydroponic nft channels 6 m long 0 25 m wide 0 1 m deep fully covered by black white polyethylene sheets were aligned with 20 catchment 42 l and 20 replenishment tanks 110 l to form 20 independent hydroponic units the nutrient solution absorbed by the plants was replenished through automatic flow of the feeding solution from the replenishment tank into the catchment tank to achieve a certain volume of recirculating nutrient solution 3 l plant 1 each hydroponic unit accommodated 14 plants giving a final plant density of 2 5 plants m 2 according to this cropping method the roots of the plants were grown in a shallow stream of a continuously recirculating nutrient solution with a flow rate of about 0 2 m3 h 1 a multi crops per year production strategy was applied instead of one crop per year 2 2 nutrient solution recycling in a closed hydroponic system with continuous nutrient solution recirculation full reuse of the drainage solution the only removal of nutrients and water from the root environment is due to plant uptake thus the technique was based on a programmed addition of nutrients in particular the amounts of water and nutrients introduced into the system were equal to the expected mean uptake concentrations ucs as suggested by sonneveld and voogt 2009 with the exception of no3 n which in one treatment was reduced to 2 3 of the standard recommendations the principle is that although the uptake of nutrients and water are independent processes driven by photosynthesis and transpiration respectively the ratio between nutrient and water uptake is relatively constant when the climatic parameters are maintained within a standard range because leaf stomata pores facilitate both processes thus this ratio can be used as a basis for the addition of fertilizers in the irrigation water sonneveld 2002 thus the fertigation head prepared a nutrient solution for closed systems with nutrient concentrations equal to the anticipated nutrient ucs savvas et al 2013 which was stored in the replenishment tanks from the replenishment tanks the replenishment solution was introduced into the catchment tanks using appropriate equipment with the aim of replenishing nutrients and water at equal ratios with those absorbed by the plants during each particular growth stage thus blending the replenishment solution with the drained solution and adjusting the ph at 5 6 addition of hno3 and rarely khco3 resulted in the preparation of the outgoing irrigation solution that was constantly supplied to the crop using a pump 2 3 plant material growing conditions two experiments were conducted in an nft system using large and small fruited tomato solanum lycopersicum l cultivars the first experiment was set up on 13 november 2019 and lasted up to 13 march 2020 autumn winter spring crop as while the second experiment was commenced on 6 april and terminated on 5 august 2020 spring summer crop ss in both experiments one large fruited cultivar of the beefsteak type elpida enza zaden and one small fruited cultivar of the cherry type shiren hazera were used initially the plants were grown on rockwool starter cubes 50 mm 40 mm in a nursery environment 20 24 c during the day and 18 20 c at night and relative humidity 70 80 thereafter at the stage of 3 4 true leaves the seedlings were transferred to the nft installation where the air temperature was maintained between 12 c and 30 c and the relative humidity between 60 and 80 detailed data on the prevailing environmental conditions during the two experimental periods are shown in table 1 each plant was pruned to one stem and trained vertically using a string attached to a horizontal wire at 2 5 m above the planting row the plant density was 2 5 plants per m2 for pollination one small colony of bumblebees bombus terrestris was introduced in the greenhouse at the beginning of flowering stage pest and diseases were controlled according to plant protection guidelines and good agricultural practices for greenhouse horticultural crops fao 2013 2 4 experimental treatments experimental treatments consisted of two varieties of tomato in terms of fruit size beefsteak and cherry types treated with 1 a typical replenishment nutrient solution rns for tomato cultivation in closed soilless systems according to standard recommendations sonneveld and straver 1994 sonneveld and voogt 2009 henceforth abbreviated as hn and 2 a replenishment nutrient solution in which the concentration of nitrates no3 was reduced to 2 3 of the standard recommendations and this decrease was electrochemically compensated for by an equivalent increase of the cl concentration henceforth abbreviated as ln table 2 the chloride fertilizer used to supply cl was calcium chloride cacl2 the two cultivars and the two different nutrient solutions were combined in a 2 2 factorial experiment arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates which resulted in 16 experimental units corresponding to 16 independent hydroponic circuits two external planting rows on each side served as guard plants experimental treatments commenced immediately after transplanting and lasted up to the termination of the crop following the common practice in commercial hydroponics different nutrient solution compositions were used to fill up the tanks before planting and to replenish the nutrient solution absorbed by plants during the vegetative and the reproductive growth stages table 2 2 5 determination of nutrient uptake concentrations a suitable non destructive method to estimate nutrient uptake in closed systems such as nft is based on the changes of the ion concentrations in the recirculating nutrient solution pardossi et al 2004 thus the mean nutrient to water uptake ratios henceforth termed uptake concentrations ucs mmol or μmol l 1 of the selected macronutrients n p k ca and mg and micronutrients fe mn zn cu and cl were determined based on the removal of nutrients from the nutrient solution in combination with the corresponding water consumption by the plants during the same time period particularly the mean uptake concentrations ucx of the x nutrient i e k ca 2 mg 2 no3 nh4 h2po4 mmol l 1 fe2 mn2 zn2 cu2 μmol l 1 and cl mmol l 1 were calculated using the following mass balance equation neocleous and savvas 2015 2016 ucx vs cxin cxf vw cxad vw where v s is the volume of the recycled solution in each hydroponic unit 42 l v w is the cumulative water consumption of plants l for a specific time period c xin and c xf are the initial and final concentration of the x nutrient in the recycled solution respectively in the same time period and cxad denotes the concentration of the x nutrient in the corresponding replenishment nutrient solution for this purpose samples 150 200 ml of the nutrient solution from each experimental unit were periodically collected during the entire cropping season at 0 30 60 90 and 120 days after the beginning of treatments and mean nutrient ucs for each crop were calculated from these data ucs were reanalyzed based on the stage of development i e vegetative veg till 1st fruiting truss fr1 till 5th fruiting truss fr5 and till 10th fruiting truss fr10 twice or three times a week the consumption of the ns in each experimental unit was recorded from the difference in the volume of water contained in the calibrated filling containers while on the same days electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature measurements of the ns were recorded multimeter mm40 crison instruments spain 2 6 leaf nutrient analysis plant leaf analysis was conducted for monitoring the nutrient assimilation processes of the crop to do so most recent fully expanded leaves opposite and below last flower cluster eleven weeks after the commencement of treatments were collected to determine the leaf mineral concentrations the samples were dried at 68 c and finely ground subsequently subsamples of plant material were acid mixture of hno3 and hclo4 digested and appropriately diluted to determine the selected inorganic elements in the filtered extracts according to the methods described by estefan et al 2013 the concentration of organic n in plant leaf tissues was determined by applying the kjeldahl method mills and jones jr 1996 in nutrient solutions and plant tissues the concentrations of calcium ca magnesium mg iron fe manganese mn zinc zn and copper cu were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer solaar m series thermo elemental cambridge

ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv vis lambda 35 perkin elmer waltham ma usa potassium k concentrations were measured using a sherwood model 420 flame photometer sherwood scientific cambridge uk the concentration of cl in nutrient solutions and tissue extracts was determined by titration with silver nitrate agno3 in the presence of potassium chromate k2cro4 eaton 2005 the concentrations of nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 ions in aqueous solutions were determined using the same uv vis spectrophotometer at 220 and 653 nm respectively the concentration of nh4 was then added to that of no3 to calculate the total uptake concentration uc of nitrogen n the nitrogen use efficiency nue was defined as the fruit yield per unit of n supply kg fruit yield kg 1 n supply leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio c n was measured using an elemental analyzer ea3000 eurovector milan italy to better understand carbon in relation to nitrogen metabolism in plants exposed to high external cl concentrations 2 7 plant

cropping season fig 1a however during the spring summer ss season which coincides with appreciably higher levels of light and temperature table 1 these differences were eliminated fig 1b on the other hand nitrate and chloride levels in the ns did not have a significant effect on either water uptake or electrical conductivity ec in the recirculating nutrient solution irrespective of the growing season the ec values in the recirculating nutrient solution ranged between 2 and 4 ds m 1 during as season and 2 6 ds m 1 during ss season averaging 2 8 and 3 8 ds m 1 respectively fig 1c and d these ec values were generally within the recommended levels 3 4 ds m 1 for hydroponic tomato crops sonneveld 2002 sonneveld and voogt 2009 3 2 yield quality and photosynthetic related parameters analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in fruit yield parameters i e marketable and total fruit yield mean fruit weight fresh and dry fruit biomass harvest index between tomato plants treated with standard or decreased no3 n levels in the replenishment nutrient solution irrespective of the growing season table 3 on the contrary genotypic differences were the biggest source of variation accounting for over 80 of total variation in yield parameters p 0 05 consideration of the harvest index in table 3 reveals that the total fruit biomass of the beefsteak cultivar makes up a larger proportion of the total plant biomass than that of the cherry type pointing towards a different distribution mechanism of their photosynthates no significant interactions between nitrate nitrogen levels and cultivars were observed table 3 genetic variability was also the main factor accounting for most of the total variation in fruit quality characteristics table 4 since plants were exposed to similar salinity levels ec values in the root zone solution fig 1c and d cherry type tomatoes consistently exhibited higher antioxidant activity frap and dpph values phenolics total phenolics compounds vitamin c ascorbic acid sugars acids and dry matter content compared with the beefsteak type table 4 however the decreased no3 n supply increased ascorbic acid content in both cultivars and growing seasons table 4 with regard to the fruit nitrate content treatment differences and interactions between no3 n levels and tomato cultivars were insignificant in all cases suggesting a similar response of the cultivars tested to applied nutritional treatments these results clearly show that marketable yield and quality were not negatively affected by partial substitution of nitrate no3 by chloride cl in the nutrient solution ns supplied to tomato beefsteak and cherry types grown in a closed hydroponic system previous research has shown that mineral nutrients can influence the behavior of the stomata or their anatomical structure neocleous et al 2020 indeed in the current study partial substitution of no3 by cl in the ns affected stomatal pore diffusion processes i e co2 entry into

consequently maintaining leaf photosynthetic rates at lower transpiration increased the amount of co2 assimilated per unit of water transpired i e instantaneous water use efficiency wuei table 5 this indicates that carbon metabolism was not negatively affected by lowering the no3 n supply up to the tested levels and crops probably regulated stomatal pore width stomatal movement by the movement of inorganic ions into guard cells e g import of k and cl or changed their anatomic structure to accomplish greater diffusion to co2 finally the observed increase in the leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio

concentrations and nitrogen use efficiency the reduction of the nitrate concentration to 2 3 of the standard recommended levels in the replenishment nutrient solution rns which was electrochemically balanced by an equivalent increase of the cl level decreased and increased respectively total nitrogen and chloride ucs as expected plants supplied with standard no3 supply levels hn exhibited n uc close to 15 0 mmol l 1 while lowering no3 supply to the crops by 33 ln reduced the n uc to about 11 0 mmol l 1 fig 2a in parallel increasing cl concentrations in the rns to 5 mm increased accordingly its uc to similar levels of those applied fig 2j analysis of variance did not detect consistent differences in average ucs between the experimental treatments for the rest of the nutrients studied sfigs 1 and 2 however the results of the current study consistently highlight higher ca and zn ucs and lower mn uc than typical values fig 2d h and g respectively in general estimated ucs were in most cases very close to the values reported in the literature savvas et al 2013 pulling data over experiments mean ucs ranged as follows sfigs 1 and 2 12 1 13 5 nitrogen no3 nh4 1 25 1 35 phosphorus p 6 1

according to the crop species and cropping stage is a prerequisite to optimize plant nutrition in commercial hydroponics because of similarity of the results in most datasets sfigs 1 and 2 ucs data were reanalyzed over treatments and presented for the vegetative and reproductive stages i e 1st 5th and 10th fruiting truss fig 2a j the course of n uc reflected its concentration in the replenishment ns with a tendency to decrease with time from the beginning to the later stages of growth fig 2a a decreasing tendency with time was also observed for the ucs of ca and mg fig 2d and e whereas the temporal changing of p and k uc was relatively small fig 2b and c however the ucs of micronutrients fe mn zn and cu were relatively stable throughout the cropping period fig 2f i the increased cl supply in the ln nutrient solution entailed an average cl concentration in the drainage between 17 and 22 mmol l 1 sfigs 3j and 4j which is considered acceptable in tomato crops sonneveld 2002 however at later stages of growth when crop is considered less sensitive cl ions were accumulated in the recycle solution at much higher levels 23 32 mmol l 1 fig 3j average ion concentrations for the rest of macro and micronutrients in the drainage sfigs 3a i and 4a i ranged as follows 13 7 19 5 no3 nh4 1 0 1 4 p 7 2 7 3 k 8 9 10 2 ca 3 4 4 2 mg mmol l 1 23 1 27 5 fe 6 3 7 3 mn 7 3 7 8 zn and 2 7 3 0 cu μmol l 1 in general nutrients were in most cases very close to the values reported in the literature showing an increasing tendency to accumulate in the recirculating solution at later stages of growth due to the continuous recycling of the nutrient solution fig 3a i lowering the no3 concentration in the rns to 2 3 of the standard recommendations hn for tomato and compensating for by an equivalent increase of the cl concentration by around 5 mm ln consistently decreased the no3 level in the recirculating nutrient solution to one half avg 11 vs 22 mm respectively for ln and hn fig 3a on the other hand ln treated hydroponic tomato plants enhanced n use efficiency nue kg produce kg 1 n supply almost by two fold compared with that recorded at standard n supply hn as the yield performance was not influenced by the differences in no3 n supply table 3 nue is a crop trait of primary importance in sustainable greenhouse horticulture the current study revealed that a partial replacement of no3 supply by cl in closed hydroponic tomato crops enhances n utilization by plants and reduces no3 concentrations in the drainage without compromising yield and quality genotypic differences clearly affected yield performance and subsequently nue as may be expected 3 4 leaf nutrient concentrations tissue analysis showed that a partial substitution of no3 33 decrease by cl in the ns ln slightly but significantly decreased total n content in leaves avg 10 decrease in both crops fig 4a ln also lowered leaf k content fig 4c which however decreased the n k ratio to a level that was closer to that suggested in the literature for tomato 2 1 mol mol according to bar tal et al 1995 in parallel cl supplementation in the ns increased 10 fold increase the leaf cl concentration at much higher levels than those found with low cl supply from 3 5 to 35 mg g 1 dry weight fig 4j on the other hand p content were influenced only by tomato genotype while the differences in no3 and cl supply had no impact on tissue p with cherry tomatoes showing consistently lower tissue p values compared with the beefsteak type 0 65 vs 0 85 dw respectively fig 4b on the contrary lowering the no3 supply in the ns increased the leaf ca and mg levels fig 4d and e as well as those of micronutrients fe mn zn and cu fig 4f i suggesting that cl has no negative impact on their uptake the mean leaf nutrient concentrations coincided more or less with values reported in the literature for optimal growth and at any case they never exceeded the critical deficiency or toxicity thresholds reported in the literature fig 4a i particularly the leaf n p k ca and mg concentrations averaged 35 7 5 47 43 4 5 mg g 1 dry weight while those of fe mn zn and cu averaged 107 114 90 and 17 μg g 1 dry weight respectively in fruit the average tissue concentrations were 24 5 37 2 1 5 mg g 1 dry weight for n p k ca and mg and 110 18 60 and 8 0 μg g 1 dry weight for fe mn zn and cu respectively the leaf cl concentrations in cl fed tomato plants were higher than those reported as toxic in many plant species fig 4j but similar with the levels proposed as beneficial in tomato crops colmenero flores et al 2019 4 discussion the electrical conductivity ec in the recirculating solution was within the optimal range for most of the cropping period averaging 2 8 as crop and 3 8 ss crop ds m 1 however the ec was gradually increasing with time in both experiments reaching values up to 4 as crop and 6 ss crop ds m 1 respectively at later stages of growth when plants are less vulnerable to salinity fig 1c and d the stronger increase of the ec in the recycled solution in ss crop compared to as crop was obviously due to the much higher water consumption by the plants 250 vs 500 mm respectively for as and ss crops table 5 which was driven by higher irradiance and temperature conditions table 1 under these conditions the increase in transpiration rates dominates over that of nutrient uptake which finally entails higher salt residuals in the recycled solution del signore et al 2016 however the increase of cl concentration in the supplied ns to compensate for lower no3 supply ln did not have a substantial impact on the water uptake fig 1a b and table 5 or the ec of the recirculating nutrient solution fig 1c and d this let us assume that tomato root cells preserved the absorption of water and nutrients ameliorating on the short term osmotic effects and on the long term specific ion toxicity and or nutrient imbalances läuchli grattan 2007 particularly a specific effect of cl ions in maintaining xylem upload and flow through the regulation of aquaporin was stated previously nieves cordones et al 2019 and could be applied in our case too in this content there is a notion that when cl is decoupled from external na and the no3 concentration is not too high in the ns the absorption of cl is stimulated colmenero flores et al 2019 in such a case a shift in the occurrence of salt stress in the root environment through a process of gradual accumulation later in the growth cycle may allow tomato plants to adjust their osmotic potential thereby overcoming any adverse osmotic effects to check this hypothesis simulated cl supplied as nacl uptake constants of tomato crops derived from the literature varlagas et al 2010 were adopted to predict cl root zone accumulation in the present study in which cl was supplied as cacl2 the course of cl accumulation was simulated as a relationship of water consumption following mass balance equations described by savvas et al 2005 indeed the model predicted cl concentrations in the root zone were much higher more than two fold higher in the study of varlagas et al 2010 than the values measured in the current study at similar water consumption levels fig 1e this finding points to a higher capacity of tomato to absorb cl in the current study since in closed systems the increase of the cl concentration in the recycled solution directly relates to the difference between the amount entering the system and the amounts absorbed by the crop neocleous and savvas 2015 indeed substantial amounts of cl ions were absorbed by plant roots and translocated to shoots in the present study as indicated by the high leaf cl content which increased at similar levels as those of macronutrients fig 1f however the high cl uptake rates did not cause any toxic cl symptoms in plant tissues or any osmotic effects this agrees with a previous study which showed that the adverse salinity effects on tomatoes exposed to similar nacl concentrations in the recirculating nutrient solution were not associated with cl toxicity savvas et al 2011 other authors schnitzler and gruda 2002 reported even a beneficial effect on tomato fruit quality when cl level in the nutrient solution supplied as cacl2 was relatively high 8 10 mm thus partial substitution of no3 by cl in tomato crops grown in closed soilless production systems provides opportunities for reducing inorganic n inputs without detrimental effects on yield indeed plant growth expressed as fresh and dry weight fruit yield and quality which are the most recognized markers to evaluate competitive nutrient interactions rietra et al 2017 were not suppressed by the applied nutritional treatments which reinforce our findings tables 3 and 4 with regard to yield data treatment differences and interactions between the two experimental factors were insignificant in all cases suggesting a similar agronomic response of the cultivars tested across and within no3 n levels table 3 the good yield performance of both cultivars tested considering the short growing period 120 d accounts for 40 and 25 kg m 2 per year for beefsteak and cherry types respectively with a percentage of over 95 graded as high quality fruits genetic variability was the main factor accounted for the most of total variation in fruit quality characteristics and metabolic composition e g antioxidants as may be expected cherry type tomatoes consistently exhibited higher antioxidant activity frap and dpph values phenolics total phenolics compounds vitamin c ascorbic acid sugars acids and dry matter content compared with beefsteak type table 4 manipulating no3 and cl supply in the ns caused average root ion concentrations of about 35 40 meq l 1 corresponding to an ec value of 4 ds m 1 sonneveld 2002 during fruit maturation stages fig 3a e which does not imply shortages in nutrient supply or salt stress conditions for the crop sonneveld and voogt 2009 these results indicate that there were no limitations in central carbon metabolism biosynthetic precursors beauvoit et al 2018 imposed by nutritional treatments that might be capable of significantly affecting the metabolites concentration in fruit cells eventually meeting high quality standards however it was interesting to observe that nitrate supply limitations at certain levels ln consistently increased ascorbic acid content in hydroponic tomatoes table 4 which indicates that a slight n depletion in such systems could be beneficial for the synthesis of ascorbic acid as suggested by previous relevant studies beauvoit et al 2018 the current study with tomato grown in a closed hydroponic system showed that marketable yield and fruit quality were not negatively affected by partial substitution of nitrates no3 by chloride cl within the range tested thus reducing the no3 concentration to 2 3 of the standard recommended level in the rns supplied to closed hydroponic tomato crops accompanied by an equivalent increase of the cl level can reduce the n fertilizer input with no negative effects on yield and quality maintaining a high yield and produce quality potential despite variation in no3 n supply within a certain range logically implies that photosynthetic processes remained intact and functioning in all n supply regimes within this range rouphael et al 2012 indeed in the current study cl fertilization affected the stomatal pore diffusion processes i e co2 entry into the leaf and release of h2o vapor reducing stomatal conductance gs intercellular co2 ci and transpiration rate tr however these differences did not cause commensurate decreases in the rate of net co2 assimilation pn and photosynthetic electron flow etr table 5 furthermore these changes increased transpiration efficiency i e the amount of co2 assimilated per unit of water transpired i e instantaneous water use efficiency wuei table 5 these results suggest that an increased cl supply affects stomatal function by regulating water retention in plant cells which involves further the contribution of stomatal aperture on this wege et al 2017 additional data on the role of cl as a beneficial macronutrient at high external concentrations decoupled from external na reveals that cl has a beneficial impact on chloroplast performance which entails an increased mesophyll conductance to co2 franco navarro et al 2019 specifically lower co2 levels in the substomatal area ci did not restrict carbon assimilation pn table 5 which let us assume that a larger surface of chloroplast enlargement of leaf cells was in contact with co2 in the mesoplyll cells rosales et al 2020 compensating for decreased stomatal conductance raven 2017 thereby increased rates of co2 diffusion in the mesophyll compensate for stomatal limitations kimura et al 2020 and allow tomato plants to reduce transpiratory water losses without affecting the biochemical capacity to assimilate co2 under cl treatment this consideration involves a role of cl in promoting chloroplast performance by facilitating physiological and morphological adaptations in leaf cells and reinforce the above mentioned findings that cl at certain levels can stabilize yield and quality in closed hydroponic tomato crops under lower nitrate supply data also indicate that a gradual cl accumulation in the recycled solution allows tomato plants to adapt by using cl ions as osmolytes nieves cordones et al 2019 regulating water movement and water retention in plant cells franco navarro et al 2016 eventually proper photosynthetic function facilitates adequate photosynthetic electron flow for nitrate reduction into organic n compounds which stabilize plant metabolic functions such as chlorophyll biosynthesis table 5 raven 2017 another objective of this study was to experimentally determine mean nutrient uptake concentrations ucs nutrient to water uptake ratio for tomato which can be used in mass balanced equations to develop or readjust ns compositions for closed hydroponic tomato crops grown under mediterranean greenhouse conditions savvas et al 2020 this specific need arises from the fact that most ns formulas are specialized for crops grown in temperate climates as those prevailing in northern europe de kreij et al 1999 adams 2002 silber and bar tal 2008 sonneveld and voogt 2009 although in recent years several investigators attempted to develop ns compositions for hydroponic crops in southern europe savvas et al 2013 neocleous and savvas 2017 ropokis et al 2018 in fact accurate replenishment of nutrients consumed by the plants in fully automated closed loop hydroponic systems is still a challenge in modern greenhouse horticulture since online nutrient concentration measurements with specific electrodes is not yet commercially feasible savvas and gruda 2018 furthermore optimal ns composition for a particular crop species depends also on the developmental stage due to the formation of different tissues and organs each with its own mineral composition consequently the determination of nutrient ucs at different plant developmental stages enables adjustment of nutrient injection into the irrigation water at ratios that follow more accurately the changes in uptake ratios thereby optimizing the recycling process in water culture systems such as nft the corresponding mean ucs of the nutritional elements determined in the present study according to the growth stage were as follows fig 2a i vegetative stage 15 0 n 1 4 p 6 4 k 4 1 ca 1 3 mg mmol l 1 14 3 fe 7 8 mn 5 3 zn 0 7 cu μmol

nutrient uptake related to weather conditions i e radiation input indeed crops during ss cropping period showed higher co2 assimilation rates compared to as crops which eventually resulted in higher fruit and biomass production thereby higher nutrient and water demand however a relative constant ratio between the net co2 assimilation which governs nutrient uptake and transpiration which governs water uptake can be calculated from table 5 which points to a similar effect of climatic factors to nutrient and water uptakes by plants this entails to minimal variations in the ucs of nutrients over crops as previously suggested neocleous and savvas 2017 neocleous et al 2020 estimated ucs were in most cases very close to the values reported in the literature savvas et al 2013 however our results consistently highlight higher ca and zn ucs and lower mn uc than typical values fig 2d g and h these differences may originate from the type of cultivars used or the method of cultivation ropokis et al 2018 nevertheless related investigations indicated that increased ca uptake in plants regulates cl transport activity wege et al 2017 and ameliorates the negative effect of salinity associated with the increased ec in the ns neocleous and savvas 2013 this let us suggest that the nss supplied to hydroponic tomato crops cvs elpida and shiren amended with cl ions should contain ca at higher concentrations than standard recommendations in any case nutrient ucs determined in the present study exhibit some stability over time thereby constituting a sound basis for nutrient solution calculation through decision support systems e g nutrisense https nutrisense online savvas et al 2020 furthermore nutrient concentrations in the root zone solution are also provided in the present study fig 3 and sfigs 3 and 4 as it is essential to achieve target nutrient concentrations in the environment around the roots as a result of any adjustments of crop nutrition sonneveld and voogt 2009 finally the decrease of the no3 level in the recirculating solution by 50 when ln nutrient solution was supplied to compensate for plant uptake fig 3a and sfigs 3a and 4a without any detrimental effects on fruit yield suggests that partial substitution of no3 by cl can reduce n fertilizer input in closed hydroponic crops of tomato nitrogen uptake by tomato plants decreased as a result of lower n concentrations in the root environment as a decreased no3 level in the rhizosphere reduces the number of inducible nitrate carriers in the plasma membrane tischner 2000 the key question is whether cl reduces the uptake of no3 by joining common transporters or cl is preferentially stored in plant cells instead of no3 it seems that plants used readily available cl ions for osmotic purposes as mentioned elsewhere if external no3 supply decreases there is evidence that cl is the dominant ion used to maintain charge balance and the preferred osmoticum in plant cell because its transport to the vacuoles requires less energy than no3 franco navarro et al 2016 thus when supplied at millimolar concentrations cytoplasmatic exclusion and vacuolar compartmentalization of cl reduce the need for no3 storage in vacuoles thereby maintaining sufficient no3 availability for reduction into organic n and use in relevant metabolic processes colmenero flores et al 2019 indeed our data demonstrate that the decrease of the net no3 supply to 2 3 of the standard recommendations in closed hydroponic tomato crops accompanied by an equivalent increase of the cl level increases nitrogen use efficiency nue nue is a fundamental crop trait in sustainable greenhouse horticulture and these results suggest that a cl concentration of up to 5 mm in the rns supplied to closed hydroponic tomato crops enhances n utilization by plants while minimizing n losses without compromising yield and quality the two tomato genotypes tested in the current study exhibited differences in nue due to variations in yield performance the beefsteak type cultivar was associated with a higher nue irrespective of the n supply regime due to better yield performance and a higher harvest index table 3 compared to the cherry type cultivar thus it is wise to strive for high yielding cultivars in view of an effective utilization of n sonneveld and voogt 2009 furthermore the leaf cl concentration in plants treated with high cl concentrations was about 35 mg g 1 dry weight fig 4j without any specific toxicity symptoms or any nutrient deficiency due to competitive phenomena particularly cl fed tomato plants regulated leaf cl content within the range defined as beneficial rosales et al 2020 which indicates that cl at the tested levels facilitated a good nutritional status of the crop fig 4a i for optimum growth and eventually increased the carbon to nitrogen c n assimilation ratio table 5 5 conclusions partial substitution of nitrate no3 by chloride cl in nft grown tomato crops provides opportunities for effective recycling of nutrients with less inorganic n inputs while not increasing the salinity in the root zone thereby zeroing the need to discharge the drainage in short medium life cycle crops if the na concentration in the irrigation water is not excessive substantial amounts of cl ions were absorbed and translocated to the leaves of tomato facilitating high leaf cl contents similar to those of macronutrients 35 mg g 1 dry weight without toxicity symptoms nutritional imbalances or osmotic salinity effects plants treated with high cl concentrations in the replenishment nutrient solution 4 4 or 5 mm depending on the cropping stage see table 2 regulated stomatal function for optimal water retention which involves further the contribution of stomatal aperture on this without affecting the biochemical capacity to assimilate co2 this points to a role of cl in promoting chloroplast performance by facilitating physiological and morphological adaptations in mesophyll cells furthermore nutrient uc determined in the present study constitute a sound basis to be used in on line decision support systems to automatically calculate and readjust ns formulations in mediterranean hydroponic tomato crops however nss supplied to hydroponic tomato crops cvs elpida and shiren amended with cl ions should contain ca2 at higher concentrations than standard recommendations these results clearly showed that reducing the no3 concentration to 2 3 of standard recommendations in the fresh nutrient solution applied to compensate for nutrient uptake in closed hydroponic tomato crops reduces nitrate fertilizer input by more than 30 without any specific negative effects on yield and quality in open systems in which the drainage solution is discharged the partial substitution of no3 by cl lessens the leaching losses of nitrate by 50 which entails higher n use efficiency and less pollution of aquifers by nitrates funding this work was supported by

hydroponic tomato crops enhances n use by two fold and eliminates no3 losses to one half with no significant effects on assimilation processes and fruit biomass production suggesting that cl at

nutrient element that plants need in high quantities as it is a structural component of many cell metabolites including proteins chlorophylls amino acids nucleic acids alkaloids and hormones taiz and zeiger 2002 consequently a deficiency of n has a dramatic influence on crop yields in agricultural systems and this enforces farmers to apply worldwide over 100 million metric tons of n fertilizer per year to ensure that crops receive adequate n faostat 2018 however excessive or timely inefficient use of n fertilizers by many farmers results in different forms of nitrogen pollution including contamination of water resources by nitrates and gaseous emissions of nitrogen pollutants n2o no nh3 therefore sutton et al 2013 characterize n a key element in the united nations environment program anon 2019 thus a reduction in n supply without compromising yield and quality which increases nitrogen use efficiency i e plant yield per unit of applied n is a prerequisite for sustainability in modern agricultural systems eunep 2015 modern greenhouse installations occupy a significant part of agricultural land in mediterranean countries summing over 200 000 ha with soilless culture being increasingly used in these as a means to optimize root growth conditions and minimize infestation by soil borne pests and diseases gallardo et al 2013 savvas and neocleous 2019 nikolaou et al 2020 greenhouse cultivation relies on high addition of fertilizers to render high yields sonneveld and voogt 2009 leonardi and maggio 2013 however excess or timely inefficient n application in greenhouses results in high nitrate no3 concentrations in the fertigation effluents leaching to surface and ground water n gas emissions daum and schenk 1998 and high no3 levels in edible plant parts of leafy vegetables which entail health related risks gruda et al 2018 in cases that frequent discharge of fertigation effluents from these greenhouses is inevitable katsoulas et al 2015 substantial no3 n losses up to 380 kg ha 1 y 1 have been reported savvas and gruda 2018 in the past few years in northern european greenhouses annual n losses from open soilless systems 30 50 leachates approached 1000 kg ha 1 gianquinto et al 2013 to cope with nitrate related problems the european union eu has adopted the nitrates directive 91 676 eec which was complemented with the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and other regulations such as 1258 2011 for maximum levels of nitrates in certain vegetables and foodstuffs however recently it has been recognized that implementation actions such as accurate nutrient management need to be more efficiently adapted to different regional hotspots anon 2018 therefore the reduction of n supply in intensive production systems in mediterranean greenhouses without affecting yield and quality is of primary importance for the transition to a more circular economy characterized by less waste of nitrogen and improved nitrogen use efficiency nue at farm level eunep 2015 the switching to closed hydroponic systems chs offers excellent opportunities to meet these aims i e save and grow by recycling nutrients and water thereby reducing leaching of chemicals including nitrates and phosphates and saving precious water savvas and neocleous 2019 the collection and reuse of the excess nutrient solution ns that drains out of the roots in closed hydroponic systems chs is termed nutrient solution recycling and provides 40 50 savings in total supply of fertilizers varlagas et al 2010 furthermore chs combined with modern greenhouse technology offer great opportunities towards sustainable crop production that can contribute to mitigation of the global climate change in mediterranean greenhouses savvas 2002 medecc 2020 and promote new dietary societal demands sambo et al 2019 in chs the surplus nutrient solution that drains out of the root zone is replenished with nutrients and water prior to recycling the net supply of nutrients via concentrated stock solutions in chs is based on the concept of the expected nutrient uptake concentrations i e mass of nutrient per water volume absorbed sonneveld and voogt 2009 thus determining mean nutrient ucs for a crop species is the first step for both establishing a reference nutrient solution for chs and calculating target nutrient concentrations in the drip solution for open and closed soilless culture systems savvas and gruda 2018 however changes in the stage of crop development e g fruit setting or in environmental conditions e g light conditions root zone salinity require frequent adjustment of the nutrient injection rates to maintain target nutrient concentrations in the root zone benton jones 1997 adams 2002 neocleous and savvas 2016 an additional reason for frequent adjustment of the nutrient injection rates in chs is the composition of the reused drainage solution which is not constant but variable over time therefore nutrient recycling relies much more on scientific knowledge and skillful management of nutrition than the supply of a standard nutrient solution in open soilless systems and this is one of the main reasons that discourages growers in mediterranean greenhouses to switch to chs furthermore the uptake concentrations can be used through on line operating decision support systems such as nutrisense https nutrisense online which was developed by savvas et al 2020 to automatically calculate and readjust nutrient solutions for open and closed hydroponic cultivations in response to the growth stage and the prevailing environmental conditions the current n recommendation for open soilless greenhouse tomato production amounts to 16 mmol l 1 sonneveld and voogt 2009 because the nitrate ion no3 is needed to maintain charge balance with k ca2 and mg2 in the nutrient solution on the other hand the element chlorine found in the nutrient solution and plants as the chloride ion cl has been traditionally considered a harmful anion this is because cl which is abundant in soils and water and accumulates at excessive concentrations in the root zone is usually accompanied by sodium na furthermore many scientists only point to an antagonistic relationship between no3 and cl grattan and grieve 1998 cl as an essential micronutrient is required in the chloroplasts where it is involved in the oxidation of water in photosystem ii and might regulate the activity of some enzymes implicated in cell division although it is considered a trace element most plants generally absorb chlorine at levels much higher than those required for the essential micronutrient functions 0 1 0 2 mg g 1 dry weight wege et al 2017 reaching similar concentrations in plant tissues with those of macronutrients 2 20 mg g 1 dry weight colmenero flores et al 2019 thus new biological functions have been recently attributed to cl such as the regulation of cell osmosis electrical charge balance and enhanced co2 water and nitrogen use efficiency which are not essential but beneficial to plants raven 2017 chloride might function as the counter ion during rapid k fluxes contributing to maintenance of turgor in guard cells to maintain bulk electrical neutrality anions such as cl or no3 are transported from the cytoplasm into the vacuole through common transporters in the membrane wege et al 2017 most of cl absorbed by plants is located in the vacuole and cytosol as free anion contributing to cell osmoregulation similarly to no3 papadopoulos and hao 2002 thus the similar osmoregulation functions of these two ions may be the eliciting factor of competition in uptake between them on the other hand these similarities provide opportunities to reduce vacuolar nitrate accumulation while increasing nitrate availability for plant assimilation processes by substituting part of no3 with cl supply gianquinto et al 2013 colmenero flores et al 2019 these findings raise the question as to whether synchronic application of cl and no3 in closed hydroponic tomato crops up to certain levels is not antagonistic but synergistic providing substantial benefits to growers and the environment without detrimental effects on yield and quality franco navarro et al 2019 tomato large and small fruited tomato types is the most widely cultivated horticultural crop in greenhouses and occupies a dominant position in the modern human diet world vegetable center 2017 because of fruit sensorial e g sugars and acids and health properties e g vitamin c lycopene antioxidative potential in addition a shift to cultivating alternative types of tomatoes with a better taste appealing appearance more lycopene and vitamins a longer post harvest life etc increased global harvested area and production yield up to 40 in the last two decades faostat 2018 tomato is a crop characterized by high input of nutrients due to extensive vegetative biomass production a heavy fruit load and a long cultivation period chapagain and wiesman 2004 at the same time tomato has the lowest sensitivity to salinity high cl tolerance of all fruitιng vegetables grown in greenhouses thus in hydroponics a controlled increase of the total salt concentration in the supplied nutrient solution up to a certain level provides opportunities for managing fruit quality attributes such as their content in dry matter organic acid sugars vitamin c carotenoids and other bioactive compounds magán et al 2008 gruda et al 2018 also fruit physiological disorders in tomato crops such as blossom end rot white flecks and green spots were reduced by adding calcium chloride in the supplied nutrient solution aiming to maintain the cl concentration in the root zone to levels ranging from 8 to 10 mm schnitzler and gruda 2002 gruda 2009 when adequate nutrient concentrations are maintained an average accumulation of nacl in the root zone up to 22 mm has been considered acceptable in tomato crops sonneveld 2002 previous research has also shown that the exposure of fruiting vegetables to salinity in the recycled solution through a process of gradual salt accumulation is less detrimental than an abrupt increase of total salt concentration in the root zone savvas et al 2005 bar yosef 2008 thus shifting the occurrence of salt stress through a process of gradual accumulation to a later stage during the growth cycle i e at commencement of fruit setting may allow tomato plants to adjust their osmotic potential and deploy physiological mechanisms as a functional strategy that mitigates any adverse salinity effects neocleous et al 2017 in this context sonneveld and straver 1994 recommend the addition of extra major nutrients no3 n k and ca2 in the nutrient solution to increase total ionic concentration electrical conductivity ec aiming to increase fruit quality schnitzler and gruda 2002 adams 2002 with minimal or even no yield losses thus in some cases ec values up to 8 ds m 1 in the root zone of tomato may be employed sonneveld 2002 although the standard recommendation is 4 ds m 1 sonneveld and voogt 2009 however high supply levels of no3 n in practice increase no3 leaching as mentioned elsewhere and may induce physiological disorders susceptibility to fungal pathogens while in the fruiting stage can favor vegetative development and negatively affect product quality gianquinto et al 2013 to reduce n supply without reducing the target ec in the root zone and therefore without reducing the supply levels of cations k ca2 and mg2 part of the no3 supply might be replaced by another anion an increase of the h2po4 hpo4 2 supply is not recommended as high p levels in the external solution may result in p toxicity induce gold speck in tomato fruits and cause zn deficiency sonneveld 2002 the common practice to electrochemically balance increased cation concentrations is to use so4 2 as a moderate increase of this anion in the root zone beyond the standard levels does not cause direct ion toxicities sonneveld 2002 however a huge increase of so4 2 supply may result in its accumulation to levels that may interfere with the uptake of other nutrients forming precipitates or ion pairs lopez baltazar et al 2007 thus to electrochemically balance a further decrease of the no3 n supply to levels below the current recommendations without reducing the cation uptake cl may be the preferable option in support of this notion when the level of cl is not associated with that of na in the external solution and the no3 concentration is not high the uptake of cl by plants increases substantially colmenero flores et al 2019 considering this background an experiment with tomato was conducted in which a standard no3 n concentration in the supplied nutrient solution according to dutch recommendations sonneveld and straver 1994 was compared with a nutrient solution containing 33 less nitrates which were substituted by chlorides the chloride concentration in the supplied nutrient solution followed the levels considered beneficial for several species including tomato i e 5 mm as reported in previous works colmenero flores et al 2019 franco navarro et al 2019 physiological and agronomical responses were evaluated with the aim to study the underlying mechanisms of crop response and to quantify this recommendation in hydroponics 2 material and methods 2 1 cropping system two distinct experiments were carried out at the experimental farm of the cyprus agricultural research institute latitude 34 44 n longitude 33 19 e altitude 35 m above sea level in a plastic multi span greenhouse with maximum height 5 m gutter height 3 m under natural light conditions the greenhouse was north south oriented and the cover material consisted of transparent polyethylene sheets anti drip resistant to uv radiation 88 light transmission the greenhouse was equipped with an automated climate control system heating ventilation and cooling premises and a hydroponic installation constructed according to the principles of nft nutrient film technique twenty hydroponic nft channels 6 m long 0 25 m wide 0 1 m deep fully covered by black white polyethylene sheets were aligned with 20 catchment 42 l and 20 replenishment tanks 110 l to form 20 independent hydroponic units the nutrient solution absorbed by the plants was replenished through automatic flow of the feeding solution from the replenishment tank into the catchment tank to achieve a certain volume of recirculating nutrient solution 3 l plant 1 each hydroponic unit accommodated 14 plants giving a final plant density of 2 5 plants m 2 according to this cropping method the roots of the plants were grown in a shallow stream of a continuously recirculating nutrient solution with a flow rate of about 0 2 m3 h 1 a multi crops per year production strategy was applied instead of one crop per year 2 2 nutrient solution recycling in a closed hydroponic system with continuous nutrient solution recirculation full reuse of the drainage solution the only removal of nutrients and water from the root environment is due to plant uptake thus the technique was based on a programmed addition of nutrients in particular the amounts of water and nutrients introduced into the system were equal to the expected mean uptake concentrations ucs as suggested by sonneveld and voogt 2009 with the exception of no3 n which in one treatment was reduced to 2 3 of the standard recommendations the principle is that although the uptake of nutrients and water are independent processes driven by photosynthesis and transpiration respectively the ratio between nutrient and water uptake is relatively constant when the climatic parameters are maintained within a standard range because leaf stomata pores facilitate both processes thus this ratio can be used as a basis for the addition of fertilizers in the irrigation water sonneveld 2002 thus the fertigation head prepared a nutrient solution for closed systems with nutrient concentrations equal to the anticipated nutrient ucs savvas et al 2013 which was stored in the replenishment tanks from the replenishment tanks the replenishment solution was introduced into the catchment tanks using appropriate equipment with the aim of replenishing nutrients and water at equal ratios with those absorbed by the plants during each particular growth stage thus blending the replenishment solution with the drained solution and adjusting the ph at 5 6 addition of hno3 and rarely khco3 resulted in the preparation of the outgoing irrigation solution that was constantly supplied to the crop using a pump 2 3 plant material growing conditions two experiments were conducted in an nft system using large and small fruited tomato solanum lycopersicum l cultivars the first experiment was set up on 13 november 2019 and lasted up to 13 march 2020 autumn winter spring crop as while the second experiment was commenced on 6 april and terminated on 5 august 2020 spring summer crop ss in both experiments one large fruited cultivar of the beefsteak type elpida enza zaden and one small fruited cultivar of the cherry type shiren hazera were used initially the plants were grown on rockwool starter cubes 50 mm 40 mm in a nursery environment 20 24 c during the day and 18 20 c at night and relative humidity 70 80 thereafter at the stage of 3 4 true leaves the seedlings were transferred to the nft installation where the air temperature was maintained between 12 c and 30 c and the relative humidity between 60 and 80 detailed data on the prevailing environmental conditions

according to plant protection guidelines and good agricultural practices for greenhouse horticultural crops fao 2013 2 4 experimental treatments experimental treatments consisted of two varieties of tomato in terms of fruit size beefsteak and cherry types treated with 1 a typical replenishment nutrient solution rns for tomato cultivation in closed soilless systems according to standard recommendations sonneveld and straver 1994 sonneveld and voogt 2009 henceforth abbreviated as hn and 2 a replenishment nutrient solution in which the concentration of nitrates no3 was reduced to 2 3 of the standard recommendations and this decrease was electrochemically compensated for by an equivalent increase of the cl concentration henceforth abbreviated as ln table 2 the chloride fertilizer used to supply cl was calcium chloride cacl2 the two cultivars and the two different nutrient solutions were combined in a 2 2 factorial experiment arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates which resulted in 16 experimental units corresponding to 16 independent hydroponic circuits two external planting rows on each side served as guard plants experimental treatments commenced immediately after transplanting and lasted up to the termination of the crop following the common practice in commercial hydroponics different nutrient solution compositions were used to fill up the tanks before planting and to replenish the nutrient solution absorbed by plants during the vegetative and the reproductive growth stages table 2 2 5 determination of nutrient uptake

subsequently subsamples of plant material were acid mixture of hno3 and hclo4 digested and appropriately diluted to determine the selected inorganic elements in the filtered extracts according to the methods described by estefan et al 2013 the concentration of organic n in plant leaf tissues was determined by applying the kjeldahl method mills and jones jr 1996 in nutrient solutions and plant

ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv vis lambda 35 perkin elmer waltham ma usa potassium k concentrations were measured using a sherwood model 420 flame photometer sherwood scientific cambridge uk the concentration of cl in nutrient solutions and tissue extracts was determined by titration with silver nitrate agno3 in the presence of potassium chromate k2cro4 eaton 2005 the concentrations of nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 ions in aqueous solutions were determined using the same uv vis spectrophotometer at 220 and 653 nm respectively the concentration of nh4 was then added to that of no3 to

software san diego california usa 3 results 3 1 evolution of water uptake and root zone ec the beefsteak tomato cultivar consumed about 15 more water than the cherry during the autumn winter spring as cropping season fig 1a however during the spring summer ss season which coincides with appreciably higher levels of light and temperature table 1 these differences were eliminated fig 1b on the other hand nitrate and chloride levels in the ns did not have a significant effect on either water uptake or electrical conductivity ec in the recirculating nutrient solution irrespective of the growing season the ec values in the recirculating nutrient solution ranged between 2 and 4 ds m 1 during as season and 2 6 ds m 1 during ss season averaging 2 8 and 3 8 ds m 1 respectively fig 1c and d these ec values were generally within the recommended levels 3 4 ds m 1 for hydroponic tomato crops sonneveld 2002 sonneveld and voogt 2009 3 2 yield quality and photosynthetic related parameters analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in fruit yield parameters i e marketable and total fruit yield mean fruit weight fresh and dry fruit biomass harvest index between tomato plants treated with standard or decreased no3 n levels in the replenishment nutrient solution irrespective of the growing season table 3 on the contrary genotypic differences were the biggest source of variation accounting for over 80 of total variation in yield parameters p 0 05 consideration of the harvest index in table 3 reveals that the total fruit biomass of the beefsteak cultivar makes up a larger proportion of the total plant biomass than that of the cherry type pointing towards a different distribution mechanism of their photosynthates no significant interactions between nitrate nitrogen levels and cultivars were observed table 3 genetic variability was also the main factor accounting for most of the total variation in fruit quality characteristics table 4 since plants were exposed to similar salinity levels ec values in the root zone solution fig 1c and d cherry type tomatoes consistently exhibited higher antioxidant activity frap and dpph values phenolics total phenolics compounds vitamin c ascorbic acid sugars acids and dry matter content compared with the beefsteak type table 4 however the decreased no3 n supply increased ascorbic acid content in both cultivars and growing seasons table 4 with regard to the fruit nitrate content treatment differences and interactions between no3 n levels and tomato cultivars were insignificant in all cases suggesting a similar response of the cultivars tested to applied nutritional treatments these results clearly show that marketable yield and quality were not negatively affected by partial substitution of nitrate no3 by chloride cl in the nutrient solution ns supplied to tomato beefsteak and cherry types grown in a closed hydroponic system previous research has shown that mineral nutrients can influence the behavior of the stomata or their anatomical structure neocleous et al 2020 indeed in the current study partial substitution of no3 by cl in the ns affected stomatal pore diffusion processes i e co2 entry into the leaf and release of h2o vapor reducing stomatal conductance gs intercellular co2 ci and transpiration rate tr however these differences did not impose commensurate decreases in the net assimilation rate of co2 pn quantum yield of photosynthesis electron transport flow of photosystem ii mass carbon to mass nitrogen ratio c n and cumulative water consumption by plants cwc table 5 consequently maintaining leaf photosynthetic rates at lower transpiration increased the amount of co2 assimilated per unit of water transpired i e instantaneous water use efficiency wuei table 5 this indicates that carbon metabolism was not negatively affected by lowering the no3 n supply up to the tested levels and crops probably regulated stomatal pore width stomatal movement by the movement of inorganic ions into guard cells e g import of k and cl or changed their anatomic structure to accomplish greater diffusion to co2 finally the observed increase in the leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio suggests a role of the partial substitution of nitrate by chloride in favor of carbon e g sugars over nitrogen e g amino acids containing compounds higher c n ratio table 5 3 3 nutrient uptake concentrations and nitrogen use efficiency the reduction of the nitrate concentration to 2 3 of the standard recommended levels in the replenishment nutrient solution rns which was electrochemically balanced by an equivalent increase of the cl level decreased and increased respectively total nitrogen and chloride ucs as expected plants supplied with standard no3 supply levels hn exhibited n uc close to 15 0 mmol l 1 while lowering no3 supply to the crops by 33 ln reduced the n uc to about 11 0 mmol l 1 fig 2a in parallel increasing cl concentrations in the rns to 5 mm increased accordingly its uc to similar levels of those applied fig 2j analysis of variance did not detect consistent differences in average ucs between the experimental treatments for the rest of the nutrients studied sfigs 1 and 2 however the results of the current study consistently highlight higher ca and zn ucs and lower mn uc than typical values fig 2d h and g respectively in general estimated ucs were in most cases very close to the values reported in the literature savvas et al 2013 pulling data over experiments mean ucs ranged as follows sfigs 1 and 2 12 1 13 5 nitrogen no3 nh4 1 25 1 35 phosphorus p 6 1 6 3 potassium k 3 6 4 0 calcium ca 1 0 1 3 magnesium mg mmol l 1 13 0 14 3 iron fe 7 6 8 4 manganese mn 5 1 5 2 zinc zn and 0 7 0 9 copper cu μmol l 1 fine tuning of the nutrient solution composition according to the crop species and cropping stage is a prerequisite to optimize plant nutrition in commercial hydroponics because of similarity of the results in most datasets sfigs 1 and 2 ucs data were reanalyzed over treatments and presented for the vegetative and reproductive stages i e 1st 5th and 10th fruiting truss fig 2a j the course of n uc reflected its concentration in the replenishment ns with a tendency to decrease with time from the beginning to the later stages of growth fig 2a a decreasing tendency with time was also observed for the ucs of ca and mg fig 2d and e whereas the temporal changing of p and k uc was relatively small fig 2b and c however the ucs of micronutrients fe mn zn and cu were relatively stable throughout the cropping period fig 2f i the increased cl supply in the ln nutrient solution entailed an average cl concentration in the drainage between 17 and 22 mmol l 1 sfigs 3j and 4j which is considered acceptable in tomato crops sonneveld 2002 however at later stages of growth when crop is considered less sensitive cl ions were accumulated in the recycle solution at much higher levels 23 32 mmol l 1 fig 3j average ion concentrations for the rest of macro and micronutrients in the drainage sfigs 3a i and 4a i ranged as follows 13 7 19 5 no3 nh4 1 0 1 4 p 7 2 7 3 k 8 9 10 2 ca 3 4 4 2 mg mmol l 1 23 1 27 5 fe 6 3 7 3 mn 7 3 7 8 zn and 2 7 3 0 cu μmol l 1 in general nutrients were in most cases very close to the values reported in the literature showing an increasing tendency to accumulate in the recirculating solution at later stages of growth due to the continuous recycling of the nutrient solution fig 3a i lowering the no3 concentration in the rns to 2 3 of the standard recommendations hn for tomato and compensating for by an equivalent increase of the cl concentration by around 5 mm ln consistently decreased the no3 level in the recirculating nutrient solution to one half avg 11 vs 22 mm respectively for ln and hn fig 3a on the other hand ln treated hydroponic tomato plants enhanced n use efficiency nue kg produce kg 1 n supply almost by two fold compared with that recorded at standard n supply hn as the yield performance was not influenced by the differences in no3 n supply table 3 nue is a crop trait of primary importance in sustainable greenhouse horticulture the current study revealed that a partial replacement of no3 supply by cl in closed hydroponic tomato crops enhances n utilization by plants and reduces no3 concentrations in the drainage without compromising yield and quality genotypic differences clearly affected yield performance and subsequently nue as may be expected 3 4 leaf nutrient concentrations tissue analysis showed that a partial substitution of no3 33 decrease by cl in the ns ln slightly but significantly decreased total n content in leaves avg 10 decrease in both crops fig 4a ln also lowered leaf k content fig 4c which however decreased the n k ratio to a level that was closer to that suggested in the literature for tomato 2 1 mol mol according to bar tal et al 1995 in parallel cl supplementation in the ns increased 10 fold increase the leaf cl concentration at much higher levels than those found with low cl supply from 3 5 to 35 mg g 1 dry weight fig 4j on the other hand p content were influenced only by tomato genotype while the differences in no3 and cl supply had no impact on tissue p with cherry tomatoes showing consistently lower tissue p values compared with the beefsteak type 0 65 vs 0 85 dw respectively fig 4b on the contrary lowering the no3 supply in the ns increased the leaf ca and mg levels fig 4d and e as well as those of micronutrients fe mn zn and cu fig 4f i suggesting that cl has no negative impact on their uptake the mean leaf nutrient concentrations coincided more or less with values reported in the literature for optimal growth and at any case they never exceeded the critical deficiency or toxicity thresholds reported in the literature fig 4a i particularly the leaf n p k ca and mg concentrations averaged 35 7 5 47 43 4 5 mg g 1 dry weight while those of fe mn zn and cu averaged 107 114 90 and 17 μg g 1 dry weight respectively in fruit the average tissue concentrations were 24 5 37 2 1 5 mg g 1 dry weight for n p k ca and mg and 110 18 60 and 8 0 μg g 1 dry weight for fe mn zn and cu respectively the leaf cl concentrations in cl fed tomato plants were higher than those reported as toxic in many plant species fig 4j but similar with the levels proposed as beneficial in tomato crops colmenero flores et al 2019 4 discussion the electrical conductivity ec in the recirculating solution was within the optimal range for most of the cropping period averaging 2 8 as crop and 3 8 ss crop ds m 1 however the ec was gradually increasing with time in both experiments reaching values up to 4 as crop and 6 ss crop ds m 1 respectively at later stages of growth when plants are less vulnerable to salinity fig 1c and d the stronger increase of the ec in the recycled solution in ss crop compared to as crop was obviously due to the much higher water consumption by the plants 250 vs 500 mm respectively for as and ss crops table 5 which was driven by higher irradiance and temperature conditions table 1 under these conditions the increase in transpiration rates dominates over that of nutrient uptake which finally entails higher salt residuals in the recycled solution del signore et al 2016 however the increase of cl concentration in the supplied ns to compensate for lower no3 supply ln did not have a substantial impact on the water uptake fig 1a b and table 5 or the ec of the recirculating nutrient solution fig 1c and d this let us assume that tomato root cells preserved the absorption of water and nutrients ameliorating on the short term osmotic effects and on the long term specific ion toxicity and or nutrient imbalances läuchli grattan 2007 particularly a specific effect of cl ions in maintaining xylem upload and flow through the regulation of aquaporin was stated previously nieves cordones et al 2019 and could be applied in our case too in this content there is a notion that when cl is decoupled from external na and the no3 concentration is not too high in the ns the absorption of cl is stimulated colmenero flores et al 2019 in such a case a shift in the occurrence of salt stress in the root environment through a process of gradual accumulation later in the growth cycle may allow tomato plants to adjust their osmotic potential thereby overcoming any adverse osmotic effects to check this hypothesis simulated cl supplied as nacl uptake constants of tomato crops derived from the literature varlagas et al 2010 were adopted to predict cl root zone accumulation in the present study in which cl was supplied as cacl2 the course of cl accumulation was simulated as a relationship of water consumption following mass balance equations described by savvas et al 2005 indeed the model predicted cl concentrations in the root zone were much higher more than two fold higher in the study of varlagas et al 2010 than the values measured in the current study at similar water consumption levels fig 1e this finding points to a higher capacity of tomato to absorb cl in the current study since in closed systems the increase of the cl concentration in the recycled solution directly relates to the difference between the amount entering the system and the amounts absorbed by the crop neocleous and savvas 2015 indeed substantial amounts of cl ions were absorbed by plant roots and translocated to shoots in the present study as indicated by the high leaf cl content which increased at similar levels as those of macronutrients fig 1f however the high cl uptake rates did not cause any toxic cl symptoms in plant tissues or any osmotic effects this agrees with a previous study which showed that the adverse salinity effects on tomatoes exposed to similar nacl concentrations in the recirculating nutrient solution were not associated with cl toxicity savvas et al 2011 other authors schnitzler and gruda 2002 reported even a beneficial effect on tomato fruit quality when cl level in the nutrient solution supplied as cacl2 was relatively high 8 10 mm thus partial substitution of no3 by cl in tomato crops grown in closed soilless production systems provides opportunities for reducing inorganic n inputs without detrimental effects on yield indeed plant growth expressed as fresh and dry weight fruit yield and quality which are the most recognized markers to evaluate competitive nutrient interactions rietra et al 2017 were not suppressed by the applied nutritional treatments which reinforce our findings tables 3 and 4 with regard to yield data treatment differences and interactions between the two experimental factors were insignificant in all cases suggesting a similar agronomic response of the cultivars tested across and within no3 n levels table 3 the good yield performance of both cultivars tested considering the short growing period 120 d accounts for 40 and 25 kg m 2 per year for beefsteak and cherry types respectively with a percentage of over 95 graded as high quality fruits genetic variability was the main factor accounted for the most of total variation in fruit quality characteristics and metabolic composition e g antioxidants as may be expected cherry type tomatoes consistently exhibited higher antioxidant activity frap and dpph values phenolics total phenolics compounds vitamin c ascorbic acid sugars acids and dry matter content compared with beefsteak type table 4 manipulating no3 and cl supply in the ns caused average root ion concentrations of about 35 40 meq l 1 corresponding to an ec value of 4 ds m 1 sonneveld 2002 during fruit maturation stages fig 3a e which does not imply shortages in nutrient supply or salt stress conditions for the crop sonneveld and voogt 2009 these results indicate that there were no limitations in central carbon metabolism biosynthetic precursors beauvoit et al 2018 imposed by nutritional treatments that might be capable of significantly affecting the metabolites concentration in fruit cells eventually meeting high quality standards however it was interesting to observe that nitrate supply limitations at certain levels ln consistently increased ascorbic acid content in hydroponic tomatoes table 4 which indicates that a slight n depletion in such systems could be beneficial for the synthesis of ascorbic acid as suggested by previous relevant studies beauvoit et al 2018 the current study with tomato grown in a closed hydroponic system showed that marketable yield and fruit quality were not negatively affected by partial substitution of nitrates no3 by chloride cl within the range tested thus reducing the no3 concentration to 2 3 of the standard recommended level in the rns supplied to closed hydroponic tomato crops accompanied by an equivalent increase of the cl level can reduce the n fertilizer input with no negative effects on yield and quality maintaining a high yield and produce quality potential despite variation in no3 n supply within a certain range logically implies that photosynthetic processes remained intact and functioning in all n supply regimes within this range rouphael et al 2012 indeed in the current study cl fertilization affected the stomatal pore diffusion processes i e co2 entry into the leaf and release of h2o vapor reducing stomatal conductance gs intercellular co2 ci and transpiration rate tr however these differences did not cause commensurate decreases in the rate of net co2 assimilation pn and photosynthetic electron flow etr table 5 furthermore these changes increased transpiration efficiency i e the amount of co2 assimilated per unit of water transpired i e instantaneous water use efficiency wuei table 5 these results suggest that an increased cl supply affects stomatal function by regulating water retention in plant cells which involves further the contribution of stomatal aperture on this wege et al 2017 additional data on the role of cl as a beneficial macronutrient at high external concentrations decoupled from external na reveals that cl has a beneficial impact on chloroplast performance which entails an increased mesophyll conductance to co2 franco navarro et al 2019 specifically lower co2 levels in the substomatal area ci did not restrict carbon assimilation pn table 5 which let us assume that a larger surface of chloroplast enlargement of leaf cells was in contact with co2 in the mesoplyll cells rosales et al 2020 compensating for decreased stomatal conductance raven 2017 thereby increased rates of co2 diffusion in the mesophyll compensate for stomatal limitations kimura et al 2020 and allow tomato plants to reduce transpiratory water losses without affecting the biochemical capacity to assimilate co2 under cl treatment this consideration involves a role of cl in promoting chloroplast performance by facilitating physiological and morphological adaptations in leaf cells and reinforce the above mentioned findings that cl at certain levels can stabilize yield and quality in closed hydroponic tomato crops under lower nitrate supply data also indicate that a gradual cl accumulation in the recycled solution allows tomato plants to adapt by using cl ions as osmolytes nieves cordones et al 2019 regulating water movement and water retention in plant cells franco navarro et al 2016 eventually proper photosynthetic function facilitates adequate photosynthetic electron flow for nitrate reduction into organic n compounds which stabilize plant metabolic functions such as chlorophyll biosynthesis table 5 raven 2017 another objective of this study was to experimentally determine mean nutrient uptake concentrations ucs nutrient to water uptake ratio for tomato which can be used in mass balanced equations to develop or readjust ns compositions for closed hydroponic tomato crops grown under mediterranean greenhouse conditions savvas et al 2020 this specific need arises from the fact that most ns formulas are specialized for crops grown in temperate climates as those prevailing in northern europe de kreij et al 1999 adams 2002 silber and bar tal 2008 sonneveld and voogt 2009 although in recent years several investigators attempted to develop ns compositions for hydroponic crops in southern europe savvas et al 2013 neocleous and savvas 2017 ropokis et al 2018 in fact accurate replenishment of nutrients consumed by the plants in fully automated closed loop hydroponic systems is still a challenge in modern greenhouse horticulture since online nutrient concentration measurements with specific electrodes is not yet commercially feasible savvas and gruda 2018 furthermore optimal ns composition for a particular crop species depends also on the developmental stage due to the formation of different tissues and organs each with its own mineral composition consequently the determination of nutrient ucs at different plant developmental stages enables adjustment of nutrient injection into the irrigation water at ratios that follow more accurately the changes in uptake ratios thereby optimizing the recycling process in water culture systems such as nft the corresponding mean ucs of the nutritional elements determined in the present study according to the growth stage were as follows fig 2a i vegetative stage 15 0 n 1 4 p 6 4 k 4 1 ca 1 3 mg mmol l 1 14 3 fe 7 8 mn 5 3 zn 0 7 cu μmol

nutrient uptake related to weather conditions i e radiation input indeed crops during ss cropping period showed higher co2 assimilation rates compared to as crops which eventually resulted in higher fruit and biomass production thereby higher nutrient and water demand however a relative constant ratio between the net co2 assimilation which governs nutrient uptake and transpiration which governs water uptake can be calculated from table 5 which points to a similar effect of climatic factors to nutrient and water uptakes by plants this entails to minimal variations in the ucs of nutrients over crops as previously suggested neocleous and savvas 2017 neocleous et al 2020 estimated ucs were in most cases very close to the values reported in the literature savvas et al 2013 however our results consistently highlight higher ca and zn ucs and lower mn uc than typical values fig 2d g and h these differences may originate from the type of cultivars used or the method of cultivation ropokis et al 2018 nevertheless related investigations indicated that increased ca uptake in plants regulates cl transport activity wege et al 2017 and ameliorates the negative effect of salinity associated with the increased ec in the ns neocleous and savvas 2013 this let us suggest that the nss supplied to hydroponic tomato crops cvs elpida and shiren amended with cl ions should contain ca at higher concentrations than standard recommendations in any case nutrient ucs determined in the present study exhibit some stability over time thereby constituting a sound basis for nutrient solution calculation through decision support systems e g nutrisense https nutrisense online savvas et al 2020 furthermore nutrient concentrations in the root zone solution are also provided in the present study fig 3 and sfigs 3 and 4 as it is essential to achieve target nutrient concentrations in the environment around the roots as a result of any adjustments of crop nutrition sonneveld and voogt 2009 finally the decrease of the no3 level in the recirculating solution by 50 when ln nutrient solution was supplied to compensate for plant uptake fig 3a and sfigs 3a and 4a without any detrimental effects on fruit yield suggests that partial substitution of no3 by cl can reduce n fertilizer input in closed hydroponic crops of tomato nitrogen uptake by tomato plants decreased as a result of lower n concentrations in the root environment as a decreased no3 level in the rhizosphere reduces the number of inducible nitrate carriers in the plasma membrane tischner 2000 the key question is whether cl reduces the uptake of no3 by joining common transporters or cl is preferentially stored in plant cells instead of no3 it seems that plants used readily available cl ions for osmotic purposes as mentioned elsewhere if external no3 supply decreases there is evidence that cl is the dominant ion used to maintain charge balance and the preferred osmoticum in plant cell because its transport to the vacuoles requires less energy than no3 franco navarro et al 2016 thus when supplied at millimolar concentrations cytoplasmatic exclusion and vacuolar compartmentalization of cl reduce the need for no3 storage in vacuoles thereby maintaining sufficient no3 availability for reduction into organic n and use in relevant metabolic processes colmenero flores et al 2019 indeed our data demonstrate that the decrease of the net no3 supply to 2 3 of the standard recommendations in closed hydroponic tomato crops accompanied by an equivalent increase of the cl level increases nitrogen use efficiency nue nue is a fundamental crop trait in sustainable greenhouse horticulture and these results suggest that a cl concentration of up to 5 mm in the rns supplied to closed hydroponic tomato crops enhances n utilization by plants while minimizing n losses without compromising yield and quality the two tomato genotypes tested in the current study exhibited differences in nue due to variations in yield performance the beefsteak type cultivar was associated with a higher nue irrespective of the n supply regime due to better yield performance and a higher harvest index table 3 compared to the cherry type cultivar thus it is wise to strive for high yielding cultivars in view of an effective utilization of n sonneveld and voogt 2009 furthermore the leaf cl concentration in plants treated with high cl concentrations was about 35 mg g 1 dry weight fig 4j without any specific toxicity symptoms or any nutrient deficiency due to competitive phenomena particularly cl fed tomato plants regulated leaf cl content within the range defined as beneficial rosales et al 2020 which indicates that cl at the tested levels facilitated a good nutritional status of the crop fig 4a i for optimum growth and eventually increased the carbon to nitrogen c n assimilation ratio table 5 5 conclusions partial substitution of nitrate no3 by chloride cl in nft grown tomato crops provides opportunities for effective recycling of nutrients with less inorganic n inputs while not increasing the salinity in the root zone thereby zeroing the need to discharge the drainage in short medium life cycle crops if the na concentration in the irrigation water is not excessive substantial amounts of cl ions were absorbed and translocated to the leaves of tomato facilitating high leaf cl contents similar to those of macronutrients 35 mg g 1 dry weight without toxicity symptoms nutritional imbalances or osmotic salinity effects plants treated with high cl concentrations in the replenishment nutrient solution 4 4 or 5 mm depending on the cropping stage see table 2 regulated stomatal function for optimal water retention which involves further the contribution of stomatal aperture on this without affecting the biochemical capacity to assimilate co2 this points to a role of cl in promoting chloroplast performance by facilitating physiological and morphological adaptations in mesophyll cells furthermore nutrient uc determined in the present study constitute a sound basis to be used in on line decision support systems to automatically calculate and readjust ns formulations in mediterranean hydroponic tomato crops however nss supplied to hydroponic tomato crops cvs elpida and shiren amended with cl ions should contain ca2 at higher concentrations than standard recommendations these results clearly showed that reducing the no3 concentration to 2 3 of standard recommendations in the fresh nutrient solution applied to compensate for nutrient uptake in closed hydroponic tomato crops reduces nitrate fertilizer input by more than 30 without any specific negative effects on yield and quality in open systems in which the drainage solution is discharged the partial substitution of no3 by cl lessens the leaching losses of nitrate by 50 which entails higher n use efficiency and less pollution of aquifers by nitrates funding this work was supported by
