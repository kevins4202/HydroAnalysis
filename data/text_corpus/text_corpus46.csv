230,a coupled statistical and conditional generative adversarial neural network is used for 3d reconstruction of both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media from a single two dimensional image a statistical approach feeds the deep network with conditional data and then the reconstruction is trained on a deep generative network the conditional nature of the generative model helps in network stability and convergence which has been optimized through a gradient descent based optimization method moreover this coupled approach allows the reconstruction of heterogeneous samples a critical and serious challenge in conventional reconstruction methods the main contribution of this work is to develop an adaptable framework that can efficiently reconstitute heterogeneous porous media using the power of conditional generative adversarial networks the reconstruction time is accelerated approximately 1000 fold compared to traditional statistical reconstruction methods various matching criteria in both morphological and physical characteristics are used to evaluate the model performance to validate the approach the reconstructed realizations have been compared to the models generated by a conventional 3d gan along with a well known statistical method the results confirm that the proposed approach is a reliable framework for extracting information from a single 2d image to reconstruct 3d microstructures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heterogeneous porous media thin section image statistical reconstruction characterization deep learning conditional generative adversarial network 1 introduction porous media are ubiquitous in natural and engineered settings the important properties of porous media which control storage flow transport and reaction such as porosity specific surface area permeability wettability preference mass transfer as well as capillary pressure are dependent on the complex microstructure blunt et al 2013 various tomography techniques are able to explore the internal structure of porous materials among them are computed tomography ct x ray scanning electron microscopy sem and focused ion beam sem fib sem wildenschild and sheppard 2013 micro computed tomography µct scans the pore space texture of porous materials in a three dimensional 3d format at the micron scale however it suffers from limited accessibility high cost and insufficient resolution to detect sub micron scale pores in contrast to the difficulties and constraints of 3d imaging 2d images are easier to obtain at different resolutions and they are more widely available owing to abundant thin section samples hence the reconstruction of 3d structures from 2d images is important to overcome experimental or manipulation limitations such as sample size sample preparation field of view image resolution and segmentation blunt 2017 statistical and artificial intelligence methods are the two main types of reconstruction algorithm which will be described in the subsequent sections we will then introduce a new hybrid method that combines the strengths of existing approaches 1 1 statistical reconstruction the original concept in statistical methods is the reconstruction of 2d images through a simulation process of exchanging pixels joshi 1974 the extended and modified version of this approach is the joshi quiblier adler mjqa method which generates 3d data by the means of an auto correlation function a spatial statistical property adler et al 1990 quiblier 1984 roberts 1997 the algorithm focuses on truncation and manipulation of a gaussian random field regarding the porosity and the auto correlation function of an input training image blair et al 1996 although the results were fair the reconstruction assessment shows underestimation of pore space connectivity in comparison to the experimental data since the percolation threshold of these approaches is about 10 and the model is unable to mimic anisotropy in the real structure øren and bakke 2002 optimization approaches such as simulated annealing sa allows the reconstructed images to match prescribed conditions or objectives based on geometrical characteristics and statistical functions such as chord length lineal path co occurrence correlation and cluster correlation feng et al 2018a hazlett 1997 roberts 1997 roberts and torquato 1999 talukdar et al 2002 yeong and torquato 1998 1997 sa is a minimization method that searches for a global optimum although it is a flexible framework it may become trapped in a local minimum which increases the reconstruction time jiang et al 2013 revised versions of sa or hybrid approaches such as stable phase method for hierarchical sa chen et al 2014 multi thread sa ju et al 2017 or improvements in pore connectivity čapek et al 2009 dilation erosion guo et al 2014 zachary and torquato 2011 pixel swapping and different phase neighbor pixel based selection gao et al 2016 pant et al 2014 have been presented to overcome the limitations and improve the efficiency of this approach in addition cherkasov et al 2021 proposed an adaptive phase retrieval stochastic algorithm using two point probability and surface surface functions which is able to improve the quality of sa reconstructions another statistical approach is the use of multiple point statistics mps by which the 2d training image is scanned with a training template and then its multi point information is extracted hajizadeh et al 2011 okabe and blunt 2005 mps can reproduce curvilinear features typical patterns and morphological texture for simulation of each new pixel the mps needs rescanning of a defined pattern consequently the approach is cpu demanding and hence image generation is still potentially time consuming these aforementioned approaches suffer from various shortcomings such as lack of long range connectivity poor ability to reproduce heterogeneities sharp changes in topology overestimating or underestimating the statistical and dynamical properties and demonstrating long simulation comparison times and large memory requirements da wang et al 2021 feng et al 2019 2018 b kamrava et al 2020 liu et al 2019 mosser et al 2017 rabbani et al 2021 sadeghnejad et al 2021 tahmasebi and sahimi 2016 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2019 to resolve these problems many researchers have turned to deep machine learning especially approaches which deal with image synthesis 1 2 deep learning reconstruction deep learning is a version of machine learning which represents data with multiple levels of abstraction and extracts deeper features of a dataset whether supervised unsupervised or through reinforcement goodfellow et al 2016 lecun et al 2015 conventional learning needs data pre processing and feature vectorization before training however deep learning is able to process data in raw or natural format through representation learning goodfellow et al 2016 the detailed feature extraction within deep models involves accessing the true map structure higher order correlation functions and complex features of an input image for reconstruction or upscaling purposes siavashi et al 2022 therefore the deep models can be used to reconstruct porous media images with these capabilities rabbani et al 2020 deep learning can be implemented in various ways among them generative models are more commonly used to generate fake samples similar to real images generative models have the role of producing representative realizations based on an input training dataset among the generative models generative adversarial neural networks gans are the most widely used goodfellow et al 2014 a gan is an unsupervised deep learning approach a gan consists of two convolutional neural networks the discriminator and the generator depicted in fig 1 a the generator s role is to produce synthetic realizations that look real to the discriminator while the discriminator determines the plausibility of synthetic images compared to the real data it is expected that once a deep model is trained it is able to generate multiple equiprobable images rapidly whose statistical and dynamical properties matches those of the training images within a reasonable accuracy recently gans have been used to reconstruct porous media based on 3d training data da wang et al 2021 mosser et al 2017 shams et al 2020 to train a gan model for porous media reconstruction the first step is preparation of a database so various sub volume images are extracted from the original 3d structure during the training the generator has the role of generation of fake images in a way which fools the discriminator in contrast the discriminator should learn how to detect the fake reconstruction from real images although gans conduct effective reconstructions they may have the following limitations feng et al 2020 2018 b shams et al 2020 gan is applicable for 2d or 3d reconstruction if the training dataset is 2d or 3d respectively and hence does not readily produce 3d output from 2d data in cases were the dataset is limited incomplete or a subsection of an examined area a gan cannot recover the missing parts in gans the generative network produces synthetic images receiving noise input g z without any further adjustment using conditional data so there is no control on modes of produced data in gans there are difficulties in controlling convergence and stability of the training which can be time consuming since the gan needs adaptation to reconstruct 3d data from 2d images we now discuss studies which focus on 2d to 3d reconstructions valsecchi et al 2020 developed a revised gan for which the discriminator learning is over 2d samples in contrast to conventional gans the discriminator receives both 2d datasets and random 2d slices extracted from 3d images they tested the model for three rock types however large memory consumption demand for a large number of 2d datasets in discriminator training and the small volume of the reconstructed media are the concerns with this approach another recent study in 2d to 3d reconstruction is the development of a bicyclegan network feng et al 2020 a bicyclegan contains two sub structures which consist of three neural networks generator discriminator and encoder the generator receives both a 2d image and noise data and produces 3d fake data to fool the discriminator while the discriminator receives 3d data and gives the corresponding probability that it is real finally the encoder converts the 3d structure to a distribution map and helps the generator training since the discriminator training of a bicyclegan is over 3d data this approach needs access to 3d data for model learning and testing the proposed bicyclegan was unsatisfactory for heterogeneous samples where very small unphysical pores were visible in the reconstructed media which is also reported in facies modeling through gans zhang et al 2019 the main problem was the difficulty in training all three networks together another attempt developed a coupled deep model to reconstruct 3d images from 2d samples zhang et al 2021 the model consisted of a variant auto encoder and a gan and addresses the solution for stability and challenges of conventional gans although these aforementioned approaches show improvement however all of them need a good quality 3d database for network training limited training data such as 2d data is a big concern which is solved through conditional generative adversarial neural networks cgan isola et al 2017 a cgan as an alternative generative model resolves some of the problems with gans feng et al 2018b in contrast to gans the generative network in cgan adjusts the generation of new realizations according to both the noise level and sampling data conditional data however the role of the discriminative function is similar to the gan distinguishing reality from fictitious in the model regarding its application in porous media studies recently a cgan framework has been established which accelerates a multi point statistics reconstruction algorithm feng et al 2018b in 2d the reconstruction method is easy whereas in 3d layer by layer stacking in the z direction was used feng et al 2018b in further work they proposed a cgan framework for reconstruction of full 2d images from a limited or partial information through mapping between partial and full image feng et al 2019 although the results show that the generated structures can recover equivalent representations of the 2d porous textures however they focused only on 2d reconstructions traditionally a mps extracts a template from training 2d data swaps pixels and matches the multi point information layer by layer to reconstruct the final 3d structure cgan relates the template to the target efficiently and accelerates the reconstruction therefore due to the generative and conditional matching behavior of cgan we utilized its power in our current study fig 1b depicts a schematic of the cgan we develop in this paper the discriminator receives both real representatives and the conditional data and the generator receives both the latent space and conditional data to train the cgan the problem is a mini max optimization on ocgan 1 o cgan min g max d e x p data x y p data y log d x y e x p data x z p z z log 1 d x g z x in eq 1 x is the 2d conditional data or observation data as the adjustment which controls the generative y is the 2d real or target data and z is the latent random space after the tuning the generator is able to reconstitute the realizations through receiving both the conditional data and the latent space therefore the generation adjustment using conditional data adapts the cgan to reconstruct 3d media from 2d images another important characteristic of cgan approaches is their ability to incorporate user defined adjustment in addition through this algorithm and the coupling with gan ae auto encoder neural network it is possible to reconstruct 2d to 3d multi scale porous media reviewing these studies revels that most previous work has focused on 2d to 2d or 3d to 3d reconstruction feng et al 2019 2018 b shams et al 2020 valsecchi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 among the 2d to 3d reconstruction approaches heterogeneous media pose a particular challenge in addition training stability and convergence issues are the common difficulties reported by researchers which motivate us to develop a new coupled framework for reconstruction feng et al 2018b zhang et al 2021 1 3 motivation an improvement to the existing models is the reconstruction of 3d porous media from 2d images with reliable topological and morphological properties at a reasonable computational cost and with stable training in this paper we present a hybrid statistical cgan approach to reconstitute 3d porous media from 2d images the statistical framework benefits the application of a cgan as an alternative to gans and resolves the common mentioned obstacles with deep approaches the paper structure is compiled in the following order section 2 describes the principles of a modified version of a statistical approach then the architecture of the hybrid st cgan approach is presented which is a coupled statistical method and cgan furthermore this section presents the evaluation criteria for reconstruction and the dataset used to train and test the algorithm in section 3 the results of the methodology proposed and comparison with experimental data are discussed and finally the paper is summarized and concluded in section 4 2 hybrid st cgan for reconstruction of 3d porous media the original gans and cgans generate the 3d images if the training data is 3d so for the case of 3d reconstruction from 2d images first we need a framework for generation of 3d pre conditioner data and then the detailed texture the current study integrates the correlation nature of statistical reconstruction with the exactness speediness and generative nature of deep learning to reconstruct 3d homogenous and heterogeneous porous media from 2d images the idea is to weaken or remove the challenges and limitations within generation of realistic 3d porous media from 2d thin section images referred to previously this section details the proposed methodologies and the hybrid approach developed in this study 2 1 principle of statistical reconstruction the statistical section generates pre conditioner data for the proposed cgan a pre conditioner data is the raw immature format of a target 3d structure as mentioned before mjqa is a well known statistical algorithm in the mjqa approach the target 3d image is generated based on processing of a noisy and uncorrelated 3d structure through a set of linear and non linear combinations using certain coefficients adler et al 1990 these coefficients are derived from a trial and error approach solving a set of equations which is a time consuming and ill posed problem in addition the proposed approach is only applicable for homogenous media adler et al 1990 quiblier 1984 roberts 1997 here we use the 3d filtration instead of linear and non linear combinations in mjqa through the following workflow a 2d porous medium or a phase function m x is a binary structure consisted of either pore or solid phases 2 m x 1 x p o r e 0 x s o l i d here x is any position vector or spatial point in the porous texture in m x the porosity as the fraction of void volume to the bulk volume and auto correlation function as the probability that two points x and x r lie in the pore or solid regions are formulated as 3 ϕ m x m x and 4 s 2 m x x x r ϕ m x m x ϕ m x m x r ϕ m x ϕ m x 2 where the r is the lag distance between two points x and x r in other words the probability of a randomly selected point of the porous medium to be in the pore phase is equal to φ m x moreover the following definition describes the auto correlation function 5 s 2 m x x x r p r o b a b i l i t y x p o r e s p a c e x r p o r e s p a c e the normalized auto correlation function or filter function s2 m r is computed from the 2d slice then it is converted to the 3d format considering r x 2 y 2 z 2 the following equation shows the calculation of f in the 3d format 6 f r f x y z s 2 m r s 2 m r s 2 m 0 2 s 2 m 0 s 2 m 0 2 the functional behavior of the auto correlation is dependent on the pore space configuration or isotropy anisotropy of the porous media and it provides information such as correlation length average pore and grain chord length the correlation length of system is when the auto correlation function becomes asymptotic the correlation length impacts directly on long range connectivity of pore spaces the derivative of function at origin point s 2 0 is a representation of average chord length of pore spaces and can represents the short and long range connectivity fig 2 therefore it is expected that the filtration of a noisy structure results in immature pre conditioner data which contains the key elements of the statistical information further discussion about the average chord length is provided in the results and discussion in a reconstruction process of pre conditioner data a random gaussian field n is created with variance of 1 and mean of 0 through the box muller method law et al 2000 let n x y z be a completely uncorrelated and noisy gaussian distributed structure for each point within n we define a neighboring domain x r y s z t and then directly convolve it with the normalized auto correlation function f r s t using 7 s r x y z r 0 d s 0 d t 0 d n x r y s z t f r s t in convolution each element of this function is convolved into the matrix n r s t are indices of f the 3d auto correlation matrix in this research the size of d is practically calculated from the half of a weighted average of the correlation length and average chord length 8 d 1 2 α a v e r a g e c h o r d l e n g t h 1 α c o r r e l a t i o n l e n g t h a visual demonstration of convolution procedure is in fig 3 after extraction of the filter function from 2d training data the convolution process of eq 7 calculates the pre conditioner matrix of sr this nonlinear filter or convolution exposes the media continuity along the z direction fig 4 shows the structure continuity of pre conditional data for three layers with spacing of 2 therefore the statistical pre processed data is generated through the filtration of original noisy random structure noisy immature structure using the 3d auto correlation function then the output of convolution is directly passed through a trained deep learning box introduced below as an st cgan package 2 2 st cgan architecture as mentioned before the 3d noisy image n x y z should be convolved into a desired size with a normalized 3d statistical function f x y z to give a pre conditioner or semi reconstructed realization then to generate more realistic structures the resultant matrix should be optimized using other morphological functions or conditioned and filtered for noise removal to depict a more reliable texture both convolution and optimization approaches are often time consuming and in the case of heterogeneous samples may show meaningless and very unstable results to overcome this challenge we use the power of cgan the coupled statistical and cgan can learn the detailed features within the 2d porous texture and reproduce equivalent 3d realizations the overall workflow of st cgan is introduced in pseudo code in table 1 the idea novelty and the steps need to be taken are the goal is to reconstruct 3d realizations from the 2d inputs the statistical approach extracts a feature based latent vector from the 2d image the feature based latent vector is convolved in a noisy immature structure the statistical pre processed data is a set of stacked 2d matrices representing as the external conditioning data cgan reproduces 2d images based on two inputs 1 a latent random data and 2 the stacked 2d conditional data as the adjustment data cgan translates the immature statistical outputs to the realistic porous media as the target the optimization is conducted through the adversarial loss function within the generator generated realizations are stacked together to reproduce the 3d image the statistical approach can only generate images as large as the input training size however benefiting from the proposed hybrid scheme larger scale 3d realizations can be reconstructed and the trained model is able to capture the short and long range connectivity the fundamental assumptions of statistical approaches recommend them for application in homogenous samples however the st cgan empowers the statistical framework to reproduce the underlying heterogeneity and so makes it suitable for heterogeneous samples fig 5 schematically provides an overview about the proposed framework which utilized a coupled version of statistical function and deep learning generation for reconstruction of 3d porous structures originally the cgan is unable to reproduce 3d structure from 2d input however the statistical section provides a 3d correlated structure which is necessary to generate 3d realizations each slice is fed into the cgan to capture the model homogeneity heterogeneity based on the trained model as we use data distribution in the cgan it can generate more realistic multi scale porous media images through the st cgan there is no need to have a 3d dataset and by using cgan there is no need for optimization of the mjqa approach shams et al 2020 valsecchi et al 2020 therefore the st cgan can reconstruct 3d images efficiently the first step in st cgan is introducing the 2d training images into the statistical approach then the immature 2d representatives enters the cgan the cgan learns a loss function that labels the real and fictitious images while concurrently trains a generative network to minimize the loss the detailed idea for proposing a loss function and its optimization is described in section 2 3 in this section the cgan architecture including the layer types numbers and functions are presented in detail both the generator g and discriminator d are composed of various forms of convolutional batch normalization batchnorm and nonlinear activation relu layers the network architecture is described in isola et al 2017 the discriminator or d is designed to give a probability that the output of g is real or fake however the role of g is to generate images similar to real ones to fool d into believing that the generated images are real the d network or classifier is structured based on 5 convolutional layers followed by leaky relu lrelu activations and batchnorms to access the output of d as a probability and indicator for similarity the blocks in the structure of d are finished with sigmoid functions in d the real data is labeled 1 and the fake data labeled as 0 in a trained model with a powerful g both data types are labeled as 0 5 in contrast to the conventional gans the g in cgan has a more complicated structure the g network is a kind of u net networks containing convolutional and deconvolutional layers u nets are well known for their general shape of the u through symmetric down sampling and up sampling sections multi scale feature extractor fewer effective parameters and good performance in image to image translations isola et al 2017 starting from a 64 64 image the image is down sampled convoluted or encoded step by step with a factor of 2 to a 1 1 code within encoder and then in reverse up sampled or decoded into a 64 64 sample with a factor of 2 through decoder section progressively in addition for noise injection into the generator we concatenated latent noise into the first layer of encoder regarding the factor 2 both encoder and decoder networks contain 6 layers each layer has a convolutional a relu and a batchnorm table 2 provides detailed information about the generator and discriminator in the proposed framework for samples of size 64 64 2 3 loss function the nature of cgan is adversarial so both of the g and d should be optimized simultaneously till they reach to equilibrium and g fools the d by generating realistic data the loss consists of two main sections the discriminator loss and generator loss the discriminator loss is based on ocgan however the generator loss needs revision the generator loss function in the form of a weighted sum of two losses measures the quality of generated representatives through the following equation 9 l g cgan l g γ l m where γ is the hyper parameter the first loss lg is defined as e x p data x z p z z log 1 d x g x z and measures the similarity of reconstructed images and the targets distinguished by d the second one lm is the analogy between fake images generated by the g and the conditional data through the x g x z 1 after network training and optimization the d is skipped and the g is used to reconstitute image data similar to the target 2 4 evaluation criteria to evaluate and verify the reconstruction performance of the hybrid scheme developed here both visual inspection and quantitative comparison are used in terms of quantitative comparison the characterization parameters such as morphological spatial or dynamical properties were used in this research the porosity is often used as the simplest and basic morphological property representing the storage capacity of a rock sample the auto correlation function is a second order morphological property used to evaluate the statistical features of the reconstruction process the geometrically related properties for pores and throats such as their numbers size shape factor and volume are extracted based on the maximal ball algorithm dong and blunt 2009 permeability i e absolute permeability which describes the rock ability to pass the single phase fluid is used as a dynamical measure to assess the quality of the reconstructed model the permeability is calculated through solving the stokes equations conservations of mass and momentum assuming that the fluid is incompressible and inertial forces are small mostaghimi et al 2013 sadeghnejad et al 2021 2 5 database to perform model training and testing we choose two 3d samples in the literature table 3 one relatively homogenous sample i e berea sandstone and one heterogeneous sample i e estaillades carbonate mosser et al 2017 muljadi et al 2016 the samples selected help us to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our framework the first is berea sandstone with image size of 400 400 400 voxels and voxel size of 3 µm the second image is a 500 500 500 estaillades carbonate imaged with voxel size of 3 3113 µm reported from the x ray imaging facility at imperial college london mosser et al 2017 muljadi et al 2016 fig 6 illustrates these samples to prepare the training and testing images we extract sub slice 2d and sub volume 3d images respectively the cgan section of the st cgan architecture needs training on samples available in the database in order to do that we train the model on stacks of 2d layers from the 3d images therefore the network training was conducted on 2d images and the testing was done on 3d sub volumes the procedure outlined in table 4 describes the training process the selection of proper sub sample sizes is directly related to the pore and grain configuration the proper sizing captures the local interaction of grains so it is a dependent parameter to the texture of each sample table 5 describes the total numbers sizes and spacing stride window for both berea and estaillades samples after training with a batch of 2d slices in the testing procedure a single 2d slice of 3d sub volume was passed to the st cgan and the resultant 3d image was compared to the original sub volume images using the evaluation criteria mentioned above during testing we have used about 30 of the 3d sub volume samples for model evaluation practically a 2d slice with statistical information similar to the 3d testing image results better matching to assess the framework capability in reconstruction of limited data such as thin section samples in addition to berea sandstone and estaillades carbonate four thin samples extracted from iranian oil fields have been selected fig 7 shams et al 2020 we can capture high resolution images from thin sections with commonly available instruments all samples are 2d thin sections with 264 264 pixels and with a resolution of 20 µm shams et al 2020 their analysis is conducted in section 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 network stability and optimization the challenges during the network training and comparison of run times for both statistical and deep methods are described here as mentioned before statistical methods usually do not capture the correct long range connectivity and also the reconstruction is very expensive so the simulation process should be usually truncated while the error is high in addition previous research has confirmed that it is challenging to converge to a stable formation in conventional gans since the problem is a nash equilibrium zhang et al 2021 the aim of modified gan based approaches is to overcome with collapse and convergence difficulties during the training phase resolving the deficiencies of conventional gans results in better sample qualities another issue with conventional gans raised from the optimization and selection of best hyper parameters several researchers discuss this problems and mentioned that the conditional gans can be used as an alternative barnett 2018 cheng et al 2020 kodali et al 2017 rabbani et al 2021 salimans et al 2016 however in our proposed st cgan there is no simulation and matching process in the statistical section and during the training in cgan the observation data provides the network with a blur immature texture this immature texture aids network stability and convergence because it plays a role similar to a map γ eq 9 the weight on lm controls the impact of observation data and in this work it is empirically set to 12 and 10 for homogenous and heterogeneous reconstructions respectively by manual manipulation of γ we can explore the results of each reconstruction it has an impact over the backbone structure king and masihi 2018 or the main local points of the porous texture furthermore in conventional gan the training is 3d to 3d and although that it is expected to give better results with increasing iterations the training shows an unstable behavior however in st cgan we observed a better convergence and the reconstruction quality was improved through increasing of iteration numbers as emphasized in other work mosser et al 2017 shams et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in addition we practically consider α 0 6 and 0 85 for homogenous and heterogeneous reconstructions respectively eq 9 this assignment is in agreement with the fact that in homogenous samples the range of average chord length is small the training process of the current study in a gpu system is optimized using a gradient descent based optimizer adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0 0002 which is gradually decreased to reach a stable training besides the reconstruction quality of st cgan which will be discussed later the reconstruction speed of mjqa takes approximately two hours to generate one realization however once trained the st cgan is able to generate 3d images in just less than a second various python libraries are developed and used for coding of different section of st cgan including numpy cv2 pandas argparse hdf5 pil itertools pyimsl matplotlib pytorch torch and tensorflow 3 2 homogenous media berea sandstone reconstruction berea as a fluvial sandstone has a homogenous texture the detailed description of image and the training testing data are presented in section 2 6 fig 8 shows the visual comparison of original sample and the generated realization from st cgan a conventional gan similar to the work conducted by mosser et al 2017 and shams et al 2020 and mjqa the detailed procedure is disccused in appendix a in both 2d and 3d for image sizes of 4002 and 4003 respectively visual inspection expresses the close agreement between the original samples and st cgan findings in contrast although mjqa generates pores in similar size and spacing it does not properly capture the pore shapes images with a size of 64 are selected for training however st cgan can produce larger images when a larger noise is introduced into the trained generator gan based models are capable of reproducing larger images when larger latent spaces are introduced goodfellow et al 2014 mosser et al 2017 shams et al 2020 the comparison between auto correlation functions for reconstructed samples and the original is presented in fig 9 the matching between the empirical behavior and the auto correlation of synthetic realizations obtained by st cgan confirms the observations of the visual inspection however the reconstruction quality of the mjqa method is questionable since in the tail part of the auto correlation function we observe several deviations from the original fig 10 compares the calculated porosity and permeability of the generated samples which confirm the model capability to capture the similar range although mjqa covers a good range in porosity it underestimates the permeability since it does not capture long range connectivity table 6 presents the important parameters of the extracted networks from the original sample and the reconstructed model and highlights the capability of st cgan to reconstruct images that capture both short and long range connectivity overall the new method produces images of similar quality to 3d to 3d reconstructions using gans having shown the ability of the proposed st cgan in homogenous samples we can train and find the model capability in heterogeneous samples 3 3 heterogeneous media estaillades carbonate reconstruction there are three main differences in the handling of heterogeneous samples first the proposed statistical approach used a value of d based on a weighted average of correlation length and average chord length eq 8 this value is significantly different based on our experiments over samples available in database second the size of training sample for heterogeneous sample is 1282 which could capture model heterogeneity based on the pore space configuration third the hyper parameter γ is different for homogenous and heterogeneous media this value controls the impact of observation data in loss function eq 9 in contrast to berea sandstone a larger sample size was used for the training of estaillades carbonate as the size of the structuring components was larger this idea was confirmed during training efforts with various sizes visual inspection of fig 11 demonstrates the ability of st cgan to reconstruct heterogeneous textures indeed the reconstructions are more realistic than from a 3d gan this can also be confirmed by comparison of auto correlation decline presented in fig 12 the exponential decline behavior of the auto correlation function in the original and st cgan reconstructions shows a similar trend however the mjqa failed to sufficiently capture the long and short range correlations the deviation is more severe at shorter lags which is highlighted within ellipsoidal dashed line the derivative of the auto correlation function at the origin s 2 0 is an average chord length of pores and an average chord length of grains through the following equations 10 l pore φ s 2 0 11 l grain 1 φ s 2 0 the cord length for pore phase can be visually read from the intersection of the derivative line and the x axis parameters a and b shown in fig 12 the comparison between the pore chord lengths shows that the st cgan reproduces the porous structure of heterogeneous estaillades much better in comparison with the mjqa and is even superior to 3d gans furthermore fig 13 compares the auto correlation in x y and z directions and shows good much in all directions to clarify the importance of chord lengths fig 14 depicts the pore spaces of 1003 sub volumes and demonstrates that the pore structure of the original samples can be reproduced with st cgan while conserving the connectivity as a summary the estaillades carbonate is a non stationary and heterogeneous complex medium and it is difficult for platforms such as gan to reconstruct with reasonable accuracy in conventional platforms the reconstruction quality is severely related to the size of the training sample which faces the reconstruction problems such as memory requirements liu et al 2019 the proposed st cgan is capable to resolve problems with conventional gans and statistical approaches feng et al 2018b shams et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 to reconstitute reliable realizations of heterogeneous media fig 15 depicts the porosity and permeability values which confirms that the st cgan captures the short and long range connectivity similar to berea sandstone the average values for pore network parameters are presented in table 7 which confirms that the model works well in addition this investigation shows that the 3d gan generated realizations are poorer in terms of structure and predicted permeability compared to our hybrid approach the visual inspection and properties comparison i e statistical or dynamical properties of both berea and estaillades confirm the potential of our model to reconstruct representative 3d porous media from 2d images within a reasonable time in comparison to other methods the model training and testing is conducted over a system with a nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ti gpu 11gb of vram and an i7 5820 k 3 3 ghz cpu 32gb memory the comparison between reconstruction times of st cgan a 3d gan mjqa and the hybrid deep model proposed by zhang et al 2021 are presented in table 8 however our proposed hybrid framework has some limitations one of them is in case of multi scale porous media images the model is unable to capture multi scale information and to resolve this we need further post processing steps in addition another limitation of st cgan is for training images containing large scale heterogeneity since the sample heterogeneity may not be available in the training image 3 4 thin section reconstruction here we evaluate the model capability through reconstruction of 3d images from 2d thin sections from a producing oilfield the selected samples have been passed through the st cgan framework and then the reconstructed microstructures are evaluated since the permeability of thin section samples are not available the quality checking of reconstructed samples has been conducted through visual inspection and the auto correlation function fig 16 a visually presents the reconstructed microstructures visual inspection confirms the similar trend between the reconstructed and the original data as in fig 7 in addition fig 16b depicts the calculated auto correlation of reconstructions and demonstrates a similar spatial distribution over the auto correlation function of original samples therefore the reconstructed media appear to be suitable for flow simulation and estimation of physical properties 4 conclusions and recommendations this paper has proposed a novel hybrid method to reconstruct three dimensional porous media from a single two dimensional image the proposed framework used the correlative nature of a well known statistical methodology and the generative power of conditional generative adversarial neural networks the introduction of two dimensional images of porous media into the statistical motor results in immature pre processed data which helps the unsupervised learning of the deep learning motor the pre processed data acts as the guiding map and aids the generator in three dimensional reconstruction the model training needs a large computational effort and network adjustment however once the model is trained the model is able to reconstruct realizations matching the key statistical characteristics and physical parameters of target porous media within a few seconds to validate the approach we examined the methodology on berea sandstone as a homogenous sample and estaillades carbonate as a heterogeneous exemplar and four 2d thin sections from reservoir rocks the results revealed more than 95 matching between the auto correlation function of the target and reconstructed realizations in all samples the matching between pore network parameters in reconstructed and real data shows average absolute relative error of 2 3 and 6 0 in berea sandstone and estaillades carbonate respectively the applications of the proposed framework may be extended for reconstruction of 2d and 3d realizations from samples with sub micron pores limited information or multi scale samples also further manipulation of the statistical functions and the integration with cgan may help in reconstitution of multi scale porous media image manipulation by user constraints will help researchers incorporate large scale heterogeneities which are often missed from reconstruction through other approaches credit authorship contribution statement reza shams conceptualization

homogenous fields 
230,a coupled statistical and conditional generative adversarial neural network is used for 3d reconstruction of both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media from a single two dimensional image a statistical approach feeds the deep network with conditional data and then the reconstruction is trained on a deep generative network the conditional nature of the generative model helps in network stability and convergence which has been optimized through a gradient descent based optimization method moreover this coupled approach allows the reconstruction of heterogeneous samples a critical and serious challenge in conventional reconstruction methods the main contribution of this work is to develop an adaptable framework that can efficiently reconstitute heterogeneous porous media using the power of conditional generative adversarial networks the reconstruction time is accelerated approximately 1000 fold compared to traditional statistical reconstruction methods various matching criteria in both morphological and physical characteristics are used to evaluate the model performance to validate the approach the reconstructed realizations have been compared to the models generated by a conventional 3d gan along with a well known statistical method the results confirm that the proposed approach is a reliable framework for extracting information from a single 2d image to reconstruct 3d microstructures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heterogeneous porous media thin section image statistical reconstruction characterization deep learning conditional generative adversarial network 1 introduction porous media are ubiquitous in natural and engineered settings the important properties of porous media which control storage flow transport and reaction such as porosity specific surface area permeability wettability preference mass transfer as well as capillary pressure are dependent on the complex microstructure blunt et al 2013 various tomography techniques are able to explore the internal structure of porous materials among them are computed tomography ct x ray scanning electron microscopy sem and focused ion beam sem fib sem wildenschild and sheppard 2013 micro computed tomography µct scans the pore space texture of porous materials in a three dimensional 3d format at the micron scale however it suffers from limited accessibility high cost and insufficient resolution to detect sub micron scale pores in contrast to the difficulties and constraints of 3d imaging 2d images are easier to obtain at different resolutions and they are more widely available owing to abundant thin section samples hence the reconstruction of 3d structures from 2d images is important to overcome experimental or manipulation limitations such as sample size sample preparation field of view image resolution and segmentation blunt 2017 statistical and artificial intelligence methods are the two main types of reconstruction algorithm which will be described in the subsequent sections we will then introduce a new hybrid method that combines the strengths of existing approaches 1 1 statistical reconstruction the original concept in statistical methods is the reconstruction of 2d images through a simulation process of exchanging pixels joshi 1974 the extended and modified version of this approach is the joshi quiblier adler mjqa method which generates 3d data by the means of an auto correlation function a spatial statistical property adler et al 1990 quiblier 1984 roberts 1997 the algorithm focuses on truncation and manipulation of a gaussian random field regarding the porosity and the auto correlation function of an input training image blair et al 1996 although the results were fair the reconstruction assessment shows underestimation of pore space connectivity in comparison to the experimental data since the percolation threshold of these approaches is about 10 and the model is unable to mimic anisotropy in the real structure øren and bakke 2002 optimization approaches such as simulated annealing sa allows the reconstructed images to match prescribed conditions or objectives based on geometrical characteristics and statistical functions such as chord length lineal path co occurrence correlation and cluster correlation feng et al 2018a hazlett 1997 roberts 1997 roberts and torquato 1999 talukdar et al 2002 yeong and torquato 1998 1997 sa is a minimization method that searches for a global optimum although it is a flexible framework it may become trapped in a local minimum which increases the reconstruction time jiang et al 2013 revised versions of sa or hybrid approaches such as stable phase method for hierarchical sa chen et al 2014 multi thread sa ju et al 2017 or improvements in pore connectivity čapek et al 2009 dilation erosion guo et al 2014 zachary and torquato 2011 pixel swapping and different phase neighbor pixel based selection gao et al 2016 pant et al 2014 have been presented to overcome the limitations and improve the efficiency of this approach in addition cherkasov et al 2021 proposed an adaptive phase retrieval stochastic algorithm using two point probability and surface surface functions which is able to improve the quality of sa reconstructions another statistical approach is the use of multiple point statistics mps by which the 2d training image is scanned with a training template and then its multi point information is extracted hajizadeh et al 2011 okabe and blunt 2005 mps can reproduce curvilinear features typical patterns and morphological texture for simulation of each new pixel the mps needs rescanning of a defined pattern consequently the approach is cpu demanding and hence image generation is still potentially time consuming these aforementioned approaches suffer from various shortcomings such as lack of long range connectivity poor ability to reproduce heterogeneities sharp changes in topology overestimating or underestimating the statistical and dynamical properties and demonstrating long simulation comparison times and large memory requirements da wang et al 2021 feng et al 2019 2018 b kamrava et al 2020 liu et al 2019 mosser et al 2017 rabbani et al 2021 sadeghnejad et al 2021 tahmasebi and sahimi 2016 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2019 to resolve these problems many researchers have turned to deep machine learning especially approaches which deal with image synthesis 1 2 deep learning reconstruction deep learning is a version of machine learning which represents data with multiple levels of abstraction and extracts deeper features of a dataset whether supervised unsupervised or through reinforcement goodfellow et al 2016 lecun et al 2015 conventional learning needs data pre processing and feature vectorization before training however deep learning is able to process data in raw or natural format through representation learning goodfellow et al 2016 the detailed feature extraction within deep models involves accessing the true map structure higher order correlation functions and complex features of an input image for reconstruction or upscaling purposes siavashi et al 2022 therefore the deep models can be used to reconstruct porous media images with these capabilities rabbani et al 2020 deep learning can be implemented in various ways among them generative models are more commonly used to generate fake samples similar to real images generative models have the role of producing representative realizations based on an input training dataset among the generative models generative adversarial neural networks gans are the most widely used goodfellow et al 2014 a gan is an unsupervised deep learning approach a gan consists of two convolutional neural networks the discriminator and the generator depicted in fig 1 a the generator s role is to produce synthetic realizations that look real to the discriminator while the discriminator determines the plausibility of synthetic images compared to the real data it is expected that once a deep model is trained it is able to generate multiple equiprobable images rapidly whose statistical and dynamical properties matches those of the training images within a reasonable accuracy recently gans have been used to reconstruct porous media based on 3d training data da wang et al 2021 mosser et al 2017 shams et al 2020 to train a gan model for porous media reconstruction the first step is preparation of a database so various sub volume images are extracted from the original 3d structure during the training the generator has the role of generation of fake images in a way which fools the discriminator in contrast the discriminator should learn how to detect the fake reconstruction from real images although gans conduct effective reconstructions they may have the following limitations feng et al 2020 2018 b shams et al 2020 gan is applicable for 2d or 3d reconstruction if the training dataset is 2d or 3d respectively and hence does not readily produce 3d output from 2d data in cases were the dataset is limited incomplete or a subsection of an examined area a gan cannot recover the missing parts in gans the generative network produces synthetic images receiving noise input g z without any further adjustment using conditional data so there is no control on modes of produced data in gans there are difficulties in controlling convergence and stability of the training which can be time consuming since the gan needs adaptation to reconstruct 3d data from 2d images we now discuss studies which focus on 2d to 3d reconstructions valsecchi et al 2020 developed a revised gan for which the discriminator learning is over 2d samples in contrast to conventional gans the discriminator receives both 2d datasets and random 2d slices extracted from 3d images they tested the model for three rock types however large memory consumption demand for a large number of 2d datasets in discriminator training and the small volume of the reconstructed media are the concerns with this approach another recent study in 2d to 3d reconstruction is the development of a bicyclegan network feng et al 2020 a bicyclegan contains two sub structures which consist of three neural networks generator discriminator and encoder the generator receives both a 2d image and noise data and produces 3d fake data to fool the discriminator while the discriminator receives 3d data and gives the corresponding probability that it is real finally the encoder converts the 3d structure to a distribution map and helps the generator training since the discriminator training of a bicyclegan is over 3d data this approach needs access to 3d data for model learning and testing the proposed bicyclegan was unsatisfactory for heterogeneous samples where very small unphysical pores were visible in the reconstructed media which is also reported in facies modeling through gans zhang et al 2019 the main problem was the difficulty in training all three networks together another attempt developed a coupled deep model to reconstruct 3d images from 2d samples zhang et al 2021 the model consisted of a variant auto encoder and a gan and addresses the solution for stability and challenges of conventional gans although these aforementioned approaches show improvement however all of them need a good quality 3d database for network training limited training data such as 2d data is a big concern which is solved through conditional generative adversarial neural networks cgan isola et al 2017 a cgan as an alternative generative model resolves some of the problems with gans feng et al 2018b in contrast to gans the generative network in cgan adjusts the generation of new realizations according to both the noise level and sampling data conditional data however the role of the discriminative function is similar to the gan distinguishing reality from fictitious in the model regarding its application in porous media studies recently a cgan framework has been established which accelerates a multi point statistics reconstruction algorithm feng et al 2018b in 2d the reconstruction method is easy whereas in 3d layer by layer stacking in the z direction was used feng et al 2018b in further work they proposed a cgan framework for reconstruction of full 2d images from a limited or partial information through mapping between partial and full image feng et al 2019 although the results show that the generated structures can recover equivalent representations of the 2d porous textures however they focused only on 2d reconstructions traditionally a mps extracts a template from training 2d data swaps pixels and matches the multi point information layer by layer to reconstruct the final 3d structure cgan relates the template to the target efficiently and accelerates the reconstruction therefore due to the generative and conditional matching behavior of cgan we utilized its power in our current study fig 1b depicts a schematic of the cgan we develop in this paper the discriminator receives both real representatives and the conditional data and the generator receives both the latent space and conditional data to train the cgan the problem is a mini max optimization on ocgan 1 o cgan min g max d e x p data x y p data y log d x y e x p data x z p z z log 1 d x g z x in eq 1 x is the 2d conditional data or observation data as the adjustment which controls the generative y is the 2d real or target data and z is the latent random space after the tuning the generator is able to reconstitute the realizations through receiving both the conditional data and the latent space therefore the generation adjustment using conditional data adapts the cgan to reconstruct 3d media from 2d images another important characteristic of cgan approaches is their ability to incorporate user defined adjustment in addition through this algorithm and the coupling with gan ae auto encoder neural network it is possible to reconstruct 2d to 3d multi scale porous media reviewing these studies revels that most previous work has focused on 2d to 2d or 3d to 3d reconstruction feng et al 2019 2018 b shams et al 2020 valsecchi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 among the 2d to 3d reconstruction approaches heterogeneous media pose a particular challenge in addition training stability and convergence issues are the common difficulties reported by researchers which motivate us to develop a new coupled framework for reconstruction feng et al 2018b zhang et al 2021 1 3 motivation an improvement to the existing models is the reconstruction of 3d porous media from 2d images with reliable topological and morphological properties at a reasonable computational cost and with stable training in this paper we present a hybrid statistical cgan approach to reconstitute 3d porous media from 2d images the statistical framework benefits the application of a cgan as an alternative to gans and resolves the common mentioned obstacles with deep approaches the paper structure is compiled in the following order section 2 describes the principles of a modified version of a statistical approach then the architecture of the hybrid st cgan approach is presented which is a coupled statistical method and cgan furthermore this section presents the evaluation criteria for reconstruction and the dataset used to train and test the algorithm in section 3 the results of the methodology proposed and comparison with experimental data are discussed and finally the paper is summarized and concluded in section 4 2 hybrid st cgan for reconstruction of 3d porous media the original gans and cgans generate the 3d images if the training data is 3d so for the case of 3d reconstruction from 2d images first we need a framework for generation of 3d pre conditioner data and then the detailed texture the current study integrates the correlation nature of statistical reconstruction with the exactness speediness and generative nature of deep learning to reconstruct 3d homogenous and heterogeneous porous media from 2d images the idea is to weaken or remove the challenges and limitations within generation of realistic 3d porous media from 2d thin section images referred to previously this section details the proposed methodologies and the hybrid approach developed in this study 2 1 principle of statistical reconstruction the statistical section generates pre conditioner data for the proposed cgan a pre conditioner data is the raw immature format of a target 3d structure as mentioned before mjqa is a well known statistical algorithm in the mjqa approach the target 3d image is generated based on processing of a noisy and uncorrelated 3d structure through a set of linear and non linear combinations using certain coefficients adler et al 1990 these coefficients are derived from a trial and error approach solving a set of equations which is a time consuming and ill posed problem in addition the proposed approach is only applicable for homogenous media adler et al 1990 quiblier 1984 roberts 1997 here we use the 3d filtration instead of linear and non linear combinations in mjqa through the following workflow a 2d porous medium or a phase function m x is a binary structure consisted of either pore or solid phases 2 m x 1 x p o r e 0 x s o l i d here x is any position vector or spatial point in the porous texture in m x the porosity as the fraction of void volume to the bulk volume and auto correlation function as the probability that two points x and x r lie in the pore or solid regions are formulated as 3 ϕ m x m x and 4 s 2 m x x x r ϕ m x m x ϕ m x m x r ϕ m x ϕ m x 2 where the r is the lag distance between two points x and x r in other words the probability of a randomly selected point of the porous medium to be in the pore phase is equal to φ m x moreover the following definition describes the auto correlation function 5 s 2 m x x x r p r o b a b i l i t y x p o r e s p a c e x r p o r e s p a c e the normalized auto correlation function or filter function s2 m r is computed from the 2d slice then it is converted to the 3d format considering r x 2 y 2 z 2 the following equation shows the calculation of f in the 3d format 6 f r f x y z s 2 m r s 2 m r s 2 m 0 2 s 2 m 0 s 2 m 0 2 the functional behavior of the auto correlation is dependent on the pore space configuration or isotropy anisotropy of the porous media and it provides information such as correlation length average pore and grain chord length the correlation length of system is when the auto correlation function becomes asymptotic the correlation length impacts directly on long range connectivity of pore spaces the derivative of function at origin point s 2 0 is a representation of average chord length of pore spaces and can represents the short and long range connectivity fig 2 therefore it is expected that the filtration of a noisy structure results in immature pre conditioner data which contains the key elements of the statistical information further discussion about the average chord length is provided in the results and discussion in a reconstruction process of pre conditioner data a random gaussian field n is created with variance of 1 and mean of 0 through the box muller method law et al 2000 let n x y z be a completely uncorrelated and noisy gaussian distributed structure for each point within n we define a neighboring domain x r y s z t and then directly convolve it with the normalized auto correlation function f r s t using 7 s r x y z r 0 d s 0 d t 0 d n x r y s z t f r s t in convolution each element of this function is convolved into the matrix n r s t are indices of f the 3d auto correlation matrix in this research the size of d is practically calculated from the half of a weighted average of the correlation length and average chord length 8 d 1 2 α a v e r a g e c h o r d l e n g t h 1 α c o r r e l a t i o n l e n g t h a visual demonstration of convolution procedure is in fig 3 after extraction of the filter function from 2d training data the convolution process of eq 7 calculates the pre conditioner matrix of sr this nonlinear filter or convolution exposes the media continuity along the z direction fig 4 shows the structure continuity of pre conditional data for three layers with spacing of 2 therefore the statistical pre processed data is generated through the filtration of original noisy random structure noisy immature structure using the 3d auto correlation function then the output of convolution is directly passed through a trained deep learning box introduced below as an st cgan package 2 2 st cgan architecture as mentioned before the 3d noisy image n x y z should be convolved into a desired size with a normalized 3d statistical function f x y z to give a pre conditioner or semi reconstructed realization then to generate more realistic structures the resultant matrix should be optimized using other morphological functions or conditioned and filtered for noise removal to depict a more reliable texture both convolution and optimization approaches are often time consuming and in the case of heterogeneous samples may show meaningless and very unstable results to overcome this challenge we use the power of cgan the coupled statistical and cgan can learn the detailed features within the 2d porous texture and reproduce equivalent 3d realizations the overall workflow of st cgan is introduced in pseudo code in table 1 the idea novelty and the steps need to be taken are the goal is to reconstruct 3d realizations from the 2d inputs the statistical approach extracts a feature based latent vector from the 2d image the feature based latent vector is convolved in a noisy immature structure the statistical pre processed data is a set of stacked 2d matrices representing as the external conditioning data cgan reproduces 2d images based on two inputs 1 a latent random data and 2 the stacked 2d conditional data as the adjustment data cgan translates the immature statistical outputs to the realistic porous media as the target the optimization is conducted through the adversarial loss function within the generator generated realizations are stacked together to reproduce the 3d image the statistical approach can only generate images as large as the input training size however benefiting from the proposed hybrid scheme larger scale 3d realizations can be reconstructed and the trained model is able to capture the short and long range connectivity the fundamental assumptions of statistical approaches recommend them for application in homogenous samples however the st cgan empowers the statistical framework to reproduce the underlying heterogeneity and so makes it suitable for heterogeneous samples fig 5 schematically provides an overview about the proposed framework which utilized a coupled version of statistical function and deep learning generation for reconstruction of 3d porous structures originally the cgan is unable to reproduce 3d structure from 2d input however the statistical section provides a 3d correlated structure which is necessary to generate 3d realizations each slice is fed into the cgan to capture the model homogeneity heterogeneity based on the trained model as we use data distribution in the cgan it can generate more realistic multi scale porous media images through the st cgan there is no need to have a 3d dataset and by using cgan there is no need for optimization of the mjqa approach shams et al 2020 valsecchi et al 2020 therefore the st cgan can reconstruct 3d images efficiently the first step in st cgan is introducing the 2d training images into the statistical approach then the immature 2d representatives enters the cgan the cgan learns a loss function that labels the real and fictitious images while concurrently trains a generative network to minimize the loss the detailed idea for proposing a loss function and its optimization is described in section 2 3 in this section the cgan architecture including the layer types numbers and functions are presented in detail both the generator g and discriminator d are composed of various forms of convolutional batch normalization batchnorm and nonlinear activation relu layers the network architecture is described in isola et al 2017 the discriminator or d is designed to give a probability that the output of g is real or fake however the role of g is to generate images similar to real ones to fool d into believing that the generated images are real the d network or classifier is structured based on 5 convolutional layers followed by leaky relu lrelu activations and batchnorms to access the output of d as a probability and indicator for similarity the blocks in the structure of d are finished with sigmoid functions in d the real data is labeled 1 and the fake data labeled as 0 in a trained model with a powerful g both data types are labeled as 0 5 in contrast to the conventional gans the g in cgan has a more complicated structure the g network is a kind of u net networks containing convolutional and deconvolutional layers u nets are well known for their general shape of the u through symmetric down sampling and up sampling sections multi scale feature extractor fewer effective parameters and good performance in image to image translations isola et al 2017 starting from a 64 64 image the image is down sampled convoluted or encoded step by step with a factor of 2 to a 1 1 code within encoder and then in reverse up sampled or decoded into a 64 64 sample with a factor of 2 through decoder section progressively in addition for noise injection into the generator we concatenated latent noise into the first layer of encoder regarding the factor 2 both encoder and decoder networks contain 6 layers each layer has a convolutional a relu and a batchnorm table 2 provides detailed information about the generator and discriminator in the proposed framework for samples of size 64 64 2 3 loss function the nature of cgan is adversarial so both of the g and d should be optimized simultaneously till they reach to equilibrium and g fools the d by generating realistic data the loss consists of two main sections the discriminator loss and generator loss the discriminator loss is based on ocgan however the generator loss needs revision the generator loss function in the form of a weighted sum of two losses measures the quality of generated representatives through the following equation 9 l g cgan l g γ l m where γ is the hyper parameter the first loss lg is defined as e x p data x z p z z log 1 d x g x z and measures the similarity of reconstructed images and the targets distinguished by d the second one lm is the analogy between fake images generated by the g and the conditional data through the x g x z 1 after network training and optimization the d is skipped and the g is used to reconstitute image data similar to the target 2 4 evaluation criteria to evaluate and verify the reconstruction performance of the hybrid scheme developed here both visual inspection and quantitative comparison are used in terms of quantitative comparison the characterization parameters such as morphological spatial or dynamical properties were used in this research the porosity is often used as the simplest and basic morphological property representing the storage capacity of a rock sample the auto correlation function is a second order morphological property used to evaluate the statistical features of the reconstruction process the geometrically related properties for pores and throats such as their numbers size shape factor and volume are extracted based on the maximal ball algorithm dong and blunt 2009 permeability i e absolute permeability which describes the rock ability to pass the single phase fluid is used as a dynamical measure to assess the quality of the reconstructed model the permeability is calculated through solving the stokes equations conservations of mass and momentum assuming that the fluid is incompressible and inertial forces are small mostaghimi et al 2013 sadeghnejad et al 2021 2 5 database to perform model training and testing we choose two 3d samples in the literature table 3 one relatively homogenous sample i e berea sandstone and one heterogeneous sample i e estaillades carbonate mosser et al 2017 muljadi et al 2016 the samples selected help us to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our framework the first is berea sandstone with image size of 400 400 400 voxels and voxel size of 3 µm the second image is a 500 500 500 estaillades carbonate imaged with voxel size of 3 3113 µm reported from the x ray imaging facility at imperial college london mosser et al 2017 muljadi et al 2016 fig 6 illustrates these samples to prepare the training and testing images we extract sub slice 2d and sub volume 3d images respectively the cgan section of the st cgan architecture needs training on samples available in the database in order to do that we train the model on stacks of 2d layers from the 3d images therefore the network training was conducted on 2d images and the testing was done on 3d sub volumes the procedure outlined in table 4 describes the training process the selection of proper sub sample sizes is directly related to the pore and grain configuration the proper sizing captures the local interaction of grains so it is a dependent parameter to the texture of each sample table 5 describes the total numbers sizes and spacing stride window for both berea and estaillades samples after training with a batch of 2d slices in the testing procedure a single 2d slice of 3d sub volume was passed to the st cgan and the resultant 3d image was compared to the original sub volume images using the evaluation criteria mentioned above during testing we have used about 30 of the 3d sub volume samples for model evaluation practically a 2d slice with statistical information similar to the 3d testing image results better matching to assess the framework capability in reconstruction of limited data such as thin section samples in addition to berea sandstone and estaillades carbonate four thin samples extracted from iranian oil fields have been selected fig 7 shams et al 2020 we can capture high resolution images from thin sections with commonly available instruments all samples are 2d thin sections with 264 264 pixels and with a resolution of 20 µm shams et al 2020 their analysis is conducted in section 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 network stability and optimization the challenges during the network training and comparison of run times for both statistical and deep methods are described here as mentioned before statistical methods usually do not capture the correct long range connectivity and also the reconstruction is very expensive so the simulation process should be usually truncated while the error is high in addition previous research has confirmed that it is challenging to converge to a stable formation in conventional gans since the problem is a nash equilibrium zhang et al 2021 the aim of modified gan based approaches is to overcome with collapse and convergence difficulties during the training phase resolving the deficiencies of conventional gans results in better sample qualities another issue with conventional gans raised from the optimization and selection of best hyper parameters several researchers discuss this problems and mentioned that the conditional gans can be used as an alternative barnett 2018 cheng et al 2020 kodali et al 2017 rabbani et al 2021 salimans et al 2016 however in our proposed st cgan there is no simulation and matching process in the statistical section and during the training in cgan the observation data provides the network with a blur immature texture this immature texture aids network stability and convergence because it plays a role similar to a map γ eq 9 the weight on lm controls the impact of observation data and in this work it is empirically set to 12 and 10 for homogenous and heterogeneous reconstructions respectively by manual manipulation of γ we can explore the results of each reconstruction it has an impact over the backbone structure king and masihi 2018 or the main local points of the porous texture furthermore in conventional gan the training is 3d to 3d and although that it is expected to give better results with increasing iterations the training shows an unstable behavior however in st cgan we observed a better convergence and the reconstruction quality was improved through increasing of iteration numbers as emphasized in other work mosser et al 2017 shams et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in addition we practically consider α 0 6 and 0 85 for homogenous and heterogeneous reconstructions respectively eq 9 this assignment is in agreement with the fact that in homogenous samples the range of average chord length is small the training process of the current study in a gpu system is optimized using a gradient descent based optimizer adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0 0002 which is gradually decreased to reach a stable training besides the reconstruction quality of st cgan which will be discussed later the reconstruction speed of mjqa takes approximately two hours to generate one realization however once trained the st cgan is able to generate 3d images in just less than a second various python libraries are developed and used for coding of different section of st cgan including numpy cv2 pandas argparse hdf5 pil itertools pyimsl matplotlib pytorch torch and tensorflow 3 2 homogenous media berea sandstone reconstruction berea as a fluvial sandstone has a homogenous texture the detailed description of image and the training testing data are presented in section 2 6 fig 8 shows the visual comparison of original sample and the generated realization from st cgan a conventional gan similar to the work conducted by mosser et al 2017 and shams et al 2020 and mjqa the detailed procedure is disccused in appendix a in both 2d and 3d for image sizes of 4002 and 4003 respectively visual inspection expresses the close agreement between the original samples and st cgan findings in contrast although mjqa generates pores in similar size and spacing it does not properly capture the pore shapes images with a size of 64 are selected for training however st cgan can produce larger images when a larger noise is introduced into the trained generator gan based models are capable of reproducing larger images when larger latent spaces are introduced goodfellow et al 2014 mosser et al 2017 shams et al 2020 the comparison between auto correlation functions for reconstructed samples and the original is presented in fig 9 the matching between the empirical behavior and the auto correlation of synthetic realizations obtained by st cgan confirms the observations of the visual inspection however the reconstruction quality of the mjqa method is questionable since in the tail part of the auto correlation function we observe several deviations from the original fig 10 compares the calculated porosity and permeability of the generated samples which confirm the model capability to capture the similar range although mjqa covers a good range in porosity it underestimates the permeability since it does not capture long range connectivity table 6 presents the important parameters of the extracted networks from the original sample and the reconstructed model and highlights the capability of st cgan to reconstruct images that capture both short and long range connectivity overall the new method produces images of similar quality to 3d to 3d reconstructions using gans having shown the ability of the proposed st cgan in homogenous samples we can train and find the model capability in heterogeneous samples 3 3 heterogeneous media estaillades carbonate reconstruction there are three main differences in the handling of heterogeneous samples first the proposed statistical approach used a value of d based on a weighted average of correlation length and average chord length eq 8 this value is significantly different based on our experiments over samples available in database second the size of training sample for heterogeneous sample is 1282 which could capture model heterogeneity based on the pore space configuration third the hyper parameter γ is different for homogenous and heterogeneous media this value controls the impact of observation data in loss function eq 9 in contrast to berea sandstone a larger sample size was used for the training of estaillades carbonate as the size of the structuring components was larger this idea was confirmed during training efforts with various sizes visual inspection of fig 11 demonstrates the ability of st cgan to reconstruct heterogeneous textures indeed the reconstructions are more realistic than from a 3d gan this can also be confirmed by comparison of auto correlation decline presented in fig 12 the exponential decline behavior of the auto correlation function in the original and st cgan reconstructions shows a similar trend however the mjqa failed to sufficiently capture the long and short range correlations the deviation is more severe at shorter lags which is highlighted within ellipsoidal dashed line the derivative of the auto correlation function at the origin s 2 0 is an average chord length of pores and an average chord length of grains through the following equations 10 l pore φ s 2 0 11 l grain 1 φ s 2 0 the cord length for pore phase can be visually read from the intersection of the derivative line and the x axis parameters a and b shown in fig 12 the comparison between the pore chord lengths shows that the st cgan reproduces the porous structure of heterogeneous estaillades much better in comparison with the mjqa and is even superior to 3d gans furthermore fig 13 compares the auto correlation in x y and z directions and shows good much in all directions to clarify the importance of chord lengths fig 14 depicts the pore spaces of 1003 sub volumes and demonstrates that the pore structure of the original samples can be reproduced with st cgan while conserving the connectivity as a summary the estaillades carbonate is a non stationary and heterogeneous complex medium and it is difficult for platforms such as gan to reconstruct with reasonable accuracy in conventional platforms the reconstruction quality is severely related to the size of the training sample which faces the reconstruction problems such as memory requirements liu et al 2019 the proposed st cgan is capable to resolve problems with conventional gans and statistical approaches feng et al 2018b shams et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 to reconstitute reliable realizations of heterogeneous media fig 15 depicts the porosity and permeability values which confirms that the st cgan captures the short and long range connectivity similar to berea sandstone the average values for pore network parameters are presented in table 7 which confirms that the model works well in addition this investigation shows that the 3d gan generated realizations are poorer in terms of structure and predicted permeability compared to our hybrid approach the visual inspection and properties comparison i e statistical or dynamical properties of both berea and estaillades confirm the potential of our model to reconstruct representative 3d porous media from 2d images within a reasonable time in comparison to other methods the model training and testing is conducted over a system with a nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ti gpu 11gb of vram and an i7 5820 k 3 3 ghz cpu 32gb memory the comparison between reconstruction times of st cgan a 3d gan mjqa and the hybrid deep model proposed by zhang et al 2021 are presented in table 8 however our proposed hybrid framework has some limitations one of them is in case of multi scale porous media images the model is unable to capture multi scale information and to resolve this we need further post processing steps in addition another limitation of st cgan is for training images containing large scale heterogeneity since the sample heterogeneity may not be available in the training image 3 4 thin section reconstruction here we evaluate the model capability through reconstruction of 3d images from 2d thin sections from a producing oilfield the selected samples have been passed through the st cgan framework and then the reconstructed microstructures are evaluated since the permeability of thin section samples are not available the quality checking of reconstructed samples has been conducted through visual inspection and the auto correlation function fig 16 a visually presents the reconstructed microstructures visual inspection confirms the similar trend between the reconstructed and the original data as in fig 7 in addition fig 16b depicts the calculated auto correlation of reconstructions and demonstrates a similar spatial distribution over the auto correlation function of original samples therefore the reconstructed media appear to be suitable for flow simulation and estimation of physical properties 4 conclusions and recommendations this paper has proposed a novel hybrid method to reconstruct three dimensional porous media from a single two dimensional image the proposed framework used the correlative nature of a well known statistical methodology and the generative power of conditional generative adversarial neural networks the introduction of two dimensional images of porous media into the statistical motor results in immature pre processed data which helps the unsupervised learning of the deep learning motor the pre processed data acts as the guiding map and aids the generator in three dimensional reconstruction the model training needs a large computational effort and network adjustment however once the model is trained the model is able to reconstruct realizations matching the key statistical characteristics and physical parameters of target porous media within a few seconds to validate the approach we examined the methodology on berea sandstone as a homogenous sample and estaillades carbonate as a heterogeneous exemplar and four 2d thin sections from reservoir rocks the results revealed more than 95 matching between the auto correlation function of the target and reconstructed realizations in all samples the matching between pore network parameters in reconstructed and real data shows average absolute relative error of 2 3 and 6 0 in berea sandstone and estaillades carbonate respectively the applications of the proposed framework may be extended for reconstruction of 2d and 3d realizations from samples with sub micron pores limited information or multi scale samples also further manipulation of the statistical functions and the integration with cgan may help in reconstitution of multi scale porous media image manipulation by user constraints will help researchers incorporate large scale heterogeneities which are often missed from reconstruction through other approaches credit authorship contribution statement reza shams conceptualization

231,the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q relates the spatial averages of flux and head gradient in a block of heterogeneous media in this article we study the influence of connectivity on k e q of media samples composed of a high conductivity k and a low conductivity k facies the k facies is characterized by a proportion p and also by two connectivity parameters a connectivity structure type no low intermediate high and a correlation integral scale l c the probability distribution of k e q and the critical value of p at which percolation occurs p a v are studied as a function of these connectivity parameters the distribution of log k e q is gaussian in all cases so the results are presented in terms of the geometric mean k e q and the variance σ log k e q 2 both quantities show a data collapse if expressed as a function of p p a v for the variance σ log k e q 2 notably even if 2d and 3d data are plotted together in 3d when a connectivity structure exists k e q is always greater than when no structure exists and increases while p a v decreases as l c increases the same is observed in 2d except for the low connectivity structure type i e when the k facies is disconnected that shows an unprecedented behaviour k e q is greater in the absence of structure and decreases p a v increases as l c increases our results show that any influence of connectivity on k e q is well accounted for simply by a shift in the percolation threshold p a v and then suggest that k e q is controlled mainly by the proximity to percolation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords percolation up scaling binary media stochastic 1 introduction 1 1 equivalent conductivity and connectivity achieving a precise description of the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q of heterogeneous media is of great interest in several subsurface related disciplines such as ground water management waste disposal co2 storage and hydrocarbon applications the homogenization procedure that makes it possible to derive a representative k e q value over a certain block from the point conductivity values k r is termed upscaling the equivalent conductivity k e q tends to the effective conductivity k e f f as the size of the block tends to infinity dagan et al 2013 frequently the scarcity of field data in subsurface related applications is mitigated by the use of a geostatistical stochastic approach gelhar 1986 linde et al 2015 godoy et al 2018 in this approach uncertainty is addressed by generating independent realizations of a sample of a subsurface formation for simplicity let s consider a sample of linear size l and volume l d where d is the space dimensionality the point conductivity k r is defined over a regular cartesian grid of linear cell size δ in each sample k r is considered to be a random process characterized by a probability density function p k r and the spatial variation of k r is defined by a covariance function with a certain integral length scale l c eventually the realizations can be conditioned with the available field data for lognormal media the mean and variance of p k r may suffice to determine k e q with a small influence of the type of covariance function in 3d de wit 1995 however in certain scenarios for example if tortuous channels are present it has been shown western et al 2001 that additional information regarding the spatial organization of k r is required this motivated an important number of studies that explored connectivity as the source of such information in a first group of studies zinn and harvey 2003 and later jankovic et al 2017 modified multigaussian continuous fields for which intermediate k r classes are naturally connected while the extreme k r classes are disconnected by applying a normal score transform to swap the intermediate k r classes with the high or the low ones this made it possible to increase or reduce the connectivity of the high k r classes without changing p k r or the spatial covariance function of k r in these studies connectivity was explored through different configurations arising from the reorganization of the k r classes and through the covariance function it was shown that the ratio between the k e q of the connected structure to that of the disconnected one can notably reach a value of 10 in 2d while it decreases to 2 2 in 3d both for high variances this shows the strong effect of dimensionality in a second group other authors evaluated new ways to describe and measure connectivity or analyzed how connectivity metrics are correlated to k e q some of them studied continuous k r fields masihi et al 2016 tyukhova and willmann 2016 while others considered multi facies media with a discrete distribution of k r values nurafza et al 2006 fleckenstein and fogg 2008 vassena et al 2010 rongier et al 2016 in all cases it is concluded that measuring the connectivity of the high k r classes is crucial to assess groundwater flow 1 2 upscaling and percolation in binary media a binary medium knudby et al 2006 king et al 2001 has a proportion p of a high conductivity facies k r k constant and a proportion 1 p of a low conductivity facies k r k constant it is a simplified representation of multi facies media that makes it possible to retain salient geometrical heterogeneity features hunt and idriss 2009 zarlenga and fiori 2015 while rendering the parameter space more tractable nevertheless binary media may accurately model natural formations guin and ritzi 2008 for example in sandstone shale or sand clay mixtures their study constitutes a gateway to understand the percolative behaviour of k e q in multi facies models regarding their flow properties a distinctive feature is a sharp increase of k e q when p overcomes the percolation threshold p c i e when it appears a spanning cluster in the k facies a k cluster connecting the sample along the mean flow direction hunt and idriss 2009 analytical methods to estimate k e q in binary media were developed in general on the basis of effective medium theory and perturbation methods maxwell 1873 dagan 1989 pozdniakov and tsang 2004 hashin and shtrikman 1962 showed that for binary isotropic media and without taking into account the spatial organization of the facies k e q lies in a bounded range narrower than the one set by the arithmetic and harmonic averages wiener 1912 bernabé et al 2004 provided a simple model for statistical isotropic and infinite media that enables the estimation of k e q in the framework of percolation theory in this model for p p c the media is assumed to be composed by isolated inclusions of the k facies randomly distributed in a matrix of the k facies so k e q is estimated as the hashin shtrikman lower bound eq 1 1 k e q k p 1 k k 1 p 3 k p p c for p p c k e q is mainly controlled by the proportion p of the volume of the spanning cluster with p p to the total sample volume in this case the media is considered as formed by two facies k with proportion p and a second fictitious one with characteristic conductivity k m k k m k and proportion 1 p the latter is a mixture arising from the combination of the k facies and the component of the k facies that don t belong to the spanning cluster the conductivity k m is obtained with eq 1 but using p p 1 p as the relative proportion of the k facies in the mixture an estimation of p can be obtained using the power law in p p c from percolation theory stauffer and aharony 1994 finally k e q is computed using the hashin shtrikman upper bound as eq 2 2 k e q k 1 p 1 k m k p 3 k p p c later oriani and renard 2014 improved the model of bernabé et al 2004 by characterizing the spanning cluster via image analysis and correcting the value of p using the convex hull of the clusters this model drops the statistical isotropy requirement and has no size restrictions resulting in a more accurate estimation but is more expensive in terms of computing time especially in 3d as explained above as many flow features are determined by the connectivity of the k facies nurafza et al 2006 a percolative analysis is of interest for accurate flow modelling and k e q estimation in this regard we highlight three important issues 1 the existence of a spatial correlation of k r characterized by the integral scale l c affects the connectivity as it modifies the size of the k clusters previous works harter 2005 guin and ritzi 2008 have shown that an increase of l c leads to a decrease of p c also we recall that keeping all other variables constant an increase of l c typically implies an increase of k e q paleologos et al 1996 boschan and noetinger 2012 2 percolation thresholds vary significantly between 2d and 3d also in 2d isotropic binary media only one percolating facies can exist while this restriction does not exist in 3d neuweiler and vogel 2007 zarlenga et al 2018 it becomes evident that dimensionality will strongly affect any connectivity characterization moreover several connectivity indicators are borrowed from percolation theory stauffer and aharony 1994 hunt 1998 renard and allard 2013 3 due to the finite size of the media samples finite size scaling affects the percolation transition king et al 1999 the critical value of p for which percolation occurs for a sample of linear size l here termed p a v tends to p c as l also k 0 in contrast with formal percolation theory for which k 0 these finite effects may influence k e q differently for 2d than for 3d these facts demonstrate that analyzing connectivity features in 2d and 3d at the same time is important to gain understanding on how connectivity indicators can be used to predict k e q 1 3 k e q distributions in the stochastic approach mentioned in section 1 1 the relative frequency of k e q values in the ensemble of realizations defines a probability distribution i e p k e q fenton and griffiths 1993 sanchez vila et al 2006 this distribution is often represented by its mean value k e q the first gaussian moment knudby et al 2006 oriani and renard 2014 liao et al 2019 and by its variance σ log k e q 2 the second gaussian moment particularly for multigaussian media dykaar and kitanidis 1992 attinger 2003 in the case of binary media as p approaches p c p k e q may undergo a transition from unimodal to bimodal with two well defined modal k e q values see fig 6 in boschan and noetinger 2012 the probability distribution widens and some values of k e q between the modes may have negligible relative frequency a gap appears in p k e q in those cases it is necessary to carefully evaluate if p k e q is appropriately described by only k e q and eventually by σ log k e q 2 also depicting the shape of p k e q is then of key importance to gain conceptual understanding of the underlying flow situation particularly on the onset of a percolative behaviour with direct impact in uncertainty management applications moreover the influence of connectivity on p k e q becomes of interest and to our knowledge has not yet been addressed in the literature 1 4 objectives the objective of this paper is to analyze the interplay among connectivity percolation and p k e q of saturated isotropic binary media we have decided to carry out the study both in 2d and 3d aiming to provide a better understanding of the subtle extrapolation from 2d to 3d and also to obtain insight over the potentially complex behaviour of p k e q in 3d to this end we have constructed random binary media samples with no low intermediate or high connectivity structure type in a binary media version of the procedure followed by previous authors zinn and harvey 2003 jankovic et al 2017 zarlenga et al 2018 using continuous k r fields the use of binary media makes it possible to analyze how connectivity influences k e q from the point of view of percolation we intend to portray here a wide range of connectivity scenarios connectivity was varied explicitly by changing the connectivity structure type and the integral scale l c these are the connectivity parameters that control the spatial organization of the k facies but also implicitly by varying the proportion p of the k facies media samples with l c 0 are used to represent the lack of structure in section 2 we present the numerical methodology employed to construct the binary samples fft ma generator le ravalec et al 2000 to use cluster analysis to determine the percolation threshold p c connect3d pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2003 and to compute k e q modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the results are presented in section 3 where we first examine the distributions p k e q for the different connectivity structure types then the behaviour of the first two gaussian moments of p k e q the mean k e q and the variance σ log k e q 2 is studied as a function of p l c and the connectivity structure type later it is shown that the influence of l c and of the connectivity structure type on k e q and σ log k e q 2 is well accounted for simply by a shift in the percolation threshold p a v finally we present a final discussion and outline the perspectives for future work 2 numerical methodology the first step described in section 2 1 of our stochastic approach consisted in generating square 2d or cubic 3d binary media samples the k facies of the samples are characterized by three parameters a connectivity structure type no low intermediate high an integral scale l c and a proportion p then k r was upscaled from the fine scale δ to the scale l of the sample size which is constant in this work obtaining one k e q value for each realization section 2 2 finally we have used a cluster identification function to estimate p a v for each value of l c and each connectivity structure type section 2 3 2 1 generation of binary fields with different connectivity structure types the binary media samples were obtained by the following procedure a generation of multigaussian media samples with a standard normal distribution of an intermediate indicator k i r using an isotropic exponential covariance function these will be referred to as underlying multigaussian media samples as explained in section 1 1 for these intermediate k i r classes form a connected matrix while the extreme k i r classes form a disconnected matrix random field generation was performed using a fast fourier transform fft moving average fft ma method le ravalec et al 2000 b binarization by truncation mapping the k i r point values from the multigaussian samples onto k or k point values in the target binary samples the truncation schemes shown in fig 1 were used to generate binary media samples with high intermediate or low connectivity structure types fig 2 for the high connectivity structure type when the proportion p is small the connected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample this is the intermediate k i r classes for which the indicator takes values close to zero becomes the k facies after binarization but as p increases also the disconnected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample the extreme k i r classes gradually becomes part of the k facies of the binary samples this is illustrated in fig 3 where binary media samples of the high connectivity structure type are shown for different values of p for the low connectivity structure type when the proportion p is small the connected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample becomes the k facies in the binary samples and the disconnected matrix becomes the k facies but as p increases the disconnected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample also becomes gradually part of the k facies in the binary samples the intermediate connectivity structure type is obtained by performing a standard truncation over the multigaussian samples allard 1993 these truncation procedures are depicted in fig 1 depending on the connectivity structure type one or two equal but with opposite signs cutoff indicator values are required to control the proportion p of the k facies in the binary samples fig 2 shows examples of the resulting binary media in 2d top p 0 5 and 3d bottom p 0 4 a sample with a high low connectivity structure type is constituted by blobs of the k k facies embedded in a k k matrix for the intermediate connectivity structure type neither of the facies embeds the other we have verified that the binarization procedure described in step b maintains the exponential nature of the covariance function while l c changes depending on the value of p and on the connectivity structure type the exponential covariance is defined in eq 3 where h is the lag or distance between two points l c is the correlation integral scale and c 0 is the variance of p k r 3 c h c 0 exp 3 h l c for the intermediate connectivity structure type an analytical relation between the integral scales of the gaussian and of the binary media can be found in mariethoz and caers 2014 we are not aware of an analogous formula for the high and low connectivity structure types because of this and to compare binary media with the same covariance function but different connectivity structure types it was necessary to map the value of l c of the multigaussian samples onto that of the binarized ones the relation between covariances before and after binarization is depicted in fig 4 for the 2d case where the covariance function for the three connectivity structure types for p 0 4 are shown along with the ones of the underlying gaussian samples note that the value of l c of the multigaussian sample required to obtain a given l c of the binarized one depends on the connectivity structure type spatially uncorrelated media samples l c 0 001 δ were used as a reference of media with no connectivity structure i e at the scale of the sample size note that media samples of the three connectivity structure types defined above should statistically coincide as l c 0 converging to this reference uncorrelated case also due to the small l c l ratio it is reasonable to assume that the ergodic hypothesis holds aiming to study the percolation transition in detail we have explored 20 values of p in the ranges 0 4 0 8 for 2d and 0 1 0 5 for 3d having in mind that the theoretical values for media with negligible integral scale l c 0 verified in this work are 0 593 in 2d and 0 312 in 3d site percolation we remark that the sample construction procedure presented here is analogous to the technique conceived by zinn and harvey 2003 in that it makes it possible to control the spatial organization of the high k r classes while leaving the other parameters unchanged the contrast between the characteristic conductivity values for the high and low conductivity facies is 10 4 k 100 m d a y k 0 01 m d a y this choice is in line with the proposed percolative approach in the following it will be assumed that k e q is made dimensionless by a factor of 1 m d a y the sample sizes are l 512 δ and l 64 δ for 2d and 3d respectively and the values of l c are 2 δ and 3 δ for 2d and 1 5 δ and 2 δ for 3d this choice aimed to equate the statistical sampling between 2d and 3d by matching the number of independent heterogeneity units that can be estimated as l c l d boschan and noetinger 2012 in table 1 the main parameters and variables are presented to study k e q and σ log k e q 2 section 3 2 we have performed 1000 realizations for each set of parameters p l c connectivity structure type while 5000 realizations were performed to achieve a satisfactory resolution for p k e q 2 2 computation of k e q the effective conductivity was computed in the square or cubic domain according to the classic permeameter definition in this approach a hydraulic gradient is imposed between inlet h i n and outlet h o u t faces dirichlet boundary conditions while other boundaries are impervious neumann boundary conditions the flow simulations were performed using modflow 2005 1 1 https water usgs gov ogw modflow mf2005 html software harbaugh 2005 that applies the finite difference method to discretize the laplace equation in this scheme the nodes are located at the center of each square or cubic cell and flow takes place only between adjacent faces the harmonic mean approximation was used to compute the transmisibilities between adjacent cells romeu and noetinger 1995 1 d flow approximation the pcg preconditioned conjugate gradient was chosen to solve the resulting linear system once the flow is solved we obtain k e q in the mean flow direction as 4 k e q q l h i n h o u t where q is the average velocity of the flow through a plane perpendicular to the imposed hydraulic gradient h i n h o u t l we mention that the samples used in the present study are isotropic as an ensemble despite the possible statistical fluctuations among individual realizations the equivalent conductivity k e q can then be well described by using a scalar 2 3 cluster analysis and percolation threshold two cells were considered as connected only if they shared a face consistently with the 1 d flow approximation used to compute k e q the connect3d code pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2003 was used to identify and label the k clusters in each realization i e obtaining a cluster identification function the code outputs a connectivity metric n p that takes unity value if there exists at least one k spanning cluster connecting the inlet and outlet faces of the sample and zero otherwise i e it measures connectivity in the mean flow direction from now on realizations for which n p 1 will be referred to as percolating realizations while those for which n p 0 as non percolating realizations taking into account the stochastic approach the ensemble mean n p measures frequency of occurrence of percolation moreover for each connectivity structure type and l c the value of p for which n p 0 5 harter 2005 this is when exactly half of the realizations percolate was obtained by performing an iterative search in the following this critical p value will be referred to as p a v an average percolation threshold it should not be considered a connectivity indicator because it cannot be directly measured for any given media sample but as it is determined by analyzing n p which is indeed a connectivity indicator renard and allard 2013 it provides useful connectivity information in the percolation framework the term p c will refer to the percolation threshold of infinite media in appendix a the dependence of p a v with the domain size l and its convergence to p c as l are analyzed the use of the indicator n p made it possible to obtain p k e q separately for the ensembles of percolating and non percolating realizations on the other hand for each realization the relative proportion p of the spanning cluster was explicitly calculated and then used in the equations proposed by bernabé eqs 1 and 2 to estimate k e q 3 results and discussion as discussed in section 1 3 in certain scenarios particularly for binary media it is necessary to assess if k e q and σ log k e q 2 suffice to provide an accurate description of p k e q in this regard we first examine p k e q analyzing briefly the influence of the connectivity structure type on it secondly we study the k e q and σ log k e q 2 as a function of p with the connectivity structure type and l c as parameters finally we analyze how p a v reflects the influence of these parameters on k e q 3 1 analysis of the distribution p k e q for ease of visualization and characterization of the distributions we ll present results in terms of p log k e q figure 5 shows the latter for 2d p 0 566 l c 0 001 δ and l c 2 δ and 3d p 0 247 l c 0 001 δ and l c 1 5 δ the values of p are chosen so that both in 2d and 3d n p equals 0 5 for the intermediate connectivity structure type this is just at percolation with p p a v it is observed that in all cases p log k e q can be fitted satisfactorily by a gaussian function suggesting a lognormal distribution of k e q when p 0 or p 1 the media are homogeneous and log k e q is equal to log k or log k respectively in 2d n p 1 and n p 0 for the high and low connectivity structure types respectively in 3d n p 0 8 and n p 0 1 for the high and low connectivity structure types respectively for both 2d and 3d n p 0 for the no structure case l c 0 001 δ the distributions of percolating and non percolating realizations are shown separately for the intermediate connectivity structure type note that there are a number of non percolating realizations with greater k e q values than those of percolating ones with a considerable overlap between both distributions in other words all parameters kept constant the occurrence of percolation does not imply a higher k e q as discussed in colecchio et al 2020 for binary media p k e q typically undergoes an homogenization from bimodal to unimodal as the linear size of the sample l increases as p approaches p a v the value of l required to achieve such homogenization increases we have verified that the distribution p k e q is unimodal for all the values of p and l c studied in this work notably even at p p a v implying that for the chosen sample size l the above mentioned homogenization is attained comparing the results in terms of the connectivity structure types in 2d the distributions p k e q for l c 2 δ are clearly separated but there is an overlap between p k e q of the low connectivity structure type and that of the no structure l c 0 001 δ in 3d the distributions for l c 1 5 δ are closer to each other and an overlap does exist between the high connectivity structure type and the intermediate one note that the probability distributions for the no structure case and the low connectivity structure case invert their relative positions in 2d with respect to 3d 3 2 analysis of the first two gaussian moments the mean k e q and the variance σ log k e q 2 figure 6 shows the variation of the geometric mean of k e q noted k e q as a function of p as p approaches the percolation transition there is a sharp increase of k e q hunt and sahimi 2017 however this increase is smeared out due to the finite effects mentioned in section 1 2 in the percolation region k e q depends strongly on the connectivity structure type as an example in 2d the values of k e q for the high connectivity structure type can be 30 times greater than those for the low connectivity structure type in 3d this ratio reaches a value of 5 these results can be compared with similar ones for lognormal media 10 for 2d zinn and harvey 2003 2 2 for 3d jankovic et al 2017 the difference among the values of k e q for the different connectivity structure types is smaller for the lower l c 2 δ in 2d and 1 5 δ in 3d on the other hand k e q increases as l c increases in all cases except notably for the low connectivity structure type in 2d for which it decreases this may be due to a more efficient isolation of the k clusters or in terms of the flow structure and given the imposed boundary conditions to a higher fraction of the flow paths being affected by head losses involving greater energy dissipation a more detailed discussion is presented at the summary section 4 the increase of k e q with l c was observed in previous works paleologos et al 1996 boschan and noetinger 2012 and may be related to the dependence of p a v with l c harter 2005 which will be discussed in the next section fig 7 shows the variance σ log k e q 2 normalized by the variance of k r σ log k 2 as a function of p a bell like shape is always observed the maxima are located at different values of p note that the maximum for l c 0 001 δ is located at 0 593 in 2d and at 0 312 in 3d the values of p c for a square 2d or cubic 3d lattice stauffer and aharony 1994 in all cases the variance σ log k e q 2 increases as l c increases boschan and noetinger 2012 note that the maximum of σ log k e q 2 increases with l c but it is similar for the three types of connectivity structures in 2d and rather similar in 3d on the other hand as l c increases the width of the bell increases also the maximum slope of the curves in fig 6 and the position of the maximum in fig 7 are related to the occurrence of percolation boschan and noetinger 2012 3 3 percolation analysis in this section we focus our attention on the percolative behaviour of k e q and its moments analyzing the critical value p a v calculated as described in section 2 3 as a function of the integral scale l c and the connectivity structure type figure 8 shows the fraction of percolating realizations n p as a function of p close to p a v n p increases steeply from 0 to 1 an initial estimation of p a v was obtained from the intersection of the n p curves with the horizontal black line n p 0 5 then by performing an iterative search the value of p a v for each parameter set was obtained figure 9 shows how p a v decreases with l c except for the low connectivity structure type in 2d for which it increases here for the latter case the interpretation of a more efficient isolation of the k clusters as l c increases applies as it did in fig 6 the reader should note that an increase of p a v with l c implies that the percolation transition for the 2d low connectivity structure case will occur at a greater value of p than that for the no structure case this leads to a noticeable result that introducing spatial correlation may involve a decrease of k e q this will be further discussed in section 4 the relationship between p a v and l c shows a rather linear trend for both 2d and 3d as l c decreases the different connectivity structure types converge into a unique uncorrelated structure and p a v tends to the site percolation values for a square 0 593 and cubic 0 312 lattice the range of values of l c studied was extended to l c 6 δ in 2d and to l c 2 5 δ in 3d to verify the trend however we omitted the analysis of k e q for these extended values of l c since in some cases it was difficult to stabilize the statistical properties of the media and the measured l c values differed from the input ones the effect of the fluctuations over the mean values p a v k e q is small but becomes important over the variance σ log k e q 2 on the other hand in appendix a it is shown that the values of p a v presented here agree with those of p c the asymptotic regime towards l being attained figure 10 shows the variation of k e q with p p a v using the values of p a v from fig 9 in this representation a data collapse is observed independently of l c and of the connectivity structure type and both for 2d and 3d this implies that a shift in p a v suffices to account for any influence of these two connectivity parameters on k e q having in mind that the high and low connectivity structure types represent two contrasting connectivity scenarios this result is noteworthy an estimation based on the work of bernabé et al 2004 is shown in dashed line here p is computed explicitly for each realization as described in section 2 3 for the lower part of the curve we take into account only the non percolating realizations using eq 1 likewise for the upper part of the curve we use eq 2 and consider only the percolating realizations the estimation predicts an important gap of k e q values for p close to p a v which is not observed in our simulations in general the agreement is rather poor in that zone especially for the 3d case the difference may arise from the influence of flow dead ends of the spanning cluster which is simplified in the estimation of bernabé et al 2004 figure 11 shows k e q as a function of p p a v using a log log scale for p p a v for comparison the power law derived from percolation theory eq 5 is shown using continuous straight lines with slopes μ 1 3 for 2d and μ 2 for 3d as reported in the literature stauffer and aharony 1994 when these slopes are obtained by linear fitting over our data they yield a mean value of μ 1 33 for 2d and μ 1 9 for 3d with little variation among the different connectivity structure types and l c values 5 k e q p p a v μ regarding the value of k e q at p p a v our results can be contrasted with the finite size scaling predicted for a binary media by efros and shklovskii 1976 eqs 6 and 7 using the values of high k and low k characteristic conductivities employed in our work this prediction yields k e q 1 in 2d and k e q 0 13 in 3d as 6 k e q k k 1 and in 3d 7 k e q k k k 0 72 0 13 on the other hand from fig 6 we obtain k e q 1 in 2d and k e q 0 1 in 3d these results show that k e q follows a percolative behaviour rather independently of the connectivity parameters fig 12 shows σ log k e q 2 scaled by l l c d as a function of p p a v in this representation it can be observed that the maximum of the σ log k e q 2 see fig 7 occurs at p p a v 0 in all cases this result was observed previously by boschan and noetinger 2012 and is related to that of masihi and king 2012 who found that a maximum in the standard deviation of connectivity quantified by the relative volume of the percolating cluster occurred at p c the scaling factor l l c d can be interpreted as the number of the independent heterogeneity units if l l c making it possible to match the statistical sampling between 2d and 3d for the cases with l c 0 001 δ the variance was scaled by l δ d since the number of the independent heterogeneity units equals the number of cells the collapse observed in fig 12 is remarkable taking into account that data for 2d and 3d media are plotted together for all the connectivity structure types and l c values studied 4 summary conclusions and perspectives the main result of this paper is that any influence of the studied connectivity parameters on the mean and the variance of k e q is simply reflected in a shift or displacement in the percolation threshold p a v both in 2d and 3d except for this shift the dependence of those moments with p is almost identical for all the connectivity scenarios investigated and follows the scaling predicted by percolation theory we reformulate here for 2d and 3d binary media and then using a percolative approach the question posed by zarlenga et al 2018 for lognormal continuous media regarding the impact of connectivity for formations sharing the same p k r and covariance in terms of parameters the roles of the connectivity structure type and of the integral scale l c are conceptually similar in both studies with the addition of a no structure case in the present one while the k k ratio in binary media plays the role of the variance for lognormal media however the proportion p is intimately related to a percolative approach having in mind that the analyzed distributions p log k e q are always unimodal and gaussian and then well defined by their mean and variance no information about gaussian moments of higher order is required the result can be extended in a straightforward manner to the distribution p log k e q itself however for smaller sample sizes l p log k e q may become bimodal colecchio et al 2020 with a greater contrast between percolating and non percolating realizations in that case it is not evident if the observed collapse would hold this remains an open issue and shall be addressed in future works on the other hand the validity of the present results for greater sample sizes is analyzed in detail in appendix a there it is shown by extrapolation from a set of smaller subsamples of increasing size that for the sample size used in this work p a v has already attained its asymptotic behaviour l this suggests that the data collapse observed in figs 10 and 12 would hold for largest sample sizes l and in particular for l we now focus our attention on the noticeable behaviour of the low connectivity structure type in 2d for which k e q decreases fig 6 and p a v increases fig 9 as l c increases as opposed to all other cases to our knowledge this behaviour has never been previously observed in the literature where it was always found that the appearance of a spatial correlation implied an increase of k e q paleologos et al 1996 boschan and noetinger 2012 and a decrease of p a v harter 2005 guin and ritzi 2008 this feature may help understanding from the percolation point of view why when comparing media with the same p k r and covariance function but different connectivity structure types a greater contrast of k e q values may exist in 2d than in 3d in the work of zarlenga et al 2018 it is suggested that this may be originated in a higher probability of existence of a low conductivity barrier extending across the entire sample cross section in that matter valuable information is available for binary media in 2d only one facies can percolate at a time while this restriction is not present in 3d neuweiler and vogel 2007 for example for the low connectivity structure type at low values of p we have indeed verified that the k facies forms a spanning cluster preventing the k facies to do so in 3d as p increases both facies can form a spanning cluster at the same time regarding connectivity and percolation the percolation threshold has been used in previous works by other authors to measure connectivity for continuous media in the framework of the critical path analysis knudby and carrera 2005 masihi et al 2016 this procedure requires a transformation that consists in adjusting a threshold until a k path spanning the sample appears likewise we acknowledge the limitation arising from the fact that p a v cannot be measured for any given media sample other connectivity indicators based on statistical measurements of the cluster sizes such as the average cluster size or the integral of the connectivity function western et al 2001 were evaluated in the course of the present study without any significant findings future research should investigate percolation and connectivity on ternary media to later address more realistic multi facies models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to thank p renard and pardo igúzquiza for kind exchanges regarding code implementation j tierno and l raineri marchina for code development we would also like to acknowledge the computational time from the tupac cluster made available by the csc conicet and from m saraceno cima conicet appendix a finite size effects in this appendix we analyze how p a v behaves for subsamples of linear sizes λ i l aiming to verify by extrapolation if for the employed sample size l p a v has already attained its asymptotic infinite value p c and then if our results are valid for greater sample sizes the chosen linear subscales were λ i l 2 i with 0 i 5 for both 2d and 3d i is an integer for each subsample n p is calculated as shown in section 2 3 figure a 1 shows the variation of n p with p for each λ i using l c 3 δ for 2d left and l c 2 δ for 3d right there is an intersection point common to all the subscales from which p c for l image 2 is estimated figure a 2 shows the variation of p a v as a function of λ estimated by interpolating the value of p for which n p 0 5 full horizontal line in fig a 1 with these results we have verified that p a v l p c for the cases with higher l c 3 δ in 2d and 2 δ in 3d this result can be extended to the cases of l c 2 δ in 2d and of l c 1 5 δ in 3d that have smaller finite size effects due to the lower l c l ratio 
231,the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q relates the spatial averages of flux and head gradient in a block of heterogeneous media in this article we study the influence of connectivity on k e q of media samples composed of a high conductivity k and a low conductivity k facies the k facies is characterized by a proportion p and also by two connectivity parameters a connectivity structure type no low intermediate high and a correlation integral scale l c the probability distribution of k e q and the critical value of p at which percolation occurs p a v are studied as a function of these connectivity parameters the distribution of log k e q is gaussian in all cases so the results are presented in terms of the geometric mean k e q and the variance σ log k e q 2 both quantities show a data collapse if expressed as a function of p p a v for the variance σ log k e q 2 notably even if 2d and 3d data are plotted together in 3d when a connectivity structure exists k e q is always greater than when no structure exists and increases while p a v decreases as l c increases the same is observed in 2d except for the low connectivity structure type i e when the k facies is disconnected that shows an unprecedented behaviour k e q is greater in the absence of structure and decreases p a v increases as l c increases our results show that any influence of connectivity on k e q is well accounted for simply by a shift in the percolation threshold p a v and then suggest that k e q is controlled mainly by the proximity to percolation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords percolation up scaling binary media stochastic 1 introduction 1 1 equivalent conductivity and connectivity achieving a precise description of the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q of heterogeneous media is of great interest in several subsurface related disciplines such as ground water management waste disposal co2 storage and hydrocarbon applications the homogenization procedure that makes it possible to derive a representative k e q value over a certain block from the point conductivity values k r is termed upscaling the equivalent conductivity k e q tends to the effective conductivity k e f f as the size of the block tends to infinity dagan et al 2013 frequently the scarcity of field data in subsurface related applications is mitigated by the use of a geostatistical stochastic approach gelhar 1986 linde et al 2015 godoy et al 2018 in this approach uncertainty is addressed by generating independent realizations of a sample of a subsurface formation for simplicity let s consider a sample of linear size l and volume l d where d is the space dimensionality the point conductivity k r is defined over a regular cartesian grid of linear cell size δ in each sample k r is considered to be a random process characterized by a probability density function p k r and the spatial variation of k r is defined by a covariance function with a certain integral length scale l c eventually the realizations can be conditioned with the available field data for lognormal media the mean and variance of p k r may suffice to determine k e q with a small influence of the type of covariance function in 3d de wit 1995 however in certain scenarios for example if tortuous channels are present it has been shown western et al 2001 that additional information regarding the spatial organization of k r is required this motivated an important number of studies that explored connectivity as the source of such information in a first group of studies zinn and harvey 2003 and later jankovic et al 2017 modified multigaussian continuous fields for which intermediate k r classes are naturally connected while the extreme k r classes are disconnected by applying a normal score transform to swap the intermediate k r classes with the high or the low ones this made it possible to increase or reduce the connectivity of the high k r classes without changing p k r or the spatial covariance function of k r in these studies connectivity was explored through different configurations arising from the reorganization of the k r classes and through the covariance function it was shown that the ratio between the k e q of the connected structure to that of the disconnected one can notably reach a value of 10 in 2d while it decreases to 2 2 in 3d both for high variances this shows the strong effect of dimensionality in a second group other authors evaluated new ways to describe and measure connectivity or analyzed how connectivity metrics are correlated to k e q some of them studied continuous k r fields masihi et al 2016 tyukhova and willmann 2016 while others considered multi facies media with a discrete distribution of k r values nurafza et al 2006 fleckenstein and fogg 2008 vassena et al 2010 rongier et al 2016 in all cases it is concluded that measuring the connectivity of the high k r classes is crucial to assess groundwater flow 1 2 upscaling and percolation in binary media a binary medium knudby et al 2006 king et al 2001 has a proportion p of a high conductivity facies k r k constant and a proportion 1 p of a low conductivity facies k r k constant it is a simplified representation of multi facies media that makes it possible to retain salient geometrical heterogeneity features hunt and idriss 2009 zarlenga and fiori 2015 while rendering the parameter space more tractable nevertheless binary media may accurately model natural formations guin and ritzi 2008 for example in sandstone shale or sand clay mixtures their study constitutes a gateway to understand the percolative behaviour of k e q in multi facies models regarding their flow properties a distinctive feature is a sharp increase of k e q when p overcomes the percolation threshold p c i e when it appears a spanning cluster in the k facies a k cluster connecting the sample along the mean flow direction hunt and idriss 2009 analytical methods to estimate k e q in binary media were developed in general on the basis of effective medium theory and perturbation methods maxwell 1873 dagan 1989 pozdniakov and tsang 2004 hashin and shtrikman 1962 showed that for binary isotropic media and without taking into account the spatial organization of the facies k e q lies in a bounded range narrower than the one set by the arithmetic and harmonic averages wiener 1912 bernabé et al 2004 provided a simple model for statistical isotropic and infinite media that enables the estimation of k e q in the framework of percolation theory in this model for p p c the media is assumed to be composed by isolated inclusions of the k facies randomly distributed in a matrix of the k facies so k e q is estimated as the hashin shtrikman lower bound eq 1 1 k e q k p 1 k k 1 p 3 k p p c for p p c k e q is mainly controlled by the proportion p of the volume of the spanning cluster with p p to the total sample volume in this case the media is considered as formed by two facies k with proportion p and a second fictitious one with characteristic conductivity k m k k m k and proportion 1 p the latter is a mixture arising from the combination of the k facies and the component of the k facies that don t belong to the spanning cluster the conductivity k m is obtained with eq 1 but using p p 1 p as the relative proportion of the k facies in the mixture an estimation of p can be obtained using the power law in p p c from percolation theory stauffer and aharony 1994 finally k e q is computed using the hashin shtrikman upper bound as eq 2 2 k e q k 1 p 1 k m k p 3 k p p c later oriani and renard 2014 improved the model of bernabé et al 2004 by characterizing the spanning cluster via image analysis and correcting the value of p using the convex hull of the clusters this model drops the statistical isotropy requirement and has no size restrictions resulting in a more accurate estimation but is more expensive in terms of computing time especially in 3d as explained above as many flow features are determined by the connectivity of the k facies nurafza et al 2006 a percolative analysis is of interest for accurate flow modelling and k e q estimation in this regard we highlight three important issues 1 the existence of a spatial correlation of k r characterized by the integral scale l c affects the connectivity as it modifies the size of the k clusters previous works harter 2005 guin and ritzi 2008 have shown that an increase of l c leads to a decrease of p c also we recall that keeping all other variables constant an increase of l c typically implies an increase of k e q paleologos et al 1996 boschan and noetinger 2012 2 percolation thresholds vary significantly between 2d and 3d also in 2d isotropic binary media only one percolating facies can exist while this restriction does not exist in 3d neuweiler and vogel 2007 zarlenga et al 2018 it becomes evident that dimensionality will strongly affect any connectivity characterization moreover several connectivity indicators are borrowed from percolation theory stauffer and aharony 1994 hunt 1998 renard and allard 2013 3 due to the finite size of the media samples finite size scaling affects the percolation transition king et al 1999 the critical value of p for which percolation occurs for a sample of linear size l here termed p a v tends to p c as l also k 0 in contrast with formal percolation theory for which k 0 these finite effects may influence k e q differently for 2d than for 3d these facts demonstrate that analyzing connectivity features in 2d and 3d at the same time is important to gain understanding on how connectivity indicators can be used to predict k e q 1 3 k e q distributions in the stochastic approach mentioned in section 1 1 the relative frequency of k e q values in the ensemble of realizations defines a probability distribution i e p k e q fenton and griffiths 1993 sanchez vila et al 2006 this distribution is often represented by its mean value k e q the first gaussian moment knudby et al 2006 oriani and renard 2014 liao et al 2019 and by its variance σ log k e q 2 the second gaussian moment particularly for multigaussian media dykaar and kitanidis 1992 attinger 2003 in the case of binary media as p approaches p c p k e q may undergo a transition from unimodal to bimodal with two well defined modal k e q values see fig 6 in boschan and noetinger 2012 the probability distribution widens and some values of k e q between the modes may have negligible relative frequency a gap appears in p k e q in those cases it is necessary to carefully evaluate if p k e q is appropriately described by only k e q and eventually by σ log k e q 2 also depicting the shape of p k e q is then of key importance to gain conceptual understanding of the underlying flow situation particularly on the onset of a percolative behaviour with direct impact in uncertainty management applications moreover the influence of connectivity on p k e q becomes of interest and to our knowledge has not yet been addressed in the literature 1 4 objectives the objective of this paper is to analyze the interplay among connectivity percolation and p k e q of saturated isotropic binary media we have decided to carry out the study both in 2d and 3d aiming to provide a better understanding of the subtle extrapolation from 2d to 3d and also to obtain insight over the potentially complex behaviour of p k e q in 3d to this end we have constructed random binary media samples with no low intermediate or high connectivity structure type in a binary media version of the procedure followed by previous authors zinn and harvey 2003 jankovic et al 2017 zarlenga et al 2018 using continuous k r fields the use of binary media makes it possible to analyze how connectivity influences k e q from the point of view of percolation we intend to portray here a wide range of connectivity scenarios connectivity was varied explicitly by changing the connectivity structure type and the integral scale l c these are the connectivity parameters that control the spatial organization of the k facies but also implicitly by varying the proportion p of the k facies media samples with l c 0 are used to represent the lack of structure in section 2 we present the numerical methodology employed to construct the binary samples fft ma generator le ravalec et al 2000 to use cluster analysis to determine the percolation threshold p c connect3d pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2003 and to compute k e q modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the results are presented in section 3 where we first examine the distributions p k e q for the different connectivity structure types then the behaviour of the first two gaussian moments of p k e q the mean k e q and the variance σ log k e q 2 is studied as a function of p l c and the connectivity structure type later it is shown that the influence of l c and of the connectivity structure type on k e q and σ log k e q 2 is well accounted for simply by a shift in the percolation threshold p a v finally we present a final discussion and outline the perspectives for future work 2 numerical methodology the first step described in section 2 1 of our stochastic approach consisted in generating square 2d or cubic 3d binary media samples the k facies of the samples are characterized by three parameters a connectivity structure type no low intermediate high an integral scale l c and a proportion p then k r was upscaled from the fine scale δ to the scale l of the sample size which is constant in this work obtaining one k e q value for each realization section 2 2 finally we have used a cluster identification function to estimate p a v for each value of l c and each connectivity structure type section 2 3 2 1 generation of binary fields with different connectivity structure types the binary media samples were obtained by the following procedure a generation of multigaussian media samples with a standard normal distribution of an intermediate indicator k i r using an isotropic exponential covariance function these will be referred to as underlying multigaussian media samples as explained in section 1 1 for these intermediate k i r classes form a connected matrix while the extreme k i r classes form a disconnected matrix random field generation was performed using a fast fourier transform fft moving average fft ma method le ravalec et al 2000 b binarization by truncation mapping the k i r point values from the multigaussian samples onto k or k point values in the target binary samples the truncation schemes shown in fig 1 were used to generate binary media samples with high intermediate or low connectivity structure types fig 2 for the high connectivity structure type when the proportion p is small the connected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample this is the intermediate k i r classes for which the indicator takes values close to zero becomes the k facies after binarization but as p increases also the disconnected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample the extreme k i r classes gradually becomes part of the k facies of the binary samples this is illustrated in fig 3 where binary media samples of the high connectivity structure type are shown for different values of p for the low connectivity structure type when the proportion p is small the connected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample becomes the k facies in the binary samples and the disconnected matrix becomes the k facies but as p increases the disconnected matrix of the underlying multigaussian sample also becomes gradually part of the k facies in the binary samples the intermediate connectivity structure type is obtained by performing a standard truncation over the multigaussian samples allard 1993 these truncation procedures are depicted in fig 1 depending on the connectivity structure type one or two equal but with opposite signs cutoff indicator values are required to control the proportion p of the k facies in the binary samples fig 2 shows examples of the resulting binary media in 2d top p 0 5 and 3d bottom p 0 4 a sample with a high low connectivity structure type is constituted by blobs of the k k facies embedded in a k k matrix for the intermediate connectivity structure type neither of the facies embeds the other we have verified that the binarization procedure described in step b maintains the exponential nature of the covariance function while l c changes depending on the value of p and on the connectivity structure type the exponential covariance is defined in eq 3 where h is the lag or distance between two points l c is the correlation integral scale and c 0 is the variance of p k r 3 c h c 0 exp 3 h l c for the intermediate connectivity structure type an analytical relation between the integral scales of the gaussian and of the binary media can be found in mariethoz and caers 2014 we are not aware of an analogous formula for the high and low connectivity structure types because of this and to compare binary media with the same covariance function but different connectivity structure types it was necessary to map the value of l c of the multigaussian samples onto that of the binarized ones the relation between covariances before and after binarization is depicted in fig 4 for the 2d case where the covariance function for the three connectivity structure types for p 0 4 are shown along with the ones of the underlying gaussian samples note that the value of l c of the multigaussian sample required to obtain a given l c of the binarized one depends on the connectivity structure type spatially uncorrelated media samples l c 0 001 δ were used as a reference of media with no connectivity structure i e at the scale of the sample size note that media samples of the three connectivity structure types defined above should statistically coincide as l c 0 converging to this reference uncorrelated case also due to the small l c l ratio it is reasonable to assume that the ergodic hypothesis holds aiming to study the percolation transition in detail we have explored 20 values of p in the ranges 0 4 0 8 for 2d and 0 1 0 5 for 3d having in mind that the theoretical values for media with negligible integral scale l c 0 verified in this work are 0 593 in 2d and 0 312 in 3d site percolation we remark that the sample construction procedure presented here is analogous to the technique conceived by zinn and harvey 2003 in that it makes it possible to control the spatial organization of the high k r classes while leaving the other parameters unchanged the contrast between the characteristic conductivity values for the high and low conductivity facies is 10 4 k 100 m d a y k 0 01 m d a y this choice is in line with the proposed percolative approach in the following it will be assumed that k e q is made dimensionless by a factor of 1 m d a y the sample sizes are l 512 δ and l 64 δ for 2d and 3d respectively and the values of l c are 2 δ and 3 δ for 2d and 1 5 δ and 2 δ for 3d this choice aimed to equate the statistical sampling between 2d and 3d by matching the number of independent heterogeneity units that can be estimated as l c l d boschan and noetinger 2012 in table 1 the main parameters and variables are presented to study k e q and σ log k e q 2 section 3 2 we have performed 1000 realizations for each set of parameters p l c connectivity structure type while 5000 realizations were performed to achieve a satisfactory resolution for p k e q 2 2 computation of k e q the effective conductivity was computed in the square or cubic domain according to the classic permeameter definition in this approach a hydraulic gradient is imposed between inlet h i n and outlet h o u t faces dirichlet boundary conditions while other boundaries are impervious neumann boundary conditions the flow simulations were performed using modflow 2005 1 1 https water usgs gov ogw modflow mf2005 html software harbaugh 2005 that applies the finite difference method to discretize the laplace equation in this scheme the nodes are located at the center of each square or cubic cell and flow takes place only between adjacent faces the harmonic mean approximation was used to compute the transmisibilities between adjacent cells romeu and noetinger 1995 1 d flow approximation the pcg preconditioned conjugate gradient was chosen to solve the resulting linear system once the flow is solved we obtain k e q in the mean flow direction as 4 k e q q l h i n h o u t where q is the average velocity of the flow through a plane perpendicular to the imposed hydraulic gradient h i n h o u t l we mention that the samples used in the present study are isotropic as an ensemble despite the possible statistical fluctuations among individual realizations the equivalent conductivity k e q can then be well described by using a scalar 2 3 cluster analysis and percolation threshold two cells were considered as connected only if they shared a face consistently with the 1 d flow approximation used to compute k e q the connect3d code pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2003 was used to identify and label the k clusters in each realization i e obtaining a cluster identification function the code outputs a connectivity metric n p that takes unity value if there exists at least one k spanning cluster connecting the inlet and outlet faces of the sample and zero otherwise i e it measures connectivity in the mean flow direction from now on realizations for which n p 1 will be referred to as percolating realizations while those for which n p 0 as non percolating realizations taking into account the stochastic approach the ensemble mean n p measures frequency of occurrence of percolation moreover for each connectivity structure type and l c the value of p for which n p 0 5 harter 2005 this is when exactly half of the realizations percolate was obtained by performing an iterative search in the following this critical p value will be referred to as p a v an average percolation threshold it should not be considered a connectivity indicator because it cannot be directly measured for any given media sample but as it is determined by analyzing n p which is indeed a connectivity indicator renard and allard 2013 it provides useful connectivity information in the percolation framework the term p c will refer to the percolation threshold of infinite media in appendix a the dependence of p a v with the domain size l and its convergence to p c as l are analyzed the use of the indicator n p made it possible to obtain p k e q separately for the ensembles of percolating and non percolating realizations on the other hand for each realization the relative proportion p of the spanning cluster was explicitly calculated and then used in the equations proposed by bernabé eqs 1 and 2 to estimate k e q 3 results and discussion as discussed in section 1 3 in certain scenarios particularly for binary media it is necessary to assess if k e q and σ log k e q 2 suffice to provide an accurate description of p k e q in this regard we first examine p k e q analyzing briefly the influence of the connectivity structure type on it secondly we study the k e q and σ log k e q 2 as a function of p with the connectivity structure type and l c as parameters finally we analyze how p a v reflects the influence of these parameters on k e q 3 1 analysis of the distribution p k e q for ease of visualization and characterization of the distributions we ll present results in terms of p log k e q figure 5 shows the latter for 2d p 0 566 l c 0 001 δ and l c 2 δ and 3d p 0 247 l c 0 001 δ and l c 1 5 δ the values of p are chosen so that both in 2d and 3d n p equals 0 5 for the intermediate connectivity structure type this is just at percolation with p p a v it is observed that in all cases p log k e q can be fitted satisfactorily by a gaussian function suggesting a lognormal distribution of k e q when p 0 or p 1 the media are homogeneous and log k e q is equal to log k or log k respectively in 2d n p 1 and n p 0 for the high and low connectivity structure types respectively in 3d n p 0 8 and n p 0 1 for the high and low connectivity structure types respectively for both 2d and 3d n p 0 for the no structure case l c 0 001 δ the distributions of percolating and non percolating realizations are shown separately for the intermediate connectivity structure type note that there are a number of non percolating realizations with greater k e q values than those of percolating ones with a considerable overlap between both distributions in other words all parameters kept constant the occurrence of percolation does not imply a higher k e q as discussed in colecchio et al 2020 for binary media p k e q typically undergoes an homogenization from bimodal to unimodal as the linear size of the sample l increases as p approaches p a v the value of l required to achieve such homogenization increases we have verified that the distribution p k e q is unimodal for all the values of p and l c studied in this work notably even at p p a v implying that for the chosen sample size l the above mentioned homogenization is attained comparing the results in terms of the connectivity structure types in 2d the distributions p k e q for l c 2 δ are clearly separated but there is an overlap between p k e q of the low connectivity structure type and that of the no structure l c 0 001 δ in 3d the distributions for l c 1 5 δ are closer to each other and an overlap does exist between the high connectivity structure type and the intermediate one note that the probability distributions for the no structure case and the low connectivity structure case invert their relative positions in 2d with respect to 3d 3 2 analysis of the first two gaussian moments the mean k e q and the variance σ log k e q 2 figure 6 shows the variation of the geometric mean of k e q noted k e q as a function of p as p approaches the percolation transition there is a sharp increase of k e q hunt and sahimi 2017 however this increase is smeared out due to the finite effects mentioned in section 1 2 in the percolation region k e q depends strongly on the connectivity structure type as an example in 2d the values of k e q for the high connectivity structure type can be 30 times greater than those for the low connectivity structure type in 3d this ratio reaches a value of 5 these results can be compared with similar ones for lognormal media 10 for 2d zinn and harvey 2003 2 2 for 3d jankovic et al 2017 the difference among the values of k e q for the different connectivity structure types is smaller for the lower l c 2 δ in 2d and 1 5 δ in 3d on the other hand k e q increases as l c increases in all cases except notably for the low connectivity structure type in 2d for which it decreases this may be due to a more efficient isolation of the k clusters or in terms of the flow structure and given the imposed boundary conditions to a higher fraction of the flow paths being affected by head losses involving greater energy dissipation a more detailed discussion is presented at the summary section 4 the increase of k e q with l c was observed in previous works paleologos et al 1996 boschan and noetinger 2012 and may be related to the dependence of p a v with l c harter 2005 which will be discussed in the next section fig 7 shows the variance σ log k e q 2 normalized by the variance of k r σ log k 2 as a function of p a bell like shape is always observed the maxima are located at different values of p note that the maximum for l c 0 001 δ is located at 0 593 in 2d and at 0 312 in 3d the values of p c for a square 2d or cubic 3d lattice stauffer and aharony 1994 in all cases the variance σ log k e q 2 increases as l c increases boschan and noetinger 2012 note that the maximum of σ log k e q 2 increases with l c but it is similar for the three types of connectivity structures in 2d and rather similar in 3d on the other hand as l c increases the width of the bell increases also the maximum slope of the curves in fig 6 and the position of the maximum in fig 7 are related to the occurrence of percolation boschan and noetinger 2012 3 3 percolation analysis in this section we focus our attention on the percolative behaviour of k e q and its moments analyzing the critical value p a v calculated as described in section 2 3 as a function of the integral scale l c and the connectivity structure type figure 8 shows the fraction of percolating realizations n p as a function of p close to p a v n p increases steeply from 0 to 1 an initial estimation of p a v was obtained from the intersection of the n p curves with the horizontal black line n p 0 5 then by performing an iterative search the value of p a v for each parameter set was obtained figure 9 shows how p a v decreases with l c except for the low connectivity structure type in 2d for which it increases here for the latter case the interpretation of a more efficient isolation of the k clusters as l c increases applies as it did in fig 6 the reader should note that an increase of p a v with l c implies that the percolation transition for the 2d low connectivity structure case will occur at a greater value of p than that for the no structure case this leads to a noticeable result that introducing spatial correlation may involve a decrease of k e q this will be further discussed in section 4 the relationship between p a v and l c shows a rather linear trend for both 2d and 3d as l c decreases the different connectivity structure types converge into a unique uncorrelated structure and p a v tends to the site percolation values for a square 0 593 and cubic 0 312 lattice the range of values of l c studied was extended to l c 6 δ in 2d and to l c 2 5 δ in 3d to verify the trend however we omitted the analysis of k e q for these extended values of l c since in some cases it was difficult to stabilize the statistical properties of the media and the measured l c values differed from the input ones the effect of the fluctuations over the mean values p a v k e q is small but becomes important over the variance σ log k e q 2 on the other hand in appendix a it is shown that the values of p a v presented here agree with those of p c the asymptotic regime towards l being attained figure 10 shows the variation of k e q with p p a v using the values of p a v from fig 9 in this representation a data collapse is observed independently of l c and of the connectivity structure type and both for 2d and 3d this implies that a shift in p a v suffices to account for any influence of these two connectivity parameters on k e q having in mind that the high and low connectivity structure types represent two contrasting connectivity scenarios this result is noteworthy an estimation based on the work of bernabé et al 2004 is shown in dashed line here p is computed explicitly for each realization as described in section 2 3 for the lower part of the curve we take into account only the non percolating realizations using eq 1 likewise for the upper part of the curve we use eq 2 and consider only the percolating realizations the estimation predicts an important gap of k e q values for p close to p a v which is not observed in our simulations in general the agreement is rather poor in that zone especially for the 3d case the difference may arise from the influence of flow dead ends of the spanning cluster which is simplified in the estimation of bernabé et al 2004 figure 11 shows k e q as a function of p p a v using a log log scale for p p a v for comparison the power law derived from percolation theory eq 5 is shown using continuous straight lines with slopes μ 1 3 for 2d and μ 2 for 3d as reported in the literature stauffer and aharony 1994 when these slopes are obtained by linear fitting over our data they yield a mean value of μ 1 33 for 2d and μ 1 9 for 3d with little variation among the different connectivity structure types and l c values 5 k e q p p a v μ regarding the value of k e q at p p a v our results can be contrasted with the finite size scaling predicted for a binary media by efros and shklovskii 1976 eqs 6 and 7 using the values of high k and low k characteristic conductivities employed in our work this prediction yields k e q 1 in 2d and k e q 0 13 in 3d as 6 k e q k k 1 and in 3d 7 k e q k k k 0 72 0 13 on the other hand from fig 6 we obtain k e q 1 in 2d and k e q 0 1 in 3d these results show that k e q follows a percolative behaviour rather independently of the connectivity parameters fig 12 shows σ log k e q 2 scaled by l l c d as a function of p p a v in this representation it can be observed that the maximum of the σ log k e q 2 see fig 7 occurs at p p a v 0 in all cases this result was observed previously by boschan and noetinger 2012 and is related to that of masihi and king 2012 who found that a maximum in the standard deviation of connectivity quantified by the relative volume of the percolating cluster occurred at p c the scaling factor l l c d can be interpreted as the number of the independent heterogeneity units if l l c making it possible to match the statistical sampling between 2d and 3d for the cases with l c 0 001 δ the variance was scaled by l δ d since the number of the independent heterogeneity units equals the number of cells the collapse observed in fig 12 is remarkable taking into account that data for 2d and 3d media are plotted together for all the connectivity structure types and l c values studied 4 summary conclusions and perspectives the main result of this paper is that any influence of the studied connectivity parameters on the mean and the variance of k e q is simply reflected in a shift or displacement in the percolation threshold p a v both in 2d and 3d except for this shift the dependence of those moments with p is almost identical for all the connectivity scenarios investigated and follows the scaling predicted by percolation theory we reformulate here for 2d and 3d binary media and then using a percolative approach the question posed by zarlenga et al 2018 for lognormal continuous media regarding the impact of connectivity for formations sharing the same p k r and covariance in terms of parameters the roles of the connectivity structure type and of the integral scale l c are conceptually similar in both studies with the addition of a no structure case in the present one while the k k ratio in binary media plays the role of the variance for lognormal media however the proportion p is intimately related to a percolative approach having in mind that the analyzed distributions p log k e q are always unimodal and gaussian and then well defined by their mean and variance no information about gaussian moments of higher order is required the result can be extended in a straightforward manner to the distribution p log k e q itself however for smaller sample sizes l p log k e q may become bimodal colecchio et al 2020 with a greater contrast between percolating and non percolating realizations in that case it is not evident if the observed collapse would hold this remains an open issue and shall be addressed in future works on the other hand the validity of the present results for greater sample sizes is analyzed in detail in appendix a there it is shown by extrapolation from a set of smaller subsamples of increasing size that for the sample size used in this work p a v has already attained its asymptotic behaviour l this suggests that the data collapse observed in figs 10 and 12 would hold for largest sample sizes l and in particular for l we now focus our attention on the noticeable behaviour of the low connectivity structure type in 2d for which k e q decreases fig 6 and p a v increases fig 9 as l c increases as opposed to all other cases to our knowledge this behaviour has never been previously observed in the literature where it was always found that the appearance of a spatial correlation implied an increase of k e q paleologos et al 1996 boschan and noetinger 2012 and a decrease of p a v harter 2005 guin and ritzi 2008 this feature may help understanding from the percolation point of view why when comparing media with the same p k r and covariance function but different connectivity structure types a greater contrast of k e q values may exist in 2d than in 3d in the work of zarlenga et al 2018 it is suggested that this may be originated in a higher probability of existence of a low conductivity barrier extending across the entire sample cross section in that matter valuable information is available for binary media in 2d only one facies can percolate at a time while this restriction is not present in 3d neuweiler and vogel 2007 for example for the low connectivity structure type at low values of p we have indeed verified that the k facies forms a spanning cluster preventing the k facies to do so in 3d as p increases both facies can form a spanning cluster at the same time regarding connectivity and percolation the percolation threshold has been used in previous works by other authors to measure connectivity for continuous media in the framework of the critical path analysis knudby and carrera 2005 masihi et al 2016 this procedure requires a transformation that consists in adjusting a threshold until a k path spanning the sample appears likewise we acknowledge the limitation arising from the fact that p a v cannot be measured for any given media sample other connectivity indicators based on statistical measurements of the cluster sizes such as the average cluster size or the integral of the connectivity function western et al 2001 were evaluated in the course of the present study without any significant findings future research should investigate percolation and connectivity on ternary media to later address more realistic multi facies models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to thank p renard and pardo igúzquiza for kind exchanges regarding code implementation j tierno and l raineri marchina for code development we would also like to acknowledge the computational time from the tupac cluster made available by the csc conicet and from m saraceno cima conicet appendix a finite size effects in this appendix we analyze how p a v behaves for subsamples of linear sizes λ i l aiming to verify by extrapolation if for the employed sample size l p a v has already attained its asymptotic infinite value p c and then if our results are valid for greater sample sizes the chosen linear subscales were λ i l 2 i with 0 i 5 for both 2d and 3d i is an integer for each subsample n p is calculated as shown in section 2 3 figure a 1 shows the variation of n p with p for each λ i using l c 3 δ for 2d left and l c 2 δ for 3d right there is an intersection point common to all the subscales from which p c for l image 2 is estimated figure a 2 shows the variation of p a v as a function of λ estimated by interpolating the value of p for which n p 0 5 full horizontal line in fig a 1 with these results we have verified that p a v l p c for the cases with higher l c 3 δ in 2d and 2 δ in 3d this result can be extended to the cases of l c 2 δ in 2d and of l c 1 5 δ in 3d that have smaller finite size effects due to the lower l c l ratio 
232,peak discharge to drainage area relationships are widely applied engineering solutions for design flood estimation in ungauged basins in this study we investigated the effects of antecedent moisture conditions amc rainfall duration and channel transmission losses on discharge drainage area power law scaling relationships the spatial organization of peak discharges were evaluated through coupled surface subsurface physics based numerical modeling we take advantage past research and the detailed flexibility of hydrogeosphere the numerical modeling platform to systematically vary amc and rainfall depths evolving the current understanding of the effects on discharge drainage area relationships channel network dynamics in the beaver creek watershed dominated the location of a scale break or the location where the log log linear relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is best described by two or more slopes single peaked hydrographs and high quality power law scaling relationships resulted from wet amc conditions or high precipitation depths as we reduced the amc under low rainfall depths the hillslope response diverged from the channel response providing an unorganized system response no longer fitting the power law scaling relationship additionally when initializing the system under losing stream conditions where the stream channel is assumed unsaturated a single peaked response ensued whereby the channel and hillslope responded in unison this study adds to our current understanding of the physical basis of the variability of the scaling structure of peak discharges that is observed in single rainfall runoff events by investigating the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry antecedent soil moisture conditions keywords antecedent moisture conditions scaling floods hillslope numerical modeling channel transmission losses 1 introduction regional flood frequency equations are mainly based on the power law scaling relationship between peak discharge quantiles and drainage area that is stated as qp a αaθ where a is the drainage area normalized by a unit drainage area α m3s 1 is the flood scaling intercept θ is the flood scaling exponent and qp m3s 1 is the peak discharge corresponding to a given exceedance probability p these peak discharge quantile scaling relationships are used extensively for design flood estimation in ungauged basins ries 2007 although the first published work on peak flow scaling relationships with drainage area dates back to the early 1900 s widespread adoption of standardized flood scaling relationships in the united states was born from the united states national flood insurance program as described by dawdy et al 2012 shortly after the publication of bulletin 15 wrc 1967 which looked to develop a uniform technique for determining flood frequency the federal emergency management agency fema and the united states geological survey usgs adopted the procedure making it widely applied and accepted since the adoption of bulletin 15 application of peak flow scaling relationships have expanded to many engineering applications that range from floodplain mapping to design of hydraulic structures such as bridges culverts and dams ries 2007 earlier studies were geared towards understanding the physical processes that control the regional variability of the flood scaling parameters prediction of these scaling parameters was the overarching goal of early studies using rainfall and a catchment s physical properties as explanatory variables in river basins where peak discharge observation is scarce bloschl and sivapalan 1997 gupta and dawdy 1995 merz and bloschl 2003 robinson and sivapalan 1997a robinson and sivapalan 1997b smith 1992 these studies which are based on the evaluation of peak discharge quantiles over large geographic regions provided significant insights on factors that control the variability of the flood scaling parameters from one geographic region to another gupta and dawdy 1995 are among the first to study the regional variability of the flood scaling parameters they showed that in some hydrologic regions of the u s peak discharge quantiles exhibit multiscaling properties where in others simple scaling was prevalent multiscaling occurs when the flood scaling exponent varies with return period and simple scaling of peak discharge quantiles is achieved when the flood scaling exponent remains constant irrespective of the return period they argued that simple scaling which is prevalent in regions where the annual maximum peak discharges are dominated by snowmelt generated runoff is due to the more spatially uniform characteristics of snow melt runoff responses they also suggested that the multi scaling property of peak discharge quantiles observed in regions where rainfall driven floods occur is a manifestation of the increasing spatial variability of rainfall with increasing scale these results were further reinforced by ogden and dawdy 2003 who reported on simple scaling peak discharge quantile patterns in the humid goodwin creek experimental watershed a 21km2 that is located in mississippi u s and goodrich et al 1997 who reported on multi scaling spatial organization of peak discharge quantiles in the semiarid walnut gulch watershed a 148km2 located in arizona u s in general these studies have shown that simple scaling of peak discharge quantiles as a function of drainage area is the exception rather than the norm continuing on the trajectory of studying the regional variability of the spatial scaling structure of peak discharge quantiles merz and bloschl 2003 studied peak floods obtained from 490 australian catchments by specifically classifying the observed peak floods into long rain floods short rain floods flash floods rain on snow floods and snowmelt floods they showed how the regional variability of the spatial scaling structure of peak discharge quantiles can be described by the regional variability of the physical processes that control the generation of peak floods in space and time other notable studies along the same line of research have investigated the regional variability of the relationship between the coefficient of variation cv of peak discharges and basin scale e g bloschl and sivapalan 1997 robinson and sivapalan 1997a smith 1992 for example bloschl and sivapalan 1997 showed how the cv is affected by the interplay among rainfall duration rainfall intensity catchment response time base flow and nonlinear runoff processes including threshold effects flood quantile based studies that are briefly summarized above provided important insights into the processes that control the regional variability of peak discharge quantile scaling structure more recent studies argue that efforts to connect the regional variability of the flood scaling parameters to physical processes that control the occurrence of peak discharges in space and time should focus on analyzing peak discharges observed in single rainfall runoff events in nested watersheds e g ayalew et al 2014b dawdy et al 2012 furey and gupta 2005 gupta 2004 peak discharge quantiles in each geographic region may come from different rainfall runoff events that occurred in separate catchments that do not share a drainage network moreover annual maximum peak discharges observed at different locations within a single river basin could also come from different rainfall runoff events that occurred at different times of the year as a result it is difficult to connect the observed spatial scaling structure of peak discharge quantiles to the physical process that control the generation of peak discharges at the scale of single rainfall runoff events to this end a number of studies have been conducted with an overarching goal of understanding the physical basis of the observed event to event variability of the peak discharge scaling structure e g ayalew et al 2014a 2015 2014b furey and gupta 2005 2007 mantilla et al 2006 2011 menabde and sivapalan 2001 menabde et al 2001 thomas et al 2016a these studies collectively address how the peak discharge scaling structure is controlled by event to event variability in particular the interplay among rainfall and catchment physical properties such as rainfall intensity rainfall duration antecedent soil moisture catchment travel time hillslope overland flow velocity and channel flow velocity however previous efforts have not focused on or have had challenges parsing out the effects of antecedent soil moisture on peak flow scaling ayalew et al 2014b was the only study to address soil moisture through varying the runoff coefficient in a hillslope link numerical framework this study identified a unified hillslope channel repsonse in wetter conditions transitioning to a multi peaked response in drier soil moisture states many studies have noted the prevalence of a scale break abp or the location where the log log linear relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is best described by two or more slopes previous work within the study watershed by thomas et al 2016b noted a scale break occurring at approximately 20 km2 in studies investigating smaller scales where scale breaks occurred the scale breaks consistently developed at 0 5 km2 goodrich et al 1997 mandapaka et al 2009 ayalew et al 2014b indicated that the scale break location represented a transition from hillslope dominated flow mechanisms to stream network dominated scaling processes abp found in thomas et al 2016b occurred at a much larger scale and became increasingly variable in its location with varying antecedent moisture conditions amc goodrich et al 1997 proposed the effects of partial area rainfall and channel transmission losses and the likely causes of the scale break at approximately 0 5 km2 at larger scales lee et al 2009 found the network structure to be important abrupt changes in drainage area contribution to beaver creek through tributary inflows were correlated with large shifts in the power law regression asquith and slade 1997 found a scale break in the relationship between annual peak discharge quantiles and drainage area in some hydrologic regions of texas for which they established regional flood frequency equations the scale break is observed at about 83 km2 and they attributed it to partial area rainfall coverage although scale breaks and the rationale behind them have been identified though several past studies the role which amc has in defining if a break occurs and the location is at least mostly unknown this study continues to expand the evaluation of peak flow scale invariance through advanced numerical modeling platforms which include couple surface subsurface dynamics thomas et al 2016a showed through application of coupled surface subsurface modeling that peak flow scale invariance held for a range of realistic wet antecented soil conditions wetness of the landscape precipitation intensity and in particular soil characteristics were shown to be critical in runoff generation in arid and semi arid areas where streams are empheral gutiérrez jurado et al 2019 schilling et al 2020 systematic coupled surface subsurface investigations of the subsurface properties and the impacts to flow generation mechanisms by carlier et al 2018a b showed an important differentiation between meterologic and geologic control over flow response our work adds to the current understanding of the variability of peak discharge scaling structure we ascribe a physical basis of the spatial organization of peak discharges under dry antecedent moisture conditions for single runoff events the results will shed light on how different antecedent soil moisture conditions can explain some of the regional variability of the peak discharge scaling relationship moreover we investigate how the scale break in the spatial scaling relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is also controlled by the drainage network geometry in addition to other catchment physical variables results presented below are based on numerical experimentation through physically based coupled surface subsurface simulation the reminder of the paper is organized as follows we discuss the study area and the numerical methodology in sections 2 and 3 in section 4 we present the results from our investigation of the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry conditions we also present how the interplay between the drainage network geometry and rainfall duration controls the spatial scale at which a scale break in the power law relationship between peak discharge and drainage area occurs the effect of channel transmission losses which is prevalent in ephemeral streams on the scaling structure is also discussed in this section we follow this by a detailed discussion of the results in section 5 we adjourn the paper with brief concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area this study was conducted in the 45 km2 beaver creek watershed that is in northeastern iowa u s fig 1 elevations range from 364 m in the uplands to 305 m at the outlet the watershed tends towards milder slopes in the northern uplands and relatively steeper slopes in the south the watershed is represented by more than 70 corn and soybean agriculture and more than 90 of the surficial soil textures are classified as loam or clay loam the beaver creek watershed lies in a humid continental climactic region characterized by large temperature and precipitation variations average annual precipitation ranges from 850 mm to 910 mm hutchinson and christiansen 2013 with approximately 75 lost to evapotranspiration sanford and selnick 2013 schilling and helmers 2008 below freezing temperatures occur annually resulting in frozen ground and a portion of the annual precipitation accumulating as snow however 70 of the annual precipitation occurs between march and july with the largest flows resulting from convective thunderstorms analysis of historical soil cores provided evidence of an unoxidized clay till between 1 m

watersheds project iwp as such the details of the basin and model construction were previously detailed by thomas et al 2016a and thomas et al 2016b 3 2 numerical model construction coupled surface subsurface flow simulations were performed on an unstructured grid produced with gridgen v15 pointwise inc 2003 gridgen automatically populates triangular mesh elements within input boundaries a two dimensional triangular surface mesh was the product of the lateral watershed boundary and stream network representing the local topographic highs and lows respectively the mesh resolution was increased near the stream channel and reduced in overland low slope areas variable mesh resolution provided a more realistic representation of fluid flux while retaining numerical efficiency li et al 2008 triangular surface elements ranged in size from 200 m2 in the overland flatter sloped regions to 25 m2 near the stream channel the subsurface was represented by 16 numerical layers which were divided into two zones from the surface down 1 m and from a depth of 1 m to the unoxidized till layer described in section 2 0 the unoxidized till was assumed to represent an impermeable layer and the impermeable bottom of the subsurface domain from the surface down 1 m subsurface elements ranged in depth from 0 025 m near the surface to 0 25 m with each numerical layer parallel to the surface one 0 1 m thick layer was incorporated at a 1 0 m depth to represent the hydrologic impact of tile drainage thomas et al 2016a the remaining lower domain was divided into five layers which increased in thickness from approximately 0 6 m to 1 7 m these lower layers smoothly transition from parallel with the surface to parrallel with the domain bottom increased grid resolution near the top of the subsurface domain provided a better description of surface subsurface coupling and near surface soil moisture storage the product of mesh generation was a 212 993 node 371 460 element three dimensional finite element mesh surface nodes were allocated elevation information based on a lidar derived digital elevation model iowa 2010 overland surface roughness varied in space according to common land unit clu land use classifications usda 2013 table 1 and fig 2 and literature values chow 1959 mattocks and forbes 2008 the top one meter of subsurface soils were described spatially by the soil survey geographic ssurgo database soil survey staff 2014 and soil water retention parameters were assigned based on the mean rosetta soil textural classification schaap and leij 1998a 1998b 2000 schaap et al 2001 table 2 the tile drainage layer was allocated a high hydraulic conductivity creating a faster subsurface response deeper subsurface soils were aggregated to produce a single uniform subsurface characterization below a depth of 1 m fig 2 table 2 no flow boundaries were assumed along the lateral and bottom watershed surfaces for both the surface and subsurface elements except the stream channel outlet was assumed to be a normal depth outflow condition rainfall was applied uniformly to the entire watershed for a complete description of model construction and characterization see thomas et al 2016a and thomas et al 2016b this model has not been calibrated as noted in thomas et al 2016b as traditional stream flow calibration data were not available with the beaver creek watershed without available streamflow data calibration to other metrics was determined to be inappropriate although this study focuses on event based durations the model has been applied continuously to simulating hydrologic processes over multiple annual cycles as shown in thomas el al 2016b in lieu of traditional calibration targets the numerical model was validated to known annual and event to event ratios between components of the hydrologic cycle for the year 2015 studies from iowa and other agriculturally dominated central u s areas were selected for validation targets table 3 the target ratios used were discharge to precipitation q p evapotranspiration to precipitation et p evaporation to evapotranspiration e et transpiration to evapotranspiration t et and baseflow to discharge qb q a validation period of 2015 was selected over the validation period precipitation was divided into 40 stream flow and 60 et table 3 these water balance components trend well from a wet state 2014 prior year toward the target of 30 q 70 et et was divided into 39 e 61 t consistent with calibration results and moving toward the 30 70 e t calibration target baseflow represented 55 of the total flow fitting the water balance metrics well in addition to partitioning of rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration thomas et al 2016a showed that subsurface and tile drainage flow in response to rainfall events was represented in a physically realistic manner stream stage sensors at three locations within the watershed were available for the 2015 year the sensor nearest to the outlet downstream of obs10 fig 1 was selected to evaluate timing as compared to the simulated results although the magnitude cannot be directly compared the simulated peaks and valleys as compared to the observed stage showed the system provided a representative response time fig 3 shows an event in april 2015 where initiation of stream flow was consistent between observed and simulated results occurring late on april 7th a series of rainfall events between april 8 10th resulted in a hydrograph peak early on april 10th the simulated peak occurred approximately in time with the observed peak the objectives of this study do not require the exact prediction of water balance components peak flows or soil water content values rather the study should be viewed as a numerical experiment on a realistic watershed representation confidence in the numerical representation of beaver creek watershed at the simulation results were gained through application of physics based modeling appropriate parameterization proper partitioning of water balance components and the timing of simulated peak flows as compared to stream stage observations although not calibrated this model provides an opportunity to experiment with the physical characteristics underlying peak discharge scaling under dry amcs 3 3 systematic analysis of amc and design storm rainfall the analysis completed by thomas et al 2016b was extended in this study to examine exceedingly dry amc for a range of 24 h design storm depths by a similar methodology 10 years of measured hourly soil moisture data was aggregated from the ames ia usa soil climate analysis network scan usda nrcs 2015 soil moisture was recorded continuously at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm the ames scan site is located roughly 150 km southwest at an elevation of 327 m in finely textured loamy material and is located adjacent to an active cropland using data from this scan site was assumed to be representative of the beaver creek watershed due to the similarity in the soil texture land use elevation and climate characteristics we independently normalized soil moisture measurements to the maximum observation at each measurement depth the results of normalization were sorted ranked and plotted for each measurement depth fig 4 this provided a cumulative distribution function of soil moisture values from wet to dry conditions fig 4 table 4 amcs were extracted for the 0 02 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 wet exceedance probabilities wet the 0 02 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 dry exceedance probabilities dry and the median 0 50 m wetness condition these soil conditions represent a realistic range from exceedingly wet to median and median to exceedingly dry soil moisture conditions fig 4 table 4 dry and wet exceedance probability soil moisture values were used as initial conditions these soil moistures were applied uniformly in space and varied only for the top 1 m of the soil below one meter deep soils were assumed saturated per analysis of the 100 cm measurement depth at the scan site computational cells located below the stream channel were initialized as saturated as beaver creek is a perennial stream channel which was assumed to be directly connected to near surface groundwater stream depths vary spatial though the watershed and temporally with response to hydrologic conditions for instance in wetter amcs baseflow and thus initial stream flow depth would be expected to be elevated to focus this study on only the effects of soil amcs on stream flow model surface was assumed dry or without any ponded water on the landscape including stream channels a 24 h duration design storm was applied uniformly in space as a surface boundary condition atlas 14 point precipitation depth frequency estimates for the 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return period 24 h rainfall events were selected for simulation perica et al 2013 table 5 point precipitation frequency estimates were collected at the basin centroid spatial characteristics of heavy rainfall events in the midwest indicated that point precipitation estimates were only applicable for areas up to 25 km2 huff 1992 the study watershed area is 45 km2 resulting in a point precipitation estimate reduction of 1 5 due to the limited reduction of precipitation depths specified areal reduction of point precipitation frequency estimates was not performed in this study design storm rainfall depths were allocated in time by the scs type ii distribution assuming the maximum precipitation intensity occurs at hour 12 or center loaded mccuen 2005 and uniformly in space huff 1992 we applied five 24 h design storms to 17 amc initializations totaling to 85 scenarios these scenarios described the basin response under dry to wet amc and medium to heavy precipitation events each simulation was run for the duration of the 24 h event and an additional 72 h which allowed for stream flow to return to near baseflow conditions simulated stream discharge response was reported at 10 locations along beaver creek fig 1a and a limited tributary locations see fig 1a and d output hydrographs and peak discharges were analyzed for the range of amc and design storm depths to explore the induced variability in streamflow response 3 4 peak flow scaling relationship many studies have investigated the influence of various drivers on the parameters of the power law scaling of peak discharge with drainage area these studies associated shifts in scaling properties to amc without the ability to directly investigate these phenomena here these effects are investigated by estimating peak discharge scaling relationships in the form of eq 1 resulting from numerical simulations 1 q a α a θ where q m3s 1 is the peak surface discharge resulting from a numerical simulation a is the drainage area normalized by a unit drainage area which simplifies the expression by making the parameter unitless α m3s 1 is the scaling intercept and θ is the scaling exponent also referred to as the slope in log log space the methodology proposed and demonstrated in main et al 1999 was followed to detect statistically significant breaks of the scaling exponent first a regression model with two slopes was set up and the drainage area at which a scale break occurs was determined if it exists by maximizing a modified version of schwarz s information criterion bic twoslopes this exercise results in two sets of intercepts and slopes α1 θ1 α2 and θ2 the bic of the regression model that is based on a single slope bic oneslope was then calculated a scale break quantitatively exists i e a double slope regression model is statistically better than a single slope model if bic twoslopes is greater than bic oneslope the statistical significance of the slopes θ1 and θ2 of the double sloped model was tested by estimating the confidence intervals of the two slopes conditional on the drainage area at which the scale break occurs also called change point using a standard multiple regression theory please refer to main et al 1999 for a detailed description of the methodology 3 5 scale break dependence on rainfall duration the location of the scale break was further investigated in a similar manner as ayalew et al 2014b a 100 year 1 h precipitation intensity was selected 88 9 mmh 1 and applied uniformly in time and space across the entire basin for increasing durations as was noted in ayalew et al 2014b the scale break or onset of multiple scaling relationships disappeared when the duration of excess precipitation reached the basins time of concentration or when flow from all locations in the watershed reaches the outlet the 100 year 1 h precipitation was applied for a systematically increasing duration from 1 h to 12 h the peak discharge scale invariance relationship was studied for the change in regression parameters and scale break location 3 6 transmission losses here we studied the influence of channel transmission losses on the scaling structure of peak discharges by initializing the stream channel locations with the same amc as the rest of the watershed in other words the stream channel is assumed to have the same amc as the adjacent hillslopes instead of our earlier assumption where the stream channel is always wet the peak discharge relationship with drainage area was compared to those without transmission losses 4 results the following section focuses on the major differences between wet and dry amc peak flow production results from the following analyses are addressed comparison of wet and dry peak discharge variation with drainage area transition from multi scaling to a break down in peak flow scale invariance factors affecting scale break locations and testing previously proposed hypotheses regrading amc on peak flow scaling with variable precipitation duration and channel transmission losses 4 1 systematic analysis of amc and design storm rainfall fig 5 displays the influence of amc and design storm precipitation depth on both hydrograph propagation and peak discharge scaling with drainage area fig 5 a b d e displays peak flow hydrographs normalized to the maximum outlet discharge for each precipitation amc scenario the effects of increasing precipitation depth produced a larger and faster peak flow response as shown by viewing fig 5 from top to bottom p 5 to p 100 while increasing amc from dry to wet produced a larger magnitude faster stream flow response at each of the selected observation locations as shown by viewing in fig 5 from left to right dry02 to wet02 the largest and fastest streamflow response occurred under wet amc and large precipitation depths fig 5e all scenarios produced single peaked hydrographs at each reported observation location except for dry amcs and low precipitation depth scenarios fig 5a peak discharge described by drainage area plots are shown in fig 5 c f g h high rainfall depths fig 5f and wet amcs fig 5h produced consistent multi sloped power relationships for all amc cyan colored in these cases peak flows increased with a scale break in the power law relationship between peak discharge and drainage area occurring at approximately 20 km2 with an increase in amc or precipitation depth the intercept increased causing an upward shift in the multi scaling relationships as amcs became drier and or the precipitation depth decreased fig 5c g a power law relationship could no longer describe the variation in peak discharge scaling a two segment power law fit could not be achieved for dry amc s and low design storm depths fig 5c g as denoted by the pink areas specifically for p 5 conditions drier than dry25 did not exhibit consistent scaling similarly for dry02 rainfall depths less than p 10 were unable to achieve adequate peak discharge scaling across all drainage areas in general as precipitation depth was increased the hydrologic response simplified regardless of the soil amc fig 6 for these high precipitation depths p 50 p 100 α1 and α2 increased linearly with increasing amc the scaling slopes θ1 and θ2 asymptotically approached 1 0 and 0 25 respectively in the driest and wettest amc p 50 simulations showed less variability for θ1 and θ2 at lower amcs while p 100 continuously decreased as precipitation depth decreased θ1 and θ2 increased with increasing amc peaking at dry10 p 25 dry25 p 10 and dry25 dry30 p 5 after the increasing trend the regression slopes decreased asymptotically approaching 0 25 and 1 0 for θ1 and θ2 respectively the peak in θ1 and θ2 amc relationships corresponded to a local minimum for α1 and α2 an abrupt shift of abp from approximately 10 km2 to 20 km2 and low rmse values after the peak in θ abp and rmse tended to remain consistent while α1 and α2 continued to increase linearly with amc high rmse resulted from dry amc and low rainfall depths evidence of a poor regression fit in cases with high rmse the scale break occurred at approximately 10 km2 followed by an abrupt shift to 20 km2 and a reduced rmse along with the scale break location the slope before the abrupt jump tended to increase with increasing wetness and continued decreasing after the rmse dropped 4 2 effect of the drainage network geometry on the scale break the beaver creek watershed has an elongated shape and a distinct river network whereby a single main stream beaver creek flows from north to south with minor tributaries adding drainage area in a relatively uniform manner figs 1 7 table 6 at approximately 1 km intervals along beaver creek a new tributary was added between reach 2 and reach 5 providing a relatively consistent addition of drainage area 3 2 km2 km table 6 reach 6 diverts from this trend as the new tributaries were not added for the longest main channel reach 4 8 km followed by the addition of the largest tributary 8 4 km2 drainage area addition along the remainder of beaver creek from reach 7 to reach 11 once again became more consistent 4 3 km2 km table 6 the combination of a significant attenuating feature reach 6 followed by a large downstream increase of drainage area tributary ab acted to separate the responses of the upstream basin from the downstream basin upstream of reach 6 hydrographs were predominantly single peaked in reach 6 peak flows were delayed and attenuated this acted to shift the scaling relationship from a rapid increase of peak discharge with increasing drainage area high slope to a lesser sloped increase reach 6 disconnected the basin response in exceedingly dry amcs creating a multi peaked response and a discontinuous scaling relationship dry amcs exacerbated the reach 6 attenuation effects as the hydrologic system responded with two unique pulses fig 8 a fig 8 expands on the normalized hydrograph described in fig 5 isolating the input peak flow hydrographs into and out of reach 6 fig 1d the most upstream observation in the largest tributary addition to reach 6 is represented in fig 8a followed by the next downstream observation on the tributary prior to the junction with beaver creek fig 8b each frame of fig 8 describes the basin response to a single design storm depth p 5 and the range of amc from dry to median dry02 to m50 the first peak in the upstream tributary location fig 8a white points occurred at 12 h into the simulations and is in response to precipitation falling directly on a saturated streambed here all the precipitation is converted to runoff and immediately transported downstream this first peak increased with increasing soil wetness likely corresponding to an expansion of the stream area and associated directly connected stream response a second hydrograph peak discharge was observed in fig 8a black points for the entire range of dry to median amc dry02 to m50 the magnitude of the second peak increased while the time to peak decreased with increasing soil wetness the response of the upstream subbasin shown in fig 8a was not unique rather it represented an archetype for the hillslope response throughout the watershed timing magnitude and multi peaked nature of the small scale responses fig 8a compounded in the elongated beaver creek watershed producing an unorganized multi peaked system response reach 6 was further investigated for its influence on timing of hydrograph peak flows obs5 and tributary observation point b are the primary flow inputs to obs 6 as shown in fig 8b c and d respectively for the driest amc dry02 both observation point b and obs5 displayed a two peaked streamflow response as the initial soil wetness increased beyond dry25 obs5 responses became single peaked while observation point b retained its dual peak nature the first peak represented the largest magnitude response at observation point b up to amc m50 for the dry02 amc the first peak at observation point b was 3 5 m3s 1 occurring at 12 3 h the first peak at obs6 occurred at 12 7 h of 3 1 m3s 1 primarily reflecting the attenuated first peak of tributary ab the first peak at obs5 occurred at 14 1 h for the dry02 amc this peak traveled into and through the 4 8 km reach 6 at obs6 the second peak occurred at 17 5 h or 3 5 h after the first peak at obs5 obs6 displayed a third peak at 26 2 h of 3 0 m3s 1 in response to the second peaks of both obs5 24 6 h 2 2 m3s 1 point b 24 7 h 0 4 m3s 1 and local reach 6 response in general fig 8 shows multi peaked hydrographs resulting from distinct hillslope and channel hydrologic responses further complicated by the attenuating effects of reach 6 as the soil wetness increased the time to peak shortened for each of the multiple peaks at each hydrograph observation location this was a product of increased subsurface surface and channelized flow velocities as the initial wetness increased the three peaked response at obs6 transitioned to a two peaked response for the amc dry15 and a single peaked response for the amc dry40 thomas et al 2016b described the streamflow response for amc m50 to wet02 occurring with a single peak the multi peak nature of hydrograph response nonlinear flow velocities and unique elongated river network combine to produce not only a consistent scale break location but also a peak flow scale invariance disruption in dry amc simulations the peak discharge power law scaling relationship for dry amc and low precipitation depths fig 5f benefited from the hydrograph analysis of reach 6 and its tributaries as described previously the streamflow response of the small scale system for p 5 and dry02 was multi peaked one peak represented precipitation falling on the stream or saturated near stream areas and the secondary response resulted fromthe larger subbasin the initial network dominated response followed a power law fit up to 9 km2 and then at greater than 28 km2 the first peak occurred at approximately the same time for all amc while the second peak occurred earlier with increased amc for conditions wetter than dry40 amc beaver creek displayed a singled peaked response the dominant peak discharge scale break occurred in the beaver creek watershed at approximately 20 km2 for wet amcs or high precipitation depth this differs from previous studies by ayalew et al 2014b and goodrich et al 1997 where scale breaks occurred at less than 1 km2 generally the resulting scale break locations in this study associated more closely with asquith and slade 1997 lee et al 2009 and thomas et al 2016b where the scale breaks were noted to occur at greater than 20 km2 varying scale break locations in each study may indicate a different driving process here the timing of hillslope and channel responses were shown to cause the predominant scale break location 4 3 scale break dependence on precipitation duration each previous amc precipitation simulation resulted in a relatively consistent scale break occurring between 9 km2 to 22 km2 breaks which occurred at small scales were dependent on peak flow timing the previous section described the influence of various factors such as basin topology and timing on the peak discharge scaling relationship where reach 6 and the surrounding tributaries acted to force a scale break at approximately 20 km2 ayalew et al 2014b noted a dependence of the scale break location on precipitation duration fig 9 shows from top left to bottom right the effects of rainfall duration on the peak flow scaling relationship increasing the rainfall duration while retaining the same intensity acted to shift the scaling relationship upwards generally increasing the intercept the intercept increased until the 4 h duration event from the 1 h duration simulation to the 4 h duration simulation θ1 increased asymptotically approaching 1 0 θ1 represents small drainage areas θ of 1 0 indicated all drainage areas below the scale break were responding uniformly ayalew et al 2014b θ2 represented larger drainage areas and rapidly increased from the 1 h duration event to the 5 h duration event asymptotically approaching 1 0 at rainfall durations of 6 h or greater the peak discharge scaled simply with drainage area in this case the entire system was in a fully saturated state and additional rainfall resulted in additional undelayed runoff 4 4 channel transmission losses goodrich et al 1997 argued that in stream transmission losses were one of the reasons behind the observed scale break in the semiarid walnut gulch watershed we investigated the role that channel transmission losses could play on the occurrence of scale breaks by initializing the stream beds of beaver creek watershed in a non saturated condition matching the remaining watershed amc this condition is representative of an ephemeral drainage way with the possibility of water loss into the stream bed fig 10 describes the effects an unsaturated stream bed on peak discharge scale invariance by assuming unsaturated stream beds α1 and α2 were reduced not shown here represented by a downward vertical translation of the peak flows in fig 10 g h as compared to saturated streams in fig 10 e f in the driest amcs α1 and α2 shift the most with a trend towards reduced influence of the amc as the initial condition became wetter the effects of the amc and channel wetness were less impactful for higher precipitation depths fig 10 d e showed that under dry amcs there was a large increase in rmse indicating a worsening regression fit the poor fit was a product of low rainfall depth and dry initial conditions and was observed for an amc of less than dry30 subsequently abp transitioned from 9 km2 to 20 km2 between dry30 and dry40 along with a rapid θ2 increase and erratic θ1 behavior in general initializing the stream as unsaturated provided a single peaked response throughout the entire system and a peak flow response which could be represented by a power law relationship in all amc precipitation scenarios simulated this is in contrast with the perennial stream system with a saturated stream bed which resulted in multi peak response and a breakdown of the scaling relationships for drier amcs and lower precipitation depths 5 discussion the results of this study indicated a large importance of the amc on peak discharge scaling relationships in wet amcs the watershed responded in a consistent single peaked manner across scales as amc decreased the hillslope response diverged from the direct rainfall instream response the mismatched timing of the two responses lead to increased regression errors and less predictive capability of the peak flow scaling relationship 5 1 dry amc and a multi peaked response this systematic analysis of precipitation depth and amc on peak flow scaling structure expanded on previous works ayalew et al 2014a 2015 2014b lee et al 2009 mandapaka et al 2009 through explicit inclusion of subsurface unsaturated flows and incorporating amcs in median to wet amcs thomas et al 2016b described the inter event variability of the flood scaling parameters pointing towards the expansion of amcs to dry conditions low precipitation depths and dry amc caused a multi peak response section 4 2 precipitation landing on saturated stream soils was converted directly to runoff propagating downstream more rapidly than precipitation which fell over dry hillslopes the second peak represented a hillslope response occurring increasingly late with drier amcs the second peak was offset from the maximum intensity precipitation by up to 17 h fig 8 the time of concentration for the whole basin is approximately 6 h such that a peak delayed by 17 h in the tributaries no longer represented surface transport this response was almost entirely subsurface in nature such that precipitation landing in the upstream hillslope locations infiltrated into the subsurface traveling vertically to the tile drainage layer flowing laterally through the drainage layer and into streams the phenomena was described by grayson et al 1997 and again by durighetto et al 2020 in that only topographically convergent areas responded during dry amcs with any surface response reabsorbed by downslope unsaturated locations peak discharge response for dry amcs and low precipitation events was largely controlled by the first peak as amcs became wetter both the hillslopes and topographically convergent stream locations responded more rapidly decreasing the first peak response time caused an increase in θ1 and θ2 corresponded well to other studies ayalew et al 2014a 2014b medhi and tripathi 2015 the first peak response time was bounded by the hyetograph peak such that the discharge peak could not end prior to the end of the maximum precipitation intensity with increasing amc wetness the two hydrograph peaks converged producing a largely single peaked response the single peaked response aligned with the peak in θ and the abp abrupt increase see figs 6 and 8 the hydrologic system becomes increasingly linear in its scaling with increased amc from strongly multi sloped with high rmse for dry amc to θ1 and θ2 approaching 1 0 followed by a divergent decrease of θ1 and θ2 this indicates an overwhelming convergence of the first stream peak and second hillslope peak into a single basin response after θmax and αmin the formation of a single peaked hydrograph forced the scale break beyond reach 6 shifting from approximately 10 km2 to 20 km2 once obtaining a single peak the scaling parameters largely followed similar trends with increasing amc for each precipitation depth θmax αmin and abp each occurred at a concurrent amc this amc of concurrence shifted to a drier amc with increased precipitation depth and at p 50 and p 100 was non existent the production of surface flow was more likely to occur with increasingly wet amcs where infiltration rates and subsurface storage are lower and in a similar manner increased precipitation depths overwhelmed the infiltration capabilities of the subsurface and more rapidly provided a surface driven hillslope response at lower amcs ayalew et al 2014b noted that α1 represented the discharge at 1 km2 such that α intrinsically includes the effects of infiltration and surface and subsurface storage as amcs become wetter infiltration reduces and runoff increases equating to a more rapid hillslope response and an increase in α here it was shown that with increasing hillslope response velocity θ reduces which concurs with results by ayalew et al 2014a and medhi and tripathi 2015 as the hydrologic system became wetter through either increased amc or increased precipitation depth θ1 asymptotically approached 1 0 a θ value of 1 0 suggested that the subbasins upstream of the scale break were saturated ayalew et al 2014b where often the duration of excess rainfall was greater than the time to concentration for the design storm analysis of section 4 1 in areas less than the scale break θ1 was greater than 1 0 in all cases deviating from the previous studies ayalew et al 2014a 2014b goodrich et al 1997 gupta et al 2007 mandapaka et al 2009 this was a product of basin topology forcing a common scale break location for most amc precipitation depth scenarios expanding this study to observations in smaller drainages would likely reveal an additional scale break and the location of saturated subbasins additional investigation into the effects of the rainfall duration in section 4 4 showed a dependence of abp on the rainfall duration ayalew et al 2014b completed a similar excess rainfall study finding a shift of the abp from less than 1 km2 to greater than 50 km2 for durations of 5 min to 6 h respectively for events less than 3 h the scale break remained constant anddependent upon the basin topology the scale breackshifted to an increased area between a 3 h and 6 h rainfall duration θ2 increased from a value of 0 1 to 1 0 over the range of precipitation durations obtaining a value of 1 0 for longer duration events an indication of saturated subbasin response the selection of numerical discretization hydrologic parameters and initialization of the surface and subsurface modeling domain impact the study findings the current discretization has an average surface element size of 0 18 ha larger element sizes result in a more averaged representation of the watershed e g slope land use soil type etc and its response to rainfall by refining the numerical mesh or increasing the resolution throughout the basin hillslopes would be steeper and previously unrepresented ephemeral waterways would be captured simulations would result in faster hillslope response initiation of ephemeral streams father upstream in the watershed and deeper thus faster channelized flow additionally a narrower wet stream bed initialization would result from smaller element sizes combining the effects of the faster hillslope and ephemeral stream response and the more limited nature of the channelized response would result in a lower likelihood of multi peaked event hydrographs power law scaling relationships would extend more readily into drier scenarios and not break down in response to multi peak system responses these effects are more pronounced upstream in the watershed and in drier conditions however the watershed scale topologic effects are still expected to dominate peak flow scale break locations future study would benefit from increased resolution and characterization of independent hillslope response 5 2 independence of scaling relationship for heavy precipitation with increasing precipitation depth the peak discharge power law relationships with drainage area became decreasingly dependent upon the amc showing statistically simple scaling gupta et al 2007 more specifically θ becomes less dependent upon the amc fig 6 p02 p01 while α acts to represent an initial system loss increasing in magnitude linearly with amc this becomes most clear in figs 5f and 6 where we see closely parallel regression fits for the highest and lowest amcs with a narrow scale break range only differentiated by the intercept as opposed to dry conditions this result indicated that all or most of the peak precipitation intensity resulted in runoff increased precipitation intensity resulted in increased depth of flow in hillslope locations thus increased velocity ayalew et al 2014b concluded that hillslope velocity was the key determinant controlling θ in this case amc directly impacted the hillslope velocity whereby velocity increased with increasing wetness with faster responding hillslopes the difference in response time between stream network was reduced if not eliminated providing a basin wide response 5 3 transmission losses and ephemeral systems channel transmission losses were suggested by asquith and slade 1997 and goodrich et al 1997 as the genesis of increasing non linearity in peak discharge scaling relationships or a scale break in this study transmission losses were evaluated through comparison of simulations initialized with and without stream channel saturation but parallel in all other facets sections 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 assumed an initially saturated stream while section 4 4 initialized the entire subsurface amc uniformly in space generally the occurrence and location of a break in peak discharge scaling relationships for simulations with transmission losses remained consistent to those without losses the abp only exhibited significant deviation in p 5 low amcs for transmission loss and saturated stream cases section 4 1 noted the lack of acceptable scaling relationship for dry amc and low precipitation depths indicated by a high rmse transmission loss simulations for low precipitation depths and amc always displayed a low rmse investigating the hydrographs not shown here indicated a single system response for all amc precipitation scenarios there was not a distinction between stream channel and hillslope responses as found in saturated stream scenarios for transmission loss simulations the entire system responded as a hillslope with timing and magnitude directly controlled by amc this provides further evidence that the high rmse in dry low rainfall depth saturated stream simulations were induced by a multi peaked subbasin response transmission loss scenarios tended to reduce α while maintaining θ consistent with saturated stream scenarios the largest differences in scaling parameters occurred in p 5 and dry amcs where transmission loss scenarios maintained reasonable rmse and subsequent scaling relationships scaling in dry amcs and saturated stream scenarios displayed an obvious multi peaked response causing an unorganized basin response and subsequently multi peaked large scale response when stream channels were initialized the same as upstream areas a single peaked response ensued such that the channel responded in unison with the hillslopes this highlights the influence of channel dynamics on peak flow production the basin shape and topology could be enough to mask the other effects of transmission losses on the flood scaling parameters as a scale break was still well defined at approximately 20 km2 here only the effects of transmission losses were isolated goodrich et al 1997 noted partial area rainfall as another factor affecting peak flow scaling it could be the case that partial area rainfall and channel transmission losses act together to significantly alter a basins hydrologic response but this was beyond the scope of this study together the research by schilling et al 2020 and gutierrez jurado et al 2019 describe the interplay between vegetation groundwater conditions precipitation rate and soil characteristics on the generation of flow or lack thereof in intermittent and ephemeral stream systems in this study only a single configuration was evaluated low hydraulic conductivity soils dominated by loam and clay loam type high intensity precipitation events consistent depth to groundwater and no initial surface water consistent with the findings of gutierrez jurado et al 2019 wet amcs or high rainfall intensities resulted in horton overland flow based peak flows which are less influenced by subsurface conditions however dry amcs and low rainfall intensities resulted in delayed interflow type peak flow responses in these interflow based runoff conditions gutierrez jurado et al 2019 found to depth to groundwater was a significant factor in runoff generation in this study high quality peak flow scaling relationships were observed when the runoff generation mechanism causing the peak flows was consistent throughout the watershed where a mismatch between runoff generation mechanisms occurred a breakdown of the power law scaling relationship was observed future work should draw upon work by carlier et al 2018a b gutierrez jurado et al 2019 and schilling et al 2020 and test the physical connection between peak flow scaling and runoff generation mechanisms this would provide a better understanding of the implications of perennial and ephemeral stream systems and those factors which affect runoff generation at the watershed scale 5 4 dry amc effects in iowa basin can be related to peak flow scaling over differing climates as noted by goodrich et al 1997 peak discharge scaling studies have historically been located in humid climatic regions defined by perennial streams and hydrologically active groundwater this study of the beaver creek watershed added to the list of humid peak flow scaling studies with the addition of a wide range of amcs and channel transmission losses due to dry stream bed the findings of this research can be applied to numerous basins in regions with perennial stream systems dry amcs act to provide a multi peaked response resulting from a slower hillslope response relative to the saturated stream response the multi peak response becomes increasingly susceptible to poor peak discharge scaling relationships caused by topologic variability a distinct multi peak hillslope stream response in a naturally occurring amc is less likely to take on the appearance it did in this study naturally occurring soil moisture is variable in space dependent upon local micro climate land use topographic location soils and depth to groundwater among other factors here stream channels were assumed fixed in location and saturated under all amc realistically the location of the initiation of surface flow varies with hydrologic condition such that stream extents expand in wet periods and contract in dry this suggests the reduction of direct precipitation stream flow response for dry amc lending the dry amc scenarios towards the results determined in section 4 4 for channel transmission losses additionally the groundwater below 1 m depth in this study is assumed saturated even with unsaturated stream conditions however in arid and semi arid climates the groundwater is often much deeper which would direct the infiltrated portion of rainfall towards longer regional flow patterns which may not respond in the manner presented in this study 6 summary and conclusion this study investigated the effects of amc rainfall duration and channel transmission losses on discharge drainage area power law scaling relationships the application of a physics based coupled surface subsurface model to a well studied iowa watershed allowed for a realistic representation of amcs the results of this study indicated a large importance of the amc on peak discharge scaling relationships in wet amcs the watershed responded in a consistent single peaked manner across scales as amc decreased the hillslope response diverged from the direct rainfall instream response the mismatched timing of the two responses leads to increased regression errors and less predictive capability of the scale invariance fits the multi peak nature of hydrograph response nonlinear flow velocities and unique elongated river network combine to produce not only a consistent scale break location but also a peak flow scale invariance break down in dry simulations with increasing precipitation depth the peak discharge power law relationships with drainage area became decreasingly dependent upon the amc in transmission loss investigations stream channels were initialized with the same amc as upstream areas a single peaked response ensued whereby the channel and hillslope responded in tandem this study adds to our current understanding of the physical basis of the variability of the scaling structure of peak discharges that is observed in single rainfall runoff events by investigating the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry antecedent soil moisture conditions study results were derived from a systematic set of synthetic rainfall and amcs although based on a realistic representation of the beaver creek watershed the results require additional verification to confirm the applicability of the principal conclusions to other watersheds credit authorship contribution statement nicholas w thomas

232,peak discharge to drainage area relationships are widely applied engineering solutions for design flood estimation in ungauged basins in this study we investigated the effects of antecedent moisture conditions amc rainfall duration and channel transmission losses on discharge drainage area power law scaling relationships the spatial organization of peak discharges were evaluated through coupled surface subsurface physics based numerical modeling we take advantage past research and the detailed flexibility of hydrogeosphere the numerical modeling platform to systematically vary amc and rainfall depths evolving the current understanding of the effects on discharge drainage area relationships channel network dynamics in the beaver creek watershed dominated the location of a scale break or the location where the log log linear relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is best described by two or more slopes single peaked hydrographs and high quality power law scaling relationships resulted from wet amc conditions or high precipitation depths as we reduced the amc under low rainfall depths the hillslope response diverged from the channel response providing an unorganized system response no longer fitting the power law scaling relationship additionally when initializing the system under losing stream conditions where the stream channel is assumed unsaturated a single peaked response ensued whereby the channel and hillslope responded in unison this study adds to our current understanding of the physical basis of the variability of the scaling structure of peak discharges that is observed in single rainfall runoff events by investigating the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry antecedent soil moisture conditions keywords antecedent moisture conditions scaling floods hillslope numerical modeling channel transmission losses 1 introduction regional flood frequency equations are mainly based on the power law scaling relationship between peak discharge quantiles and drainage area that is stated as qp a αaθ where a is the drainage area normalized by a unit drainage area α m3s 1 is the flood scaling intercept θ is the flood scaling exponent and qp m3s 1 is the peak discharge corresponding to a given exceedance probability p these peak discharge quantile scaling relationships are used extensively for design flood estimation in ungauged basins ries 2007 although the first published work on peak flow scaling relationships with drainage area dates back to the early 1900 s widespread adoption of standardized flood scaling relationships in the united states was born from the united states national flood insurance program as described by dawdy et al 2012 shortly after the publication of bulletin 15 wrc 1967 which looked to develop a uniform technique for determining flood frequency the federal emergency management agency fema and the united states geological survey usgs adopted the procedure making it widely applied and accepted since the adoption of bulletin 15 application of peak flow scaling relationships have expanded to many engineering applications that range from floodplain mapping to design of hydraulic structures such as bridges culverts and dams ries 2007 earlier studies were geared towards understanding the physical processes that control the regional variability of the flood scaling parameters prediction of these scaling parameters was the overarching goal of early studies using rainfall and a catchment s physical properties as explanatory variables in river basins where peak discharge observation is scarce bloschl and sivapalan 1997 gupta and dawdy 1995 merz and bloschl 2003 robinson and sivapalan 1997a robinson and sivapalan 1997b smith 1992 these studies which are based on the evaluation of peak discharge quantiles over large geographic regions provided significant insights on factors that control the variability of the flood scaling parameters from one geographic region to another gupta and dawdy 1995 are among the first to study the regional variability of the flood scaling parameters they showed that in some hydrologic regions of the u s peak discharge quantiles exhibit multiscaling properties where in others simple scaling was prevalent multiscaling occurs when the flood scaling exponent varies with return period and simple scaling of peak discharge quantiles is achieved when the flood scaling exponent remains constant irrespective of the return period they argued that simple scaling which is prevalent in regions where the annual maximum peak discharges are dominated by snowmelt generated runoff is due to the more spatially uniform characteristics of snow melt runoff responses they also suggested that the multi scaling property of peak discharge quantiles observed in regions where rainfall driven floods occur is a manifestation of the increasing spatial variability of rainfall with increasing scale these results were further reinforced by ogden and dawdy 2003 who reported on simple scaling peak discharge quantile patterns in the humid goodwin creek experimental watershed a 21km2 that is located in mississippi u s and goodrich et al 1997 who reported on multi scaling spatial organization of peak discharge quantiles in the semiarid walnut gulch watershed a 148km2 located in arizona u s in general these studies have shown that simple scaling of peak discharge quantiles as a function of drainage area is the exception rather than the norm continuing on the trajectory of studying the regional variability of the spatial scaling structure of peak discharge quantiles merz and bloschl 2003 studied peak floods obtained from 490 australian catchments by specifically classifying the observed peak floods into long rain floods short rain floods flash floods rain on snow floods and snowmelt floods they showed how the regional variability of the spatial scaling structure of peak discharge quantiles can be described by the regional variability of the physical processes that control the generation of peak floods in space and time other notable studies along the same line of research have investigated the regional variability of the relationship between the coefficient of variation cv of peak discharges and basin scale e g bloschl and sivapalan 1997 robinson and sivapalan 1997a smith 1992 for example bloschl and sivapalan 1997 showed how the cv is affected by the interplay among rainfall duration rainfall intensity catchment response time base flow and nonlinear runoff processes including threshold effects flood quantile based studies that are briefly summarized above provided important insights into the processes that control the regional variability of peak discharge quantile scaling structure more recent studies argue that efforts to connect the regional variability of the flood scaling parameters to physical processes that control the occurrence of peak discharges in space and time should focus on analyzing peak discharges observed in single rainfall runoff events in nested watersheds e g ayalew et al 2014b dawdy et al 2012 furey and gupta 2005 gupta 2004 peak discharge quantiles in each geographic region may come from different rainfall runoff events that occurred in separate catchments that do not share a drainage network moreover annual maximum peak discharges observed at different locations within a single river basin could also come from different rainfall runoff events that occurred at different times of the year as a result it is difficult to connect the observed spatial scaling structure of peak discharge quantiles to the physical process that control the generation of peak discharges at the scale of single rainfall runoff events to this end a number of studies have been conducted with an overarching goal of understanding the physical basis of the observed event to event variability of the peak discharge scaling structure e g ayalew et al 2014a 2015 2014b furey and gupta 2005 2007 mantilla et al 2006 2011 menabde and sivapalan 2001 menabde et al 2001 thomas et al 2016a these studies collectively address how the peak discharge scaling structure is controlled by event to event variability in particular the interplay among rainfall and catchment physical properties such as rainfall intensity rainfall duration antecedent soil moisture catchment travel time hillslope overland flow velocity and channel flow velocity however previous efforts have not focused on or have had challenges parsing out the effects of antecedent soil moisture on peak flow scaling ayalew et al 2014b was the only study to address soil moisture through varying the runoff coefficient in a hillslope link numerical framework this study identified a unified hillslope channel repsonse in wetter conditions transitioning to a multi peaked response in drier soil moisture states many studies have noted the prevalence of a scale break abp or the location where the log log linear relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is best described by two or more slopes previous work within the study watershed by thomas et al 2016b noted a scale break occurring at approximately 20 km2 in studies investigating smaller scales where scale breaks occurred the scale breaks consistently developed at 0 5 km2 goodrich et al 1997 mandapaka et al 2009 ayalew et al 2014b indicated that the scale break location represented a transition from hillslope dominated flow mechanisms to stream network dominated scaling processes abp found in thomas et al 2016b occurred at a much larger scale and became increasingly variable in its location with varying antecedent moisture conditions amc goodrich et al 1997 proposed the effects of partial area rainfall and channel transmission losses and the likely causes of the scale break at approximately 0 5 km2 at larger scales lee et al 2009 found the network structure to be important abrupt changes in drainage area contribution to beaver creek through tributary inflows were correlated with large shifts in the power law regression asquith and slade 1997 found a scale break in the relationship between annual peak discharge quantiles and drainage area in some hydrologic regions of texas for which they established regional flood frequency equations the scale break is observed at about 83 km2 and they attributed it to partial area rainfall coverage although scale breaks and the rationale behind them have been identified though several past studies the role which amc has in defining if a break occurs and the location is at least mostly unknown this study continues to expand the evaluation of peak flow scale invariance through advanced numerical modeling platforms which include couple surface subsurface dynamics thomas et al 2016a showed through application of coupled surface subsurface modeling that peak flow scale invariance held for a range of realistic wet antecented soil conditions wetness of the landscape precipitation intensity and in particular soil characteristics were shown to be critical in runoff generation in arid and semi arid areas where streams are empheral gutiérrez jurado et al 2019 schilling et al 2020 systematic coupled surface subsurface investigations of the subsurface properties and the impacts to flow generation mechanisms by carlier et al 2018a b showed an important differentiation between meterologic and geologic control over flow response our work adds to the current understanding of the variability of peak discharge scaling structure we ascribe a physical basis of the spatial organization of peak discharges under dry antecedent moisture conditions for single runoff events the results will shed light on how different antecedent soil moisture conditions can explain some of the regional variability of the peak discharge scaling relationship moreover we investigate how the scale break in the spatial scaling relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is also controlled by the drainage network geometry in addition to other catchment physical variables results presented below are based on numerical experimentation through physically based coupled surface subsurface simulation the reminder of the paper is organized as follows we discuss the study area and the numerical methodology in sections 2 and 3 in section 4 we present the results from our investigation of the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry conditions we also present how the interplay between the drainage network geometry and rainfall duration controls the spatial scale at which a scale break in the power law relationship between peak discharge and drainage area occurs the effect of channel transmission losses which is prevalent in ephemeral streams on the scaling structure is also discussed in this section we follow this by a detailed discussion of the results in section 5 we adjourn the paper with brief concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area this study was conducted in the 45 km2 beaver creek watershed that is in northeastern iowa u s fig 1 elevations range from 364 m in the uplands to 305 m at the outlet the watershed tends towards milder slopes in the northern uplands and relatively steeper slopes in the south the watershed is represented by more than 70 corn and soybean agriculture and more than 90 of the surficial soil textures are classified as loam or clay loam the beaver creek watershed lies in a humid continental climactic region characterized by large temperature and precipitation variations average annual precipitation ranges from 850 mm to 910 mm hutchinson and christiansen 2013 with approximately 75 lost to evapotranspiration sanford and selnick 2013 schilling and helmers 2008 below freezing temperatures occur annually resulting in frozen ground and a portion of the annual precipitation accumulating as snow however 70 of the annual precipitation occurs between march and july with the largest flows resulting from convective thunderstorms analysis of historical soil cores provided evidence of an unoxidized clay till between 1 m and 18 m below the surface exhibiting a significant reduction in vertical hydraulic conductivity bakhsh et al 2004 eidem et al 1999 schilling and tassier surine 2006 seo 1996 3 methods 3 1 numerical model description we simulated peak discharge events with hydrogeosphere hgs a coupled surface subsurface hydrologic modeling software therrien and sudicky 1996 in this model flow through a three dimensional subsurface domain is solved by the variably saturated form of the richards equation therrien and sudicky 1996 capable of realistically simulating saturated and unsaturated flow conditions surface flow is solved in two dimensions by the depth averaged diffusion wave approximation to the st venant equations therrien and sudicky 1996 the surface and subsurface domains are coupled through a dual node approach where fluid flux from one domain to the other is controlled by the difference in hydraulic head vertical hydraulic conductivity and a coupling length winter hydrological process including snowfall snow accumulation and snow melt are simulated at each node through the degree day method and the pore water freeze and thaw by the stefan s equation as described in schilling et al 2019 for a complete model description the reader is referred to panday and huyakorn 2004 therrien et al 2013 beaver creek watershed and this numerical model have been an integral component of the iowa watersheds project iwp as such the details of the basin and model construction were previously detailed by thomas et al 2016a and thomas et al 2016b 3 2 numerical model construction coupled surface subsurface flow simulations were performed on an unstructured grid produced with gridgen v15 pointwise inc 2003 gridgen automatically populates triangular mesh elements within input boundaries a two dimensional triangular surface mesh was the product of the lateral watershed boundary and stream network representing the local topographic highs and lows respectively the mesh resolution was increased near the stream channel and reduced in overland low slope areas variable mesh resolution provided a more realistic representation of fluid flux while retaining numerical efficiency li et al 2008 triangular surface elements ranged in size from 200 m2 in the overland flatter sloped regions to 25 m2 near the stream channel the subsurface was represented by 16 numerical layers which were divided into two zones from the surface down 1 m and from a depth of 1 m to the unoxidized till layer described in section 2 0 the unoxidized till was assumed to represent an impermeable layer and the impermeable bottom of the subsurface domain from the surface down 1 m subsurface elements ranged in depth from 0 025 m near the surface to 0 25 m with each numerical layer parallel to the surface one 0 1 m thick layer was incorporated at a 1 0 m depth to represent the hydrologic impact of tile drainage thomas et al 2016a the remaining lower domain was divided into five layers which increased in thickness from approximately 0 6 m to 1 7 m these lower layers smoothly transition from parallel with the surface to parrallel with the domain bottom increased grid resolution near the top of the subsurface domain provided a better description of surface subsurface coupling and near surface soil moisture storage the product of mesh generation was a 212 993 node 371 460 element three dimensional finite element mesh surface nodes were allocated elevation information based on a lidar derived digital elevation model iowa 2010 overland surface roughness varied in space according to common land unit clu land use classifications usda 2013 table 1 and fig 2 and literature values chow 1959 mattocks and forbes 2008 the top one meter of subsurface soils were described spatially by the soil survey geographic ssurgo database soil survey staff 2014 and soil water retention parameters were assigned based on the mean rosetta soil textural classification schaap and leij 1998a 1998b 2000 schaap et al 2001 table 2 the tile drainage layer was allocated a high hydraulic conductivity creating a faster subsurface response deeper subsurface soils were aggregated to produce a single uniform subsurface characterization below a depth of 1 m fig 2 table 2 no flow boundaries were assumed along the lateral and bottom watershed surfaces for both the surface and subsurface elements except the stream channel outlet was assumed to be a normal depth outflow condition rainfall was applied uniformly to the entire watershed for a complete description of model construction and characterization see thomas et al 2016a and thomas et al 2016b this model has not been calibrated as noted in thomas et al 2016b as traditional stream flow calibration data were not available with the beaver creek watershed without available streamflow data calibration to other metrics was determined to be inappropriate although this study focuses on event based durations the model has been applied continuously to simulating hydrologic processes over multiple annual cycles as shown in thomas el al 2016b in lieu of traditional calibration targets the numerical model was validated to known annual and event to event ratios between components of the hydrologic cycle for the year 2015 studies from iowa and other agriculturally dominated central u s areas were selected for validation targets table 3 the target ratios used were discharge to precipitation q p evapotranspiration to precipitation et p evaporation to evapotranspiration e et transpiration to evapotranspiration t et and baseflow to discharge qb q a validation period of 2015 was selected over the validation period precipitation was divided into 40 stream flow and 60 et table 3 these water balance components trend well from a wet state 2014 prior year toward the target of 30 q 70 et et was divided into 39 e 61 t consistent with calibration results and moving toward the 30 70 e t calibration target baseflow represented 55 of the total flow fitting the water balance metrics well in addition to partitioning of rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration thomas et al 2016a showed that subsurface and tile drainage flow in response to rainfall events was represented in a physically realistic manner stream stage sensors at three locations within the watershed were available for the 2015 year the sensor nearest to the outlet downstream of obs10 fig 1 was selected to evaluate timing as compared to the simulated results although the magnitude cannot be directly compared the simulated peaks and valleys as compared to the observed stage showed the system provided a representative response time fig 3 shows an event in april 2015 where initiation of stream flow was consistent between observed and simulated results occurring late on april 7th a series of rainfall events between april 8 10th resulted in a hydrograph peak early on april 10th the simulated peak occurred approximately in time with the observed peak the objectives of this study do not require the exact prediction of water balance components peak flows or soil water content values rather the study should be viewed as a numerical experiment on a realistic watershed representation confidence in the numerical representation of beaver creek watershed at the simulation results were gained through application of physics based modeling appropriate parameterization proper partitioning of water balance components and the timing of simulated peak flows as compared to stream stage observations although not calibrated this model provides an opportunity to experiment with the physical characteristics underlying peak discharge scaling under dry amcs 3 3 systematic analysis of amc and design storm rainfall the analysis completed by thomas et al 2016b was extended in this study to examine exceedingly dry amc for a range of 24 h design storm depths by a similar methodology 10 years of measured hourly soil moisture data was aggregated from the ames ia usa soil climate analysis network scan usda nrcs 2015 soil moisture was recorded continuously at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm the ames scan site is located roughly 150 km southwest at an elevation of 327 m in finely textured loamy material and is located adjacent to an active cropland using data from this scan site was assumed to be representative of the beaver creek watershed due to the similarity in the soil texture land use elevation and climate characteristics we independently normalized soil moisture measurements to the maximum observation at each measurement depth the results of normalization were sorted ranked and plotted for each measurement depth fig 4 this provided a cumulative distribution function of soil moisture values from wet to dry conditions fig 4 table 4 amcs were extracted for the 0 02 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 wet exceedance probabilities wet the 0 02 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 dry exceedance probabilities dry and the median 0 50 m wetness condition these soil conditions represent a realistic range from exceedingly wet to median and median to exceedingly dry soil moisture conditions fig 4 table 4 dry and wet exceedance probability soil moisture values were used as initial conditions these soil moistures were applied uniformly in space and varied only for the top 1 m of the soil below one meter deep soils were assumed saturated per analysis of the 100 cm measurement depth at the scan site computational cells located below the stream channel were initialized as saturated as beaver creek is a perennial stream channel which was assumed to be directly connected to near surface groundwater stream depths vary spatial though the watershed and temporally with response to hydrologic conditions for instance in wetter amcs baseflow and thus initial stream flow depth would be expected to be elevated to focus this study on only the effects of soil amcs on stream flow model surface was assumed dry or without any ponded water on the landscape including stream channels a 24 h duration design storm was applied uniformly in space as a surface boundary condition atlas 14 point precipitation depth frequency estimates for the 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return period 24 h rainfall events were selected for simulation perica et al 2013 table 5 point precipitation frequency estimates were collected at the basin centroid spatial characteristics of heavy rainfall events in the midwest indicated that point precipitation estimates were only applicable for areas up to 25 km2 huff 1992 the study watershed area is 45 km2 resulting in a point precipitation estimate reduction of 1 5 due to the limited reduction of precipitation depths specified areal reduction of point precipitation frequency estimates was not performed in this study design storm rainfall depths were allocated in time by the scs type ii distribution assuming the maximum precipitation intensity occurs at hour 12 or center loaded mccuen 2005 and uniformly in space huff 1992 we applied five 24 h design storms to 17 amc initializations totaling to 85 scenarios these scenarios described the basin response under dry to wet amc and medium to heavy precipitation events each simulation was run for the duration of the 24 h event and an additional 72 h which allowed for stream flow to return to near baseflow conditions simulated stream discharge response was reported at 10 locations along beaver creek fig 1a and a limited tributary locations see fig 1a and d output hydrographs and peak discharges were analyzed for the range of amc and design storm depths to explore the induced variability in streamflow response 3 4 peak flow scaling relationship many studies have investigated the influence of various drivers on the parameters of the power law scaling of peak discharge with drainage area these studies associated shifts in scaling properties to amc without the ability to directly investigate these phenomena here these effects are investigated by estimating peak discharge scaling relationships in the form of eq 1 resulting from numerical simulations 1 q a α a θ where q m3s 1 is the peak surface discharge resulting from a numerical simulation a is the drainage area normalized by a unit drainage area which simplifies the expression by making the parameter unitless α m3s 1 is the scaling intercept and θ is the scaling exponent also referred to as the slope in log log space the methodology proposed and demonstrated in main et al 1999 was followed to detect statistically significant breaks of the scaling exponent first a regression model with two slopes was set up and the drainage area at which a scale break occurs was determined if it exists by maximizing a modified version of schwarz s information criterion bic twoslopes this exercise results in two sets of intercepts and slopes α1 θ1 α2 and θ2 the bic of the regression model that is based on a single slope bic oneslope was then calculated a scale break quantitatively exists i e a double slope regression model is statistically better than a single slope model if bic twoslopes is greater than bic oneslope the statistical significance of the slopes θ1 and θ2 of the double sloped model was tested by estimating the confidence intervals of the two slopes conditional on the drainage area at which the scale break occurs also called change point using a standard multiple regression theory please refer to main et al 1999 for a detailed description of the methodology 3 5 scale break dependence on rainfall duration the location of the scale break was further investigated in a similar manner as ayalew et al 2014b a 100 year 1 h precipitation intensity was selected 88 9 mmh 1 and applied uniformly in time and space across the entire basin for increasing durations as was noted in ayalew et al 2014b the scale break or onset of multiple scaling relationships disappeared when the duration of excess precipitation reached the basins time of concentration or when flow from all locations in the watershed reaches the outlet the 100 year 1 h precipitation was applied for a systematically increasing duration from 1 h to 12 h the peak discharge scale invariance relationship was studied for the change in regression parameters and scale break location 3 6 transmission losses here we studied the influence of channel transmission losses on the scaling structure of peak discharges by initializing the stream channel locations with the same amc as the rest of the watershed in other words the stream channel is assumed to have the same amc as the adjacent hillslopes instead of our earlier assumption where the stream channel is always wet the peak discharge relationship with drainage area was compared to those without transmission losses 4 results the following section focuses on the major differences between wet and dry amc peak flow production results from the following analyses are addressed comparison of wet and dry peak discharge variation with drainage area transition from multi scaling to a break down in peak flow scale invariance factors affecting scale break locations and testing previously proposed hypotheses regrading amc on peak flow scaling with variable precipitation duration and channel transmission losses 4 1 systematic analysis of amc and design storm rainfall fig 5 displays the influence of amc and design storm precipitation depth on both hydrograph propagation and peak discharge scaling with drainage area fig 5 a b d e displays peak flow hydrographs normalized to the maximum outlet discharge for each precipitation amc scenario the effects of increasing precipitation depth produced a larger and faster peak flow response as shown by viewing fig 5 from top to bottom p 5 to p 100 while increasing amc from dry to wet produced a larger magnitude faster stream flow response at each of the selected observation locations as shown by viewing in fig 5 from left to right dry02 to wet02 the largest and fastest streamflow response occurred under wet amc and large precipitation depths fig 5e all scenarios produced single peaked hydrographs at each reported observation location except for dry amcs and low precipitation depth scenarios fig 5a peak discharge described by drainage area plots are shown in fig 5 c f g h high rainfall depths fig 5f and wet amcs fig 5h produced consistent multi sloped power relationships for all amc cyan colored in these cases peak flows increased with a scale break in the power law relationship between peak discharge and drainage area occurring at approximately 20 km2 with an increase in amc or precipitation depth the intercept increased causing an upward shift in the multi scaling relationships as amcs became drier and or the precipitation depth decreased fig 5c g a power law relationship could no longer describe the variation in peak discharge scaling a two segment power law fit could not be achieved for dry amc s and low design storm depths fig 5c g as denoted by the pink areas specifically for p 5 conditions drier than dry25 did not exhibit consistent scaling similarly for dry02 rainfall depths less than p 10 were unable to achieve adequate peak discharge scaling across all drainage areas in general as precipitation depth was increased the hydrologic response simplified regardless of the soil amc fig 6 for these high precipitation depths p 50 p 100 α1 and α2 increased linearly with increasing amc the scaling slopes θ1 and θ2 asymptotically approached 1 0 and 0 25 respectively in the driest and wettest amc p 50 simulations showed less variability for θ1 and θ2 at lower amcs while p 100 continuously decreased as precipitation depth decreased θ1 and θ2 increased with increasing amc peaking at dry10 p 25 dry25 p 10 and dry25 dry30 p 5 after the increasing trend the regression slopes decreased asymptotically approaching 0 25 and 1 0 for θ1 and θ2 respectively the peak in θ1 and θ2 amc relationships corresponded to a local minimum for α1 and α2 an abrupt shift of abp from approximately 10 km2 to 20 km2 and low rmse values after the peak in θ abp and rmse tended to remain consistent while α1 and α2 continued to increase linearly with amc high rmse resulted from dry amc and low rainfall depths evidence of a poor regression fit in cases with high rmse the scale break occurred at approximately 10 km2 followed by an abrupt shift to 20 km2 and a reduced rmse along with the scale break location the slope before the abrupt jump tended to increase with increasing wetness and continued decreasing after the rmse dropped 4 2 effect of the drainage network geometry on the scale break the beaver creek watershed has an elongated shape and a distinct river network whereby a single main stream beaver creek flows from north to south with minor tributaries adding drainage area in a relatively uniform manner figs 1 7 table 6 at approximately 1 km intervals along beaver creek a new tributary was added between reach 2 and reach 5 providing a relatively consistent addition of drainage area 3 2 km2 km table 6 reach 6 diverts from this trend as the new tributaries were not added for the longest main channel reach 4 8 km followed by the addition of the largest tributary 8 4 km2 drainage area addition along the remainder of beaver creek from reach 7 to reach 11 once again became more consistent 4 3 km2 km table 6 the combination of a significant attenuating feature reach 6 followed by a large downstream increase of drainage area tributary ab acted to separate the responses of the upstream basin from the downstream basin upstream of reach 6 hydrographs were predominantly single peaked in reach 6 peak flows were delayed and attenuated this acted to shift the scaling relationship from a rapid increase of peak discharge with increasing drainage area high slope to a lesser sloped increase reach 6 disconnected the basin response in exceedingly dry amcs creating a multi peaked response and a discontinuous scaling relationship dry amcs exacerbated the reach 6 attenuation effects as the hydrologic system responded with two unique pulses fig 8 a fig 8 expands on the normalized hydrograph described in fig 5 isolating the input peak flow hydrographs into and out of reach 6 fig 1d the most upstream observation in the largest tributary addition to reach 6 is represented in fig 8a followed by the next downstream observation on the tributary prior to the junction with beaver creek fig 8b each frame of fig 8 describes the basin response to a single design storm depth p 5 and the range of amc from dry to median dry02 to m50 the first peak in the upstream tributary location fig 8a white points occurred at 12 h into the simulations and is in response to precipitation falling directly on a saturated streambed here all the precipitation is converted to runoff and immediately transported downstream this first peak increased with increasing soil wetness likely corresponding to an expansion of the stream area and associated directly connected stream response a second hydrograph peak discharge was observed in fig 8a black points for the entire range of dry to median amc dry02 to m50 the magnitude of the second peak increased while the time to peak decreased with increasing soil wetness the response of the upstream subbasin shown in fig 8a was not unique rather it represented an archetype for the hillslope response throughout the watershed timing magnitude and multi peaked nature of the small scale responses fig 8a compounded in the elongated beaver creek watershed producing an unorganized multi peaked system response reach 6 was further investigated for its influence on timing of hydrograph peak flows obs5 and tributary observation point b are the primary flow inputs to obs 6 as shown in fig 8b c and d respectively for the driest amc dry02 both observation point b and obs5 displayed a two peaked streamflow response as the initial soil wetness increased beyond dry25 obs5 responses became single peaked while observation point b retained its dual peak nature the first peak represented the largest magnitude response at observation point b up to amc m50 for the dry02 amc the first peak at observation point b was 3 5 m3s 1 occurring at 12 3 h the first peak at obs6 occurred at 12 7 h of 3 1 m3s 1 primarily reflecting the attenuated first peak of tributary ab the first peak at obs5 occurred at 14 1 h for the dry02 amc this peak traveled into and through the 4 8 km reach 6 at obs6 the second peak occurred at 17 5 h or 3 5 h after the first peak at obs5 obs6 displayed a third peak at 26 2 h of 3 0 m3s 1 in response to the second peaks of both obs5 24 6 h 2 2 m3s 1 point b 24 7 h 0 4 m3s 1 and local reach 6 response in general fig 8 shows multi peaked hydrographs resulting from distinct hillslope and channel hydrologic responses further complicated by the attenuating effects of reach 6 as the soil wetness increased the time to peak shortened for each of the multiple peaks at each hydrograph observation location this was a product of increased subsurface surface and channelized flow velocities as the initial wetness increased the three peaked response at obs6 transitioned to a two peaked response for the amc dry15 and a single peaked response for the amc dry40 thomas et al 2016b described the streamflow response for amc m50 to wet02 occurring with a single peak the multi peak nature of hydrograph response nonlinear flow velocities and unique elongated river network combine to produce not only a consistent scale break location but also a peak flow scale invariance disruption in dry amc simulations the peak discharge power law scaling relationship for dry amc and low precipitation depths fig 5f benefited from the hydrograph analysis of reach 6 and its tributaries as described previously the streamflow response of the small scale system for p 5 and dry02 was multi peaked one peak represented precipitation falling on the stream or saturated near stream areas and the secondary response resulted fromthe larger subbasin the initial network dominated response followed a power law fit up to 9 km2 and then at greater than 28 km2 the first peak occurred at approximately the same time for all amc while the second peak occurred earlier with increased amc for conditions wetter than dry40 amc beaver creek displayed a singled peaked response the dominant peak discharge scale break occurred in the beaver creek watershed at approximately 20 km2 for wet amcs or high precipitation depth this differs from previous studies by ayalew et al 2014b and goodrich et al 1997 where scale breaks occurred at less than 1 km2 generally the resulting scale break locations in this study associated more closely with asquith and slade 1997 lee et al 2009 and thomas et al 2016b where the scale breaks were noted to occur at greater than 20 km2 varying scale break locations in each study may indicate a different driving process here the timing of hillslope and channel responses were shown to cause the predominant scale break location 4 3 scale break dependence on precipitation duration each previous amc precipitation simulation resulted in a relatively consistent scale break occurring between 9 km2 to 22 km2 breaks which occurred at small scales were dependent on peak flow timing the previous section described the influence of various factors such as basin topology and timing on the peak discharge scaling relationship where reach 6 and the surrounding tributaries acted to force a scale break at approximately 20 km2 ayalew et al 2014b noted a dependence of the scale break location on precipitation duration fig 9 shows from top left to bottom right the effects of rainfall duration on the peak flow scaling relationship increasing the rainfall duration while retaining the same intensity acted to shift the scaling relationship upwards generally increasing the intercept the intercept increased until the 4 h duration event from the 1 h duration simulation to the 4 h duration simulation θ1 increased asymptotically approaching 1 0 θ1 represents small drainage areas θ of 1 0 indicated all drainage areas below the scale break were responding uniformly ayalew et al 2014b θ2 represented larger drainage areas and rapidly increased from the 1 h duration event to the 5 h duration event asymptotically approaching 1 0 at rainfall durations of 6 h or greater the peak discharge scaled simply with drainage area in this case the entire system was in a fully saturated state and additional rainfall resulted in additional undelayed runoff 4 4 channel transmission losses goodrich et al 1997 argued that in stream transmission losses were one of the reasons behind the observed scale break in the semiarid walnut gulch watershed we investigated the role that channel transmission losses could play on the occurrence of scale breaks by initializing the stream beds of beaver creek watershed in a non saturated condition matching the remaining watershed amc this condition is representative of an ephemeral drainage way with the possibility of water loss into the stream bed fig 10 describes the effects an unsaturated stream bed on peak discharge scale invariance by assuming unsaturated stream beds α1 and α2 were reduced not shown here represented by a downward vertical translation of the peak flows in fig 10 g h as compared to saturated streams in fig 10 e f in the driest amcs α1 and α2 shift the most with a trend towards reduced influence of the amc as the initial condition became wetter the effects of the amc and channel wetness were less impactful for higher precipitation depths fig 10 d e showed that under dry amcs there was a large increase in rmse indicating a worsening regression fit the poor fit was a product of low rainfall depth and dry initial conditions and was observed for an amc of less than dry30 subsequently abp transitioned from 9 km2 to 20 km2 between dry30 and dry40 along with a rapid θ2 increase and erratic θ1 behavior in general initializing the stream as unsaturated provided a single peaked response throughout the entire system and a peak flow response which could be represented by a power law relationship in all amc precipitation scenarios simulated this is in contrast with the perennial stream system with a saturated stream bed which resulted in multi peak response and a breakdown of the scaling relationships for drier amcs and lower precipitation depths 5 discussion the results of this study indicated a large importance of the amc on peak discharge scaling relationships in wet amcs the watershed responded in a consistent single peaked manner across scales as amc decreased the hillslope response diverged from the direct rainfall instream response the mismatched timing of the two responses lead to increased regression errors and less predictive capability of the peak flow scaling relationship 5 1 dry amc and a multi peaked response this systematic analysis of precipitation depth and amc on peak flow scaling structure expanded on previous works ayalew et al 2014a 2015 2014b lee et al 2009 mandapaka et al 2009 through explicit inclusion of subsurface unsaturated flows and incorporating amcs in median to wet amcs thomas et al 2016b described the inter event variability of the flood scaling parameters pointing towards the expansion of amcs to dry conditions low precipitation depths and dry amc caused a multi peak response section 4 2 precipitation landing on saturated stream soils was converted directly to runoff propagating downstream more rapidly than precipitation which fell over dry hillslopes the second peak represented a hillslope response occurring increasingly late with drier amcs the second peak was offset from the maximum intensity precipitation by up to 17 h fig 8 the time of concentration for the whole basin is approximately 6 h such that a peak delayed by 17 h in the tributaries no longer represented surface transport this response was almost entirely subsurface in nature such that precipitation landing in the upstream hillslope locations infiltrated into the subsurface traveling vertically to the tile drainage layer flowing laterally through the drainage layer and into streams the phenomena was described by grayson et al 1997 and again by durighetto et al 2020 in that only topographically convergent areas responded during dry amcs with any surface response reabsorbed by downslope unsaturated locations peak discharge response for dry amcs and low precipitation events was largely controlled by the first peak as amcs became wetter both the hillslopes and topographically convergent stream locations responded more rapidly decreasing the first peak response time caused an increase in θ1 and θ2 corresponded well to other studies ayalew et al 2014a 2014b medhi and tripathi 2015 the first peak response time was bounded by the hyetograph peak such that the discharge peak could not end prior to the end of the maximum precipitation intensity with increasing amc wetness the two hydrograph peaks converged producing a largely single peaked response the single peaked response aligned with the peak in θ and the abp abrupt increase see figs 6 and 8 the hydrologic system becomes increasingly linear in its scaling with increased amc from strongly multi sloped with high rmse for dry amc to θ1 and θ2 approaching 1 0 followed by a divergent decrease of θ1 and θ2 this indicates an overwhelming convergence of the first stream peak and second hillslope peak into a single basin response after θmax and αmin the formation of a single peaked hydrograph forced the scale break beyond reach 6 shifting from approximately 10 km2 to 20 km2 once obtaining a single peak the scaling parameters largely followed similar trends with increasing amc for each precipitation depth θmax αmin and abp each occurred at a concurrent amc this amc of concurrence shifted to a drier amc with increased precipitation depth and at p 50 and p 100 was non existent the production of surface flow was more likely to occur with increasingly wet amcs where infiltration rates and subsurface storage are lower and in a similar manner increased precipitation depths overwhelmed the infiltration capabilities of the subsurface and more rapidly provided a surface driven hillslope response at lower amcs ayalew et al 2014b noted that α1 represented the discharge at 1 km2 such that α intrinsically includes the effects of infiltration and surface and subsurface storage as amcs become wetter infiltration reduces and runoff increases equating to a more rapid hillslope response and an increase in α here it was shown that with increasing hillslope response velocity θ reduces which concurs with results by ayalew et al 2014a and medhi and tripathi 2015 as the hydrologic system became wetter through either increased amc or increased precipitation depth θ1 asymptotically approached 1 0 a θ value of 1 0 suggested that the subbasins upstream of the scale break were saturated ayalew et al 2014b where often the duration of excess rainfall was greater than the time to concentration for the design storm analysis of section 4 1 in areas less than the scale break θ1 was greater than 1 0 in all cases deviating from the previous studies ayalew et al 2014a 2014b goodrich et al 1997 gupta et al 2007 mandapaka et al 2009 this was a product of basin topology forcing a common scale break location for most amc precipitation depth scenarios expanding this study to observations in smaller drainages would likely reveal an additional scale break and the location of saturated subbasins additional investigation into the effects of the rainfall duration in section 4 4 showed a dependence of abp on the rainfall duration ayalew et al 2014b completed a similar excess rainfall study finding a shift of the abp from less than 1 km2 to greater than 50 km2 for durations of 5 min to 6 h respectively for events less than 3 h the scale break remained constant anddependent upon the basin topology the scale breackshifted to an increased area between a 3 h and 6 h rainfall duration θ2 increased from a value of 0 1 to 1 0 over the range of precipitation durations obtaining a value of 1 0 for longer duration events an indication of saturated subbasin response the selection of numerical discretization hydrologic parameters and initialization of the surface and subsurface modeling domain impact the study findings the current discretization has an average surface element size of 0 18 ha larger element sizes result in a more averaged representation of the watershed e g slope land use soil type etc and its response to rainfall by refining the numerical mesh or increasing the resolution throughout the basin hillslopes would be steeper and previously unrepresented ephemeral waterways would be captured simulations would result in faster hillslope response initiation of ephemeral streams father upstream in the watershed and deeper thus faster channelized flow additionally a narrower wet stream bed initialization would result from smaller element sizes combining the effects of the faster hillslope and ephemeral stream response and the more limited nature of the channelized response would result in a lower likelihood of multi peaked event hydrographs power law scaling relationships would extend more readily into drier scenarios and not break down in response to multi peak system responses these effects are more pronounced upstream in the watershed and in drier conditions however the watershed scale topologic effects are still expected to dominate peak flow scale break locations future study would benefit from increased resolution and characterization of independent hillslope response 5 2 independence of scaling relationship for heavy precipitation with increasing precipitation depth the peak discharge power law relationships with drainage area became decreasingly dependent upon the amc showing statistically simple scaling gupta et al 2007 more specifically θ becomes less dependent upon the amc fig 6 p02 p01 while α acts to represent an initial system loss increasing in magnitude linearly with amc this becomes most clear in figs 5f and 6 where we see closely parallel regression fits for the highest and lowest amcs with a narrow scale break range only differentiated by the intercept as opposed to dry conditions this result indicated that all or most of the peak precipitation intensity resulted in runoff increased precipitation intensity resulted in increased depth of flow in hillslope locations thus increased velocity ayalew et al 2014b concluded that hillslope velocity was the key determinant controlling θ in this case amc directly impacted the hillslope velocity whereby velocity increased with increasing wetness with faster responding hillslopes the difference in response time between stream network was reduced if not eliminated providing a basin wide response 5 3 transmission losses and ephemeral systems channel transmission losses were suggested by asquith and slade 1997 and goodrich et al 1997 as the genesis of increasing non linearity in peak discharge scaling relationships or a scale break in this study transmission losses were evaluated through comparison of simulations initialized with and without stream channel saturation but parallel in all other facets sections 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 assumed an initially saturated stream while section 4 4 initialized the entire subsurface amc uniformly in space generally the occurrence and location of a break in peak discharge scaling relationships for simulations with transmission losses remained consistent to those without losses the abp only exhibited significant deviation in p 5 low amcs for transmission loss and saturated stream cases section 4 1 noted the lack of acceptable scaling relationship for dry amc and low precipitation depths indicated by a high rmse transmission loss simulations for low precipitation depths and amc always displayed a low rmse investigating the hydrographs not shown here indicated a single system response for all amc precipitation scenarios there was not a distinction between stream channel and hillslope responses as found in saturated stream scenarios for transmission loss simulations the entire system responded as a hillslope with timing and magnitude directly controlled by amc this provides further evidence that the high rmse in dry low rainfall depth saturated stream simulations were induced by a multi peaked subbasin response transmission loss scenarios tended to reduce α while maintaining θ consistent with saturated stream scenarios the largest differences in scaling parameters occurred in p 5 and dry amcs where transmission loss scenarios maintained reasonable rmse and subsequent scaling relationships scaling in dry amcs and saturated stream scenarios displayed an obvious multi peaked response causing an unorganized basin response and subsequently multi peaked large scale response when stream channels were initialized the same as upstream areas a single peaked response ensued such that the channel responded in unison with the hillslopes this highlights the influence of channel dynamics on peak flow production the basin shape and topology could be enough to mask the other effects of transmission losses on the flood scaling parameters as a scale break was still well defined at approximately 20 km2 here only the effects of transmission losses were isolated goodrich et al 1997 noted partial area rainfall as another factor affecting peak flow scaling it could be the case that partial area rainfall and channel transmission losses act together to significantly alter a basins hydrologic response but this was beyond the scope of this study together the research by schilling et al 2020 and gutierrez jurado et al 2019 describe the interplay between vegetation groundwater conditions precipitation rate and soil characteristics on the generation of flow or lack thereof in intermittent and ephemeral stream systems in this study only a single configuration was evaluated low hydraulic conductivity soils dominated by loam and clay loam type high intensity precipitation events consistent depth to groundwater and no initial surface water consistent with the findings of gutierrez jurado et al 2019 wet amcs or high rainfall intensities resulted in horton overland flow based peak flows which are less influenced by subsurface conditions however dry amcs and low rainfall intensities resulted in delayed interflow type peak flow responses in these interflow based runoff conditions gutierrez jurado et al 2019 found to depth to groundwater was a significant factor in runoff generation in this study high quality peak flow scaling relationships were observed when the runoff generation mechanism causing the peak flows was consistent throughout the watershed where a mismatch between runoff generation mechanisms occurred a breakdown of the power law scaling relationship was observed future work should draw upon work by carlier et al 2018a b gutierrez jurado et al 2019 and schilling et al 2020 and test the physical connection between peak flow scaling and runoff generation mechanisms this would provide a better understanding of the implications of perennial and ephemeral stream systems and those factors which affect runoff generation at the watershed scale 5 4 dry amc effects in iowa basin can be related to peak flow scaling over differing climates as noted by goodrich et al 1997 peak discharge scaling studies have historically been located in humid climatic regions defined by perennial streams and hydrologically active groundwater this study of the beaver creek watershed added to the list of humid peak flow scaling studies with the addition of a wide range of amcs and channel transmission losses due to dry stream bed the findings of this research can be applied to numerous basins in regions with perennial stream systems dry amcs act to provide a multi peaked response resulting from a slower hillslope response relative to the saturated stream response the multi peak response becomes increasingly susceptible to poor peak discharge scaling relationships caused by topologic variability a distinct multi peak hillslope stream response in a naturally occurring amc is less likely to take on the appearance it did in this study naturally occurring soil moisture is variable in space dependent upon local micro climate land use topographic location soils and depth to groundwater among other factors here stream channels were assumed fixed in location and saturated under all amc realistically the location of the initiation of surface flow varies with hydrologic condition such that stream extents expand in wet periods and contract in dry this suggests the reduction of direct precipitation stream flow response for dry amc lending the dry amc scenarios towards the results determined in section 4 4 for channel transmission losses additionally the groundwater below 1 m depth in this study is assumed saturated even with unsaturated stream conditions however in arid and semi arid climates the groundwater is often much deeper which would direct the infiltrated portion of rainfall towards longer regional flow patterns which may not respond in the manner presented in this study 6 summary and conclusion this study investigated the effects of amc rainfall duration and channel transmission losses on discharge drainage area power law scaling relationships the application of a physics based coupled surface subsurface model to a well studied iowa watershed allowed for a realistic representation of amcs the results of this study indicated a large importance of the amc on peak discharge scaling relationships in wet amcs the watershed responded in a consistent single peaked manner across scales as amc decreased the hillslope response diverged from the direct rainfall instream response the mismatched timing of the two responses leads to increased regression errors and less predictive capability of the scale invariance fits the multi peak nature of hydrograph response nonlinear flow velocities and unique elongated river network combine to produce not only a consistent scale break location but also a peak flow scale invariance break down in dry simulations with increasing precipitation depth the peak discharge power law relationships with drainage area became decreasingly dependent upon the amc in transmission loss investigations stream channels were initialized with the same amc as upstream areas a single peaked response ensued whereby the channel and hillslope responded in tandem this study adds to our current understanding of the physical basis of the variability of the scaling structure of peak discharges that is observed in single rainfall runoff events by investigating the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry antecedent soil moisture conditions study results were derived from a systematic set of synthetic rainfall and amcs although based on a realistic representation of the beaver creek watershed the results require additional verification to confirm the applicability of the principal conclusions to other watersheds credit authorship contribution statement nicholas w thomas

233,differences in the boundary condition near buried corrugated pipes used for combined drainage and irrigation show that the hydraulic resistance due to perforations are not identical under both drainage and subsurface irrigation modes no studies to date have sufficiently examined how perforation characteristics such as size and configuration affect the exit head loss of buried corrugated pipes used for subsurface irrigation this research proposes a new dimensionless parameter called the exit resistance αx that accounts for variable perforations and can be used to compute the exit head loss due to capillary rise under subsurface irrigation datasets obtained from 189 numerical simulations were used to investigate how the size and configuration of rectangular slots affect αx the results show that the number of perforation lines n and longitudinal spacing of slots ay on the pipe wall have the largest impact on αx the difference in αx can be as large as 50 when n varies between 4 and 10 while slots placed in every corrugation valley ay 1 645 cm provide less than 60 of the exit resistance compared to those spaced in every third valley ay 4 935 cm exit resistance was also found to vary with the pressure head on the subsurface irrigation pipes the impact of heterogeneity from layered soils on αx of buried perforated pipes was also investigated the results indicated that αx is not influenced by soil heterogeneity in general the findings from this study implies that it is better to perforate buried corrugated pipes with slots in every corrugation valley to reduce exit head losses and maximize upward soil water fluxes in subsurface irrigation systems author keywords exit resistance perforation corrugated pipes head loss subsurface irrigation layered soils 1 0 introduction dual purpose drainage and subsurface irrigation systems on agricultural lands are used to both remove excess soil water during the wet periods and to provide irrigation water during dry periods of the growing season yu et al 2020 buried perforated corrugated polyethylene pipes with a typical diameter between 75 and 100 mm are commonly used as the primary material in these dual purpose water management systems the subsurface irrigation system also known as subirrigation can supply water to the crop root zone via capillary rise or upward flux this upward movement of water in the unsaturated soil zone above the water table has both agronomic and water quality benefits previous studies demonstrated increases in corn and soybean yields galganov 1991 mejia et al 2000 nelson 2017 improved water quality through the reduction of nutrient losses has been shown by several researchers drury et al 1996 madramootoo et al 2001 mejia and madramootoo 1998 efficiently designed and operated subsurface irrigation systems are therefore essential as future crop production expands to meet an increasing global food demand compounded by a changing climate the main objective in the design of a subsurface irrigation system is to determine the spacing and depth of the drains to supply water for optimum crop production skaggs 1981 the steady state equation developed by ernst 1975 is commonly used to determine the required lateral drain spacing for subsurface irrigation systems corrections to ernst s equation are typically made in order to account for the head losses that occur near the drains in the system skaggs 1999 these losses occur due to the depth of the impermeable layer below the drains skaggs 1981 and as a result of the finite perforations on the drainage pipe skaggs 1991 current design practices utilize the hydraulic entrance resistance to compensate for the head loss from perforations on subsurface irrigation supply pipes skaggs 1991 1999 however this parameter was derived for buried pipes operating under the drainage mode where streamlines converge towards the perforation the hydrodynamics of the water management system is reversed when operated under the subsurface irrigation mode applied irrigation water from a control chamber must first exit the buried supply pipes through the perforations and then flow into the surrounding soil medium to raise the water table to a desired target level in subsurface irrigation mode the streamlines diverge away from the perforations on the supply pipe the pressure head on the buried pipe is also larger when operated under the subsurface irrigation mode due to the increased water levels in the control chamber these differences in boundary conditions raise the pertinent question of whether the hydraulic resistance and head loss of the system due to perforations are identical under both drainage and subsurface irrigation modes determining the magnitude of head losses in a subsurface irrigation system is important for water management because it affects the amount of water that needs to be supplied to the field via the control chambers bournival et al 1987 total head losses as high as 55 cm were first measured by bournival et al 1987 in a field study with subsurface irrigation systems on a sandy loam soil in southern quebec approximately 75 of the total head loss was attributed to exit head losses due to perforations bournival et al 1987 on the other hand laboratory measurements reported by prasher et al 1989 showed that exit losses may be significantly smaller less than 3 7 cm suggesting that the results reported by bournival et al 1987 may have actually been divergent head losses from clogged envelopes around the buried pipes however this small exit head loss may be explained by the perforation pattern used on the test pipe by prasher et al 1989 which had 12 rows of narrow slots 0 17 mm x 9 81 mm placed in every corrugation valley previous work has shown that a large number of perforation rows will significantly reduce the entry resistance and head loss of buried corrugated pipes under drainage mode gaj and madramootoo 2020 thus from a hydraulic perspective the test pipe used by prasher et al 1989 was densely perforated resulting in comparatively small exit head loss measurements drainage pipes are typically perforated with less than six rows of perforations distributed equally along the pipe circumference and spaced in every second or third corrugation valley ads 2008 armtec 2012 jm eagle 2012 therefore exit head losses may be appreciably larger for cases where the supply pipes are perforated with fewer slots no studies to date have sufficiently examined how the size and configuration of perforations affect the exit head loss of buried corrugated pipes operated in the subsurface irrigation mode subsurface irrigation systems can be installed on agricultural fields that have multiple soil layers due to natural formation processes soil texture usually varies between layers resulting in heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities the effect of soil heterogeneity on lateral spacing has been widely documented for two layer systems under drainage mode khan et al 1989 sharma et al 1991 but few studies have been done for subsurface irrigation systems in layered soils tang and skaggs 1980 investigated the effect of drain depth in a two layer subsurface irrigation system and concluded that drains are best placed at the layer interface however their numerical study only considered cases where the upper layer had a lower conductivity relative to the layer below the drains subsurface irrigation systems have been installed in fields with a 0 5 m thick conductive sandy layer overlying a less conductive clay layer at the drain level galganov 1991 furthermore head loss effects from perforations were not included in the simulations by tang and skaggs 1980 in this context another valid question arises does soil heterogeneity influence the exit resistance of perforated pipes in subsurface irrigation systems this research is aimed at investigating the exit head loss in corrugated pipes with hydraulic boundary conditions that are representative of subsurface irrigation water management systems used on agricultural lands a new parameter called the exit resistance is proposed to be used in the analysis and design of buried perforated pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode in this study the exit resistance is defined as a dimensionless geometric constant that represents the additional hydraulic head loss experienced by streamlines as they exit from perforations on the pipe wall the exit resistance accounts for variable perforation characteristics size and configuration and it can be used in computations of the exit head loss and subsequently to determine the lateral drain spacing for subsurface irrigation systems it is hypothesized that the exit resistance of buried perforated pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode is larger than the entrance resistance its counterpart for water table drawdown when operated under the drainage mode due to the reverse hydraulics of upward water movement specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to compute the exit resistance of buried corrugated pipes in a subsurface irrigation system in order to test the hypothesis stated above 2 to establish relationships between the exit resistance and variable perforation size and configuration using a three dimensional 3d finite element based numerical model and 3 to investigate the impact of heterogeneity from layered soils on the exit resistance of buried perforated pipes the numerical model comsol used in this study to simulate subsurface irrigation flow from perforations in corrugated pipes is original and innovative such multi physics 3d modeling is computationally powerful and has been applied for the first time in subsurface irrigation to simulate exit head losses in buried perforated pipes previously laboratory sand tank experiments and field studies have been used however these experiments are costly time consuming and laborious in addition the use of the dimensionless exit resistance parameter to compensate for exit head losses is new to subsurface irrigation design the results from this study can be used to integrate perforation characteristics into the analysis and design of 100 mm diameter corrugated pipes for water management of agricultural lands 2 0 methodology 2 1 upward soil water movement during subsurface irrigation in a subsurface irrigation system the water table rises into the unsaturated zone via capillary forces to a predetermined target level which is set relative to the buried drainage pipe fig 1 the water table level at midpoint between two parallel drainage pipes typically experiences a sag from the target level because of the head losses in the system several theories have been developed to predict the water movement in the system based on assumptions of how the water flows laterally and vertically through the soil medium subsurface irrigation systems are typically designed to operate under steady state or transient conditions skaggs 1999 for a steady state operation the water level in the control chambers is maintained at the constant target level of 50 75 cm below the soil surface crézé and madramootoo 2019 singh et al 2014 stämpfli and madramootoo 2006 the resulting pressure head above the buried pipe provides the necessary energy to generate the soil water fluxes through the porous medium skaggs 1981 stated that most of the water movement occurs laterally in the saturated zone under steady state conditions raising the midpoint water table to the target elevation soil moisture then moves vertically as capillary or upward flux into the unsaturated root zone to meet the crop evapotranspiration et demands skaggs 1999 in steady state conditions the upward flux is deemed equivalent to et and the deficit soil moisture in the unsaturated zone above the water table is continuously replenished by the upward soil water flux furthermore this upward flux into the root zone is implicitly considered when selecting a design target level for a specific crop type and soil texture abbasi et al 2020 elmi et al 2010 madramootoo et al 2001 in some soil textures a small capillary fringe may develop above the water table but all lateral movement in this layer is usually negligible because of the rapid decrease in hydraulic conductivity with water content skaggs 1999 in many two dimensional 2d subsurface drainage theories flow below the water table usually employs the dupuit forchheimer assumptions i streamlines are horizontal and ii the hydraulic gradient is equal to the tangent of the water table slope mcwhorter and marinelli 1999 however the streamlines near buried pipes under subsurface irrigation mode are curvilinear due to head losses from the radial divergence of flow fig 2 the total head loss in the radial flow region δh comprises the exit head loss due to the finite perforations on the pipe wall and the divergent head loss due to the actual depth of the impermeable layer dim below the drainage pipe the exit head loss of buried pipes under subsurface irrigation mode is analogous to the entrance head loss of buried pipes under drainage mode and therefore can be determined from the mechanics of flow in the radial zone based on continuity conservation of mass and darcy s law under radial flow theory stuyt et al 2005 the continuity condition specifies that the irrigation soil water flux qirr leaving the buried pipe through the perforations fig 2 is equal to the upward et flux leaving the cropped surface fig 1 to maintain steady state conditions in order to account for the distortion of streamlines as the irrigation soil water flux exits the pipe perforations a new geometric parameter called the exit resistance αx is proposed in this study the exit resistance is comparable to the entrance resistance αe of buried perforated pipes operated under drainage mode similar to αe the exit resistance was also conceptualized as a dimensionless and soil independent parameter consequently hydraulic head data generated from numerical simulations of steady state radial flow near buried perforated pipes can be used to compute αx following gaj and madramootoo 2020 a brief description of radial flow theory stuyt et al 2005 and the equations used to compute αx are summarized in the supplementary materials 2 2 numerical simulations of exit resistance the exit resistance for various perforation size and configuration was computed from hydraulic head datasets obtained through simulations with a 3d finite element based numerical model the discretized model fig 3 is representative of the radial flow zone surrounding a nominal 100 mm diameter corrugated drainage pipe the numerical model was implemented in comsol multiphysics version 5 3 comsol multiphysics 2017a using the subsurface flow module comsol multiphysics 2017b only half of the radial flow region as shown in fig 3 was modelled due to symmetry along the pipe s longitudinal axis y axis the dimensions of the 3d model are 150 cm width x axis 60 cm length y axis and 124 cm depth z axis a full description of the model s governing and boundary equations discretization and calibration is given by gaj and madramootoo 2020 for completeness a short summary of the governing equations and boundary conditions is reported in the supplementary materials a total of 235 676 tetrahedral elements of varying sizes between 5 cm maximum and 0 15 cm minimum were used to generate the discretized mesh shown in figs 3 and 4 exploded view the hydraulic head datasets are generated from the numerical model using 72 piezometric probes that are strategically placed in the radial and axial directions in the saturated porous medium surrounding the buried pipe gaj and madramootoo 2020 the 3d numerical model fig 3 was previously used for computing αe of buried perforated corrugated pipes under drainage mode the flow direction in the radial zone during subsurface irrigation is reversed i e flow exiting the buried supply pipe and moving radially upward into the saturated soil medium therefore the dirichlet boundary condition at the perforation surface on the buried pipe φ 1 can no longer be described as flowing full with a free flow outlet gaj and madramootoo 2020 the buried supply pipe will flow full under a pressure head y 0 and thus the hydraulic head at the perforation surface is 1 φ 1 z h d y 0 d i m x y eq 1 was prescribed to the 3d numerical model for the steady state simulations carried out in subsurface irrigation mode practical values of y 0 were chosen such that hd is always greater than hs fig 2 which ensures that the hydraulic gradient will produce soil water fluxes that exit the pipe via the perforations it should be noted that the modification to the boundary condition at the perforation surface does not warrant a re calibration of the model because the boundary value problem formulated for radial flow under drainage is valid for radial flow under subsurface irrigation skaggs 1991 consequently a comparison of the delivery ratios of the perforated pipes under subsurface drainage and irrigation modes was made to verify this assumption the delivery ratio is defined as the ratio of discharge through a perforated or non ideal pipe to the discharge through a fully porous or ideal pipe under steady state conditions gaj and madramootoo 2020 the design variables considered in the numerical simulations for αx table 1 were the number of perforation lines n the length of the rectangular slot lperf the longitudinal spacing ay and the difference in head between hd and hs δh it has been previously demonstrated that rectangular slots are hydraulically more advantageous than circular holes when used as perforations for buried corrugated pipe to facilitate water table drawdown under drainage gaj and madramootoo 2020 this preferred hydraulic response from slots is due to the fact that the length of each slot is oriented along the circumference of the pipe wall which results in streamlines that converge in a 2d radial planar flow pattern similar to that of an ideal pipe gaj and madramootoo 2020 the same perforation shape effect is expected when the pipe is operated in the subsurface irrigation mode since the streamlines from rectangular slots will more closely diverge in a 2d radial planar flow pattern than streamlines from circular holes furthermore research has also shown that buried corrugated high density polyethylene hdpe pipes with rectangular slots have a lower risk of structural failure via ductile yielding compared to buried pipes perforated with circular holes gaj and madramootoo 2021 thus only the perforated pipe model with rectangular slots model cws was considered in this study for the subsurface irrigation simulations the perforations were placed in the center of the corrugation valley which is common practice for buried corrugated drainage pipes stuyt et al 2005 the pitch of the pipe is 1 645 cm for the annular corrugation profile used in model cws fig 4 hence the values of ay in table 1 represent perforations placed in every first second and third corrugation valley respectively the values of n and lperf are also representative of perforation characteristics commonly used on commercially available corrugated hdpe pipes gaj and madramootoo 2020 the range of values for δh in table 1 was selected based on pressure head values used in field studies with subsurface irrigation systems bournival et al 1987 cordeiro and sri ranjan 2012 elmi et al 2010 smith et al 1985 these studies covered a wide range of buried pipe depths soil types and crop types across north america moreover a head difference of 48 cm was included in the simulations in order to compare αx with αe and test the main hypothesis under equivalent hydraulic conditions this subset of simulations for hypothesis testing resulted in 27 3 3 3 combinations of n lperf and ay 2 3 layered soils in subsurface irrigation radial flow in a two layer system was simulated with model cws to investigate the impacts of soil heterogeneity on the exit resistance the porous medium domain fig 3 was separated into two blocks in order to represent two distinct soil layers the separation was done so that the center of the buried corrugated pipe was positioned at the interface of the two soil layers following tang and skaggs 1980 the mesh size and number of elements in model cws were unaffected because no changes were made to physical dimensions of the model domain or pipe geometry heterogeneity in the layered system was represented by the hydraulic conductivity ksat assigned to each layer according to soil texture a subset of four soil textures table 2 were adapted for the numerical simulations from rawls et al 1998 which contains a database of soil physical and hydraulic properties categorized according to the us department of agriculture usda textural classification system the corresponding unified soil classification system uscs symbol for each texture following garcia gaines and frankenstein 2015 is also listed in table 2 four arrangements table 3 of the two layer subsurface irrigation system were simulated using the soil textures listed in table 2 in each arrangement the soil with the larger conductivity was prescribed to the upper layer layer 1 the soil properties within each layer were assumed to be uniform and isotropic table 3 also summarizes the conductivity ratio crks of the two layer system which was computed as ksat layer 1 ksat layer 2 heterogeneous soils can be incorporated into subsurface drainage irrigation design through the use of an average conductivity value in lateral drain spacing equations madramootoo 1999 in layered soils the average hydraulic conductivity can be computed as either the harmonic or arithmetic mean if the flow direction is perpendicular or parallel to the layers respectively amoozegar and wilson 1999 considering that most of the water movement in a subsurface irrigation system occurs laterally under steady state conditions skaggs 1981 the arithmetic mean would be more appropriate for estimating the average hydraulic conductivity ksat a as amoozegar and wilson 1999 2 k s a t a l z 1 k s a t 1 l z 2 k s a t 2 l z n k s a t n l z where lz is the thickness of the soil layer a conductivity value computed with eq 2 is also known as the weighted average and it accounts for the differences in the thickness of each layer in heterogeneous soils the average hydraulic conductivity was computed for the four arrangements of two layer systems table 4 using eq 2 and then used in simulations to represent an equivalent homogeneous one layer system these simulations allowed for a direct comparison of the exit resistance of buried pipes in a heterogeneous two layer systems with the resistance from its equivalent homogeneous one layer counterpart 3 0 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of entrance and exit resistances in order to test the main hypothesis of this study the hydraulic resistances of perforated corrugated pipes used in subsurface drainage and irrigation systems were evaluated to allow for an explicit comparison under an equivalent hydraulic head difference δh 48 cm a total of 27 simulations representing combinations of n lperf and ay section 2 2 table 1 were carried out with model cws to generate the required hydraulic head data for computing αx subsurface irrigation mode on the other hand αe drainage mode was computed from a predictive equation developed by gaj and madramootoo 2020 for the matching 27 combinations of the perforation characteristics the results are shown in fig 5 which plots αe and αx relative to the equality 1 1 line the hydraulic resistance values shown in fig 5 all lie above the 1 1 line indicating that αx is generally greater than αe as a result the exit head loss due to perforations in a drainage pipe under subsurface irrigation mode will be larger than the entrance head loss of the pipe under drainage mode this disparity in head loss from the perforations can be explained by the reversal of flow through the porous medium under subsurface irrigation mode the hydraulic head is highest at the soil pipe interface then it experiences a precipitous drop immediately outside the pipe surface before it gradually decreases in the radial direction and the streamlines diverge upwards and radially away from the perforations this dissipation of the hydraulic head is illustrated in fig 6 which shows its distribution in the radial flow region around the buried pipe under subsurface irrigation mode the buried pipe in fig 6 is perforated with four lines of rectangular slots lperf 1 0 cm placed in every corrugation valley ay 1 645 cm in this particular perforation scenario the exit head loss accounts for approximately 57 of δh within a 5 0 cm radius from the pipe surface the remaining 43 of δh is dissipated over the next 50 cm of the flow region representing the divergent head loss in the subirrigation system these results demonstrate that exit losses can potentially account for the largest fraction of the total head loss within the radial flow zone in contrast the hydraulic head under drainage mode will drop steadily across the radial flow region losing a larger fraction of energy before the flow converges towards the perforations on the pipe wall thus the change in the pipe s boundary condition at the perforation surface due to the increased hydraulic head hd is ultimately responsible for the larger exit resistance to flow of buried pipes when operated in the subsurface irrigation mode 3 1 1 hypothesis testing and generalized relationship further comparison of the hydraulic resistances shows that αx is 1 7 times larger than αe when taken as an average across all 27 combinations section 2 2 of perforation design variables this difference between αx and αe however is not best described as a constant that can be applied to all perforation characteristics there is some degree of variability that is suitably illustrated fig 7 by the non linear increase of αx αe expressed as a function of the total perforation area ap the results in fig 7 show that the ratio of αx to αe can be as great as 2 5 when a buried corrugated pipe has a large perforation area ap 300 cm2 m the results also indicate that αx is approximately 20 larger than αe for buried pipes with a small perforation area ap 16 cm2 m consequently these differences in hydraulic resistance values were tested for statistical significance 5 level using the welch s t test moser and stevens 1992 the t test results not presented show that the differences between αx and αe are statistically significant p 0 05 across all 27 perforation combinations confirming the hypothesis of this study that αx is significantly larger than αe therefore these findings strongly support the use of the exit resistance to account for perforations in the analysis and design of subsurface irrigation systems moreover the following power law function was fitted r 2 87 2 to the data in fig 7 in order to provide a generalized predictive relationship between αx αe and ap 3 a x a e 0 593 a p 0 25 where ap is in cm2 m eq 3 can be used to estimate αx in situations where an existing drainage system with buried corrugated pipes is to be retrofitted to operate under subsurface irrigation mode elmi et al 2010 galganov 1991 the equation is limited to corrugated pipes perforated with rectangular slots having a maximum ap of 300 cm2 m values of ap for existing buried corrugated pipes are sometime reported by researchers bournival et al 1987 but details on the exact dimensions and or configuration of the perforations are often not properly documented therefore eq 3 may prove to be very useful provided a relationship between αe and ap is also available dierickx 1999 presented several curves of αe as a function of ap but only one of the curves is valid for corrugated drainage pipes furthermore only 0 5 cm long slots were used to generate the curve presented by dierickx 1999 restricting its use in practical situations a better representative relationship between αe and ap for corrugated drainage pipes with rectangular slots is presented in fig s1 supplementary material which considers a wider array of perforation characteristics such as size and configuration 3 1 2 validity of radial model under subsurface irrigation it is important to note that the flow rate through a fixed perforation size and configuration remained constant under both subsurface irrigation and drainage modes since δh was identical in these simulations this is fittingly demonstrated in fig 8 which plots the delivery ratios qirr q 0 or qs q 0 for variable perforated pipes operated under each mode relative to the equality 1 1 line the denominator q 0 is the flow rate through an ideal of fully porous pipe following gaj and madramootoo 2020 values of qirr q 0 for perforated corrugated pipes operated under subsurface irrigation mode were computed from the simulation results during post processing the corresponding qs q 0 for a buried corrugated pipe operated under drainage mode with the matching perforation combinations was computed from a predictive equation developed by gaj and madramootoo 2020 the results in fig 8 corroborate the validity of model cws for simulating radial flow under subsurface irrigation confirming that no re calibration of the model was necessary while the validity of the 3d radial flow model operating under subsurface irrigation mode has been demonstrated its application is limited to buried pipes with a diameter of 100 mm subsurface irrigation pipe diameters can vary from 75 mm to 150 mm but 100 mm was selected for the simulations since it is the most commonly used pipe diameter across eastern canada and the us midwest where subsurface irrigation is employed marmanilo et al 2021 yu et al 2020 another limitation to the study is that the model results apply to corrugated pipes that do not have thin synthetic envelopes or geotextile fabrics such as a filter sock wrapped around them during installation these fabrics prevent the loss of silt sized particles from soil around the pipe and have the effect of decreasing the entrance resistance of pipes operated under the drainage mode stuyt and dierickx 2006 however the effect of geotextile fabrics on the exit resistance of pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode has not been investigated 3 2 exit resistance and perforation characteristics 3 2 1 variable slot length a series of parametric simulations 189 in total using model cws and varying lperf n and ay were carried out in order to establish explicit relationships with αx for buried corrugated pipes under subsurface irrigation mode as shown in section 3 1 hd has a direct impact on the exit losses as water flows out of the pipe perforations therefore δh was also varied in these simulations in order to reflect typical field conditions for subsurface irrigation systems on agricultural lands fig 9 shows that αx generally decreases as δh increases for all values of lperf n and ay were fixed at 4 and 1 645 cm respectively this trend is indicative of the fact that the highest resistance to flow through the perforations occurs when the hydraulic gradient is lowest at the soil pipe interface perforation surface a low hydraulic gradient arises when there is a small difference between hd and the water table level immediately outside the buried supply pipe hs as δh increases the hydraulic gradient increases and more energy is available to overcome the resistance to flow resulting in lower values of αx for the perforated pipe fig 9 also shows that there are differences in the resistance of the perforated pipe under subsurface irrigation due to lperf this difference in αx is largest 34 between lperf values of 1 0 and 2 5 cm when δh is less than 10 cm however as δh increases the difference due to lperf becomes negligible these results indicate that the length of a rectangular slot has a relatively minor impact on the exit losses of corrugated subsurface irrigation pipes nevertheless it may be beneficial to use values of lperf greater than 1 75 cm in order to maximize the flow rate leaving the perforated pipes 3 2 2 variable perforation lines varying n during the simulations for model cws produced similar results to those obtained for variable lperf fig 10 shows that αx decreases as n increases across all values of δh for a corrugated pipe with lperf and ay fixed at 1 0 cm and 1 645 cm respectively however at the lower end of δh the difference in αx can be as large as 50 between 4 and 10 lines of perforations these results indicate that n has a larger effect on αx than lperf which is comparable to the findings for αe of corrugated drainage pipes gaj and madramootoo 2020 the current industry practice of using four lines of perforations on buried drainage pipes ads 2008 armtec 2012 jm eagle 2012 may result in larger exit losses for subsurface irrigation systems as such utilizing as many lines of rectangular slots as practical may be an efficient way of reducing the hydraulic resistance and minimizing the exit head loss of perforated pipes under subsurface irrigation mode in fact this finding is supported by the sand tank results of prasher et al 1989 which showed that there were no significant exit losses for corrugated pipes with n 12 it is important to note that there is a constraint on increasing n with respect to the structural response of buried corrugated pipes under agricultural loading conditions previous work has shown that at shallow burial depths less than 0 6 m increases in n can cause increases in pipe deformation of up to 4 of the pipe s diameter at the crown gaj and madramootoo 2021 this increase in deformation is due to a reduction in pipe stiffness in the hoop direction if the buried depth of corrugated supply pipes is greater than 0 6 m n 10 can be used as an upper limit for perforation lines without causing excessive deformation not more than 5 from agricultural field traffic loading gaj and madramootoo 2021 3 2 3 variable longitudinal spacing the third and final perforation design variable that represents the longitudinal spacing ay was then varied during the simulations with model cws n 4 and lperf 1 0 cm the results are shown in fig 11 which indicates that αx increases as the slots are spaced further apart for example slots spaced in every third corrugation valley ay 4 935 cm result in an increase in αx by more than 60 compared to slots in every valley ay 1 645 cm such increases in αx can be explained by the distortion of the streamlines in the longitudinal direction y as the flow exits the perforations figs 12 a and 12b as ay increases the streamlines travel a larger distance between slots before they leave through the perforations losing more energy and resulting in a more pronounced departure from 2d radial planar flow fig 12b in contrast the streamlines exiting perforations that are closely spaced display a higher degree of radial planar flow as indicated in fig 12a this trend exists across all values of δh for buried corrugated pipes indicating that closer spaced perforations are beneficial in reducing the exit head loss in subsurface irrigation systems as before this finding mirrors that of αe for buried corrugated drainage pipes where ay was ranked as second only to n for perforation variables that have the largest impact on hydraulic resistance gaj and madramootoo 2020 altogether these results show that the configuration of rectangular slots on the pipe wall n and ay plays an important role in estimating αx and ultimately the exit head loss of perforated corrugated pipes used in subsurface irrigation systems from a hydraulic point of view it is advantageous to use slots in every corrugation valley in order to reduce αx from a structural point of view there are no major disadvantages associated with placing slots in every valley previous work has shown that stress concentrations around perforations are not affected by ay in corrugated pipes gaj and madramootoo 2021 as manufacturers continue to produce and market corrugated polyethylene pipes rectangular slots placed in every corrugation valley should be promoted as the best perforations configuration to reduce hydraulic head losses both entrance and exit and maximize soil water fluxes in the case for subsurface irrigation systems reducing exit head losses can assist with setting automated water table controls and conserving scare water resources the non linear regression equation eq s2 and its associated coefficients given in tables s1 s3 can be used to compute αx as a function of δh and for select values of n lperf and ay these regression coefficients were generated from the simulated hydraulic head datasets the goodness of fit was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r 2 which was greater than 99 3 for all 27 fitted equations 3 3 effect of layered soils 3 4 1 exit resistance the effect of layered soils on αx was investigated using model cws which was adjusted to simulate radial flow through a corrugated pipe positioned at the interface of two soil layers the resulting αx due to varying perforation characteristics and δh combinations are shown in fig 13 for the heterogeneous arrangement of a loamy sand layer overlying a sandy clay layer sm sc for comparison simulations were also run with a single homogeneous layer having a weighted conductivity value ksat a eq 2 equivalent to that of the two layer sm sc system crks 46 the exit resistance values plotted in fig 13 all lie on the equality line 1 1 indicating that there is no difference in αx between the heterogeneous and homogeneous subsurface irrigation systems the simulated pathway of the streamlines shown in figs 14 a and 14b further supports the finding that αx is not affected by heterogeneous soil layers the streamlines within close proximity to the corrugated pipe are virtually identical for both the heterogeneous fig 14a and homogeneous fig 14b cases it is only when the streamlines diverge radially upward and away from the perforations that those in the less hydraulically conductive sc layer are sharply refracted after entering the more conductive sm layer fig 14a this sharp refraction is certainly due to the large difference in ksat between the two layers as this arrangement resulted in the highest conductivity ratio crks 46 representing an extreme case of heterogeneity on the other hand the ml ch arrangement fig 15 represents an intermediate case of heterogeneity with a crks value of 8 the relatively lower conductivity ratio explains why the streamlines in fig 15 are refracted to a lesser degree than those in fig 14a to further explore the streamline refraction across the layer interface of heterogeneous soils simulations were run using an additional two layer arrangement to those listed in table 3 the additional arrangement simulated a clay layer overlying a sandy clay layer ch sc as shown in fig 16 the streamlines in fig 16 are mildly refracted because this arrangement represents a two layer system with a crks of 2 in fact the refraction shown in fig 16 is almost comparable to that for a homogeneous soil system crks 1 as shown in fig 14b these findings indicate that the degree of streamline refraction between two soil layers varies directly with the conductivity ratio increasing as crks increases it is important to note that the streamline refractions in figs 14 16 occur well outside the vicinity of the pipe wall and they are not impacted by the pipe perforations for the homogeneous case crks 1 ksat is constant throughout the flow region and there is no refraction of the streamlines fig 14b moreover the same trend of diverging streamlines near the pipe perforations was observed from simulations using the two remaining two layer arrangements in table 3 ml sc and sm ch the computed exit resistance values remained the same regardless of the soil textures above and below the buried perforated pipe figs s2 s4 these results provide conclusive evidence to support the conceptualization of αx as a dimensionless parameter that is independent of ksat and only representative of the size and geometric configuration of perforations on the pipe wall therefore αx is not influenced by soil texture in either homogeneous soils or heterogeneous two layered systems that may be encountered on agricultural lands 4 0 conclusions a new dimensionless parameter αx representing the hydraulic exit resistance of corrugated pipes due to perforations is proposed in this study for incorporation into the analysis and design of buried pipes used in subsurface irrigation systems datasets obtained from 189 numerical simulations were used to investigate how the size and configuration of rectangular slots affect the exit resistance as the difference in hydraulic head between water levels in a control chamber and the surrounding soil increases from 10 to 100 cm the exit resistance of perforated corrugated pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode in layered soils was also investigated the major findings from this research indicate that αx is generally larger than its counterpart under drainage mode αe the differences between the two resistances are statistically significant p 0 05 the configuration of rectangular slots on the pipe wall as determined by n and ay has the largest impact on αx pipes with slots in every corrugation valley ay 1 645 cm will provide the least resistance compared to those with larger longitudinal spacings αx decreases as δh increases because more energy is available to overcome the resistance to flow during subsurface irrigation the degree of streamline refraction between two heterogeneous soil layers varies directly with the conductivity ratio increasing as crks increases αx is not influenced by soil texture in either homogeneous soils or heterogeneous two layered systems that are typically encountered on agricultural lands altogether the findings presented in this study extend the analysis and design of subsurface irrigation systems to include the exit resistance due to perforations in corrugated pipes exit head losses can now be computed for various perforation sizes and configurations and as a function of the hydraulic head on buried subsurface irrigation pipes these losses can be used to make more informed decisions about the target water level in control chambers in order to achieve more uniform rates of capillary rise in the unsaturated soil water zone to meet the et demands of the crop this can be of importance as water managers aim to automate the water table controls for conserving scarce water resources credit author statement

233,differences in the boundary condition near buried corrugated pipes used for combined drainage and irrigation show that the hydraulic resistance due to perforations are not identical under both drainage and subsurface irrigation modes no studies to date have sufficiently examined how perforation characteristics such as size and configuration affect the exit head loss of buried corrugated pipes used for subsurface irrigation this research proposes a new dimensionless parameter called the exit resistance αx that accounts for variable perforations and can be used to compute the exit head loss due to capillary rise under subsurface irrigation datasets obtained from 189 numerical simulations were used to investigate how the size and configuration of rectangular slots affect αx the results show that the number of perforation lines n and longitudinal spacing of slots ay on the pipe wall have the largest impact on αx the difference in αx can be as large as 50 when n varies between 4 and 10 while slots placed in every corrugation valley ay 1 645 cm provide less than 60 of the exit resistance compared to those spaced in every third valley ay 4 935 cm exit resistance was also found to vary with the pressure head on the subsurface irrigation pipes the impact of heterogeneity from layered soils on αx of buried perforated pipes was also investigated the results indicated that αx is not influenced by soil heterogeneity in general the findings from this study implies that it is better to perforate buried corrugated pipes with slots in every corrugation valley to reduce exit head losses and maximize upward soil water fluxes in subsurface irrigation systems author keywords exit resistance perforation corrugated pipes head loss subsurface irrigation layered soils 1 0 introduction dual purpose drainage and subsurface irrigation systems on agricultural lands are used to both remove excess soil water during the wet periods and to provide irrigation water during dry periods of the growing season yu et al 2020 buried perforated corrugated polyethylene pipes with a typical diameter between 75 and 100 mm are commonly used as the primary material in these dual purpose water management systems the subsurface irrigation system also known as subirrigation can supply water to the crop root zone via capillary rise or upward flux this upward movement of water in the unsaturated soil zone above the water table has both agronomic and water quality benefits previous studies demonstrated increases in corn and soybean yields galganov 1991 mejia et al 2000 nelson 2017 improved water quality through the reduction of nutrient losses has been shown by several researchers drury et al 1996 madramootoo et al 2001 mejia and madramootoo 1998 efficiently designed and operated subsurface irrigation systems are therefore essential as future crop production expands to meet an increasing global food demand compounded by a changing climate the main objective in the design of a subsurface irrigation system is to determine the spacing and depth of the drains to supply water for optimum crop production skaggs 1981 the steady state equation developed by ernst 1975 is commonly used to determine the required lateral drain spacing for subsurface irrigation systems corrections to ernst s equation are typically made in order to account for the head losses that occur near the drains in the system skaggs 1999 these losses occur due to the depth of the impermeable layer below the drains skaggs 1981 and as a result of the finite perforations on the drainage pipe skaggs 1991 current design practices utilize the hydraulic entrance resistance to compensate for the head loss from perforations on subsurface irrigation supply pipes skaggs 1991 1999 however this parameter was derived for buried pipes operating under the drainage mode where streamlines converge towards the perforation the hydrodynamics of the water management system is reversed when operated under the subsurface irrigation mode applied irrigation water from a control chamber must first exit the buried supply pipes through the perforations and then flow into the surrounding soil medium to raise the water table to a desired target level in subsurface irrigation mode the streamlines diverge away from the perforations on the supply pipe the pressure head on the buried pipe is also larger when operated under the subsurface irrigation mode due to the increased water levels in the control chamber these differences in boundary conditions raise the pertinent question of whether the hydraulic resistance and head loss of the system due to perforations are identical under both drainage and subsurface irrigation modes determining the magnitude of head losses in a subsurface irrigation system is important for water management because it affects the amount of water that needs to be supplied to the field via the control chambers bournival et al 1987 total head losses as high as 55 cm were first measured by bournival et al 1987 in a field study with subsurface irrigation systems on a sandy loam soil in southern quebec approximately 75 of the total head loss was attributed to exit head losses due to perforations bournival et al 1987 on the other hand laboratory measurements reported by prasher et al 1989 showed that exit losses may be significantly smaller less than 3 7 cm suggesting that the results reported by bournival et al 1987 may have actually been divergent head losses from clogged envelopes around the buried pipes however this small exit head loss may be explained by the perforation pattern used on the test pipe by prasher et al 1989 which had 12 rows of narrow slots 0 17 mm x 9 81 mm placed in every corrugation valley previous work has shown that a large number of perforation rows will significantly reduce the entry resistance and head loss of buried corrugated pipes under drainage mode gaj and madramootoo 2020 thus from a hydraulic perspective the test pipe used by prasher et al 1989 was densely perforated resulting in comparatively small exit head loss measurements drainage pipes are typically perforated with less than six rows of perforations distributed equally along the pipe circumference and spaced in every second or third corrugation valley ads 2008 armtec 2012 jm eagle 2012 therefore exit head losses may be appreciably larger for cases where the supply pipes are perforated with fewer slots no studies to date have sufficiently examined how the size and configuration of perforations affect the exit head loss of buried corrugated pipes operated in the subsurface irrigation mode subsurface irrigation systems can be installed on agricultural fields that have multiple soil layers due to natural formation processes soil texture usually varies between layers resulting in heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities the effect of soil heterogeneity on lateral spacing has been widely documented for two layer systems under drainage mode khan et al 1989 sharma et al 1991 but few studies have been done for subsurface irrigation systems in layered soils tang and skaggs 1980 investigated the effect of drain depth in a two layer subsurface irrigation system and concluded that drains are best placed at the layer interface however their numerical study only considered cases where the upper layer had a lower conductivity relative to the layer below the drains subsurface irrigation systems have been installed in fields with a 0 5 m thick conductive sandy layer overlying a less conductive clay layer at the drain level galganov 1991 furthermore head loss effects from perforations were not included in the simulations by tang and skaggs 1980 in this context another valid question arises does soil heterogeneity influence the exit resistance of perforated pipes in subsurface irrigation systems this research is aimed at investigating the exit head loss in corrugated pipes with hydraulic boundary conditions that are representative of subsurface irrigation water management systems used on agricultural lands a new parameter called the exit resistance is proposed to be used in the analysis and design of buried perforated pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode in this study the exit resistance is defined as a dimensionless geometric constant that represents the additional hydraulic head loss experienced by streamlines as they exit from perforations on the pipe wall the exit resistance accounts for variable perforation characteristics size and configuration and it can be used in computations of the exit head loss and subsequently to determine the lateral drain spacing for subsurface irrigation systems it is hypothesized that the exit resistance of buried perforated pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode is larger than the entrance resistance its counterpart for water table drawdown when operated under the drainage mode due to the reverse hydraulics of upward water movement specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to compute the exit resistance of buried corrugated pipes in a subsurface irrigation system in order to test the hypothesis stated above 2 to establish relationships between the exit resistance and variable perforation size and configuration using a three dimensional 3d finite element based numerical model and 3 to investigate the impact of heterogeneity from layered soils on the exit resistance of buried perforated pipes the numerical model comsol used in this study to simulate subsurface irrigation flow from perforations in corrugated pipes is original and innovative such multi physics 3d modeling is computationally powerful and has been applied for the first time in subsurface irrigation to simulate exit head losses in buried perforated pipes previously laboratory sand tank experiments and field studies have been used however these experiments are costly time consuming and laborious in addition the use of the dimensionless exit resistance parameter to compensate for exit head losses is new to subsurface irrigation design the results from this study can be used to integrate perforation characteristics into the analysis and design of 100 mm diameter corrugated pipes for water management of agricultural lands 2 0 methodology 2 1 upward soil water movement during subsurface irrigation in a subsurface irrigation system the water table rises into the unsaturated zone via capillary forces to a predetermined target level which is set relative to the buried drainage pipe fig 1 the water table level at midpoint between two parallel drainage pipes typically experiences a sag from the target level because of the head losses in the system several theories have been developed to predict the water movement in the system based on assumptions of how the water flows laterally and vertically through the soil medium subsurface irrigation systems are typically designed to operate under steady state or transient conditions skaggs 1999 for a steady state operation the water level in the control chambers is maintained at the constant target level of 50 75 cm below the soil surface crézé and madramootoo 2019 singh et al 2014 stämpfli and madramootoo 2006 the resulting pressure head above the buried pipe provides the necessary energy to generate the soil water fluxes through the porous medium skaggs 1981 stated that most of the water movement occurs laterally in the saturated zone under steady state conditions raising the midpoint water table to the target elevation soil moisture then moves vertically as capillary or upward flux into the unsaturated root zone to meet the crop evapotranspiration et demands skaggs 1999 in steady state conditions the upward flux is deemed equivalent to et and the deficit soil moisture in the unsaturated zone above the water table is continuously replenished by the upward soil water flux furthermore this upward flux into the root zone is implicitly considered when selecting a design target level for a specific crop type and soil texture abbasi et al 2020 elmi et al 2010 madramootoo et al 2001 in some soil textures a small capillary fringe may develop above the water table but all lateral movement in this layer is usually negligible because of the rapid decrease in hydraulic conductivity with water content skaggs 1999 in many two dimensional 2d subsurface drainage theories flow below the water table usually employs the dupuit forchheimer assumptions i streamlines are horizontal and ii the hydraulic gradient is equal to the tangent of the water table slope mcwhorter and marinelli 1999 however the streamlines near buried pipes under subsurface irrigation mode are curvilinear due to head losses from the radial divergence of flow fig 2 the total head loss in the radial flow region δh comprises the exit head loss due to the finite perforations on the pipe wall and the divergent head loss due to the actual depth of the impermeable layer dim below the drainage pipe the exit head loss of buried pipes under subsurface irrigation mode is analogous to the entrance head loss of buried pipes under drainage mode and therefore can be determined from the mechanics of flow in the radial zone based on continuity conservation of mass and darcy s law under radial flow theory stuyt et al 2005 the continuity condition specifies that the irrigation soil water flux qirr leaving the buried pipe through the perforations fig 2 is equal to the upward et flux leaving the cropped surface fig 1 to maintain steady state conditions in order to account for the distortion of streamlines as the irrigation soil water flux exits the pipe perforations a new geometric parameter called the exit resistance αx is proposed in this study the exit resistance is comparable to the entrance resistance αe of buried perforated pipes operated under drainage mode similar to αe the exit resistance was also conceptualized as a dimensionless and soil independent parameter consequently hydraulic head data generated from numerical simulations of steady state radial flow near buried perforated pipes can be used to compute αx following gaj and madramootoo 2020 a brief description of radial flow theory stuyt et al 2005 and the equations used to compute αx are summarized in the supplementary materials 2 2 numerical simulations of exit resistance the exit resistance for various perforation size and configuration was computed from hydraulic head datasets obtained through simulations with a 3d finite element based numerical model the discretized model fig 3 is representative of the radial flow zone surrounding a nominal 100 mm diameter corrugated drainage pipe the numerical model was implemented in comsol multiphysics version 5 3 comsol multiphysics 2017a using the subsurface flow module comsol multiphysics 2017b only half of the radial flow region as shown in fig 3 was modelled due to symmetry along the pipe s longitudinal axis y axis the dimensions of the 3d model are 150 cm width x axis 60 cm length y axis and 124 cm depth z axis a full description of the model s governing and boundary equations discretization and calibration is given by gaj and madramootoo 2020 for completeness a short summary of the governing equations and boundary conditions is reported in the supplementary materials a total of 235 676 tetrahedral elements of varying sizes between 5 cm maximum and 0 15 cm minimum were used to generate the discretized mesh shown in figs 3 and 4 exploded view the hydraulic head datasets are generated from the numerical model using 72 piezometric probes that are strategically placed in the radial and axial directions in the saturated porous medium surrounding the buried pipe gaj and madramootoo 2020 the 3d numerical model fig 3 was previously used for computing αe of buried perforated corrugated pipes under drainage mode the flow direction in the radial zone during subsurface irrigation is reversed i e flow exiting the buried supply pipe and moving radially upward into the saturated soil medium therefore the dirichlet boundary condition at the perforation surface on the buried pipe φ 1 can no longer be described as flowing full with a free flow outlet gaj and madramootoo 2020 the buried supply pipe will flow full under a pressure head y 0 and thus the hydraulic head at the perforation surface is 1 φ 1 z h d y 0 d i m x y eq 1 was prescribed to the 3d numerical model for the steady state simulations carried out in subsurface irrigation mode practical values of y 0 were chosen such that hd is always greater than hs fig 2 which ensures that the hydraulic gradient will produce soil water fluxes that exit the pipe via the perforations it should be noted that the modification to the boundary condition at the perforation surface does not warrant a re calibration of the model because the boundary value problem formulated for radial flow under drainage is valid for radial flow under subsurface irrigation skaggs 1991 consequently a comparison of the delivery ratios of the perforated pipes under subsurface drainage and irrigation modes was made to verify this assumption the delivery ratio is defined as the ratio of discharge through a perforated or non ideal pipe to the discharge through a fully porous or ideal pipe under steady state conditions gaj and madramootoo 2020 the design variables considered in the numerical simulations for αx table 1 were the number of perforation lines n the length of the rectangular slot lperf the longitudinal spacing ay and the difference in head between hd and hs δh it has been previously demonstrated that rectangular slots are hydraulically more advantageous than circular holes when used as perforations for buried corrugated pipe to facilitate water table drawdown under drainage gaj and madramootoo 2020 this preferred hydraulic response from slots is due to the fact that the length of each slot is oriented along the circumference of the pipe wall which results in streamlines that converge in a 2d radial planar flow pattern similar to that of an ideal pipe gaj and madramootoo 2020 the same perforation shape effect is expected when the pipe is operated in the subsurface irrigation mode since the streamlines from rectangular slots will more closely diverge in a 2d radial planar flow pattern than streamlines from circular holes furthermore research has also shown that buried corrugated high density polyethylene hdpe pipes with rectangular slots have a lower risk of structural failure via ductile yielding compared to buried pipes perforated with circular holes gaj and madramootoo 2021 thus only the perforated pipe model with rectangular slots model cws was considered in this study for the subsurface irrigation simulations the perforations were placed in the center of the corrugation valley which is common practice for buried corrugated drainage pipes stuyt et al 2005 the pitch of the pipe is 1 645 cm for the annular corrugation profile used in model cws fig 4 hence the values of ay in table 1 represent perforations placed in every first second and third corrugation valley respectively the values of n and lperf are also representative of perforation characteristics commonly used on commercially available corrugated hdpe pipes gaj and madramootoo 2020 the range of values for δh in table 1 was selected based on pressure head values used in field studies with subsurface irrigation systems bournival et al 1987 cordeiro and sri ranjan 2012 elmi et al 2010 smith et al 1985 these studies covered a wide range of buried pipe depths soil types and crop types across north america moreover a head difference of 48 cm was included in the simulations in order to compare αx with αe and test the main hypothesis under equivalent hydraulic conditions this subset of simulations for hypothesis testing resulted in 27 3 3 3 combinations of n lperf and ay 2 3 layered soils in subsurface irrigation radial flow in a two layer system was simulated with model cws to investigate the impacts of soil heterogeneity on the exit resistance the porous medium domain fig 3 was separated into two blocks in order to represent two distinct soil layers the separation was done so that the center of the buried corrugated pipe was positioned at the interface of the two soil layers following tang and skaggs 1980 the mesh size and number of elements in model cws were unaffected because no changes were made to physical dimensions of the model domain or pipe geometry heterogeneity in the layered system was represented by the hydraulic conductivity ksat assigned to each layer according to soil texture a subset of four soil textures table 2 were adapted for the numerical simulations from rawls et al 1998 which contains a database of soil physical and hydraulic properties categorized according to the us department of agriculture usda textural classification system the corresponding unified soil classification system uscs symbol for each texture following garcia gaines and frankenstein 2015 is also listed in table 2 four arrangements table 3 of the two layer subsurface irrigation system were simulated using the soil textures listed in table 2 in each arrangement the soil with the larger conductivity was prescribed to the upper layer layer 1 the soil properties within each layer were assumed to be uniform and isotropic table 3 also summarizes the conductivity ratio crks of the two layer system which was computed as ksat layer 1 ksat layer 2 heterogeneous soils can be incorporated into subsurface drainage irrigation design through the use of an average conductivity value in lateral drain spacing equations madramootoo 1999 in layered soils the average hydraulic conductivity can be computed as either the harmonic or arithmetic mean if the flow direction is perpendicular or parallel to the layers respectively amoozegar and wilson 1999 considering that most of the water movement in a subsurface irrigation system occurs laterally under steady state conditions skaggs 1981 the arithmetic mean would be more appropriate for estimating the average hydraulic conductivity ksat a as amoozegar and wilson 1999 2 k s a t a l z 1 k s a t 1 l z 2 k s a t 2 l z n k s a t n l z where lz is the thickness of the soil layer a conductivity value computed with eq 2 is also known as the weighted average and it accounts for the differences in the thickness of each layer in heterogeneous soils the average hydraulic conductivity was computed for the four arrangements of two layer systems table 4 using eq 2 and then used in simulations to represent an equivalent homogeneous one layer system these simulations allowed for a direct comparison of the exit resistance of buried pipes in a heterogeneous two layer systems with the resistance from its equivalent homogeneous one layer counterpart 3 0 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of entrance and exit resistances in order to test the main hypothesis of this study the hydraulic resistances of perforated corrugated pipes used in subsurface drainage and irrigation systems were evaluated to allow for an explicit comparison under an equivalent hydraulic head difference δh 48 cm a total of 27 simulations representing combinations of n lperf and ay section 2 2 table 1 were carried out with model cws to generate the required hydraulic head data for computing αx subsurface irrigation mode on the other hand αe drainage mode was computed from a predictive equation developed by gaj and madramootoo 2020 for the matching 27 combinations of the perforation characteristics the results are shown in fig 5 which plots αe and αx relative to the equality 1 1 line the hydraulic resistance values shown in fig 5 all lie above the 1 1 line indicating that αx is generally greater than αe as a result the exit head loss due to perforations in a drainage pipe under subsurface irrigation mode will be larger than the entrance head loss of the pipe under drainage mode this disparity in head loss from the perforations can be explained by the reversal of flow through the porous medium under subsurface irrigation mode the hydraulic head is highest at the soil pipe interface then it experiences a precipitous drop immediately outside the pipe surface before it gradually decreases in the radial direction and the streamlines diverge upwards and radially away from the perforations this dissipation of the hydraulic head is illustrated in fig 6 which shows its distribution in the radial flow region around the buried pipe under subsurface irrigation mode the buried pipe in fig 6 is perforated with four lines of rectangular slots lperf 1 0 cm placed in every corrugation valley ay 1 645 cm in this particular perforation scenario the exit head loss accounts for approximately 57 of δh within a 5 0 cm radius from the pipe surface the remaining 43 of δh is dissipated over the next 50 cm of the flow region representing the divergent head loss in the subirrigation system these results demonstrate that exit losses can potentially account for the largest fraction of the total head loss within the radial flow zone in contrast the hydraulic head under drainage mode will drop steadily across the radial flow region losing a larger fraction of energy before the flow converges towards the perforations on the pipe wall thus the change in the pipe s boundary condition at the perforation surface due to the increased hydraulic head hd is ultimately responsible for the larger exit resistance to flow of buried pipes when operated in the subsurface irrigation mode 3 1 1 hypothesis testing and generalized relationship further comparison of the hydraulic resistances shows that αx is 1 7 times larger than αe when taken as an average across all 27 combinations section 2 2 of perforation design variables this difference between αx and αe however is not best described as a constant that can be applied to all perforation characteristics there is some degree of variability that is suitably illustrated fig 7 by the non linear increase of αx αe expressed as a function of the total perforation area ap the results in fig 7 show that the ratio of αx to αe can be as great as 2 5 when a buried corrugated pipe has a large perforation area ap 300 cm2 m the results also indicate that αx is approximately 20 larger than αe for buried pipes with a small perforation area ap 16 cm2 m consequently these differences in hydraulic resistance values were tested for statistical significance 5 level using the welch s t test moser and stevens 1992 the t test results not presented show that the differences between αx and αe are statistically significant p 0 05 across all 27 perforation combinations confirming the hypothesis of this study that αx is significantly larger than αe therefore these findings strongly support the use of the exit resistance to account for perforations in the analysis and design of subsurface irrigation systems moreover the following power law function was fitted r 2 87 2 to the data in fig 7 in order to provide a generalized predictive relationship between αx αe and ap 3 a x a e 0 593 a p 0 25 where ap is in cm2 m eq 3 can be used to estimate αx in situations where an existing drainage system with buried corrugated pipes is to be retrofitted to operate under subsurface irrigation mode elmi et al 2010 galganov 1991 the equation is limited to corrugated pipes perforated with rectangular slots having a maximum ap of 300 cm2 m values of ap for existing buried corrugated pipes are sometime reported by researchers bournival et al 1987 but details on the exact dimensions and or configuration of the perforations are often not properly documented therefore eq 3 may prove to be very useful provided a relationship between αe and ap is also available dierickx 1999 presented several curves of αe as a function of ap but only one of the curves is valid for corrugated drainage pipes furthermore only 0 5 cm long slots were used to generate the curve presented by dierickx 1999 restricting its use in practical situations a better representative relationship between αe and ap for corrugated drainage pipes with rectangular slots is presented in fig s1 supplementary material which considers a wider array of perforation characteristics such as size and configuration 3 1 2 validity of radial model under subsurface irrigation it is important to note that the flow rate through a fixed perforation size and configuration remained constant under both subsurface irrigation and drainage modes since δh was identical in these simulations this is fittingly demonstrated in fig 8 which plots the delivery ratios qirr q 0 or qs q 0 for variable perforated pipes operated under each mode relative to the equality 1 1 line the denominator q 0 is the flow rate through an ideal of fully porous pipe following gaj and madramootoo 2020 values of qirr q 0 for perforated corrugated pipes operated under subsurface irrigation mode were computed from the simulation results during post processing the corresponding qs q 0 for a buried corrugated pipe operated under drainage mode with the matching perforation combinations was computed from a predictive equation developed by gaj and madramootoo 2020 the results in fig 8 corroborate the validity of model cws for simulating radial flow under subsurface irrigation confirming that no re calibration of the model was necessary while the validity of the 3d radial flow model operating under subsurface irrigation mode has been demonstrated its application is limited to buried pipes with a diameter of 100 mm subsurface irrigation pipe diameters can vary from 75 mm to 150 mm but 100 mm was selected for the simulations since it is the most commonly used pipe diameter across eastern canada and the us midwest where subsurface irrigation is employed marmanilo et al 2021 yu et al 2020 another limitation to the study is that the model results apply to corrugated pipes that do not have thin synthetic envelopes or geotextile fabrics such as a filter sock wrapped around them during installation these fabrics prevent the loss of silt sized particles from soil around the pipe and have the effect of decreasing the entrance resistance of pipes operated under the drainage mode stuyt and dierickx 2006 however the effect of geotextile fabrics on the exit resistance of pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode has not been investigated 3 2 exit resistance and perforation characteristics 3 2 1 variable slot length a series of parametric simulations 189 in total using model cws and varying lperf n and ay were carried out in order to establish explicit relationships with αx for buried corrugated pipes under subsurface irrigation mode as shown in section 3 1 hd has a direct impact on the exit losses as water flows out of the pipe perforations therefore δh was also varied in these simulations in order to reflect typical field conditions for subsurface irrigation systems on agricultural lands fig 9 shows that αx generally decreases as δh increases for all values of lperf n and ay were fixed at 4 and 1 645 cm respectively this trend is indicative of the fact that the highest resistance to flow through the perforations occurs when the hydraulic gradient is lowest at the soil pipe interface perforation surface a low hydraulic gradient arises when there is a small difference between hd and the water table level immediately outside the buried supply pipe hs as δh increases the hydraulic gradient increases and more energy is available to overcome the resistance to flow resulting in lower values of αx for the perforated pipe fig 9 also shows that there are differences in the resistance of the perforated pipe under subsurface irrigation due to lperf this difference in αx is largest 34 between lperf values of 1 0 and 2 5 cm when δh is less than 10 cm however as δh increases the difference due to lperf becomes negligible these results indicate that the length of a rectangular slot has a relatively minor impact on the exit losses of corrugated subsurface irrigation pipes nevertheless it may be beneficial to use values of lperf greater than 1 75 cm in order to maximize the flow rate leaving the perforated pipes 3 2 2 variable perforation lines varying n during the simulations for model cws produced similar results to those obtained for variable lperf fig 10 shows that αx decreases as n increases across all values of δh for a corrugated pipe with lperf and ay fixed at 1 0 cm and 1 645 cm respectively however at the lower end of δh the difference in αx can be as large as 50 between 4 and 10 lines of perforations these results indicate that n has a larger effect on αx than lperf which is comparable to the findings for αe of corrugated drainage pipes gaj and madramootoo 2020 the current industry practice of using four lines of perforations on buried drainage pipes ads 2008 armtec 2012 jm eagle 2012 may result in larger exit losses for subsurface irrigation systems as such utilizing as many lines of rectangular slots as practical may be an efficient way of reducing the hydraulic resistance and minimizing the exit head loss of perforated pipes under subsurface irrigation mode in fact this finding is supported by the sand tank results of prasher et al 1989 which showed that there were no significant exit losses for corrugated pipes with n 12 it is important to note that there is a constraint on increasing n with respect to the structural response of buried corrugated pipes under agricultural loading conditions previous work has shown that at shallow burial depths less than 0 6 m increases in n can cause increases in pipe deformation of up to 4 of the pipe s diameter at the crown gaj and madramootoo 2021 this increase in deformation is due to a reduction in pipe stiffness in the hoop direction if the buried depth of corrugated supply pipes is greater than 0 6 m n 10 can be used as an upper limit for perforation lines without causing excessive deformation not more than 5 from agricultural field traffic loading gaj and madramootoo 2021 3 2 3 variable longitudinal spacing the third and final perforation design variable that represents the longitudinal spacing ay was then varied during the simulations with model cws n 4 and lperf 1 0 cm the results are shown in fig 11 which indicates that αx increases as the slots are spaced further apart for example slots spaced in every third corrugation valley ay 4 935 cm result in an increase in αx by more than 60 compared to slots in every valley ay 1 645 cm such increases in αx can be explained by the distortion of the streamlines in the longitudinal direction y as the flow exits the perforations figs 12 a and 12b as ay increases the streamlines travel a larger distance between slots before they leave through the perforations losing more energy and resulting in a more pronounced departure from 2d radial planar flow fig 12b in contrast the streamlines exiting perforations that are closely spaced display a higher degree of radial planar flow as indicated in fig 12a this trend exists across all values of δh for buried corrugated pipes indicating that closer spaced perforations are beneficial in reducing the exit head loss in subsurface irrigation systems as before this finding mirrors that of αe for buried corrugated drainage pipes where ay was ranked as second only to n for perforation variables that have the largest impact on hydraulic resistance gaj and madramootoo 2020 altogether these results show that the configuration of rectangular slots on the pipe wall n and ay plays an important role in estimating αx and ultimately the exit head loss of perforated corrugated pipes used in subsurface irrigation systems from a hydraulic point of view it is advantageous to use slots in every corrugation valley in order to reduce αx from a structural point of view there are no major disadvantages associated with placing slots in every valley previous work has shown that stress concentrations around perforations are not affected by ay in corrugated pipes gaj and madramootoo 2021 as manufacturers continue to produce and market corrugated polyethylene pipes rectangular slots placed in every corrugation valley should be promoted as the best perforations configuration to reduce hydraulic head losses both entrance and exit and maximize soil water fluxes in the case for subsurface irrigation systems reducing exit head losses can assist with setting automated water table controls and conserving scare water resources the non linear regression equation eq s2 and its associated coefficients given in tables s1 s3 can be used to compute αx as a function of δh and for select values of n lperf and ay these regression coefficients were generated from the simulated hydraulic head datasets the goodness of fit was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r 2 which was greater than 99 3 for all 27 fitted equations 3 3 effect of layered soils 3 4 1 exit resistance the effect of layered soils on αx was investigated using model cws which was adjusted to simulate radial flow through a corrugated pipe positioned at the interface of two soil layers the resulting αx due to varying perforation characteristics and δh combinations are shown in fig 13 for the heterogeneous arrangement of a loamy sand layer overlying a sandy clay layer sm sc for comparison simulations were also run with a single homogeneous layer having a weighted conductivity value ksat a eq 2 equivalent to that of the two layer sm sc system crks 46 the exit resistance values plotted in fig 13 all lie on the equality line 1 1 indicating that there is no difference in αx between the heterogeneous and homogeneous subsurface irrigation systems the simulated pathway of the streamlines shown in figs 14 a and 14b further supports the finding that αx is not affected by heterogeneous soil layers the streamlines within close proximity to the corrugated pipe are virtually identical for both the heterogeneous fig 14a and homogeneous fig 14b cases it is only when the streamlines diverge radially upward and away from the perforations that those in the less hydraulically conductive sc layer are sharply refracted after entering the more conductive sm layer fig 14a this sharp refraction is certainly due to the large difference in ksat between the two layers as this arrangement resulted in the highest conductivity ratio crks 46 representing an extreme case of heterogeneity on the other hand the ml ch arrangement fig 15 represents an intermediate case of heterogeneity with a crks value of 8 the relatively lower conductivity ratio explains why the streamlines in fig 15 are refracted to a lesser degree than those in fig 14a to further explore the streamline refraction across the layer interface of heterogeneous soils simulations were run using an additional two layer arrangement to those listed in table 3 the additional arrangement simulated a clay layer overlying a sandy clay layer ch sc as shown in fig 16 the streamlines in fig 16 are mildly refracted because this arrangement represents a two layer system with a crks of 2 in fact the refraction shown in fig 16 is almost comparable to that for a homogeneous soil system crks 1 as shown in fig 14b these findings indicate that the degree of streamline refraction between two soil layers varies directly with the conductivity ratio increasing as crks increases it is important to note that the streamline refractions in figs 14 16 occur well outside the vicinity of the pipe wall and they are not impacted by the pipe perforations for the homogeneous case crks 1 ksat is constant throughout the flow region and there is no refraction of the streamlines fig 14b moreover the same trend of diverging streamlines near the pipe perforations was observed from simulations using the two remaining two layer arrangements in table 3 ml sc and sm ch the computed exit resistance values remained the same regardless of the soil textures above and below the buried perforated pipe figs s2 s4 these results provide conclusive evidence to support the conceptualization of αx as a dimensionless parameter that is independent of ksat and only representative of the size and geometric configuration of perforations on the pipe wall therefore αx is not influenced by soil texture in either homogeneous soils or heterogeneous two layered systems that may be encountered on agricultural lands 4 0 conclusions a new dimensionless parameter αx representing the hydraulic exit resistance of corrugated pipes due to perforations is proposed in this study for incorporation into the analysis and design of buried pipes used in subsurface irrigation systems datasets obtained from 189 numerical simulations were used to investigate how the size and configuration of rectangular slots affect the exit resistance as the difference in hydraulic head between water levels in a control chamber and the surrounding soil increases from 10 to 100 cm the exit resistance of perforated corrugated pipes operated under the subsurface irrigation mode in layered soils was also investigated the major findings from this research indicate that αx is generally larger than its counterpart under drainage mode αe the differences between the two resistances are statistically significant p 0 05 the configuration of rectangular slots on the pipe wall as determined by n and ay has the largest impact on αx pipes with slots in every corrugation valley ay 1 645 cm will provide the least resistance compared to those with larger longitudinal spacings αx decreases as δh increases because more energy is available to overcome the resistance to flow during subsurface irrigation the degree of streamline refraction between two heterogeneous soil layers varies directly with the conductivity ratio increasing as crks increases αx is not influenced by soil texture in either homogeneous soils or heterogeneous two layered systems that are typically encountered on agricultural lands altogether the findings presented in this study extend the analysis and design of subsurface irrigation systems to include the exit resistance due to perforations in corrugated pipes exit head losses can now be computed for various perforation sizes and configurations and as a function of the hydraulic head on buried subsurface irrigation pipes these losses can be used to make more informed decisions about the target water level in control chambers in order to achieve more uniform rates of capillary rise in the unsaturated soil water zone to meet the et demands of the crop this can be of importance as water managers aim to automate the water table controls for conserving scarce water resources credit author statement

the basis for wettability evaluation here we model the relationship between the shape of imbibition profile and wettability of a medium we develop a wettability evaluation criterion based on the

anderson 1986 agbalaka et al 2008 gao et al 2020 to date numerous researchers investigated the effect of wettability on oil recovery and it is still of broad and current interest morrow 1990 ekechukwu et al 2021 kallel et al 2016 alyafei and blunt 2016 moradpour et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 numerous wettability measurement techniques have been proposed in the literature which can be classified as qualitative or quantitative methods anderson 1986 qualitative methods utilize imbibition rates microscopic examinations relative permeability curves capillary pressure curves nuclear magnetic resonance data and reservoir logs amott 1959 craig 1993 chen et al 2021 hjelmeland and torsæter 1980 donaldson 1981 three quantitative methods that are widely used are 1 contact angle measurement 2 amott harvey amott 1959 and 3 united states bureau of mines usbm donaldson 1981 donaldson et al 1969 contact angle measurements represent the specific limited surface contacted by the droplet while usbm and amott harvey methods measure the average wettability of a core sample anderson 1986 therefore contact angle measurements become impractical for evaluating the wettability of rocks with surface contamination and compositional heterogeneities such as shales morrow 1990 moreover amott harvey and usbm methods can hardly be applied to rocks with ultralow permeability that makes the forced displacement part challenging sulucarnain et al 2012 another technique that is widely utilized for wettability evaluation is based on the spontaneous imbibition si profile anderson 1986 gao et al 2019 lan et al 2015 jadhunandan and morrow 1995 olafuyi et al 2007 jadhunandan and morrow 1991 si is the process of wetting fluid invasion into a porous medium by capillary force morrow and mason 2001 numerous analytical and simulation studies have been performed so far to model the spontaneous imbibition process in porous media which are extensively reviewed elsewhere cai et al 2021 conventionally two samples of a rock which are initially completely saturated with air are placed in contact with two different fluids and the weight of samples is monitored over time until no measurable change in weight is observed the rock wettability is estimated based on the final imbibed volume many scholars have used this approach to evaluate wettability of rock samples of either conventional or unconventional reservoirs begum et al 2017 yassin et al 2018 yassin et al 2017 xu et al 2020 siddiqui et al 2019 takahashi and kovscek 2010 other studies investigated the relationship between the shape of imbibition curves and rock wettability and introduced new wettability indices lan et al 2015 compared slope of oil and water imbibition curves at early stages of imbibition and defined a parameter as the ratio between the slope of oil and water imbibition curves they observed good correlations between the slope of oil imbibition curve and equilibrium imbibed mass however the logic behind this parameter and its application for wettability evaluation were not addressed yassin et al 2017 similarly investigated the slope of imbibition curve and defined pore wettability index pwi as cos θ r based on the initial rate of si they used handy 1960 model for rate of imbibition and evaluated pwi of the rock samples used in their study they explained the reason for pwioil pwiwater but they did not investigate the correlation of pwi with rock mineralogy and petrophysical properties mirzaei paiaman et al 2013 proposed a wettability index using the slope of oil recovery curve obtained from a counter current imbibition process they combined the continuity equation with the fractional flow and capillary diffusion functions and proposed a special linear plot with a slope depending on the rock and fluid properties along with relative permeability data they normalized the slope with a reference value that corresponds to a strongly water wet system to define the wettability index morrow et al 1994 modeled a pseudo imbibition capillary pressure curve using si data and defined a new parameter called pseudo work of imbibition w they proposed that the area under an imbibition capillary pressure curve is related to the work done by the system they introduced relative pseudo work of imbibition by normalization of pseudo work data by the maximum value of w however they used scaling of si data instead of thermodynamic concepts moreover the contact angle parameter was not considered in their model which can lead to the insensitivity of the model to varying states of wettability thermodynamically a system always seeks the lowest free energy level to achieve an equilibrium state borgnakke and sonntag 2020 spontaneous imbibition of liquids into a porous medium which is a strong function of wettability occurs to reduce the free energy level peters 2012 accordingly the change in the free energy of the system depends on wettability state of the porous medium in this paper we model the helmholtz free energy a of a system during the si process from a thermodynamics point of view the proposed model incorporates the area under the curve and slope of the imbibition profile to predict a we develop equations for a single circular and non circular capillary tubes and then generalize them for a porous medium and define a wettability index using the volume normalized a values finally we apply the proposed model on spontaneous imbibition profiles of eight twin rock samples from the montney formation and investigate the correlations of wettability indices with rock mineralogy and petrophysical properties 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 hypothesis and assumptions we hypothesize that the area under the curve of si represents the change in a of the system to verify this hypothesis we start from the hagen poiseuille cai et al 2014 equation for a single capillary tube and arrive at a modified form of the lucas washburn lucas 1918 equation and then we generalize the model for porous media the following assumptions form the basis of the proposed model capillary force is the only driving force for the spontaneous imbibition process we assume capillary sizes to be in the order of microns hence the bond number for capillary tube li et al 2018 and porous medium schechter et al 1994 will be in the order of 10 7 and 10 3 respectively confirming that gravity forces are negligible in these systems we consider both circular and non circular cross section capillary tubes in developing energy equations we assume the porous medium as a bundle of straight capillary tubes with circular cross sections previous studies rye et al 1996 mann et al 1995 ichikawa et al 2004 yang et al 2011 chen et al 2009 yu et al 2018 showed that regardless of the shape of the cross section of the capillary tube the capillary suction obeys the lucas washburn t 1 2 scaling in developing energy balance equations the shape of the interface between the wetting and non wetting phases remains constant during a displacement process fluid and rock properties are assumed to be constant during the si process 2 2 mathematical formulation of helmholtz free energy during a spontaneous imbibition process 2 2 1 single circular capillary tube here we aim to develop an equation for a during si of fluids into a single circular capillary tube first we formulate the flow of fluids through a capillary tube during the si process conventionally the hagen poiseuille cai et al 2014 equation is used to model the laminar flow of an incompressible newtonian fluid through conduits of constant cross section combining hagen poiseuille and young laplace siqveland and skjaeveland 2021 equations yields the following expression for wetting fluid imbibition into a capillary tube initially saturated with a non wetting fluid 1 x t r σ nw w cos θ 2 μ w μ nw t l μ nw μ w μ nw 2 l μ nw μ w μ nw the derivation details are presented in appendix a this is the modified form of the lucas washburn lucas 1918 washburn 1921 equation that is simplified to the basic form when μ nw 0 indeed in the basic form of the lucas washburn equation the non wetting phase is air with negligible viscosity compared to liquids moreover when μnw μw eq 1 has a asymptotic solution which is presented in detail in appendix a fig 1 shows the typical profile representing si of a wetting fluid into a vertical capillary tube over time v eq w is the equilibrium wetting fluid volume and teq is the time at which this equilibrium is achieved the area under the curve illustrated by the hatched region is given by 2 a r e a 0 t e q v t d t a c 0 t e q x t d t here ac is the cross sectional area of the capillary tube substituting eq 1 into eq 2 gives the area under the curve of imbibition based on the system parameters 3 a r e a 4 μ w μ n w 3 r σ n w w cos θ r σ n w w cos θ 2 μ w μ n w t e q l μ n w μ w μ n w 2 3 2 l μ n w μ w μ n w t e q a c hereafter the system refers to porous medium or capillary tube and its saturating fluids during displacement of a non wetting phase by a wetting phase the helmholtz free energy of the system is a function of the interfacial tensions peters 2012 4 a f a s w a s n w a n w w here a is the helmholtz free energy of the system asw asnw and a nw w are the interfacial area of solid wetting solid non wetting and non wetting wetting interfaces respectively if the interfacial area of the wetting non wetting interface remains constant during wetting fluid advancement into the capillary tube we can quantify the changes in a of the system da dx during the displacement as peters 2012 5 d a d x 2 π r σ s n w σ s w appendix b shows the derivation details eq 5 gives negative values for da dx when the wetting fluid displaces the non wetting fluid since σ snw σ sw this shows that a of the system decreases during the si process and the system reaches thermodynamically stable conditions at the end of the process peters 2012 young dupre equation schrader 1995 relates the surface tension of solid non wetting σ snw solid wetting σ sw and non wetting wetting σ nw w interfaces to contact angle θ at equilibrium state by 6 σ s

n w μ w μ n w 2 3 2 2 2 single non circular capillary tube here we aim to extend the developed model eq 8 for cylindrical capillary tubes with arbitrary non circular cross sections previous studies showed that pore bodies and throats of porous materials might have different cross sections such as triangular rectangular and elliptical tuller and or 2001 keller et al 1997 bubeck et al 2017 in such cases the fluid configuration and interface are affected by pore shape and corners angle hwang 1977 showed that we can compute the mean curvature and capillary rise in a non circular capillary provided that we know the hydraulic radius mason and morrow 1991 defined a shape factor g equivalent to dimensionless hydraulic radius of the capillary by 9 g a c p tri 2 r h p tri here rh and p tri are the hydraulic radius and perimeter of a capillary with a triangular cross section patzek and silin 2001 used this definition and computed g of such capillary tubes by 10 g 1 4 i 1 3 cot β i 1 4 tan β 1 tan β 2 cot β 1 β 2 where β 1 β 2 and β 3 are corner half angles of the triangle the maximum value of g is 3 36 corresponding to an equilateral triangular cross section we use this definition to modify our model for triangular cross sections if wetting fluid imbibes spontaneously into a triangular capillary with a perimeter of p tri and shape factor of g which is computed by eq 10 the helmholtz free energy area relationship is modified to 11 a a c 3 area a c l μ nw μ w μ nw t eq dv t d t 2 96 a c 2 μ w μ nw 3 t eq 3 g p tri 6 v eq a c l μ nw μ w μ nw 2 1 a c 2 l μ nw μ w μ nw 2 3 here the cross sectional area of the capillary a c can be calculated either by hydraulic radius or dimensions of the triangle 2 2 3 porous medium here the objective is to model helmholtz free energy during the si process in a porous medium the effective medium approximation ema theory has been successfully used for prediction of hydrodynamic properties of porous materials such as permeability and hydraulic conductance doyen 1988 this theory helps to define average properties of heterogeneous composite materials that can be representative of the system choy 2015 besides previous studies proposed imbibition models for porous media based on a bundle of capillary tube assumption and observed a reasonable match between experimental data and analytical models cai et al 2021 cai et al 2014 hammecker et al 1993 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 here we use the same assumption and generalize eq 8 for porous media when a rock is in contact with a wetting fluid only from its bottom face the average cross section open to flow can be approximated by acφ φ and ac are porosity and total cross sectional area of the medium respectively therefore the ac term in eq 8 can be replaced with acφ for rock samples with a more complex structure we cannot measure an average value of r that can truly represent the whole medium therefore we use the concept of effective hydraulic radius and replace the r 2 term with 8k φ babchin et al 2016 where k is the absolute permeability of the rock applying these modifications to eq 8 gives 12 a a c φ 3 a r e a a c φ l μ n w μ w μ n w t e q d v t d t 2 3 16 φ μ w μ n w 3 a c 2 t e q 3 k 3 v e q a c φ l μ n w μ w μ n w 2 1 φ 2 a c 2 l μ n w μ w μ n w 2 3 2 2 4 limiting case in the case of a porous medium that is initially completely saturated with air eq 9 is simplified to the following expression 13 a 3 a r e a d v t d t 2 3 16 μ w 3 v e q 6 a c 6 φ 3 t e q 3 k 3 here μ w is in pa s veq in m 3 ac in m 2 φ in fraction teq in s and k in m 2 and the calculated a in joule eq 10 suggests that a 3 is proportional to area slope 2 where the slope is defined by d v d t it also suggests that a is proportional to v e q 2 and inversely proportional to teq estimation of a using eq 13 only requires a si profile with no need for any knowledge about capillary pressure or contact angle data the effect of these parameters is reflected in equilibrium volume equilibrium time and the area under the curve and its slope 2 3 wettability evaluation index using helmholtz free energy thermodynamically the lower the free energy level of the system is the higher the stability of the system will be borgnakke and sonntag 2020 during the si process the wetting fluid displaces the non wetting one to increase the thermodynamic stability of the system this implies that the extent of energy change is related to the wettability state of the system therefore we introduce a wettability index based on the predicted a using eqs 12 or eq 13 in fig 2 two rock samples with identical petrophysical properties are placed in contact with water and oil only from their bottom face in two separate tests in each of the tests the sample is initially completely saturated with air i e sair 1 two separate imbibition curves are obtained for water and oil see fig 2 we can determine the helmholtz free energy of the system after each imbibition process using eq 13 one may argue that based on eq 13 a depends on veq when a fluid is imbibed more than another fluid lan et al 2015 yassin et al 2018 yassin et al 2017 xu et al 2020 habibi et al 2016 the difference in a of these two cases might originate from the difference in the amount of imbibed fluid not wettability state therefore we normalize a by veq to have a consistent comparison between the imbibition results of different fluids in terms of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity morrow et al 1994 normalized the predicted pseudo work values by the maximum value of work to define the wettability index in the usbm technique the ratio of area under the curve of oil and water imbibition is used to quantify the wettability index donaldson 1981 donaldson et al 1969 amott harvey technique uses the difference between spontaneously imbibed volume of oil and water which are normalized by the total amount of imbibed oil and water si forced imbibition respectively amott 1959 analogous to the usbm method we define the wettability index as the ratio of volume normalized a values of oil and water however we compare the changes in a by one fluid with respect to total changes in a occurred by both oil and water 14 w i w a w v eq w a w v eq w a nw v eq nw 15 w i nw a nw v eq nw a w v eq w a nw v eq nw 1 w i w here wiw and winw are wettability index of wetting and non wetting phases respectively aw and anw are the calculated helmholtz free energy values using eq 13 or eq 12 for wetting and non wetting phases based on this definition wettability indices range from 0 to 1 representing strongly non wetting and strongly wetting conditions respectively eqs 14 and 15 along with eq 12 can determine the degree of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of a porous medium without any need for uncertain contact angle data unlike the usbm method that needs a centrifuge to push the fluid into the rock and the amott harvey method that has a forced imbibition part this method only requires the si data 3 data sources for model application the proposed technique is applied to eight twin rock samples selected from the montney formation from western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb twin refers to samples that are taken from the same depth of a formation therefore the petrophysical properties and mineralogy of the twin samples can be assumed to be identical this assumption is used to eliminate the effect of changes in petrophysical properties and mineralogy of the twin samples on wettability evaluation tables a 1 and a 2 in appendix d list the mineralogy and petrophysical properties of the selected rock samples respectively adopted from lan et al 2015 dodecane and 2 wt of potassium chloride kcl solution were used as oleic and aqueous phases in their si tests respectively table a 3 lists the physical properties of these liquids at the experimental temperature of 25 fig 3 shows the profiles of water and oil spontaneous imbibition into a sample lmt4 from their study umt and lmt refer to samples taken from upper montney and lower montney formations respectively imbibition profiles of all the samples are presented in appendix d the profiles suggest that more parts of the pore network are hydrophobic since the volume of imbibed water is significantly lower than that of imbibed oil note that the water imbibition curve arrives at equilibrium faster than the oil curve solid and dashed arrows in fig 3 determine the equilibrium time of water and oil imbibition curves respectively this is the time at which no more fluid is imbibed into the rock samples for both fluids equilibrium occurs much earlier than the end of the imbibition test this observation is more pronounced for the water imbibition profile referring to lan et al s paper the average pore size of these samples is in the order of 0 1 microns lan et al 2015 therefore we can ignore the effect of gravity on the imbibition profiles this implies that the plateau section is not due to the balance between capillary and gravity forces this can be attributed to the completion of pore filling by the imbibing fluid note that filling of the pore network does not imply 100 saturation of imbibing fluid since there always exists entrapment of the non wetting phase in the pore network meng et al 2015 fluid redistribution is still possible in the pore network during the plateau section but it does not change the equilibrium imbibed volume chen et al 2021 therefore the onset of the plateau section of the si curve is the end of the fluid intake process by the capillary force and is referred to as teq eqs 12 or 13 can be used to calculate a when t teq 4 model application 4 1 predicted wettability indices using the proposed technique here we first apply eq 13 to the imbibition profiles shown in fig a 1 and a 2 to calculate a of the system during each imbibition process then we calculate the wettability index of oil using eq 12 table 1 summarizes the calculated a volume normalized a and wio using the proposed technique for all the rock samples the last column lists the calculated wettability indices using the volume based technique lan et al 2015 according to table 1 the predicted wio values using the proposed technique range from 54 to 96 representing intermediate to strongly hydrophobic systems in general the wettability indices increase with depth showing that the lmt samples are more hydrophobic than the umt samples except for umt4 and umt5 the predicted wio values using the proposed technique are higher than the values estimated based on the volume based method the minimum difference is related to umt4 with 6 33 and the maximum difference corresponds to umt3 with 20 07 in the next sections we investigate the correlations of wettability indices with the mineralogy and petrophysical properties of the rock samples to verify the proposed technique 4 2 correlation between wettability index of oil and petrophysical properties here we analyze the correlations of predicted wio by the proposed technique with rock properties including porosity total organic carbon content toc bulk volume water bvw asquith 1985 and total clay concentration table 2 lists the observed correlations categorized as positive or negative showing ascending or descending trends respectively the last two columns report the calculated r2 values for the observed trends using the proposed and volume based techniques the graphical representation of the studied correlations can be found in appendix e table 2 shows that both the proposed and volume based techniques generate similar types of correlations positive or negative for all the studied parameters however the calculated r2 values for all the correlations are higher using the proposed technique compared with those using the volume based technique indicating the higher accuracy of the proposed technique the highest difference is observed for the correlation with total clay concentration detailed explanation of the observed trends is presented in appendix f based on table 2 the volume based technique of wettability evaluation underestimates the degree of hydrophobicity of these rock samples this observation is consistent with faster imbibition of oil compared with water which is captured by the proposed energy based method 5 limitations although the proposed model shows reasonable results for the cases studied above there are limitations that can be addressed in future studies 1 we consider the capillary force as the only driving force for fluid uptake the model can be modified for the cases where other effects such as gravity and osmosis are significant 2 the rock samples used in this study have non swelling clay minerals lan et al 2015 when swelling minerals such as smectite exist in the rock part of the water intake will be due to clay swelling which is not considered in the proposed mathematical model in this case disjoining pressure must be considered in the young laplace equation kim 2012 3 we assumed that rock properties such as porosity and permeability are constant during the imbibition however phenomena such as clay swelling and the reaction of rock minerals with fluids might alter these properties aksu et al 2015 4 in the nano scale pore network of tight rocks the fluid properties such as viscosity may change due to nanoconfinement effect wang et al 2018 however we assumed that fluid properties are constant during the tests in the present model 5 in real porous media such as rocks the flow channels are tortuous in this case the lucas washburn t 1 2 scaling changes to t 1 2 d t scaling where dt is fractal dimension for tortuosity cai and yu 2011 however the effect of tortuosity is not considered in the present model 6 conclusions in this study we used hagen poiseuille and young laplace equations to develop a mathematical model to estimate the helmholtz free energy of the system during the spontaneous imbibition process the system includes a porous medium with its saturating fluids first we developed a modified form of the lucas washburn equation which models the dynamics of displacement of a viscous non wetting fluid by a viscous wetting fluid in a co current imbibition process we proposed a model that can estimate the changes in helmholtz free energy of the system using the profile of imbibed volume versus time the model is simplified for a case that a liquid is imbibed into a dry porous medium the model relates the helmholtz free energy of the system to the area under the curve and slope of the imbibition profile the model incorporates the system parameters including equilibrium imbibed volume equilibrium imbibition time and fluid and rock properties then we defined a wettability index based on volume normalized helmholtz free energy values the proposed wettability indices range from 0 to 1 showing very weak and very strong wetting preference of a rock surface toward a fluid respectively we applied the model on the data of spontaneous imbibition experiments conducted on eight twin rock samples we compared the wettability indices predicted by the proposed technique with those by the volume based technique we studied the correlations of the wettability indices predicted by both techniques with porosity total organic carbon content bulk volume water and total clay concentration of the rock samples the results showed similar trends using both techniques with more accurate correlations using the proposed technique the comparison between the two techniques demonstrated that the volume based

alberta t6g 2w2 canada corresponding author spontaneous imbibition profiles are widely used for wettability evaluation of porous media such as rocks however mostly the equilibrium imbibed volume is the basis for wettability evaluation here we model the relationship between the shape of imbibition profile and wettability of a medium we develop a wettability evaluation criterion based on the change in helmholtz free energy of the system during the imbibition process the model relates the helmholtz free energy to the area under the profile the slope of the imbibition profile equilibrium imbibed volume and equilibrium time we propose a modified form of lucas washburn equation to model the capillary driven flow of a viscous wetting phase into a porous medium saturated with a viscous non wetting phase we introduce a wettability index using the volume normalized helmholtz free energy finally the model is tested on imbibition data of eight twin rock samples and the wettability

usbm and amott harvey methods measure the average wettability of a core sample anderson 1986 therefore contact angle measurements become impractical for evaluating the wettability of rocks with surface contamination and compositional heterogeneities such as shales morrow 1990 moreover amott harvey and usbm methods can hardly be applied to rocks with ultralow permeability that makes the forced displacement part challenging sulucarnain et al 2012 another technique that is widely utilized for wettability evaluation is based on the spontaneous imbibition si profile anderson 1986 gao et al 2019 lan et al 2015 jadhunandan and morrow 1995 olafuyi et al 2007 jadhunandan and morrow 1991 si is the process of wetting fluid invasion into a porous medium by capillary force morrow and mason 2001 numerous analytical and simulation studies have been performed so far to model the spontaneous imbibition process in porous media which are extensively reviewed elsewhere cai et al 2021 conventionally two samples of a rock which are initially completely saturated with air are placed in contact with two different fluids and the weight of samples is monitored over time until no measurable change in weight is observed the rock wettability is estimated based on the final imbibed volume many scholars have used this approach to evaluate wettability of rock samples of either conventional or unconventional reservoirs begum et al 2017 yassin et al 2018 yassin et al 2017 xu et al 2020 siddiqui et al 2019 takahashi and kovscek 2010 other studies investigated the relationship between the shape of imbibition curves and rock wettability and introduced new wettability indices lan et al 2015 compared slope of oil and water imbibition curves at early stages of imbibition and defined a parameter as the ratio between the slope of oil and water imbibition curves they observed good correlations between the slope of oil imbibition curve and equilibrium imbibed mass however the logic behind this parameter and its application for wettability evaluation were not addressed yassin et al 2017 similarly investigated the slope of imbibition curve and defined pore wettability index pwi as cos θ r based on the initial rate of si they used handy 1960 model for rate of imbibition and evaluated pwi of the rock samples used in their study they explained the reason for pwioil pwiwater but they did not investigate the correlation of pwi with rock mineralogy and petrophysical properties mirzaei paiaman et al 2013 proposed a wettability index using the slope of oil recovery curve obtained from a counter current imbibition process they combined the continuity equation with the fractional flow and capillary diffusion functions and proposed a special linear plot with a slope depending on the rock and fluid properties along with relative permeability data they normalized the slope with a reference value that corresponds to a strongly water wet system to define the wettability index morrow et al 1994 modeled a pseudo imbibition capillary pressure curve using si data and defined a new parameter called pseudo work of imbibition w they proposed that the area under an imbibition capillary pressure curve is related to the work done by the system they introduced relative pseudo work of imbibition by normalization of pseudo work data by the maximum value of w however they used scaling of si data instead of thermodynamic concepts moreover the contact angle parameter was not considered in their model which can lead to the insensitivity of the model to varying states of wettability thermodynamically a system always seeks the lowest free energy level to achieve an equilibrium state borgnakke and sonntag 2020 spontaneous imbibition of liquids into a porous medium which is a strong function of wettability occurs to reduce the free energy level peters 2012 accordingly the change in the free energy of the system depends on wettability state of the porous medium in this paper we model the helmholtz free energy a of a system during the si process from a thermodynamics point of view the proposed model incorporates the area under the curve and slope of the imbibition profile to predict a we develop equations for a single circular and non circular capillary tubes and then generalize them for a porous medium and define a wettability index using the volume normalized a values finally we apply the proposed model on spontaneous imbibition profiles of eight twin rock samples from the montney formation and investigate the correlations of wettability indices with rock mineralogy and petrophysical properties 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 hypothesis and assumptions we hypothesize that the area under the curve of si represents the change in a of the system to verify this hypothesis we start from the hagen poiseuille cai et al 2014 equation for a single capillary tube and arrive at a modified form of the lucas washburn lucas 1918 equation and then we generalize the model for porous media the following assumptions form the basis of the proposed model capillary force is the only driving force for the spontaneous imbibition process we assume capillary sizes to be in the order of microns hence the bond number for capillary tube li et al 2018 and porous medium schechter et al 1994 will be in the order of 10 7 and 10 3 respectively confirming that gravity forces are negligible in these systems we consider both circular and non circular cross section capillary tubes in developing energy equations we assume the porous medium as a bundle of straight capillary tubes with circular cross sections previous studies rye et al 1996 mann et al 1995 ichikawa et al 2004 yang et al 2011 chen et al 2009 yu et al 2018 showed that regardless of the shape of the cross section of the capillary tube the capillary suction obeys the lucas washburn t 1 2 scaling in developing energy balance equations the shape of the interface between the wetting and non wetting phases remains constant during a displacement process fluid and rock properties are assumed to be constant during the si process 2 2 mathematical formulation of helmholtz free energy during a spontaneous imbibition process 2 2 1 single circular capillary tube here we aim to develop an equation for a during si of fluids into a single circular capillary tube first we formulate the flow of fluids through a capillary tube during the si process conventionally the hagen poiseuille cai et al 2014 equation is used to model the laminar flow of an incompressible newtonian fluid through conduits of constant cross section combining hagen poiseuille and young laplace siqveland and skjaeveland 2021 equations yields the following expression for wetting fluid imbibition into a capillary tube initially saturated with a non wetting fluid 1 x t r σ nw w cos θ 2 μ w μ nw t l μ nw μ w μ nw 2 l μ nw μ w μ nw the derivation details are presented in appendix a this is the modified form of the lucas washburn lucas 1918 washburn 1921 equation that is simplified to the basic form when μ nw 0 indeed in the basic form of the lucas washburn equation the non wetting phase is air with negligible viscosity compared to liquids moreover when μnw μw eq 1 has a asymptotic solution which is presented in detail in appendix a fig 1 shows the typical profile representing si of a wetting fluid into a vertical capillary tube over time v eq w is the equilibrium wetting fluid volume and teq is the time at which this equilibrium is achieved the area under the curve illustrated by the hatched region is given by 2 a r e a 0 t e q v t d t a c 0 t e q x t d t here ac is the cross sectional area of the capillary tube substituting eq 1 into eq 2 gives the area under the curve of imbibition based on the system parameters 3 a r e a 4 μ w μ n w 3 r σ n w w cos θ r σ n w w cos θ 2 μ w μ n w t e q l μ n w μ w μ n w 2 3 2 l μ n w μ w μ n w t e q a c hereafter the system refers to porous medium or capillary tube and its saturating fluids during displacement of a non wetting phase by a wetting phase the helmholtz free energy of the system is a function of the interfacial tensions peters 2012 4 a f a s w a s n w a n w w here a is the helmholtz free energy of the system asw asnw and a nw w are the interfacial area of solid wetting solid non wetting and non wetting wetting interfaces respectively if the interfacial area of the wetting non wetting interface remains constant during wetting fluid advancement into the capillary tube we can quantify the changes in a

the non wetting fluid since σ snw σ sw this shows that a of the system decreases during the si process and the system reaches thermodynamically stable conditions at the end of the process peters 2012 young dupre equation schrader 1995 relates the surface tension of solid non wetting σ snw solid wetting σ sw and non wetting wetting σ nw w interfaces to contact angle θ at equilibrium state by 6 σ s

n w μ w μ n w 2 3 2 2 2 single non circular capillary tube here we aim to extend the developed model eq 8 for cylindrical capillary tubes with arbitrary non circular cross sections previous studies showed that pore bodies and throats of porous materials might have different cross sections such as triangular rectangular and elliptical tuller and or 2001 keller et al 1997 bubeck et al 2017 in such cases the fluid configuration and interface are affected by pore shape and corners angle hwang 1977 showed that we can compute the mean curvature and capillary rise in a non circular capillary provided that we know the hydraulic radius mason and morrow 1991 defined a shape factor g equivalent to dimensionless hydraulic radius of the capillary by 9 g a c p tri 2 r h p tri here rh and p tri are the hydraulic radius and perimeter of a capillary with a triangular cross section patzek and silin 2001 used this definition and computed g of such capillary tubes by 10 g 1 4 i 1 3 cot β i 1 4 tan β 1 tan β 2 cot β 1 β 2 where β 1 β 2 and β 3 are corner half angles of the triangle the maximum value of g is 3 36 corresponding to an equilateral triangular cross section we use this definition to modify our model for triangular cross sections if wetting fluid imbibes spontaneously into a triangular capillary with a perimeter of p tri and shape factor of g which is computed by eq 10 the helmholtz free energy area relationship is modified to 11 a a c 3 area a c l μ nw μ w μ nw t eq dv t d t 2 96 a c 2 μ w μ nw 3 t eq 3 g p tri 6 v eq a c l μ nw μ w μ nw 2 1 a c 2 l μ nw μ w μ nw 2 3 here the cross sectional area of the capillary a c can be calculated either by hydraulic radius or dimensions of the triangle 2 2 3 porous medium here the objective is to model helmholtz free energy during the si process in a porous medium the effective medium approximation ema theory has been successfully used for prediction of hydrodynamic properties of porous materials such as permeability and hydraulic conductance doyen 1988 this theory helps to define average properties of heterogeneous composite materials that can be representative of the system choy 2015 besides previous studies proposed imbibition models for porous media based on a bundle of capillary tube assumption and observed a reasonable match between experimental data and analytical models cai et al 2021 cai et al 2014 hammecker et al 1993 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 here we use the same assumption and generalize eq 8 for porous media when a rock is in contact with a wetting fluid only from its bottom face the average cross section open to flow can be approximated by acφ φ and ac are porosity and total cross sectional area of the medium respectively therefore the ac term in eq 8 can be replaced with acφ for rock samples with a more complex structure we cannot measure an average value of r that can truly represent the whole medium therefore we use the concept of effective hydraulic radius and replace the r 2 term with 8k φ babchin et al 2016 where k is the absolute permeability of the rock applying these modifications to eq 8 gives 12 a a c φ 3 a r e a a c φ l μ n w μ w μ n w t e q d v t d t 2 3 16 φ μ w μ n w 3 a c 2 t e q 3 k 3 v e q a c φ l μ n w μ w μ n w 2 1 φ 2 a c 2 l μ n w μ w μ n w 2 3 2 2 4 limiting case in the case of a porous medium that is initially completely saturated with air eq 9 is simplified to the following expression 13 a 3 a r e a d v t d t 2 3 16 μ w 3 v e q 6 a c 6 φ 3 t e q 3 k 3 here μ w is in pa s veq in m 3 ac in m 2 φ in fraction teq in s and k in m 2 and the calculated a in joule eq 10 suggests that a 3 is proportional to area slope 2 where the slope is defined by d v d t it also suggests that a is proportional to v e q 2 and inversely proportional to teq estimation of a using eq 13 only requires a si profile with no need for any knowledge about capillary pressure or contact angle data the effect of these parameters is reflected in equilibrium volume equilibrium time and the area under the curve and its slope 2 3 wettability evaluation index using helmholtz free energy thermodynamically the lower the free energy level of the system is the higher the stability of the system will be borgnakke and sonntag 2020 during the si process the wetting fluid displaces the non wetting one to increase the thermodynamic stability of the system this implies that the extent of energy change is related to the wettability state of the system therefore we introduce a wettability index based on the predicted a using eqs 12 or eq 13 in fig 2 two rock samples with identical petrophysical properties are placed in contact with water and oil only from their bottom face in two separate tests in each of the tests the sample is initially completely saturated with air i e sair 1 two separate imbibition curves are obtained for water and oil see fig 2 we can determine the helmholtz free energy of the system after each imbibition process using eq 13 one may argue that based on eq 13 a depends on veq when a fluid is imbibed more than another fluid lan et al 2015 yassin et al 2018 yassin et al 2017 xu et al 2020 habibi et al 2016 the difference in a of these two cases might originate from the difference in the amount of imbibed fluid not wettability state therefore we normalize a by veq to have a consistent comparison between the imbibition results of different fluids in terms of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity morrow et al 1994 normalized the predicted pseudo work values by the maximum value of work to define the wettability index in the usbm technique the ratio of area under the curve of oil and water imbibition is used to quantify the wettability index donaldson 1981 donaldson et al 1969 amott harvey technique uses the difference between spontaneously imbibed volume of oil and water which are normalized by the total amount of imbibed oil and water si forced imbibition respectively amott 1959 analogous to the usbm method we define the wettability index as the ratio of volume normalized a values of oil and water however we compare the changes in a by one fluid with respect to total changes in a occurred by both oil and water 14 w i w a w v eq w a w v eq w a nw v eq nw 15 w i nw a nw v eq nw a w v eq w a nw v eq nw 1 w i w here wiw and winw are wettability index of wetting and non wetting phases respectively aw and anw are the calculated helmholtz free energy values using eq 13 or eq 12 for wetting and non wetting phases based on this definition wettability indices range from 0 to 1 representing strongly non wetting and strongly wetting conditions respectively eqs 14 and 15 along with eq 12 can determine the degree of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of a porous medium without any need for uncertain contact angle data unlike the usbm method that needs a centrifuge to push the fluid into the rock and the amott harvey method that has a forced imbibition part this method only requires the si data 3 data sources for model application the proposed technique is applied to eight twin rock samples selected from the montney formation from western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb twin refers to samples that are taken from the same depth of a formation therefore the petrophysical properties and mineralogy of the twin samples can be assumed to be identical this assumption is used to eliminate the effect of changes in petrophysical properties and mineralogy of the twin samples on wettability evaluation tables a 1 and a 2 in appendix d list the mineralogy and petrophysical properties of the selected rock samples respectively adopted from lan et al 2015 dodecane and 2 wt of potassium chloride kcl solution were used as oleic and aqueous phases in their si tests respectively table a 3 lists the physical properties of these liquids at the experimental temperature of 25 fig 3 shows the profiles of water and oil spontaneous imbibition into a sample lmt4 from their study umt and lmt refer to samples taken from upper montney and lower montney formations respectively imbibition profiles of all the samples are presented in appendix d the profiles suggest that more parts of the pore network are hydrophobic since the volume of imbibed water is significantly lower than that of imbibed oil note that the water imbibition curve arrives at equilibrium faster than the oil curve solid and dashed arrows in fig 3 determine the equilibrium time of water and oil imbibition curves respectively this is the time at which no more fluid is imbibed into the rock samples for both fluids equilibrium occurs much earlier than the end of the imbibition test this observation is more pronounced for the water imbibition profile referring to lan et al s paper the average pore size of these samples is in the order of 0 1 microns lan et al 2015 therefore we can ignore the effect of gravity on the imbibition profiles this implies that the plateau section is not due to the balance between capillary and gravity forces this can be attributed to the completion of pore filling by the imbibing fluid note that filling of the pore network does not imply 100 saturation of imbibing fluid since there always exists entrapment of the non wetting phase in the pore network meng et al 2015 fluid redistribution is still possible in the pore network during the plateau section but it does not change the equilibrium imbibed volume chen et al 2021 therefore the onset of the plateau section of the si curve is the end of the fluid intake process by the capillary force and is referred to as teq eqs 12 or 13 can be used to calculate a when t teq 4 model application 4 1 predicted wettability indices using the proposed technique here we first apply eq 13 to the imbibition profiles shown in fig a 1 and a 2 to calculate a of the system during each imbibition process then we calculate the wettability index of oil using eq 12 table 1 summarizes the calculated a volume normalized a and wio using the proposed technique for all the rock samples the last column lists the calculated wettability indices using the volume based technique lan et al 2015 according to table 1 the predicted wio values using the proposed technique range from 54 to 96 representing intermediate to strongly hydrophobic systems in general the wettability indices increase with depth showing that the lmt samples are more hydrophobic than the umt samples except for umt4 and umt5 the predicted wio values using the proposed technique are higher than the values estimated based on the volume based method the minimum difference is related to umt4 with 6 33 and the maximum difference corresponds to umt3 with 20 07 in the next sections we investigate the correlations of wettability indices with the mineralogy and petrophysical properties of the rock samples to verify the proposed technique 4 2 correlation between wettability index of oil and petrophysical properties here we analyze the correlations of predicted wio by the proposed technique with rock properties including porosity total organic carbon content toc bulk volume water bvw asquith 1985 and total clay concentration table 2 lists the observed correlations categorized as positive or negative showing ascending or descending trends respectively the last two columns report the calculated r2 values for the observed trends using the proposed and volume based techniques the graphical representation of the studied correlations can be found in appendix e table 2 shows that both the proposed and volume based techniques generate similar types of correlations positive or negative for all the studied parameters however the calculated r2 values for all the correlations are higher using the proposed technique compared with those using the volume based technique indicating the higher accuracy of the proposed technique the highest difference is observed for the correlation with total clay concentration detailed explanation of the observed trends is presented in appendix f based on table 2 the volume based technique of wettability evaluation underestimates the degree of hydrophobicity of these rock samples this observation is consistent with faster imbibition of oil compared with water which is captured by the proposed energy based method 5 limitations although the proposed model shows reasonable results for the cases studied above there are limitations that can be addressed in future studies 1 we consider the capillary force as the only driving force for fluid uptake the model can be modified for the cases where other effects such as gravity and osmosis are significant 2 the rock samples used in this study have non swelling clay minerals lan et al 2015 when swelling minerals such as smectite exist in the rock part of the water intake will be due to clay swelling which is not considered in the proposed mathematical model in this case disjoining pressure must be considered in the young laplace equation kim 2012 3 we assumed that rock properties such as porosity and permeability are constant during the imbibition however phenomena such as clay swelling and the reaction of rock minerals with fluids might alter these properties aksu et al 2015 4 in the nano scale pore network of tight rocks the fluid properties such as viscosity may change due to nanoconfinement effect wang et al 2018 however we assumed that fluid properties are constant during the tests in the present model 5 in real porous media such as rocks the flow channels are tortuous in this case the lucas washburn t 1 2 scaling changes to t 1 2 d t scaling where dt is fractal dimension for tortuosity cai and yu 2011 however the effect of tortuosity is not considered in the present model 6 conclusions in this study we used hagen poiseuille and young laplace equations to develop a mathematical model to estimate the helmholtz free energy of the system during the spontaneous imbibition process the system includes a porous medium with its saturating fluids first we developed a modified form of the lucas washburn equation which models the dynamics of displacement of a viscous non wetting fluid by a viscous wetting fluid in a co current imbibition process we proposed a model that can estimate the changes in helmholtz free energy of the system using the profile of imbibed volume versus time the model is simplified for a case that a liquid is imbibed into a dry porous medium the model relates the helmholtz free energy of the system to the area under the curve and slope of the imbibition profile the model incorporates the system parameters including equilibrium imbibed volume equilibrium imbibition time and fluid and rock properties then we defined a wettability index based on volume normalized helmholtz free energy values the proposed wettability indices range from 0 to 1 showing very weak and very strong wetting preference of a rock surface toward a fluid respectively we applied the model on the data of spontaneous imbibition experiments conducted on eight twin rock samples we compared the wettability indices predicted by the proposed technique with those by the volume based technique we studied the correlations of the wettability indices predicted by both techniques with porosity total organic carbon content bulk volume water and total clay concentration of the rock samples the results showed similar trends using both techniques with more accurate correlations using the proposed technique the comparison between the two techniques demonstrated that the volume based
