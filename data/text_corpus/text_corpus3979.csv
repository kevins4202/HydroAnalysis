materials such as aquaporins kumar et al 2007 artificial water channels barboiu 2012 and graphene based materials nair et al 2012 have been successfully incorporated into synthetic membranes lim et al 2022 at the same time new fabrication methods and novel membrane structures endow tfc polyamide membranes with greatly enhanced separation performance fig 1 a in addition to the pursuit of high membrane selectivity many researchers focus on the development of ultra permeable nf upnf membranes wang et al 2022 yang et al 2021 nevertheless others are of the opinion that high water permeance plays a far less important role than selectivity shi et al 2017 werber et al 2016a although this concern is legitimate for membrane processes involving high transmembrane osmotic pressure difference δπ such as ro based seawater desalination cohen tanugi et al 2014 elimelech and phillip 2011 patel et al 2020 shi et al 2017 werber et al 2016a 2016b yang et al 2021 many nf applications involves relatively low δπ guo et al 2021 liu et al 2022 shao et al 2022 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 which leaves sufficient room for energy savings another common opinion is that in view of the membrane permeance selectivity tradeoff fig 1a and geise et al 2011 park et al 2017 robeson 1991 2008 werber et al 2016b yang et al 2019 2021 increasing membrane selectivity rather than water permeance is more important to enable process favorable applications lu and elimelech 2021 werber et al 2016a the ongoing debates inspire us to critically analyze the existing literature and examine the untapped opportunities associated with upnf herein we provide our perspectives on why upnf membranes are desired for water treatment we show the potential energy savings offered by upnf under various application scenarios we further explore new process possibilities enabled by upnf which could potentially lead to a paradigm shift in applying nf technology for water wastewater treatment opportunities for novel membrane development are also highlighted our perspective paper offers critical insights for the future development of nf based water treatment technology 2 why are upnf membranes needed for water applications 2 1 upnf reduces specific energy consumption sec for various applications researchers from different backgrounds often have different opinions on the value of high permeance membranes while some membrane makers believe that high water permanence can directly lead to major savings in sec a typical practitioner in seawater ro desalination would argue that only marginal reduction of sec can be achieved in reality the available savings in sec is strongly dependent on the transmembrane osmotic pressure difference δπ fig 1b unlike seawater ro desalination that deals with highly saline water total dissolved solids tds 32 000 ppm and δπ 25 bar many nf applications involve feedwaters with relatively low tds and thus low osmotic pressure values πfeed for example a typical municipal wastewater may have a tds of 500 1000 ppm which translates into a πfeed value of only 0 4 0 7 bar when treatment or reuse of municipal wastewater is considered the applicable πfeed value is even lower for typical surface water treatment and household tap water purification in fig 1b we analyze the benefit of upnf in terms of potential savings in sec yang et al 2020 using three different δπ values 0 1 bar typical surface water scenario 0 5 bar representative of typical municipal wastewater and ground water and 5 bar relevant to brackish water and some saline industrial wastewater since the water permeance of commercially available nf membranes is generally in the range of 8 14 lm 2h 1bar 1 fane et al 2011 a value of 10 lm 2h 1bar 1 is used for benchmarking purpose considering an upnf membrane with a water permeance of 50 lm 2h 1bar 1 a one third reduction in sec is achievable for δπ 0 5 bar the available reduction is as much as 63 5 for δπ 0 1 bar in contrast the energy saving is only 2 7 for δπ 5 bar largely due to the dominance of osmotic pressure over the transmembrane resistance it is worthwhile to note that even for highly saline feedwaters with high πfeed values many applications may not require the removal of tds instead specific contaminants or valuable resources are targeted such as the removal of fouling precursors in seawater pretreatment for desalination zhang et al 2022 and the recovery of previous metals from metal plating wastewater ricci et al 2015 for such cases nf membranes can be designed to allow selective passage of tds e g with low retention of monovalent ions which effectively reduces the transmembrane osmotic pressure difference toward greater energy savings our critical analysis reveals a huge potential of upnf membranes for achieving major savings in sec for a wide range of applications which should be further explored in future developments 2 2 upnf enables new process opportunities in addition to reduced sec upnf membranes may enable new module process opportunities constrained by their relatively low water permeance existing commercial nf membranes are generally used in side stream crossflow filtration systems with an applied hydraulic pressure typically in the range of 2 10 bar fane et al 2011 high membrane water permeance could potentially allow the use of nf membranes in submerged filtration system driven by a partial vacuum fig 1c for example using an upnf membrane with a water permeance of 50 100 lm 2h 1bar 1 the required vacuum suction could be as low as 0 1 0 2 bar for achieving a practically relevant water flux of 10 lm 2h 1 such a submerged upnf membrane system offers multiple benefits it allows easy retrofitting upgrading of existing drinking water treatment plants and or wastewater treatment plants the elimination of pressure vessels and reduced land requirement could potentially save 10 in capital cost major energy savings may be achievable with the use of much lower transmembrane pressure the possible use of hollow fiber upnf membranes in submerged systems further enables greater membrane packing density and easier system operation an interesting potential application of upnf membranes is membrane bioreactors for wastewater reclamation existing mbrs typically adopt porous microfiltration mf or uf membranes historically the adoption of submerged mf uf modules led to the wide spread applications of mbrs for wastewater treatment meng et al 2009 2017 tadkaew et al 2011 xiao et al 2019 yamamoto et al 1989 however due to the limited ability of mf uf membranes for removing dissolved solutes such as nutrients n and p metals and organic micropollutants a polishing step e g by ro is often required for reuse purpose tay et al 2018 one notable example is singapore s changi newater plant which recycles municipal wastewater into highly purified water through an mbr ro treatment train tang et al 2018 the adoption of upnf membranes could enable the development of a submerged nf mbr to achieve water reuse in a single treatment step with upnf membranes serving the dual roles of 1 separation of biomass and 2 removal of contaminants including dissolved ones fig 1c the high selectivity of nf membranes could greatly improve the effluent water quality for organic micropollutants the use of high retention membranes allows their longer residence in the bioreactor which may substantially improve their removal through the combined actions of membrane retention and biodegradation wang et al 2018 despite of these obvious benefits of nf mbrs nevertheless membrane fouling could pose a critical challenge le clech et al 2006 therefore future studies are needed to develop effective fouling control and cleaning strategies in nf mbrs wang et al 2014 a further untapped opportunity is the development of anaerobic nf mbrs for municipal wastewater treatment although it is difficult to apply conventional mbrs for the anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewaters with low organic strength the use of high retention membranes could concentrate soluble organics in the bioreactor to make it an attractive option through the production of ch4 or h2 anaerobic nf mbrs could potentially make wastewater treatment plants less energy intensive or even converting them into net energy producers in addition to energy recovery the ability to retain n and p may also allow the use of nf mbrs for nutrient recovery xie et al 2016 2 3 there is still huge room for developing upnf membranes with desired selectivity and antifouling performance despite their vast untapped opportunities upnf membranes need to possess suitable selectivity and antifouling properties that are required for practical applications indeed one prevailing argument is that membrane selectivity deserves priority over water permeance shi et al 2017 werber et al 2016a we are of the opinion that balanced combinations of selectivity and permeability are needed to suit different application requirements yang et al 2021 recent literature reports promising developments of high performance polyamide nf membranes shao et al 2022 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 one notable strategy is nf membranes with crumpled surfaces fig 1d which can simultaneously increase the effective membrane filtration area and optimize the water transport pathways shao et al 2022 as shown in fig 1a some crumpled nf membranes surpass the previously reported upper bound with respect to water permeance and water na2so4 selectivity interlayered thin film nanocomposite tfni membranes featuring an interlayer sandwiched between the polyamide and substrate layers to improve the membrane formation and water transport pathways also show promising combinations of permeance and selectivity dai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 recent studies also show that the use of more porous substrates or interlayer modified substrates could enhance membrane water permeance and antifouling performance at the same time long et al 2022 wu et al 2022 in the longer run the development of novel alternative desalination materials lim et al 2022 werber et al 2016b may provide greater rooms for simultaneously attainment of high water permeance high selectivity and excellent antifouling performance it is worthwhile to note that although fig 1a only presents the upper bound for water na2so4 based selectivity practical applications may often mandate different water solute selectivity and solute solute selectivity based on the specific treatment goals the future development of nf technology should specifically consider such application oriented selectivity requirements taking water reuse as an example the removal of harmful organic micropollutants is of critical importance to protect the public health while this critical aspect is often neglected in traditional membrane development some studies report the feasibility of simultaneous enhancement of pollutant removal and water permeance revealing the huge room for future membrane development and optimization guo et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yang et al 2020 3 conclusions the necessity of upnf membranes has been long debated in the literature we are of the opinion that upnf membranes are desired for water and wastewater treatment in terms of energy consumption upnf can offer an impressive sec savings of 63 5 at a transmembrane osmotic pressure difference of 0 1 bar nevertheless the available reduction in sec becomes marginal at δπ 5 bar due to the dominance of osmotic pressure over the transmembrane resistance upnf could be potentially applied in submerged membrane bioreactors nf mbr for wastewater treatment reuse compared to side stream crossflow configuration submerged vacuum driven upnf features lower energy consumption and easier retrofitting upgrading of water wastewater treatment plants the ability to retain soluble organics may further allow nf mbr for the anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater future development of upnf membranes needs to simultaneously cater for water permeance selectivity and antifouling properties to meet the requirements for practical applications application specific requirements for selectivity along with permeance should be considered in membrane development and optimization credit authorship contribution statement zhe yang

19896,the tet x4 gene is a clinically important tigecycline resistance gene and has shown high persistence in livestock related environments however the bacterial hosts of tet x4 remain unknown due to the lack of appropriate approaches herein a culture independent and high throughput epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction method was developed optimized and demonstrated for the identification of bacterial hosts carrying tet x4 from environmental samples considering the high sequence similarity between tet x4 and other tet x variant genes specific primers and amplification conditions were screened and optimized to identify tet x4 accurately and link tet x4 with the 16s rrna gene which were further validated using artificially constructed bacterial communities the epicpcr targeting tet x4 was applied for the identification of bacterial hosts carrying this resistance gene in anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure a total of 19 genera were identified as tet x4 hosts which were distributed in the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes and caldatribacteriota sixteen genera and two phyla that were identified have not been previously reported as tet x4 bacterial hosts the results indicated that a far more diverse range of bacteria was involved in harboring tet x4 than previously realized compared with the tet x4 hosts determined by correlation based network analysis and metagenomic binning epicpcr revealed a high diversity of tet x4 hosts even at the phylum level the epicpcr method developed in this study could be effectively employed to reveal the presence of tet x4 bacterial hosts from a holistic viewpoint graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes tet x variant genes livestock waste single cell technology data availability data will be made available on request the sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjna906023 and prjna907475 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a global health challenge from the one health perspective involving the transfer of bacteria and genes among humans animals and environments jin et al 2022 larsson and flach 2021 walsh 2018 the environment has played an increasing role in the spread of antibiotic resistance bondarczuk et al 2016 finley et al 2013 environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args may promote the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance among clinically relevant bacteria berendonk et al 2015 zhang et al 2022b thus determining environmental bacterial hosts of emerging and clinically important args is conducive to broadening the scope of arg hosts tracking arg transmission in the environment exploring the potential environmental origin of clinically relevant args and assessing the risk to human health berendonk et al 2015 larsson and flach 2021 culture based methods have been considered the gold standard for identifying the hosts of a given antibiotic resistance gene rice et al 2020 while very effective in clinical settings the culture based method with a low detection throughput faces big challenges in identifying arg hosts in the environment because most environmental bacteria are yet unculturable amann et al 1995 stewart 2012 tanaka et al 2014 zhang et al 2022c several culture independent methods including correlation analysis metagenomics fluorescence activated cell sorting facs and genomic crosslinking have been tried to explore arg hosts from various environmental samples rice et al 2020 while the use of these approaches has enhanced our understanding regarding environmental arg hosts it is difficult to detect hosts for a specific clinically important arg in a complex community recently a promising epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction method was developed which could link functional genes such as the dissimilatory sulfate reductase gene dsrb with 16s rrna gene in massively single cells encapsulated in hydrogel beads qin et al 2019 spencer et al 2016 wei et al 2022 hosts of common args such as tet m and sul1 could be also identified in environmental communities with the advantages of being culture independent and high throughput hultman et al 2018 wei et al 2021 however some clinically relevant args exhibit different variants which share high sequence similarity but represent greatly different health risk more design optimization and validation were required for epicpcr to target one of the clinically crucial arg variants tigecycline is a last resort tetracycline antibiotic used to treat severe infections caused by extensively drug resistant bacteria brust et al 2014 tasina et al 2011 however the recent emergence and spread of the tigecycline resistance genes tet x3 tet x4 tet x5 tet x6 and other tet x variant genes have compromised its clinical efficacy by enzymatic degradation he et al 2019 liu et al 2020 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 among various tet x variant genes tet x4 has received the most attention because of the following features i being commonly located on mobile plasmids such as incq1 and incx1 with high conjugation efficiency suggesting an increasing risk of tet x4 transmission ii being carried by the insertion sequence iscr2 for horizontal transfer by rolling cycle transposition iii conferring higher level antibiotic resistance to tigecycline than other tet gene iv being detected widely in humans animals and showing better persistence than other tet x variants in livestock related environments cui et al 2021 dai et al 2022 he et al 2021a liu et al 2022 mohsin et al 2021 wang et al 2022 so far acinetobacter spp and escherichia coli e coli have been reported as the main hosts of the tet x4 gene in clinical settings and animals sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a given the fact that the tet x4 gene is widely distributed and increasingly detected in different environments dai et al 2022 kurekci et al 2022 it is easy to assume that there should be a diverse range of tet x4 hosts in different environments it would be very helpful if most of the tet x4 hosts in these environments could be identified using the epicpcr approach however the challenge is how to establish an epicpcr specifically targeting tet x4 among various variants sharing high sequence similarity this study aimed to develop an epicpcr method for the identification of bacterial hosts of tet x4 from environmental microbiota firstly primer screening and amplification condition optimization were performed to ensure the specific detection of tet x4 among different tet x variants with high sequence similarity and fuse tet x4 with the 16s rrna gene subsequently validation of the accuracy of the epicpcr method was performed within artificially constructed bacterial communities furthermore as a demonstration of its utility epicpcr targeting tet x4 was applied for the identification of potential tet x4 hosts in anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts were revealed even from phyla that had not been reported previously this study provided a culture independent and high throughput approach for uncovering novel bacterial hosts with potential utilization in studies on the environmental transmission mechanism and engineering control strategies of tet x4 2 results and discussion 2 1 development of culture independent epicpcr for identifying tet x4 bacterial hosts 2 1 1 specific primer screening and amplification condition optimization to investigate bacterial hosts associated with the tet x4 gene we developed an approach adapting the tet x4 gene fig 1 a the principal strategy of epicpcr is to detect tet x4 gene hosts by encapsulating single cells and fusing tet x4 to a phylogenetic marker gene 16s rrna gene the final fused reads containing the tet x4 gene 154 bp and 16s rrna gene 250 bp were obtained from massive numbers of single cells which could allow phylogenetic identification of bacterial taxa fig s1 the bottlenecks of the tet x4 targeted epicpcr approach were distinguishing tet x4 from tet x and the other tet x variants and simultaneously linking tet x4 to the 16s rrna gene in encapsulated single cells therefore screening of specific primers and optimization of pcr amplification conditions were performed fig 1b prior to performing epicpcr we collected primer sets for tet x4 detection reported in the literature and combined them to create four primer groups group a b c d for epicpcr table s1 because fusion pcr must amplify tet x4 and the 16s rrna gene by the same thermal cycle program and simultaneously link them primer groups were considered if they were shown to successfully produce only the fusion products of tet x4 and the 16s rrna gene group c d the specificity of primers used to amplify the tet x4 side in fusion pcr was verified further by performing pcr on the genomic dna of bacteria carrying tet x tet x3 tet x4 tet x5 and tet x6 respectively resulting in the detection of a single and expected 217 bp band belonging to tet x4 carrying bacteria in agarose gel electrophoresis fig s2 the selection of primers for nested pcr relies on the fusion pcr product sequence region and only primers that specifically intercept the target fragments on the fusion pcr product sequences and efficiently amplify them could be used group d considering that the annealing temperature and the concentration ratio of the forward primer and bridge primer are key conditions to accomplish the linking of tet x4 to the 16s rrna gene within the pcr reaction the annealing temperatures of fusion pcr and nested pcr were optimized by temperature gradient amplification experiments obtaining the optimum annealing temperatures which were 56 c in all cases the optimum ratio of forward primer tet x4 f1 and bridge primer tet x4 16s rrna were determined by setting different gradient concentration ratios and 50 1 200 1 was the optimal range at the optimal amplification conditions the group d primers performed best in linking tet x4 to the 16s rrna gene fig 1b 2 1 2 validation of epicpcr targeting tet x4 in artificial microbial communities to validate the accuracy of epicpcr for tet x4 bacterial host identification we applied it to four artificial microbial communities containing tet x4 positive bacteria and tet x4 negative bacteria i tet x4 positive e coli ⅱ tet x4 positive e coli and tet x4 positive acinetobacter johnsonii a johnsonii ⅲ tet x4 positive e coli tet x4 positive a johnsonii and tet x4 negative enterococcus faecalis e faecalis ⅳ tet x4 positive e coli tet x4 positive a johnsonii tet x4 negative e faecalis and tet x4 negative proteus vulgaris fig 1c after completion of preprocessing for tet x4 16s rrna fusion sequences the 16s rrna gene fragments stemming from fusion sequences were clustered to the same operational taxonomic units otus otu identification is a critical procedure to avoid the risk of missing effective results or causing false positives resulting from sequencing errors and operational errors of the epicpcr technique it has been reported that epicpcr results obtained for two or three biological replicates give a similar and even better confidence level in otu identification roman et al 2021 in the present study only otus detected in all biological triplicates were reserved for subsequent analysis the epicpcr results of artificial microbial communities showed that only e coli and a johnsonii were tet x4 hosts in three mixed systems ⅱ ⅲ ⅳ which is consistent with the tet x4 positive bacteria spiked in the mixture highlighting the high resolution and accuracy of epicpcr targeting tet x4 collectively the epicpcr targeting tet x4 gene was developed optimized and validated the method exhibited high specificity for accurately distinguishing the tet x4 bacterial hosts from tet x and other variant genes hosts although a few studies used epicpcr to identify the hosts of common args such as tet m and sul1 hultman et al 2018 wei et al 2021 they focused on covering as many of the target arg hosts as possible as a trade off for the distinction of the importance rank among target arg variants 2 2 application of epicpcr targeting tet x4 in anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure 2 2 1 diversity of tet x4 bacterial hosts in anaerobic digestion systems to further demonstrate the utility of the epicpcr targeting tet x4 it was applied to identify tet x4 hosts in a set of environmental samples previous studies reported that tet x4 was prevalent in animal manure with high abundance dai et al 2022 fu et al 2021 anaerobic digestion is a widely used treatment for animal manure and is effective for diminishing args in animal manure zahedi et al 2022 three anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure including a mesophilic system thermophilic mesophilic system and hyperthermophilic mesophilic system were operated at 37 c 55 c 37 c 70 c 37 c respectively with their effluents labeled as ef 37 c ef 55 c 37 c and ef 70 c 37 c fig 2 a we assessed the absolute and relative abundance of mobile tet x variant genes i e tet x3 tet x4 tet x5 and tet x6 by qpcr in influent and effluent samples of the anaerobic digestion systems the results showed that the absolute abundance and relative abundance of mobile tet x variant genes in three anaerobic digestion effluents exhibited significant reduction compared with those in influent fig 2b s2 however the tet x4 gene abundance was maintained at relatively stable levels among the influent and effluents even in hyperthermophilic mesophilic anaerobic digestion systems fig 2c showing the high persistence of tet x4 in anaerobic digestion treatments there were abundant tet x4 bacterial hosts determined by epicpcr in 12 samples from anaerobic digestion systems the identified tet x4 bacterial hosts belonged to 19 genera 14 families and four phyla including proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes and caldatribacteriota table 1 while the latter two phyla have not previously been identified as tet x4 hosts among these 19 genera acinetobacter chen et al 2020 cui et al 2020 wang et al 2020a escherichia shigella cui et al 2021 he et al 2020 and flavobacterium zhang et al 2020b have been reported to carry tet x4 based on a culture based method suggesting the consistency of hosts detected by epicpcr the other 16 genera have not been reported as hosts of tet x4 suggesting a tremendous underestimation of the extent of tet x4 host diversity by routine culture methods the more holistic and diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts revealed by the epicpcr could provide an explanation for the wide distribution of tet x4 in various media involving in animal human and environment in some extent of note the tet x4 gene was reported to be carried by various conjugation plasmids in the acinetobacter spp and e coli he et al 2019 sun et al 2019 and tet x4 usually flanked by iscr2 which conferring the horizontal transfer of tet x4 by rolling cycle transposition liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a these characteristics will further promote the spread of tet x4 genes among distinct bacterial hosts 2 2 2 characteristics of tet x4 bacterial hosts in anaerobic digestion systems at different temperatures the α diversity of the tet x4 host community in both influent and effluent samples at different temperatures was assessed using the shannon index and richness fig 3 a s5 the tet x4 hosts community in ef 37 c showed the highest α diversity the values of shannon index and richness decreased significantly in ef 37 c ef 55 c 37 c ef 70 c 37 c in turn kruskal wallis test p 0 05 previous study noted that decreasing in diversity of arg bacterial hosts might help to the reduction in resistance transmission risk in some extent tran et al 2021 compared with ef 37 c and ef 55 c 37 c the lowest α diversity of tet x4 host community in ef 70 c 37 c suggested that the hyperthermophilic anaerobic digestion could be an alternative technology in controlling the spread of resistance conferred by tet x4 the composition and abundance of tet x4 bacterial hosts showed that firmicutes and bacteroidota were among the dominant phyla existing in all effluents but not were predominant in influent fig 3b the dominant tet x4 host in influent was proteobacteria at the phylum level with psychrobacter accounting for 86 56 at the genus level the tet x4 hosting bacteria of ef 37 c were distributed in proteobacteria 7 20 bacteroidota 42 56 firmicutes 38 48 and caldatribacteriota 11 76 at the phylum level with the genera fermentimonas 31 31 and caldicoprobacter 27 51 predominating fig 3c acinetobacter belonging to proteobacteria was the main tet x4 host in ef 55 c 37 c it was also reported as one of the major tet x4 hosts in animals and human clinics he et al 2019 li et al 2022a implying the potential dissemination of tet x4 gene among humans animals and environments the tet x4 hosts in ef 70 c 37 c were mainly distributed in moheibacter bacteroidota and caldicoprobacter firmicutes our result showed that different genera were identified as specifically abundant in effluents at different temperatures suggesting that the preferred bacterial hosts of tet x4 could adaptively alter in response to environmental conditions in addition 11 genera such as fermentimonas aequorivita membranicola ruminiclostridium and fastidiosipila presented in anaerobic digestion effluents but not detected in the influent by epicpcr implying the possible occurrence of horizontal transfer of tet x4 during anaerobic treatment especially in ef 37 c the higher diverse bacterial hosts provided the prerequisite for tet x4 horizontal transfer some tet x4 bacterial hosts determined by epicpcr in the three effluents also performed functions related to anaerobic digestion fig 3c the genera fermentimonas ruminiclostridium defluviitalea and fastidiosipila are important hydrolytic bacteria or acetogens jiang et al 2022 kang et al 2021 the anaerobic and mesophilic genus syntrophomonas not only takes part in long chain fatty acid degradation but also forms a syntrophic metabolism with methanogens to promote methane production shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a notably as the main tet x4 host in ef 37 c ef 55 c 37 c and ef 70 c 37 c the genus caldicoprobacter belonging to firmicutes is anaerobic gram positive and extremely thermophilic it plays an important role in the hydrolysis process and can degrade protein hemicellulose and lipids lei et al 2019 wang et al 2020b anaerobic digestion a microbial mediated biotechnology relies on myriads of functions performed by complex microbial communities aziz et al 2022 zahedi et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 some tet x4 bacterial hosts were assigned to the functional niches of hydrolysis acidogenesis hydrogenesis suggesting that the tet x4 bacterial hosts could adapt to the conditions of anaerobic digestion at different temperatures 2 2 3 comparison with correlation based network analysis and metagenomic binning approaches epicpcr revealed more diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts compared to network analysis and metagenomic binning network analysis based on spearman correlations between tet x family genes and bacterial genera p 0 05 and r 0 70 was performed and only seven potential tet x4 host bacteria genus level were obtained fig s3 among them the genera acinetobacter psychrobacter flavobacterium and ignatzschineria were found by the epicpcr approach table 1 the rationale behind network analysis is that similar abundance trends between microbial taxa and specific args might indicate possible arg hosts but the statistics based method lacks enough confidence layeghifard et al 2017 although the metagenomic binning approach has been powerful in characterizing the diversity of environmental args and their hosts rice et al 2020 no tet x4 hosts were captured the possible reason is that the tet x4 gene which is present on hybrid plasmids may not bin with taxonomic marker genes li et al 2020 thus being impossible to assign to a specific host it was clear that more diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts were revealed by epicpcr in this study the epicpcr method could provide host information regardless of whether tet x4 is located on a chromosome or plasmid however it could not provide the whole genome and it was difficult to discern the genetic context of tet x4 therefore it is a desirable strategy to combine multiple methods to obtain complete tet x4 host information the epicpcr can be used to screen the bacterial hosts of tet x4 in the complex environmental community firstly and then a selective isolation of epicpcr informed candidate hosts of interest can be conducted the development of an epicpcr directed cultivation approach will greatly improve the efficiency of tet x4 host bacteria isolation 2 3 significance and implications as a newly developed single cell based technology the epicpcr method targeting tet x4 developed in the present study highlighted the ability to accurately distinguish the hosts of clinically important tet x4 from tet x and other tet x variants thus reflecting the crucial antibiotic resistance risk in the environment this promising approach allowed for parallel analysis of massive amounts of tet x4 bacterial hosts in a single cell experiment by combining the method with high throughput sequencing which could capture the unseen majority of non culturable bacteria suggesting the potential to reveal previously unknown tet x4 hosts taking the anaerobic digestion system treating swine manure as an example we revealed more diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts by epicpcr the discovery of new hosts even at the phylum level indicated that a far more diverse range of bacteria was involved in harboring tet x4 than previously realized although bacterial hosts in the environment have previously been studied using the culture based methods li et al 2022b marathe et al 2021 such limited information could not match with the fact that tet x4 was widely distributed in the environment with a high abundance dai et al 2022 in this study epicpcr uncovered the diverse environmental hosts of tet x4 providing a possible explanation for the wide spread of tet x4 the epicpcr revealed host range could also provide vital clues for the isolation of tet x4 carrying bacteria a recent study developed a targeted cultivation approach by repurposing epicpcr to resolve in situ cpr host episymbiotic associations xie et al 2022 their result substantiated that the epicpcr directed cultivation approach will help to narrow down candidate hosts in complex samples and reduce the uncertainty and labor required during isolation compared with the traditional cultivation process the combination of epicpcr and the culture based method will be a novel research paradigm for studying arg hosts this epicpcr targeting tet x4 can be applied to various environmental media to identify the dominant hosts across different environments it has been recognized that the environment is the potential source reservoir and transmission route of antimicrobial resistance bengtsson palme et al 2021 the tet x4 gene hosted by environmental bacteria could be shared between diverse populations of environmental bacteria and pathogens thus leading to direct and immediate health implications for both humans and animals this method could also be extended to clinical settings and animal guts to find more hosts of tet x4 which will provide the basis for human health risk assessment in the one health framework furthermore the epicpcr method will be potentially considered to uncover the bacterial hosts of the other clinically important args such as ctx m type extended spectrum lactamase gene bla ctx m and the abc transporter gene optra which were of high prevalence and high persistence in anaerobic digestion systems in the future tian et al 2022 yang et al 2020 3 conclusions this study developed an epicpcr method for identifying tet x4 bacterial hosts in the environment this method precisely distinguished the tet x4 hosts from the other tet x variant genes hosts through primer specificity validation and amplification condition optimization the results for an artificial bacterial community showed that the epicpcr targeting tet x4 was highly accurate and specific the method was further applied to three anaerobic digestion systems at different temperatures in total 19 genera were identified as tet x4 bacterial hosts by epicpcr in anaerobic digestion systems belonging to 14 families and four phyla the phyla of firmicutes and caldatribacteriota were previously unknown to possess hosts for tet x4 the results substantiated that the culture independent epicpcr method was an effective approach to uncover the diversity of tet x4 hosts from environmental microbiota the epicpcr method will aid in exploring environmental transmission mechanisms optimizing engineering control strategies and assessing the health risk of tet x4 under the one health framework 4 materials and methods 4 1 sample collection and characterization three lab scale anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure were operated in parallel a single

19896,the tet x4 gene is a clinically important tigecycline resistance gene and has shown high persistence in livestock related environments however the bacterial hosts of tet x4 remain unknown due to the lack of appropriate approaches herein a culture independent and high throughput epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction method was developed optimized and demonstrated for the identification of bacterial hosts carrying tet x4 from environmental samples considering the high sequence similarity between tet x4 and other tet x variant genes specific primers and amplification conditions were screened and optimized to identify tet x4 accurately and link tet x4 with the 16s rrna gene which were further validated using artificially constructed bacterial communities the epicpcr targeting tet x4 was applied for the identification of bacterial hosts carrying this resistance gene in anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure a total of 19 genera were identified as tet x4 hosts which were distributed in the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes and caldatribacteriota sixteen genera and two phyla that were identified have not been previously reported as tet x4 bacterial hosts the results indicated that a far more diverse range of bacteria was involved in harboring tet x4 than previously realized compared with the tet x4 hosts determined by correlation based network analysis and metagenomic binning epicpcr revealed a high diversity of tet x4 hosts even at the phylum level the epicpcr method developed in this study could be effectively employed to reveal the presence of tet x4 bacterial hosts from a holistic viewpoint graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes tet x variant genes livestock waste single cell technology data availability data will be made available on request the sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjna906023 and prjna907475 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a global health challenge from the one health perspective involving the transfer of bacteria and genes among humans animals and environments jin et al 2022 larsson and flach 2021 walsh 2018 the environment has played an increasing role in the spread of antibiotic resistance bondarczuk et al 2016 finley et al 2013 environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args may promote the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance among clinically relevant bacteria berendonk et al 2015 zhang et al 2022b thus determining environmental bacterial hosts of emerging and clinically important args is conducive to broadening the scope of arg hosts tracking arg transmission in the environment exploring the potential environmental origin of clinically relevant args and assessing the risk to human health berendonk et al 2015 larsson and flach 2021 culture based methods have been considered the gold standard for identifying the hosts of a given antibiotic resistance gene rice et al 2020 while very effective in clinical settings the culture based method with a low detection throughput faces big challenges in identifying arg hosts in the environment because most environmental bacteria are yet unculturable amann et al 1995 stewart 2012 tanaka et al 2014 zhang et al 2022c several culture independent methods including correlation analysis metagenomics fluorescence activated cell sorting facs and genomic crosslinking have been tried to explore arg hosts from various environmental samples rice et al 2020 while the use of these approaches has enhanced our understanding regarding environmental arg hosts it is difficult to detect hosts for a specific clinically important arg in a complex community recently a promising epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction method was developed which could link functional genes such as the dissimilatory sulfate reductase gene dsrb with 16s rrna gene in massively single cells encapsulated in hydrogel beads qin et al 2019 spencer et al 2016 wei et al 2022 hosts of common args such as tet m and sul1 could be also identified in environmental communities with the advantages of being culture independent and high throughput hultman et al 2018 wei et al 2021 however some clinically relevant args exhibit different variants which share high sequence similarity but represent greatly different health risk more design optimization and validation were required for epicpcr to target one of the clinically crucial arg variants tigecycline is a last resort tetracycline antibiotic used to treat severe infections caused by extensively drug resistant bacteria brust et al 2014 tasina et al 2011 however the recent emergence and spread of the tigecycline resistance genes tet x3 tet x4 tet x5 tet x6 and other tet x variant genes have compromised its clinical efficacy by enzymatic degradation he et al 2019 liu et al 2020 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 among various tet x variant genes tet x4 has received the most attention because of the following features i being commonly located on mobile plasmids such as incq1 and incx1 with high conjugation efficiency suggesting an increasing risk of tet x4 transmission ii being carried by the insertion sequence iscr2 for horizontal transfer by rolling cycle transposition iii conferring higher level antibiotic resistance to tigecycline than other tet gene iv being detected widely in humans animals and showing better persistence than other tet x variants in livestock related environments cui et al 2021 dai et al 2022 he et al 2021a liu et al 2022 mohsin et al 2021 wang et al 2022 so far acinetobacter spp and escherichia coli e coli have been reported as the main hosts of the tet x4 gene in clinical settings and animals sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a given the fact that the tet x4 gene is widely distributed and increasingly detected in different environments dai et al 2022 kurekci et al 2022 it is easy to assume that there should be a diverse range of tet x4 hosts in different environments it would be very helpful if most of the tet x4 hosts in these environments could be identified using the epicpcr approach however the challenge is how to establish an epicpcr specifically targeting tet x4 among various variants sharing high sequence similarity this study aimed to develop an epicpcr method for the identification of bacterial hosts of tet x4 from environmental microbiota firstly primer screening and amplification condition optimization were performed to ensure the specific detection of tet x4 among different tet x variants with high sequence similarity and fuse tet x4 with the 16s rrna gene subsequently validation of the accuracy of the epicpcr method was performed within artificially constructed bacterial communities furthermore as a demonstration of its utility epicpcr targeting tet x4 was applied for the identification of potential tet x4 hosts in anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts were revealed even from phyla that had not been reported previously this study provided a culture independent and high throughput approach for uncovering novel bacterial hosts with potential utilization in studies on the environmental transmission mechanism and engineering control strategies of tet x4 2 results and discussion 2 1 development of culture independent epicpcr for identifying tet x4 bacterial hosts 2 1 1 specific primer screening and amplification condition optimization to investigate bacterial hosts associated with the tet x4 gene we developed an approach adapting the tet x4 gene fig 1 a the principal strategy of epicpcr is to detect tet x4 gene hosts by encapsulating single cells and fusing tet x4 to a phylogenetic marker gene 16s rrna gene the final fused reads containing the tet x4 gene 154 bp and 16s rrna gene 250 bp were obtained from massive numbers of single cells which could allow phylogenetic identification of bacterial taxa fig s1 the bottlenecks of the tet x4 targeted epicpcr approach were distinguishing tet x4 from tet x and the other tet x variants and simultaneously linking tet x4 to the 16s rrna gene in encapsulated single cells therefore screening of specific primers and optimization of pcr amplification conditions were performed fig 1b prior to performing epicpcr we collected primer sets for tet x4 detection reported in the literature and combined them to create four primer groups group a b c d for epicpcr table s1 because fusion pcr must amplify tet x4 and the 16s rrna gene by the same thermal cycle program and simultaneously link them primer groups were considered if they were shown to successfully produce only the fusion products of tet x4 and the 16s rrna gene group c d the specificity of primers used to amplify the tet x4 side in fusion pcr was verified further by performing pcr on the genomic dna of bacteria carrying tet x tet x3 tet x4 tet x5 and tet x6 respectively resulting in the detection of a single and expected 217 bp band belonging to tet x4 carrying bacteria in agarose gel electrophoresis fig s2 the selection of primers for nested pcr relies on the fusion pcr product sequence region and only primers that specifically intercept the target fragments on the fusion pcr product sequences and efficiently amplify them could be used group d considering that the annealing temperature and the concentration ratio of the forward primer and bridge primer are key conditions to accomplish the linking of tet x4 to the 16s rrna gene within the pcr reaction the annealing temperatures of fusion pcr and nested pcr were optimized by temperature gradient amplification experiments obtaining the optimum annealing temperatures which were 56 c in all cases the optimum ratio of forward primer tet x4 f1 and bridge primer tet x4 16s rrna were determined by setting different gradient concentration ratios and 50 1 200 1 was the optimal range at the optimal amplification conditions the group d primers performed best in linking tet x4 to the 16s rrna gene fig 1b 2 1 2 validation of epicpcr targeting tet x4 in artificial microbial communities to validate the accuracy of epicpcr for tet x4 bacterial host identification we applied it to four artificial microbial communities containing tet x4 positive bacteria and tet x4 negative bacteria i tet x4 positive e coli ⅱ tet x4 positive e coli and tet x4 positive acinetobacter johnsonii a johnsonii ⅲ tet x4 positive e coli tet x4 positive a johnsonii and tet x4 negative enterococcus faecalis e faecalis ⅳ tet x4 positive e coli tet x4 positive a johnsonii tet x4 negative e faecalis and tet x4 negative proteus vulgaris fig 1c after completion of preprocessing for tet x4 16s rrna fusion sequences the 16s rrna gene fragments stemming from fusion sequences were clustered to the same operational taxonomic units otus otu identification is a critical procedure to avoid the risk of missing effective results or causing false positives resulting from sequencing errors and operational errors of the epicpcr technique it has been reported that epicpcr results obtained for two or three biological replicates give a similar and even better confidence level in otu identification roman et al 2021 in the present study only otus detected in all biological triplicates were reserved for subsequent analysis the epicpcr results of artificial microbial communities showed that only e coli and a johnsonii were tet x4 hosts in three mixed systems ⅱ ⅲ ⅳ which is consistent with the tet x4 positive bacteria spiked in the mixture highlighting the high resolution and accuracy of epicpcr targeting tet x4 collectively the epicpcr targeting tet x4 gene was developed optimized and validated the method exhibited high specificity for accurately distinguishing the tet x4 bacterial hosts from tet x and other variant genes hosts although a few studies used epicpcr to identify the hosts of common args such as tet m and sul1 hultman et al 2018 wei et al 2021 they focused on covering as many of the target arg hosts as possible as a trade off for the distinction of the importance rank among target arg variants 2 2 application of epicpcr targeting tet x4 in anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure 2 2 1 diversity of tet x4 bacterial hosts in anaerobic digestion systems to further demonstrate the utility of the epicpcr targeting tet x4 it was applied to identify tet x4 hosts in a set of environmental samples previous studies reported that tet x4 was prevalent in animal manure with high abundance dai et al 2022 fu et al 2021 anaerobic digestion is a widely used treatment for animal manure and is effective for diminishing args in animal manure zahedi et al 2022 three anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure including a mesophilic system thermophilic mesophilic system and hyperthermophilic mesophilic system were operated at 37 c 55 c 37 c 70 c 37 c respectively with their effluents labeled as ef 37 c ef 55 c 37 c and ef 70 c 37 c fig 2 a we assessed the absolute and relative abundance of mobile tet x variant genes i e tet x3 tet x4 tet x5 and tet x6 by qpcr in influent and effluent samples of the anaerobic digestion systems the results showed that the absolute abundance and relative abundance of mobile tet x variant genes in three anaerobic digestion effluents exhibited significant reduction compared with those in influent fig 2b s2 however the tet x4 gene abundance was maintained at relatively stable levels among the influent and effluents even in hyperthermophilic mesophilic anaerobic digestion systems fig 2c showing the high persistence of tet x4 in anaerobic digestion treatments there were abundant tet x4 bacterial hosts determined by epicpcr in 12 samples from anaerobic digestion systems the identified tet x4 bacterial hosts belonged to 19 genera 14 families and four phyla including proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes and caldatribacteriota table 1 while the latter two phyla have not previously been identified as tet x4 hosts among these 19 genera acinetobacter chen et al 2020 cui et al 2020 wang et al 2020a escherichia shigella cui et al 2021 he et al 2020 and flavobacterium zhang et al 2020b have been reported to carry tet x4 based on a culture based method suggesting the consistency of hosts detected by epicpcr the other 16 genera have not been reported as hosts of tet x4 suggesting a tremendous underestimation of the extent of tet x4 host diversity by routine culture methods the more holistic and diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts revealed by the epicpcr could provide an explanation for the wide distribution of tet x4 in various media involving in animal human and environment in some extent of note the tet x4 gene was reported to be carried by various conjugation plasmids in the acinetobacter spp and e coli he et al 2019 sun et al 2019 and tet x4 usually flanked by iscr2 which conferring the horizontal transfer of tet x4 by rolling cycle transposition liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a these characteristics will further promote the spread of tet x4 genes among distinct bacterial hosts 2 2 2 characteristics of tet x4 bacterial hosts in anaerobic digestion systems at different temperatures the α diversity of the tet x4 host community in both influent and effluent samples at different temperatures was assessed using the shannon index and richness fig 3 a s5 the tet x4 hosts community in ef 37 c showed the highest α diversity the values of shannon index and richness decreased significantly in ef 37 c ef 55 c 37 c ef 70 c 37 c in turn kruskal wallis test p 0 05 previous study noted that decreasing in diversity of arg bacterial hosts might help to the reduction in resistance transmission risk in some extent tran et al 2021 compared with ef 37 c and ef 55 c 37 c the lowest α diversity of tet x4 host community in ef 70 c 37 c suggested that the hyperthermophilic anaerobic digestion could be an alternative technology in controlling the spread of resistance conferred by tet x4 the composition and abundance of tet x4 bacterial hosts showed that firmicutes and bacteroidota were among the dominant phyla existing in all effluents but not were predominant in influent fig 3b the dominant tet x4 host in influent was proteobacteria at the phylum level with psychrobacter accounting for 86 56 at the genus level the tet x4 hosting bacteria of ef 37 c were distributed in proteobacteria 7 20 bacteroidota 42 56 firmicutes 38 48 and caldatribacteriota 11 76 at the phylum level with the genera fermentimonas 31 31 and caldicoprobacter 27 51 predominating fig 3c acinetobacter belonging to proteobacteria was the main tet x4 host in ef 55 c 37 c it was also reported as one of the major tet x4 hosts in animals and human clinics he et al 2019 li et al 2022a implying the potential dissemination of tet x4 gene among humans animals and environments the tet x4 hosts in ef 70 c 37 c were mainly distributed in moheibacter bacteroidota and caldicoprobacter firmicutes our result showed that different genera were identified as specifically abundant in effluents at different temperatures suggesting that the preferred bacterial hosts of tet x4 could adaptively alter in response to environmental conditions in addition 11 genera such as fermentimonas aequorivita membranicola ruminiclostridium and fastidiosipila presented in anaerobic digestion effluents but not detected in the influent by epicpcr implying the possible occurrence of horizontal transfer of tet x4 during anaerobic treatment especially in ef 37 c the higher diverse bacterial hosts provided the prerequisite for tet x4 horizontal transfer some tet x4 bacterial hosts determined by epicpcr in the three effluents also performed functions related to anaerobic digestion fig 3c the genera fermentimonas ruminiclostridium defluviitalea and fastidiosipila are important hydrolytic bacteria or acetogens jiang et al 2022 kang et al 2021 the anaerobic and mesophilic genus syntrophomonas not only takes part in long chain fatty acid degradation but also forms a syntrophic metabolism with methanogens to promote methane production shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a notably as the main tet x4 host in ef 37 c ef 55 c 37 c and ef 70 c 37 c the genus caldicoprobacter belonging to firmicutes is anaerobic gram positive and extremely thermophilic it plays an important role in the hydrolysis process and can degrade protein hemicellulose and lipids lei et al 2019 wang et al 2020b anaerobic digestion a microbial mediated biotechnology relies on myriads of functions performed by complex microbial communities aziz et al 2022 zahedi et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 some tet x4 bacterial hosts were assigned to the functional niches of hydrolysis acidogenesis hydrogenesis suggesting that the tet x4 bacterial hosts could adapt to the conditions of anaerobic digestion at different temperatures 2 2 3 comparison with correlation based network analysis and metagenomic binning approaches epicpcr revealed more diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts compared to network analysis and metagenomic binning network analysis based on spearman correlations between tet x family genes and bacterial genera p 0 05 and r 0 70 was performed and only seven potential tet x4 host bacteria genus level were obtained fig s3 among them the genera acinetobacter psychrobacter flavobacterium and ignatzschineria were found by the epicpcr approach table 1 the rationale behind network analysis is that similar abundance trends between microbial taxa and specific args might indicate possible arg hosts but the statistics based method lacks enough confidence layeghifard et al 2017 although the metagenomic binning approach has been powerful in characterizing the diversity of environmental args and their hosts rice et al 2020 no tet x4 hosts were captured the possible reason is that the tet x4 gene which is present on hybrid plasmids may not bin with taxonomic marker genes li et al 2020 thus being impossible to assign to a specific host it was clear that more diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts were revealed by epicpcr in this study the epicpcr method could provide host information regardless of whether tet x4 is located on a chromosome or plasmid however it could not provide the whole genome and it was difficult to discern the genetic context of tet x4 therefore it is a desirable strategy to combine multiple methods to obtain complete tet x4 host information the epicpcr can be used to screen the bacterial hosts of tet x4 in the complex environmental community firstly and then a selective isolation of epicpcr informed candidate hosts of interest can be conducted the development of an epicpcr directed cultivation approach will greatly improve the efficiency of tet x4 host bacteria isolation 2 3 significance and implications as a newly developed single cell based technology the epicpcr method targeting tet x4 developed in the present study highlighted the ability to accurately distinguish the hosts of clinically important tet x4 from tet x and other tet x variants thus reflecting the crucial antibiotic resistance risk in the environment this promising approach allowed for parallel analysis of massive amounts of tet x4 bacterial hosts in a single cell experiment by combining the method with high throughput sequencing which could capture the unseen majority of non culturable bacteria suggesting the potential to reveal previously unknown tet x4 hosts taking the anaerobic digestion system treating swine manure as an example we revealed more diverse tet x4 bacterial hosts by epicpcr the discovery of new hosts even at the phylum level indicated that a far more diverse range of bacteria was involved in harboring tet x4 than previously realized although bacterial hosts in the environment have previously been studied using the culture based methods li et al 2022b marathe et al 2021 such limited information could not match with the fact that tet x4 was widely distributed in the environment with a high abundance dai et al 2022 in this study epicpcr uncovered the diverse environmental hosts of tet x4 providing a possible explanation for the wide spread of tet x4 the epicpcr revealed host range could also provide vital clues for the isolation of tet x4 carrying bacteria a recent study developed a targeted cultivation approach by repurposing epicpcr to resolve in situ cpr host episymbiotic associations xie et al 2022 their result substantiated that the epicpcr directed cultivation approach will help to narrow down candidate hosts in complex samples and reduce the uncertainty and labor required during isolation compared with the traditional cultivation process the combination of epicpcr and the culture based method will be a novel research paradigm for studying arg hosts this epicpcr targeting tet x4 can be applied to various environmental media to identify the dominant hosts across different environments it has been recognized that the environment is the potential source reservoir and transmission route of antimicrobial resistance bengtsson palme et al 2021 the tet x4 gene hosted by environmental bacteria could be shared between diverse populations of environmental bacteria and pathogens thus leading to direct and immediate health implications for both humans and animals this method could also be extended to clinical settings and animal guts to find more hosts of tet x4 which will provide the basis for human health risk assessment in the one health framework furthermore the epicpcr method will be potentially considered to uncover the bacterial hosts of the other clinically important args such as ctx m type extended spectrum lactamase gene bla ctx m and the abc transporter gene optra which were of high prevalence and high persistence in anaerobic digestion systems in the future tian et al 2022 yang et al 2020 3 conclusions this study developed an epicpcr method for identifying tet x4 bacterial hosts in the environment this method precisely distinguished the tet x4 hosts from the other tet x variant genes hosts through primer specificity validation and amplification condition optimization the results for an artificial bacterial community showed that the epicpcr targeting tet x4 was highly accurate and specific the method was further applied to three anaerobic digestion systems at different temperatures in total 19 genera were identified as tet x4 bacterial hosts by epicpcr in anaerobic digestion systems belonging to 14 families and four phyla the phyla of firmicutes and caldatribacteriota were previously unknown to possess hosts for tet x4 the results substantiated that the culture independent epicpcr method was an effective approach to uncover the diversity of tet x4 hosts from environmental microbiota the epicpcr method will aid in exploring environmental transmission mechanisms optimizing engineering control strategies and assessing the health risk of tet x4 under the one health framework 4 materials and methods 4 1 sample collection and characterization three lab scale anaerobic digestion systems treating swine manure were operated in parallel a single stage mesophilic system 37 c 1 c a two stage thermophilic mesophilic system including a thermophilic reactor at 55 c 1 c and a mesophilic reactor at 37 c 1 c and a two stage hyperthermophilic

19897,the proliferation of new psychoactive substances nps over recent years has made their surveillance complex the analysis of raw municipal influent wastewater can allow a broader insight into community consumption patterns of nps this study examines data from an international wastewater surveillance program that collected and analysed influent wastewater samples from up to 47 sites in 16 countries between 2019 and 2022 influent wastewater samples were collected over the new year period and analysed using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods over the three years a total of 18 nps were found in at least one site synthetic cathinones were the most found class followed by phenethylamines and designer benzodiazepines furthermore two ketamine analogues one plant based nps mitragynine and methiopropamine were also quantified across the three years this work demonstrates that nps are used across different continents and countries with the use of some more evident in particular regions for example mitragynine has highest mass loads in sites in the united states while eutylone and 3 methylmethcathinone increased considerably in new zealand and in several european countries respectively moreover 2f deschloroketamine an analogue of ketamine has emerged more recently and could be quantified in several sites including one in china where it is considered as one of the drugs of most concern finally some nps were detected in specific regions during the initial sampling campaigns and spread to additional sites by the third campaign hence wastewater surveillance can provide an insight into temporal and spatial trends of nps use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords illicit drugs public health monitoring 3 methylmethcathinone wastewater analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction new psychoactive substances nps are compounds that have been designed to mimic the effect of conventional illicit drugs while evading legal restrictions and are thus of international public health concern from fentanyl laced heroin jannetto et al 2019 to counterfeit xanax blakey et al 2022 and adulterated mdma krotulski et al 2021 highalert 2021 nps may pose a risk to illicit users the united nations office of drugs and crime unodc runs an early warning advisory ewa program on nps which is updated with information from international drug enforcement and intelligence agencies health authorities and toxicologists as of mid 2022 136 countries and territories covering all continents had reported more than 1100 nps to the ewa the consumption of nps is influenced by their specific effects availability price potential undetectability in routine drug tests and their use as adulterants peacock et al 2019 united nations office on drugs and crime 2022 it is imperative from a public health viewpoint to monitor the use of these drugs given our limited knowledge of their specific effects their interactions with other drugs and the harms that they cause it is difficult for law enforcement to control the circulation of these compounds because they are generally manufactured in much smaller quantities than traditional illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine and many have a grey legal status information on the prevalence of nps use is collected from forensic analyses surveys and pill testing as well as social media and dark web monitoring peacock et al 2019 pascoe et al 2022 barenholtz et al 2021 each of these serves as a complementary tool for identification monitoring surveillance control and ultimately evaluation of public health impacts of nps use each has its distinct advantages such as rapid identification of substances early warning capabilities and outlining demographics and profiles of users however not all jurisdictions have access to these data sources and thus some communities could be misinformed there is increased concern around music festivals where nps adulterated drugs can be mistakenly consumed this can increase the risk of overdoses resulting in more emergency department presentations wastewater analysis can help to fill this gap and has been used in many countries to assess licit and illicit drug use gracia lor et al 2017 the global prevalence of nps use remains unknown and data are limited to a few countries with appropriate resources unodc 2022 khaled et al 2016 the current work presents data from wastewater sampling across the new year period in three consecutive years 2019 20 2020 21 and 2021 22 the use of nps typically increases during festivals such as those of the new year period that are associated with parties and festivals the number of countries and sites has increased from 8 12 in the first iteration to 10 25 and finally to 16 47 throughout this project the number of targeted analytes changed to include the most relevant nps based on findings from the unodc ewa on nps international forensic findings and published scientific literature the aims of this work are i to study international spatial trends in nps use ii to examine if preferences for nps drugs change from year to year iii to evaluate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on nps use and iv to establish whether data on nps obtained from wastewater analysis is comparable to that from other data sources 2 results across the three years the number of countries and sites investigated increased from 8 12 to 10 25 and finally 16 47 across all three campaigns a total of 546 individual samples were analysed between 115 2019 20 and 287 2021 22 a total of 18 nps were found across the three sampling campaigns table 1 structures in table s1 with yearly totals from nine 2019 20 and 2021 22 to ten 2020 21 individual nps each year the number of analytes included in the analytical method has changed table s2 based on information from the unodc ewa forensic agencies peer reviewed publications and availability of reference analytical standards for example 3 methylmethcathinone 3 mmc mephedrone and methylone were analysed across all years while 2f deschloroketamine 2f dck mitragynine clonazolam and etizolam were only included in the third campaign 4 methylethcathinone 4 mec methylenedioxypyrovalerone mdpv methiopropamine methoxetamine and para methoxyamphetamine pma were not included in the 2021 22 campaign because there was limited identification in international forensic analyses and in the early warning systems of the unodc and emcdda a variety of classes of nps were found during this campaign synthetic cathinones were the most common table 1 phenethylamines 4 fluoroamphetamine and pma designer benzodiazepines clonazolam and etizolam ketamine analogues 2f dck and methoxetamine as well as the plant based nps mitragynine and methiopropamine were also quantified at least once across the three years 2 1 spatial trends over the three years of these data some spatial patterns emerged the synthetic cathinone 3 mmc was found consistently in all years primarily in europe fig 1 however in 2020 21 and 2021 22 it was found in at least one site in new zealand in the latter sampling period it was also found on selected days in the united states mephedrone and methylone were also found across the three campaigns they were primarily located in oceania and north america with highest levels in new zealand across the european sites they were only found in one site in spain in the 2021 22 collection table 1 like mephedrone eutylone was also primarily seen in sites in new zealand up to 55 mg day 1000 people in both 2020 21 and 2021 22 fig 2 a n ethylpentylone pentylone and ethylone had the lowest levels of synthetic cathinones found across the three sampling campaigns n ethylpentylone and pentylone had highest levels in the united states several compounds were only seen once 4 fluoroamphetamine 4 mec and mdpv in the netherlands methiopropamine and methoxetamine in australia and pma in new zealand table 1 some substances were only quantified in the most recent surveillance campaign in 2021 22 mitragynine fig 3 was found at the highest levels in the united states mostly between 1000 and 5000 mg day 1000 people sites in sweden had the next highest levels most other sites where the compound was found had levels below 50 mg day 1000 people there was generally no increase in levels over the new year in any site except for specific sites in slovenia and sweden n ethylhexedrone was only quantifiable in two sites in sweden and spain with particularly high levels in one site from sweden on new year s day the designer benzodiazepines clonazolam and etizolam were also found with highest loads at a site in iceland while levels in wastewater at other sites were below the limit of quantification of our method 2f dck was found in samples from nine sites across canada china spain france iceland italy and the united states fig 4 increases over new year s eve were evident in canada and spain table s4 while highest levels were seen across the entire sampling week in china it was only quantifiable on certain days in iceland italy and the united states 2 2 temporal trends for sites and compounds that were monitored over multiple years statistical tests were performed to determine significance 3 mmc was monitored across all three years and the measured excreted mass loads increased from 5 to 10 mg day 1000 people in the first two sampling campaigns to more than 100 mg day 1000 people in 2021 22 the highest levels were found in the 2021 22 sampling campaign at sites in spain and slovenia in sites monitored over multiple years there was also an increase i e belgium be spain es 1 new zealand nz 3 and italy it a statistically significant increase was seen in sites in belgium italy and spain between 2020 21 and 2021 22 p 0 05 there was also a statistically significant increase in the site in italy between 2019 20 and 2021 22 p 0 05 in the new zealand site where 3 mmc was found in both 2020 21 and 2021 22 there was also a statistically significant increase p 0 05 in most sites there was an increase in mass loads over new year s eve and new year s day eutylone was analysed over the two most recent campaigns the three sites in new zealand that were monitored over 2020 21 were also included in 2021 22 nz 2 and nz 3 showed similar trends for the different periods with statistically significant increases found p 0 05 while eutylone at nz 4 had no significant difference between the two sampling periods eutylone was also found at much lower levels in sites in australia north america brazil republic of korea and specific sites in europe fig 2 b these differences for both 3 mmc and eutylone from 2020 to 21 to 2021 22 could reflect the impact of covid 19 restrictions 3 discussion the societal burden attributable to illicit drug use is increasing for example in australia the societal burden due to illicit drug use increased by 35 from 2003 to 2018 and was responsible for 72 of all burden due to poisonings and almost all burden related to drug use disorders excluding alcohol australian institute of health and welfare 2021 however the burden specifically related to nps use is not easily quantified this wastewater based study provides a broader insight into nps use and establishes which nps are most used across sites in 16 countries and may potentially contribute to disease burden highest consumption was recorded for most nps around the new year period indicating that consumption increases at festivals and parties this may be due to higher consumption of regular consumers and or new users who consume nps intentionally or unintentionally it must be noted that in countries where lunar new year is celebrated i e china and the republic of korea the december january collection does not coincide with a specific holiday season nevertheless this allows this work to also show the use of nps in sites during a normal time of the year 3 1 impact of the covid 19 pandemic the novelty of this work is emphasised by comparing the sampling campaigns covering sites before the covid 19 pandemic 2019 20 when most severe covid 19 related restrictions were in place 2020 21 and when most restrictions had eased 2021 22 despite these three distinct periods and the impacts on the population there was little difference in the total number of nps detections in fact for a few compounds high levels were seen during the 2020 21 period such as eutylone in sites in new zealand increases between 2020 21 and 2021 22 were observed in two sites in new zealand while a third had no significant change these results are not unexpected as pill testing over both periods carried out in new zealand found that eutylone was the most commonly found cathinone knowyourstuffnz 2023 most compounds were at lower levels during the 2020 21 period particularly for 3 mmc in the european sites it is acknowledged that the restriction of movement as well as the cancellation of festivals and social gatherings likely resulted at these lower levels moreover the use of synthetic cathinones such as 3 mmc and eutylone is linked with that of mdma pascoe et al 2022 for example the increase in eutylone in the summer of 2020 21 was hypothesised to be due to a reduction of mdma in the country radio new zealand 2022 radio new zealand 2021 mdma was reported to have declined during 2020 in europe australia and canada which could have resulted in the increased levels of 3 mmc and or eutylone in this work bade et al 2021 been et al 2021 alygizakis et al 2021 statistics canada 2023 with the same time periods being monitored over the three years this study is able to provide a snapshot of nps consumption as such the primary difference between the 2020 21 collection and those before and after is the covid 19 pandemic we therefore hypothesise that this was the driving factor for the differences observed 3 2 spatial and temporal trends with samples collected at the same time every year it is possible to see spatial and temporal changes in consumption trends supporting information fig s1 many nps seemingly follow regional trends for example mitragynine has highest loads in sites in the united states while eutylone and mephedrone were most common in new zealand 3 mmc and n ethylhexedrone in europe and 2f dck in china some nps that were initially detected in specific regions spread to additional parts of the world in the third sampling campaign for instance 3 mmc was initially found in europe then spread to oceania in 2020 21 and north america in 2021 22 eutylone that was only detected in oceania and north america in the second campaign but was detected in europe in the last campaign 2021 22 this study has identified the potential origin of nps use around the world and could be used to monitor rapid changes in global consumers habits these results suggest that reducing nps use and protecting public health should not only be done at the national level it requires an organised global campaign they also show the global spread of nps in spite of current legislation there are blanket bans on any nps in countries such as china new zealand and australia while compound specific bans also exist internationally for example the convention on psychotropic substances 1971 from the united nations is a treaty designed to control psychoactive drugs the world health organisation who expert committee on drug dependence meets regularly to discuss the possible addition of new substances to the list of controlled drugs in recent years the nps eutylone n ethylhexedrone and n ethylpentylone have been added to the convention while 3 mmc is currently under review and mitragynine is under surveillance international narcotics control board 2021 world health organization 2021 world health organization 2022 3 2 1 synthetic cathinones the synthetic cathinones are stimulants that constitute the largest group of nps reported to the unodc ewa united nations office on drugs and crime 2021 and 3 mmc eutylone n ethylhexedrone and mephedrone were all found in this work 3 mmc is of particular concern in europe since it was first reported in 2012 in sweden it has gained in popularity particularly since 2020 european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 this is reflected in acute poisonings in the netherlands nugteren van lonkhuyzen et al 2022 while it was one of the most common nps seized in italy between may and october 2020 vincenti et al 2021 and was also the nps with the highest mass loads found in a recent national study conducted in italy salgueiro gonzález et al 2022 this european prevalence is reflected in fig 1 in the sites with multiple years of data an increase in measured mass loads is evident this increase in use has unfortunately resulted in at least 291 acute poisonings and 27 deaths in europe european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 in early 2022 after a risk assessment report of 3 mmc commissioned by the emcdda the european commission recommended control measures and member states were given six months to introduce national legislation european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 the who has also decided to include 3 mmc amongst nine nps for critical review by its expert committee on drug dependence because of its dependence producing properties and potential harms world health organization 2022 in this study the only sites outside of europe where 3 mmc was found were in new zealand and the united states albeit at much lower levels than in europe there is no current literature around the use of 3 mmc in the united states or new zealand but the new zealand drug information website high alert did release an article about 3 mmc in mid 2021 highalert 2021 in new zealand in late 2020 it was reported that there was also a decline in mdma which was maintained through 2021 new zealand police 2021 new zealand police 2022 with some of the sites in the new zealand locations incorporating music festivals it is possible that the 3 mmc measured may have been from the consumption of adulterated mdma this hypothesis is supported by a study from the united kingdom on drug use at festivals which found that as mdma detection decreased cathinone detections increased and 3 mmc represented more than 20 of all cathinones found pascoe et al 2022 mephedrone 4 methylmethcathinone is an isomer of 3 mmc and was one of the most popular nps in the early 2010s but has maintained its popularity despite legislation restrictions hutton 2020 in the three years of this work it has been found at relatively low levels particularly in new zealand and australia however in 2021 22 it was also found in a site in spain in this work eutylone had highest levels in new zealand in late 2020 the new zealand drug information website put out an alert for eutylone highalert 2021 over the 2020 21 summer festival season in new zealand testing of party drugs across the country found that up to 50 of samples thought to be of mdma contained eutylone this reduced to around 10 the following year radio new zealand 2022 however in fig 2 similar levels were obtained across both years while site nz 2 showed a statistically significant increase in 2021 22 in other sites where eutylone was monitored over 2020 21 and 2021 22 there was a decrease in sites in australia and canada while eutylone was found for the first time in samples from sites in italy belgium and the republic of korea according to seizure data the most common nps stimulants in europe were 3 mmc and n ethylhexedrone european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 so it is interesting that some eutylone was found in several european sites n ethylhexedrone was only found in a couple of european sites in spain belgium and sweden with quite high levels found in a site sweden 3 2 2 mitragynine mitragynine is the primary alkaloid derived from a plant kratom found in south east asia where it is traditionally used to combat fatigue and improve work productivity cinosi et al 2015 suwanlert 1975 in recent years it has become particularly popular in the united states as a legal high for its stimulant and or opioid like effects tobacyk et al 2022 the u s food and drug administration has repeatedly warned of the dangers of kratom including addiction abuse and dependence united states food and drug administration 2022 it is not currently federally regulated in the united states but some states have banned the substance while others have imposed age restrictions use of the compound is legal in all the sites analysed in this study in the united states but age restrictions may be in place to limit consumption by minors estimates of how many people use kratom in the united states vary but the national institute on drug abuse estimate that 0 6 i e 1 7 million people of the population aged 12 or older in 2021 reported using kratom in the past 12 months substance abuse and mental health services administration 2022 amongst the other sites in this project mitragynine was only legal in brazil belgium canada spain and greece the legal status of mitragynine was not necessarily reflected in the measured mass loads calculated in this work while sites in the united states had by far the highest levels of mitragynine the next highest were in sweden slovenia and australia where it is illegal 3 2 3 2f deschloroketamine 2f deschloroketamine 2f dck is an analogue of ketamine that has emerged over the past few years ketamine has been one of the drugs of most concern in china but major interventions have resulted in a large decline in registered ketamine users united nations office on drugs and crime 2020 in recent years ketamine analogues have emerged and become particularly prevalent in south east asia including china the highest levels of 2f dck were found in samples from one site in china and were similar to those previously reported shao et al 2021 li et al 2022 it was also evident that there was no weekend new year peak in use in the chinese site in contrast to other sites where 2f dck was found e g spain and canada it was also found infrequently in sites in the united states italy and iceland at relatively low levels according to the unodc ewa 2f dck is the second most prevalent dissociative behind ketamine in all reporting countries since 2020 united nations office on drugs and crime 2022 3 2 3 designer benzodiazepines etizolam and clonazolam are designer benzodiazepines a class associated with the greatest fatalities united nations office on drugs and crime 2021 and hence of greatest public health concern etizolam was found in eight countries in this work with most at or below our limit of quantification however a site in iceland had the highest mass loads clonazolam was only found in this same site in iceland according to the nordic health and welfare statistics iceland has the highest prescription sales rate of benzodiazepines of all nordic countries nordic health and welfare statistics 2022 both etizolam and clonazolam have been sold as counterfeit xanax blakey et al 2022 so it is possible that the high etizolam levels in iceland were due to illicit or unwitting use of xanax alprazolam 3 3 future perspectives the spe method used for this work has previously been validated for synthetic cathinones phenethylamines and opioids bade et al 2020 however recoveries for synthetic cannabinoids benzodiazepines and plant based nps range between 10 and 50 data not shown additionally studies have shown that acidified conditions are unsuitable for the optimal quantification of cannabinoids and benzodiazepines bade et al 2021 pandopulos et al 2020 while internal standards were included in this work to help cater for losses during extraction it is possible that the limited detection frequency of the designer benzodiazepines and synthetic cannabinoids could be due to their instability in acidic conditions to make a single method suitable for such a wide range of classes is challenging but several methods have been developed to detect multiple classes of nps in wastewater bade et al 2020 o rourke and subedi 2020 as the variety and number of nps continue to rise it is important to continue developing new methods suitable to cover a wide number of classes in a single extraction the results of this study highlighted the need for a global campaign as the issue of nps use affects all countries to a different level and degree therefore organisations such as the unodc and the emcdda could adopt a similar wastewater analysis approach as a surveillance tool for nps since it allows the assessment of larger populations while minimising costs provides data in an objective way reducing the impact of self reported data and presents no ethical implications as the samples are anonymous annual and targeted e g new year period music festivals and other special events campaigns could act as a warning system for the prevalence of nps 4 conclusion monitoring and surveillance of nps internationally is an ongoing and complex problem this wastewater based study provides an insight into the nps market internationally over the past three years including before during and after the covid 19 pandemic the use of nps was mainly lower during the pandemic with a few exceptions such as eutylone in specific sites higher nps consumption around the world was found during the new year holiday period and there were specific regional trends in which nps was detected for example mitragynine had highest loads in sites in the united states eutylone and mephedrone in new zealand 3 mmc and n ethylhexedrone in europe and 2f dck in china these data indicate the promise of more systematic wastewater analyses to identify and monitor trends in the use of specific nps in different populations and identify temporal and spatial patterns in their global spread of use 5 materials and methods 5 1 compounds a total of 52 compounds were analysed across the three years of this project with between 26 and 34 analysed each year table s2 5 2 sampling campaigns all information related to the wastewater collection and sites collection dates flow rates and population can be found in the supplemental files table s3 as part of an ongoing global surveillance program the number of countries and sites has increased from 8 12 in the first iteration to 10 25 and finally 16 47 data pertaining to the first two campaigns have been previously published 2019 20 bade et al 2021 and 2020 21 bade et al 2022 the population covered has increased from five to more than 17 million inhabitants all samples were collected at the end of december early january coinciding with the new year period the first sampling campaign was performed before the covid 19 pandemic the second during the pandemic and the third when restrictions were ended eased or presented only in a few countries 5 3 sampling instrumentation and quality control the best practice for wbe protocols were followed to minimise uncertainties relating to sample collection storage and analytical methodology castiglioni et al 2013 briefly 24 h composite influent wastewater was collected for between one and nine consecutive days the wastewater was acidified upon collection and stored at 20 c until sample treatment all samples were analysed using validated targeted lc ms ms methods bade et al 2020 bade et al 2023 procedural blanks were run throughout the analysis after every 10 injections with the aim to identify any contamination originating from solvents and laboratory conditions a quality control blank spiked with 100 ng l standards was analysed after every 20 injections instruments were cleaned before the analysis according to vendors recommendations for quantification purposes both transitions needed to be present while the ion ratio within 20 as well as retention time had to compare with the standard within 2 if only one transition was present the compound was deemed at above the limit of detection lod but below the limit of quantification loq for calculation purposes this was given as the midpoint between the lod and loq as no analyte specific internal standards were used for this method quantification was based on the peak area ratios between native and surrogate internal standards compared to an external calibration curve all data were acquired and processed with sciex os further details about the analytical methodology are provided in the supplemental files 5 4 calculations for each compound a calibration curve of up to 11 points was constructed from 0 1 to 10 000 ng l concentrations were calculated using the isotope dilution method and processed using sciex os or multiquant 3 0 2 as labelled internal standards were not available for the nps in this work a surrogate internal standard was utilised table s4 the flow rates and population data provided by each collaborating laboratory table s3 were then used to calculate excreted mass loads table s4 for 2022 23 2019 20 bade et al 2021 and 2020 21 bade et al 2022 5 5 statistical analysis statistical tests were performed on all sites and compounds where more than one year of data was available for sites with two years of data independent t tests were performed for sites with three years of data a one way anova was performed followed by a pairwise t test with bonferroni correction differences

19897,the proliferation of new psychoactive substances nps over recent years has made their surveillance complex the analysis of raw municipal influent wastewater can allow a broader insight into community consumption patterns of nps this study examines data from an international wastewater surveillance program that collected and analysed influent wastewater samples from up to 47 sites in 16 countries between 2019 and 2022 influent wastewater samples were collected over the new year period and analysed using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods over the three years a total of 18 nps were found in at least one site synthetic cathinones were the most found class followed by phenethylamines and designer benzodiazepines furthermore two ketamine analogues one plant based nps mitragynine and methiopropamine were also quantified across the three years this work demonstrates that nps are used across different continents and countries with the use of some more evident in particular regions for example mitragynine has highest mass loads in sites in the united states while eutylone and 3 methylmethcathinone increased considerably in new zealand and in several european countries respectively moreover 2f deschloroketamine an analogue of ketamine has emerged more recently and could be quantified in several sites including one in china where it is considered as one of the drugs of most concern finally some nps were detected in specific regions during the initial sampling campaigns and spread to additional sites by the third campaign hence wastewater surveillance can provide an insight into temporal and spatial trends of nps use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords illicit drugs public health monitoring 3 methylmethcathinone wastewater analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction new psychoactive substances nps are compounds that have been designed to mimic the effect of conventional illicit drugs while evading legal restrictions and are thus of international public health concern from fentanyl laced heroin jannetto et al 2019 to counterfeit xanax blakey et al 2022 and adulterated mdma krotulski et al 2021 highalert 2021 nps may pose a risk to illicit users the united nations office of drugs and crime unodc runs an early warning advisory ewa program on nps which is updated with information from international drug enforcement and intelligence agencies health authorities and toxicologists as of mid 2022 136 countries and territories covering all continents had reported more than 1100 nps to the ewa the consumption of nps is influenced by their specific effects availability price potential undetectability in routine drug tests and their use as adulterants peacock et al 2019 united nations office on drugs and crime 2022 it is imperative from a public health viewpoint to monitor the use of these drugs given our limited knowledge of their specific effects their interactions with other drugs and the harms that they cause it is difficult for law enforcement to control the circulation of these compounds because they are generally manufactured in much smaller quantities than traditional illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine and many have a grey legal status information on the prevalence of nps use is collected from forensic analyses surveys and pill testing as well as social media and dark web monitoring peacock et al 2019 pascoe et al 2022 barenholtz et al 2021 each of these serves as a complementary tool for identification monitoring surveillance control and ultimately evaluation of public health impacts of nps use each has its distinct advantages such as rapid identification of substances early warning capabilities and outlining demographics and profiles of users however not all jurisdictions have access to these data sources and thus some communities could be misinformed there is increased concern around music festivals where nps adulterated drugs can be mistakenly consumed this can increase the risk of overdoses resulting in more emergency department presentations wastewater analysis can help to fill this gap and has been used in many countries to assess licit and illicit drug use gracia lor et al 2017 the global prevalence of nps use remains unknown and data are limited to a few countries with appropriate resources unodc 2022 khaled et al 2016 the current work presents data from wastewater sampling across the new year period in three consecutive years 2019 20 2020 21 and 2021 22 the use of nps typically increases during festivals such as those of the new year period that are associated with parties and festivals the number of countries and sites has increased from 8 12 in the first iteration to 10 25 and finally to 16 47 throughout this project the number of targeted analytes changed to include the most relevant nps based on findings from the unodc ewa on nps international forensic findings and published scientific literature the aims of this work are i to study international spatial trends in nps use ii to examine if preferences for nps drugs change from year to year iii to evaluate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on nps use and iv to establish whether data on nps obtained from wastewater analysis is comparable to that from other data sources 2 results across the three years the number of countries and sites investigated increased from 8 12 to 10 25 and finally 16 47 across all three campaigns a total of 546 individual samples were analysed between 115 2019 20 and 287 2021 22 a total of 18 nps were found across the three sampling campaigns table 1 structures in table s1 with yearly totals from nine 2019 20 and 2021 22 to ten 2020 21 individual nps each year the number of analytes included in the analytical method has changed table s2 based on information from the unodc ewa forensic agencies peer reviewed publications and availability of reference analytical standards for example 3 methylmethcathinone 3 mmc mephedrone and methylone were analysed across all years while 2f deschloroketamine 2f dck mitragynine clonazolam and etizolam were only included in the third campaign 4 methylethcathinone 4 mec methylenedioxypyrovalerone mdpv methiopropamine methoxetamine and para methoxyamphetamine pma were not included in the 2021 22 campaign because there was limited identification in international forensic analyses and in the early warning systems of the unodc and emcdda a variety of classes of nps were found during this campaign synthetic cathinones were the most common table 1 phenethylamines 4 fluoroamphetamine and pma designer benzodiazepines clonazolam and etizolam ketamine analogues 2f dck and methoxetamine as well as the plant based nps mitragynine and methiopropamine were also quantified at least once across the three years 2 1 spatial trends over the three years of these data some spatial patterns emerged the synthetic cathinone 3 mmc was found consistently in all years primarily in europe fig 1 however in 2020 21 and 2021 22 it was found in at least one site in new zealand in the latter sampling period it was also found on selected days in the united states mephedrone and methylone were also found across the three campaigns they were primarily located in oceania and north america with highest levels in new zealand across the european sites they were only found in one site in spain in the 2021 22 collection table 1 like mephedrone eutylone was also primarily seen in sites in new zealand up to 55 mg day 1000 people in both 2020 21 and 2021 22 fig 2 a n ethylpentylone pentylone and ethylone had the lowest levels of synthetic cathinones found across the three sampling campaigns n ethylpentylone and pentylone had highest levels in the united states several compounds were only seen once 4 fluoroamphetamine 4 mec and mdpv in the netherlands methiopropamine and methoxetamine in australia and pma in new zealand table 1 some substances were only quantified in the most recent surveillance campaign in 2021 22 mitragynine fig 3 was found at the highest levels in the united states mostly between 1000 and 5000 mg day 1000 people sites in sweden had the next highest levels most other sites where the compound was found had levels below 50 mg day 1000 people there was generally no increase in levels over the new year in any site except for specific sites in slovenia and sweden n ethylhexedrone was only quantifiable in two sites in sweden and spain with particularly high levels in one site from sweden on new year s day the designer benzodiazepines clonazolam and etizolam were also found with highest loads at a site in iceland while levels in wastewater at other sites were below the limit of quantification of our method 2f dck was found in samples from nine sites across canada china spain france iceland italy and the united states fig 4 increases over new year s eve were evident in canada and spain table s4 while highest levels were seen across the entire sampling week in china it was only quantifiable on certain days in iceland italy and the united states 2 2 temporal trends for sites and compounds that were monitored over multiple years statistical tests were performed to determine significance 3 mmc was monitored across all three years and the measured excreted mass loads increased from 5 to 10 mg day 1000 people in the first two sampling campaigns to more than 100 mg day 1000 people in 2021 22 the highest levels were found in the 2021 22 sampling campaign at sites in spain and slovenia in sites monitored over multiple years there was also an increase i e belgium be spain es 1 new zealand nz 3 and italy it a statistically significant increase was seen in sites in belgium italy and spain between 2020 21 and 2021 22 p 0 05 there was also a statistically significant increase in the site in italy between 2019 20 and 2021 22 p 0 05 in the new zealand site where 3 mmc was found in both 2020 21 and 2021 22 there was also a statistically significant increase p 0 05 in most sites there was an increase in mass loads over new year s eve and new year s day eutylone was analysed over the two most recent campaigns the three sites in new zealand that were monitored over 2020 21 were also included in 2021 22 nz 2 and nz 3 showed similar trends for the different periods with statistically significant increases found p 0 05 while eutylone at nz 4 had no significant difference between the two sampling periods eutylone was also found at much lower levels in sites in australia north america brazil republic of korea and specific sites in europe fig 2 b these differences for both 3 mmc and eutylone from 2020 to 21 to 2021 22 could reflect the impact of covid 19 restrictions 3 discussion the societal burden attributable to illicit drug use is increasing for example in australia the societal burden due to illicit drug use increased by 35 from 2003 to 2018 and was responsible for 72 of all burden due to poisonings and almost all burden related to drug use disorders excluding alcohol australian institute of health and welfare 2021 however the burden specifically related to nps use is not easily quantified this wastewater based study provides a broader insight into nps use and establishes which nps are most used across sites in 16 countries and may potentially contribute to disease burden highest consumption was recorded for most nps around the new year period indicating that consumption increases at festivals and parties this may be due to higher consumption of regular consumers and or new users who consume nps intentionally or unintentionally it must be noted that in countries where lunar new year is celebrated i e china and the republic of korea the december january collection does not coincide with a specific holiday season nevertheless this allows this work to also show the use of nps in sites during a normal time of the year 3 1 impact of the covid 19 pandemic the novelty of this work is emphasised by comparing the sampling campaigns covering sites before the covid 19 pandemic 2019 20 when most severe covid 19 related restrictions were in place 2020 21 and when most restrictions had eased 2021 22 despite these three distinct periods and the impacts on the population there was little difference in the total number of nps detections in fact for a few compounds high levels were seen during the 2020 21 period such as eutylone in sites in new zealand increases between 2020 21 and 2021 22 were observed in two sites in new zealand while a third had no significant change these results are not unexpected as pill testing over both periods carried out in new zealand found that eutylone was the most commonly found cathinone knowyourstuffnz 2023 most compounds were at lower levels during the 2020 21 period particularly for 3 mmc in the european sites it is acknowledged that the restriction of movement as well as the cancellation of festivals and social gatherings likely resulted at these lower levels moreover the use of synthetic cathinones such as 3 mmc and eutylone is linked with that of mdma pascoe et al 2022 for example the increase in eutylone in the summer of 2020 21 was hypothesised to be due to a reduction of mdma in the country radio new zealand 2022 radio new zealand 2021 mdma was reported to have declined during 2020 in europe australia and canada which could have resulted in the increased levels of 3 mmc and or eutylone in this work bade et al 2021 been et al 2021 alygizakis et al 2021 statistics canada 2023 with the same time periods being monitored over the three years this study is able to provide a snapshot of nps consumption as such the primary difference between the 2020 21 collection and those before and after is the covid 19 pandemic we therefore hypothesise that this was the driving factor for the differences observed 3 2 spatial and temporal trends with samples collected at the same time every year it is possible to see spatial and temporal changes in consumption trends supporting information fig s1 many nps seemingly follow regional trends for example mitragynine has highest loads in sites in the united states while eutylone and mephedrone were most common in new zealand 3 mmc and n ethylhexedrone in europe and 2f dck in china some nps that were initially detected in specific regions spread to additional parts of the world in the third sampling campaign for instance 3 mmc was initially found in europe then spread to oceania in 2020 21 and north america in 2021 22 eutylone that was only detected in oceania and north america in the second campaign but was detected in europe in the last campaign 2021 22 this study has identified the potential origin of nps use around the world and could be used to monitor rapid changes in global consumers habits these results suggest that reducing nps use and protecting public health should not only be done at the national level it requires an organised global campaign they also show the global spread of nps in spite of current legislation there are blanket bans on any nps in countries such as china new zealand and australia while compound specific bans also exist internationally for example the convention on psychotropic substances 1971 from the united nations is a treaty designed to control psychoactive drugs the world health organisation who expert committee on drug dependence meets regularly to discuss the possible addition of new substances to the list of controlled drugs in recent years the nps eutylone n ethylhexedrone and n ethylpentylone have been added to the convention while 3 mmc is currently under review and mitragynine is under surveillance international narcotics control board 2021 world health organization 2021 world health organization 2022 3 2 1 synthetic cathinones the synthetic cathinones are stimulants that constitute the largest group of nps reported to the unodc ewa united nations office on drugs and crime 2021 and 3 mmc eutylone n ethylhexedrone and mephedrone were all found in this work 3 mmc is of particular concern in europe since it was first reported in 2012 in sweden it has gained in popularity particularly since 2020 european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 this is reflected in acute poisonings in the netherlands nugteren van lonkhuyzen et al 2022 while it was one of the most common nps seized in italy between may and october 2020 vincenti et al 2021 and was also the nps with the highest mass loads found in a recent national study conducted in italy salgueiro gonzález et al 2022 this european prevalence is reflected in fig 1 in the sites with multiple years of data an increase in measured mass loads is evident this increase in use has unfortunately resulted in at least 291 acute poisonings and 27 deaths in europe european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 in early 2022 after a risk assessment report of 3 mmc commissioned by the emcdda the european commission recommended control measures and member states were given six months to introduce national legislation european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 the who has also decided to include 3 mmc amongst nine nps for critical review by its expert committee on drug dependence because of its dependence producing properties and potential harms world health organization 2022 in this study the only sites outside of europe where 3 mmc was found were in new zealand and the united states albeit at much lower levels than in europe there is no current literature around the use of 3 mmc in the united states or new zealand but the new zealand drug information website high alert did release an article about 3 mmc in mid 2021 highalert 2021 in new zealand in late 2020 it was reported that there was also a decline in mdma which was maintained through 2021 new zealand police 2021 new zealand police 2022 with some of the sites in the new zealand locations incorporating music festivals it is possible that the 3 mmc measured may have been from the consumption of adulterated mdma this hypothesis is supported by a study from the united kingdom on drug use at festivals which found that as mdma detection decreased cathinone detections increased and 3 mmc represented more than 20 of all cathinones found pascoe et al 2022 mephedrone 4 methylmethcathinone is an isomer of 3 mmc and was one of the most popular nps in the early 2010s but has maintained its popularity despite legislation restrictions hutton 2020 in the three years of this work it has been found at relatively low levels particularly in new zealand and australia however in 2021 22 it was also found in a site in spain in this work eutylone had highest levels in new zealand in late 2020 the new zealand drug information website put out an alert for eutylone highalert 2021 over the 2020 21 summer festival season in new zealand testing of party drugs across the country found that up to 50 of samples thought to be of mdma contained eutylone this reduced to around 10 the following year radio new zealand 2022 however in fig 2 similar levels were obtained across both years while site nz 2 showed a statistically significant increase in 2021 22 in other sites where eutylone was monitored over 2020 21 and 2021 22 there was a decrease in sites in australia and canada while eutylone was found for the first time in samples from sites in italy belgium and the republic of korea according to seizure data the most common nps stimulants in europe were 3 mmc and n ethylhexedrone european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction 2022 so it is interesting that some eutylone was found in several european sites n ethylhexedrone was only found in a couple of european sites in spain belgium and sweden with quite high levels found in a site sweden 3 2 2 mitragynine mitragynine is the primary alkaloid derived from a plant kratom found in south east asia where it is traditionally used to combat fatigue and improve work productivity cinosi et al 2015 suwanlert 1975 in recent years it has become particularly popular in the united states as a legal high for its stimulant and or opioid like effects tobacyk et al 2022 the u s food and drug administration has repeatedly warned of the dangers of kratom including addiction abuse and dependence united states food and drug administration 2022 it is not currently federally regulated in the united states but some states have banned the substance while others have imposed age restrictions use of the compound is legal in all the sites analysed in this study in the united states but age restrictions may be in place to limit consumption by minors estimates of how many people use kratom in the united states vary but the national institute on drug abuse estimate that 0 6 i e 1 7 million people of the population aged 12 or older in 2021 reported using kratom in the past 12 months substance abuse and mental health services administration 2022 amongst the other sites in this project mitragynine was only legal in brazil belgium canada spain and greece the legal status of mitragynine was not necessarily reflected in the measured mass loads calculated in this work while sites in the united states had by far the highest levels of mitragynine the next highest were in sweden slovenia and australia where it is illegal 3 2 3 2f deschloroketamine 2f deschloroketamine 2f dck is an analogue of ketamine that has emerged over the past few years ketamine has been one of the drugs of most concern in china but major interventions have resulted in a large decline in registered ketamine users united nations office on drugs and crime 2020 in recent years ketamine analogues have emerged and become particularly prevalent in south east asia including china the highest levels of 2f dck were found in samples from one site in china and were similar to those previously reported shao et al 2021 li et al 2022 it was also evident that there was no weekend new year peak in use in the chinese site in contrast to other sites where 2f dck was found e g spain and canada it was also found infrequently in sites in the united states italy and iceland at relatively low levels according to the unodc ewa 2f dck is the second most prevalent dissociative behind ketamine in all reporting countries since 2020 united nations office on drugs and crime 2022 3 2 3 designer benzodiazepines etizolam and clonazolam are designer benzodiazepines a class associated with the greatest fatalities united nations office on drugs and crime 2021 and hence of greatest public health concern etizolam was found in eight countries in this work with most at or below our limit of quantification however a site in iceland had the highest mass loads clonazolam was only found in this same site in iceland according to the nordic health and welfare statistics iceland has the highest prescription sales rate of benzodiazepines of all nordic countries nordic health and welfare statistics 2022 both etizolam and clonazolam have been sold as counterfeit xanax blakey et al 2022 so it is possible that the high etizolam levels in iceland were due to illicit or unwitting use of xanax alprazolam 3 3 future perspectives the spe method used for this work has previously been validated for synthetic cathinones phenethylamines and opioids bade et al 2020 however recoveries for synthetic cannabinoids benzodiazepines and plant based nps range between 10 and 50 data not shown additionally studies have shown that acidified conditions are unsuitable for the optimal quantification of cannabinoids and benzodiazepines bade et al 2021 pandopulos et al 2020 while internal standards were included in this work to help cater for losses during extraction it is possible that the limited detection frequency of the designer benzodiazepines and synthetic cannabinoids could be due to their instability in acidic conditions to make a single method suitable for such a wide range of classes is challenging but several methods have been developed to detect multiple classes of nps in wastewater bade et al 2020 o rourke and subedi 2020 as the variety and number of nps continue to rise it is important to continue developing new methods suitable to cover a wide number of classes in a single extraction the results of this study highlighted the need for a global campaign as the issue of nps use affects all countries to a different level and degree therefore organisations such as the unodc and the emcdda could adopt a similar wastewater analysis approach as a surveillance tool for nps since it allows the assessment of larger populations while minimising costs provides data in an objective way reducing the impact of self reported data and presents no ethical implications as the samples are anonymous annual and targeted e g new year period music festivals and other special events campaigns could act as a warning system for the prevalence of nps 4 conclusion monitoring and surveillance of nps internationally is an ongoing and complex problem this wastewater based study provides an insight into the nps market internationally over the past three years including before during and after the covid 19 pandemic the use of nps was mainly lower during the pandemic with a few exceptions such as eutylone in specific sites higher nps consumption around the world was found during the new year holiday period and there were specific regional trends in which nps was detected for example mitragynine had highest loads in sites in the united states eutylone and mephedrone in new zealand 3 mmc and n ethylhexedrone in europe and 2f dck in china these data indicate the promise of more systematic wastewater analyses to identify and monitor trends in the use of specific nps in different populations and identify temporal and spatial patterns in their global spread of use 5 materials and methods 5 1 compounds a total of 52 compounds were analysed across the three years of this project with between 26 and 34 analysed each year table s2 5 2 sampling campaigns all information related to the wastewater collection and sites collection dates flow rates and population can be found in the supplemental files table s3 as part of an ongoing global surveillance program the number of countries and sites has increased from 8 12 in the first iteration to 10 25 and finally 16 47 data pertaining to the first two campaigns have been previously published 2019 20 bade et al 2021 and 2020 21 bade et al 2022 the population covered has increased from five to more than 17 million inhabitants all samples were collected at the end of december early january coinciding with the new year period the first sampling campaign was performed before the covid 19 pandemic the second during the pandemic and the third when restrictions were ended eased or presented only in a few countries 5 3 sampling instrumentation and quality control the best practice for wbe protocols were followed to minimise uncertainties relating to sample collection storage and analytical methodology castiglioni et al 2013 briefly 24 h composite influent wastewater was collected for between one and nine consecutive days the wastewater was acidified upon collection and stored at 20 c until sample treatment all samples were analysed using validated targeted lc ms ms methods bade et al 2020 bade et al 2023 procedural blanks were run throughout the analysis after every 10 injections with the aim to identify any contamination originating from solvents and laboratory conditions a quality control blank spiked with 100 ng l standards was analysed after every 20 injections instruments were cleaned before the analysis according to vendors recommendations for quantification purposes both transitions needed to be present while the ion ratio within 20 as well as retention time had to compare with the standard within 2 if only one transition was present the compound was deemed at above the limit of detection lod but below the limit of quantification loq for calculation purposes this was given as the midpoint between the lod and loq as no analyte specific internal standards were used for this method quantification was based on the peak area ratios between native and surrogate internal standards compared to an external calibration curve all data were acquired and processed with sciex os further details about the analytical methodology are provided in the supplemental files 5 4 calculations for each compound a calibration curve of up to 11 points was constructed from 0 1 to 10 000 ng l concentrations were calculated using the isotope dilution method and processed using sciex os or multiquant 3 0 2 as labelled internal standards were not available for the nps in this work a surrogate internal standard was utilised table s4 the flow rates and population data provided by each collaborating laboratory table s3 were then used to calculate excreted mass loads table s4 for 2022 23 2019 20 bade et al 2021 and 2020 21 bade et al 2022 5 5 statistical analysis statistical tests were performed on all sites and compounds where more than one year of data was available for sites with two years of data independent t tests were performed for sites with three years of data a one way anova was performed followed by a pairwise t test with bonferroni correction differences

19898,numerous innovative decentralised urban water solutions have been described over many years yet their application in practice is still not common at all while many proposed solutions may have some techno economic advantages over current systems the real reasons for the slow uptake have more to do with system wide inertia and technology lock in where existing solutions are preferred for simplicity and familiarity a key factor is also the inadequate assessments in project decision making processes that should consider all relevant social environmental and economic benefits and values this paper highlights some key barriers and how to address them in a more holistic way it also identifies opportunities where more integrated hybrid solutions could offer significant benefits over current technologies it calls on all key partners in this sector to foster broad and strong collaborations and on water service providers to be empowered to take an inclusive leadership role in creating such innovative solutions that help address our growing challenges driven by rapid urbanisation and climate change keywords urban water decentralisation integrated solutions multi sector collaboration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article introduction for several decades now there have been discussions in academia and practice about the optimal water infrastructure solutions for the future particularly for our rapidly growing urban population worldwide sedlack 2014 while some argue strongly that the current centralised solutions have served us well for water supply sewage management and flood mitigation many also pointed out the shortcomings of these assets and have proposed various decentralised solutions that would achieve better and more sustainable outcomes for our current and future cities van loosdrecht and brdanjovic 2014 larsen et al 2016 roefs et al 2017 numerous academic studies and demonstration projects on the ground have shown the benefits of various decentralised solutions for urban water infrastructure projects good recent summary in garrido baserba et al 2022 however in practice there is often an opposing trend evident since many years whereby smaller plants are decommissioned and larger ones being expanded particularly for wastewater treatment as this offers apparently the most cost effective option to manage existing and growing demands meanwhile only a slow uptake of alternative water resource options is evident including more decentralised solutions this situation is clearly not advantageous to address our growing needs and challenges including those created by the rapidly urbanising populations and the changing climatic conditions in many parts of the world while our current infrastructure assets are increasingly under pressure from higher population demands growing environmental and economic requirements and stronger climate variations we are not pro actively and constructively incorporating novel alternative solutions at a rate that would help to alleviate these challenges with the growing push towards a circular economy including more sustainable energy and resource management solutions the opportunities and benefits of a more inclusive and integrated approach are becoming even more compelling olsson 2015 estévez et al 2022 what are the reasons for the slow uptake of integrated or decentralised solutions there are a range of different reasons for the slow and limited implementation of such alternative approaches often specific local obstacles can be in the way but there are also many structural and institutional barriers plus social acceptance challenges that make the application of such novel solutions difficult here are a few key reasons that may explain the slow uptake and that also point to what needs to be changed in future to accelerate this transition the economic value of smaller systems is often difficult to justify particularly when indirect benefits are not fully recognised and accounted for the economy of scale benefits of large systems are real and significant both on capital and operational costs a particular shortfall in some academic papers eg garrido baserba et al 2022 is that the costs of the alternative decentralised solutions are looking promising when compared to the costs of the current technologies at the same scale e g 300 people equivalents but the authors then fail to recognise the major savings in unit costs of much larger centralised processes to achieve significant change many different players need to be engaged and they typically have poor alignment of their interests timing objectives etc it is difficult to create meaningful and project time relevant engagement between regulators public institutions urban planners public private sector property developers mostly private companies water utilities public and private sector entities and customers private citizens yet all these key stakeholder groups need to be involved in the decision making and implementation process to ensure a successful outcome of a novel alternative solution additionally a culture of poor collaboration is often common between some of these stakeholders generally due to misaligned or even opposing objectives with limited or no external drivers or incentives regulatory or economic for example property developers generally are looking for readily available solutions with limited capital expenditure small space requirements and low complexity technical and contractual while most councils water utilities and end users may favour integrated solutions with lower overall costs and multiple benefits and value for several players public health regulators can also raise high expectations and demands at these novel decentralised technology solutions these requirements may be partly justified particularly for high risk activities like blackwater treatment but are sometimes also excessively conservative and risk averse due to a lack of understanding or experience with these new systems this not only raises the acceptance bar higher than what current technologies may have to achieve it also creates a substantial compliance burden sampling analysis reporting costs that can make smaller systems economically unviable many of the above points were also identified in a recent analysis of failed full scale residential water recycling schemes in australia west et al 2016 which identified as top critical risks unanticipated operational costs legal and contractual arrangements and regulatory requirements what would make alternative solutions more competitive first and foremost we need to change our focus from finding a short term appropriate technology solution for a particular problem to one where we look for long term optimal solutions on a whole of system basis this then often leads to an approach to integrate decentralised and centralised options and their benefits which may be referred to as hybrid or distributed solutions such an approach requires active and genuine collaboration between many entities and it will ideally also generate benefits and value to multiple or even all stakeholders this change of perspective has regularly been advocated by researchers e g nika et al 2020 and practioners alike but its actual application in project development and decision making processes is still very limited to support and encourage such innovative solutions stronger drivers are needed that are based on a whole of system optimisation and assesses the overall long term economic impact on all relevant aspects including social and environmental values this may require mechanisms for fair cost sharing arrangements between players importantly all relevant benefit cost assessments need to be done on a whole of life basis which means considering both capital and operating expenses and taking into account the actual costs of new or additional water supply or treatment options required additionally all relevant externalities like public amenity environmental impacts benefits flood and drought resilience urban heat mitigation and other community benefits need to be considered as many of these decentralised blue green solutions offer significant local value such broad based approaches should be mandatory in project planning and evaluation and suitable tools to assist in these assessments are becoming available west et al 2019 iftekhar and pannell 2022 the opportunities for decentralised technologies are typically greatest where there are no or only inefficient expensive solutions possible in centralised systems but an existing or emerging need has been recognised for a better outcome than what is currently achieved some examples of such market niches for decentralised options are stormwater and rainwater harvesting possibly combined with graywater recycling to provide alternative distributed water supply options non potable or even potable given the highly intermittent and variable nature of stormwater and rainwater generation decentralised harvesting and storage reuse options e g rainwater tanks stormwater ponds tanks etc are generally more suitable due to the very large volumes that otherwise need to be managed in a short time in centralised systems similarly the separate collection and treatment of graywater household effluent except toilet and possibly kitchen effluent is only competitive in a localised setting to avoid costly duplication of the sewer networks as graywater generation is quite continuous a combined decentralised treatment of graywater and rain stormwater after storage could boost local water supplies significantly while also drastically reducing sewage flows particularly during wet weather periods nutrient harvesting from high strength waste streams such as yellow water from urine separating toilets this solution can take significant nutrient loads off the wastewater treatment system while also allowing local concentrated collection of nutrients especially nitrogen phosphorus to be recovered and reused as part of a circular economy approach while such urine separating systems have been developed for many years the key remaining challenge is what to do with the collected yellow water see excellent review by larsen et al 2021 a key solution could be to have many small decentralised processes that selectively up concentrate the nutrients from the urine while the remaining low nutrient stream is discharged into the centralised wastewater system wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2006 freguia et al 2019 this minimises the storage requirements for the nutrients while also making use of the existing sewer infrastructure to handle the liquid flows hence creating a true hybrid system integrated distributed rainwater and stormwater management with centralised control this solution combines the benefits of rainwater capture as outlined above with optimal management of the stormwater system that is still required for medium to high rainfall situations a key feature of this approach is to have highly decentralised storage capacity rainwater collection at each house for local use that is actively managed and controlled from a central location aquarevo melbourne wsaa 2023 this creates maximal rainwater storage capacity before a wet weather event by discharging all rainwater tank contents into the stormwater system before rainfall this achieves major reduction of total run off during the rainfall event creating significant size and cost reductions for the stormwater management and flood mitigation infrastructure this example again shows the benefits of such hybrid solutions utilising both decentralised and centralised elements to achieve an optimal outcome for the whole system how to encourage collaboration that can achieve successful outcomes to foster stronger and more in depth collaboration key entities like planning and building approval departments water service providers and environmental public health regulators must raise their technical and risk management capabilities this should enable increased flexibility for and acceptance of alternative or non conventional solutions that achieve at least a comparable risk outcome as business as usual stronger incentives or legal requirements as well as the removal of institutional or regulatory barriers are needed to promote and support collaborative approaches between different stakeholders across the industry a key role in fostering such collaborations often falls to the local

19898,numerous innovative decentralised urban water solutions have been described over many years yet their application in practice is still not common at all while many proposed solutions may have some techno economic advantages over current systems the real reasons for the slow uptake have more to do with system wide inertia and technology lock in where existing solutions are preferred for simplicity and familiarity a key factor is also the inadequate assessments in project decision making processes that should consider all relevant social environmental and economic benefits and values this paper highlights some key barriers and how to address them in a more holistic way it also identifies opportunities where more integrated hybrid solutions could offer significant benefits over current technologies it calls on all key partners in this sector to foster broad and strong collaborations and on water service providers to be empowered to take an inclusive leadership role in creating such innovative solutions that help address our growing challenges driven by rapid urbanisation and climate change keywords urban water decentralisation integrated solutions multi sector collaboration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article introduction for several decades now there have been discussions in academia and practice about the optimal water infrastructure solutions for the future particularly for our rapidly growing urban population worldwide sedlack 2014 while some argue strongly that the current centralised solutions have served us well for water supply sewage management and flood mitigation many also pointed out the shortcomings of these assets and have proposed various decentralised solutions that would achieve better and more sustainable outcomes for our current and future cities van loosdrecht and brdanjovic 2014 larsen et al 2016 roefs et al 2017 numerous academic studies and demonstration projects on the ground have shown the benefits of various decentralised solutions for urban water infrastructure projects good recent summary in garrido baserba et al 2022 however in practice there is often an opposing trend evident since many years whereby smaller plants are decommissioned and larger ones being expanded particularly for wastewater treatment as this offers apparently the most cost effective option to manage existing and growing demands meanwhile only a slow uptake of alternative water resource options is evident including more decentralised solutions this situation is clearly not advantageous to address our growing needs and challenges including those created by the rapidly urbanising populations and the changing climatic conditions in many parts of the world while our current infrastructure assets are increasingly under pressure from higher population demands growing environmental and economic requirements and stronger climate variations we are not pro actively and constructively incorporating novel alternative solutions at a rate that would help to alleviate these challenges with the growing push towards a circular economy including more sustainable energy and resource management solutions the opportunities and benefits of a more inclusive and integrated approach are becoming even more compelling olsson 2015 estévez et al 2022 what are the reasons for the slow uptake of integrated or decentralised solutions there are a range of different reasons for the slow and limited implementation of such alternative approaches often specific local obstacles can be in the way but there are also many structural and institutional barriers plus social acceptance challenges that make the application of such novel solutions difficult here are a few key reasons that may explain the slow uptake and that also point to what needs to be changed in future to accelerate this transition the economic value of smaller systems is often difficult to justify particularly when indirect benefits are not fully recognised and accounted for the economy of scale benefits of large systems are real and significant both on capital and operational costs a particular shortfall in some academic papers eg garrido baserba et al 2022 is that the costs of the alternative decentralised solutions are looking promising when compared to the costs of the current technologies at the same scale e g 300 people equivalents but the authors then fail to recognise the major savings in unit costs of much larger centralised processes to achieve significant change many different players need to be engaged and they typically have poor alignment of their interests timing objectives etc it is difficult to create meaningful and project time relevant engagement between regulators public institutions urban planners public private sector property developers mostly private companies water utilities public and private sector entities and customers private citizens yet all these key stakeholder groups need to be involved in the decision making and implementation process to ensure a successful outcome of a novel alternative solution additionally a culture of poor collaboration is often common between some of these stakeholders generally due to misaligned or even opposing objectives with limited or no external drivers or incentives regulatory or economic for example property developers generally are looking for readily available solutions with limited capital expenditure small space requirements and low complexity technical and contractual while most councils water utilities and end users may favour integrated solutions with lower overall costs and multiple benefits and value for several players public health regulators can also raise high expectations and demands at these novel decentralised technology solutions these requirements may be partly justified particularly for high risk activities like blackwater treatment but are sometimes also excessively conservative and risk averse due to a lack of understanding or experience with these new systems this not only raises the acceptance bar higher than what current technologies may have to achieve it also creates a substantial compliance burden sampling analysis reporting costs that can make smaller systems economically unviable many of the above points were also identified in a recent analysis of failed full scale residential water recycling schemes in australia west et al 2016 which identified as top critical risks unanticipated operational costs legal and contractual arrangements and regulatory requirements what would make alternative solutions more competitive first and foremost we need to change our focus from finding a short term appropriate technology solution for a particular problem to one where we look for long term optimal solutions on a whole of system basis this then often leads to an approach to integrate decentralised and centralised options and their benefits which may be referred to as hybrid or distributed solutions such an approach requires active and genuine collaboration between many entities and it will ideally also generate benefits and value to multiple or even all stakeholders this change of perspective has regularly been advocated by researchers e g nika et al 2020 and practioners alike but its actual application in project development and decision making processes is still very limited to support and encourage such innovative solutions stronger drivers are needed that are based on a whole of system optimisation and assesses the overall long term economic impact on all relevant aspects including social and environmental values this may require mechanisms for fair cost sharing arrangements between players importantly all relevant benefit cost assessments need to be done on a whole of life basis which means considering both capital and operating expenses and taking into account the actual costs of new or additional water supply or treatment options required additionally all relevant externalities like public amenity environmental impacts benefits flood and drought resilience urban heat mitigation and other community benefits need to be considered as many of these decentralised blue green solutions offer significant local value such broad based approaches should be mandatory in project planning and evaluation and suitable tools to assist in these assessments are becoming available west et al 2019 iftekhar and pannell 2022 the opportunities for decentralised technologies are typically greatest where there are no or only inefficient expensive solutions possible in centralised systems but an existing or emerging need has been recognised for a better outcome than what is currently achieved some examples of such market niches for decentralised options are stormwater and rainwater harvesting possibly combined with graywater recycling to provide alternative distributed water supply options non potable or even potable given the highly intermittent and variable nature of stormwater and rainwater generation decentralised harvesting and storage reuse options e g rainwater tanks stormwater ponds tanks etc are generally more suitable due to the very large volumes that otherwise need to be managed in a short time in centralised systems similarly the separate collection and treatment of graywater household effluent except toilet and possibly kitchen effluent is only competitive in a localised setting to avoid costly duplication of the sewer networks as graywater generation is quite continuous a combined decentralised treatment of graywater and rain stormwater after storage could boost local water supplies significantly while also drastically reducing sewage flows particularly during wet weather periods nutrient harvesting from high strength waste streams such as yellow water from urine separating toilets this solution can take significant nutrient loads off the wastewater treatment system while also allowing local concentrated collection of nutrients especially nitrogen phosphorus to be recovered and reused as part of a circular economy approach while such urine separating systems have been developed for many years the key remaining challenge is what to do with the collected yellow water see excellent review by larsen et al 2021 a key solution could be to have many small decentralised processes that selectively up concentrate the nutrients from the urine while the remaining low nutrient stream is discharged into the centralised wastewater system wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2006 freguia et al 2019 this minimises the storage requirements for the nutrients while also making use of the existing sewer infrastructure to handle the liquid flows hence creating a true hybrid system integrated distributed rainwater and stormwater management with centralised control this solution combines the benefits of rainwater capture as outlined above with optimal management of the stormwater system that is still required for medium to high rainfall situations a key feature of this approach is to have highly decentralised storage capacity rainwater collection at each house for local use that is actively managed and controlled from a central location aquarevo melbourne wsaa 2023 this creates maximal rainwater storage capacity before a wet weather event by discharging all rainwater tank contents into the stormwater system before rainfall this achieves major reduction of total run off during the rainfall event creating significant size and cost reductions for the stormwater management and flood mitigation infrastructure this example again shows the benefits of such hybrid solutions utilising both decentralised and centralised elements to achieve an optimal outcome for the whole system how to encourage collaboration that can achieve successful outcomes to foster stronger and more in depth collaboration key entities like planning and building approval departments water service providers and environmental public health regulators must raise their technical and risk management capabilities this should enable increased flexibility for and acceptance of alternative or non conventional solutions that achieve at least a comparable risk outcome as business as usual stronger incentives or legal requirements as well as the removal of institutional or regulatory barriers are needed to promote and support collaborative approaches between different stakeholders across the industry a key role in fostering such collaborations often falls to the local water service provider they or their private sector partners are often the only relevant agency with both the technical and organisational capabilities to help develop install and operate these novel solutions including ongoing maintenance troubleshooting as well as financial and accounting services therefore water utilities need to have a strong capacity and willingness to take on this leadership role but in a very collaborative and inclusive way with all relevant stakeholders importantly they should also be politically encouraged and legally empowered to take on this critically important role

19899,the synthetic dye discharge is responsible for nearly one fifth of the total water pollution from textile industry which poses both environmental and public health risks herein a solid substrate inoculated with fungi is proposed as an effective and environmentally friendly approach for catalyzing organic dye degradation pleurotus ostreatus was inoculated onto commercially available solid substrates such as sorghum bran and husk among these p ostreatus grown on sorghum po sorg produced the highest enzyme activity and was further tested for its dye biodegradation ability four dye compounds reactive blue 19 rb 19 indigo carmine acid orange 7 and acid red 1 were degraded by po sorg with removal efficiencies of 93 95 95 and 78 respectively under more industrially relevant conditions po sorg successfully degraded dyes in synthetic wastewater and in samples collected from a local textile factory which reveals its potential for practical usage various biotransformation intermediates and end products were identified for each dye po sorg exhibited high stability even under relatively extreme temperatures and ph conditions over 85 removal of rb 19 was achieved after three consecutive batch cycles demonstrating reusability of this approach altogether po sorg demonstrated outstanding reusability and sustainability and offers considerable potential for treating wastewater streams containing synthetic organic dyes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biocatalysts white rot fungus solid state fermentation dye biodegradation textile wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dyeing industry brings enormous profits to many developing countries góralczyk bińkowska et al 2021 however without proper legislation manufacturers discharge nearly 11 million tons of dye polluted wastewater into aquatic systems about 20 of textile industrial pollution chauhan and choudhury 2021 kant 2012 routoula and patwardhan 2020 dye containing wastewater is characterized by light absorbing pigments high biological and chemical oxygen demand and toxic ingredients which negatively impact receiving environments if not properly treated lellis et al 2019 shindhal et al 2021 while several physicochemical techniques such as membrane filtration ozonation and flocculation shindhal et al 2021 have been used to treat dye effluents these methods can be inefficient costly and generate secondary pollutants agrawal and verma 2019 a potentially safer and cost effective involves using microbes and their enzymes to biodegrade synthetic dyes lellis et al 2019 recent research efforts have focused on the use of fungi in wastewater treatment applications arikan et al 2019 dalecka et al 2020 grelska and noszczyńska 2020 wood decaying fungi are well suited for removing contaminants because they produce powerful oxidative enzymes merino et al 2023 these extracellular ligninolytic enzymes can catalyze the degradation of many organic compounds including dye compounds sen et al 2016 one of the most commonly reported fungal enzymes is laccase laccase is a copper containing oxidoreductase that uses oxygen molecules as the terminal electron acceptor to catalyze various organic reactions gao et al 2022a however adding free fungal organisms to wastewater often clogs pipelines and limits reusability more et al 2010 another approach involving fungal enzyme extracts in pollutant degradation has also been limited due to production costs environmental stress e g ph and temperature and limited ability to recover the catalyst materials rodríguez couto 2009 wang et al 2019 to circumvent these concerns fermenting solid substrates with live fungi has been proposed to produce effective and green biocatalysts reported solid substrates include rice hull li and jia 2008 sawdust przystaś et al 2018 and other materials for example luffa cylindrica a natural biomass material was utilized to support stropharia sp itcc 8422 which in turn was able to degrade and detoxify anthraquinone violet r agrawal and verma 2019 solid substrate grown fungi offer many advantages including high abundance low cost ease of operation and resilience the inoculation process is simple and requires only one step incubating the fungi and the substrate materials together in addition the rich and diverse nutrients in these solid substrates support fungal growth providing sustained enzyme release during experiments technically it is an immobilization process that enhances the biocatalysts stability making them less susceptible to environmental stresses the solid associated fungal biomass is also easy to separate from the reaction medium allowing easy replacement furthermore these natural materials can be sourced locally and from naturally grown plants making them more sustainable and environmentally friendly than other supports collectively fungi grown on natural solid substrates offer multiple advantages as biocatalysts wang et al 2019 zahmatkesh et al 2018 making them good candidates for degrading dye compounds the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient and green biocatalyst system based on solid substrate immobilized fungi and investigate its performance in treating individual dye compounds synthetic textile wastewater stww and a sample of real textile wastewater rtww effluent to further evaluate the biocatalyst performance degradation products were identified enzyme stability under a range of temperatures and ph was examined and reusability in sequential batch experiments was assessed 2 results and discussion 2 1 characterization of pleurotus ostreatus grown on different substrates among the laccase activities of p ostreatus grown on sorghum po sorg bran po bran or husk po husk measured over 75 days po sorg showed the highest laccase activity 1 60 u g on average fig 1 a on the other hand po husk showed the lowest laccase activity throughout the experiment therefore we selected po sorg and po bran to further study mycelia morphologies by scanning electron microscopy sem fig 1b the hyphae of po sorg appeared to be straight and wired to each other whereas po bran was characterized by flaky mycelia these distinct structures of p ostreatus could be due to the different nutrients in sorghum and bran in addition the healthy mycelium on sorghum suggested that the ingredients of sorghum are preferred for fungal growth furthermore as shown in fig 1b po bran was easily disintegrated making it unfavorable for practical usage more importantly po sorg maintained its structure even after a 120 day storage at room temperature superior to previously reported trametes versicolor cultivated on sorghum fig s2 zahmatkesh et al 2018 the morphology and longevity of po sorg further demonstrated that it could be a robust biocatalyst for wastewater treatment applications transcriptional analysis has been used to study molecular mechanism of biodegradation zhang et al 2021 we further profiled the transcription levels of laccase isozymes produced by po sorg along with growth fig 1c among the six identified genes coding for laccase isozymes in p ostreatus lacc3 5 7 10 11 and 12 durán sequeda et al 2022 lacc10 showed the highest average upregulation 5 25 fold within 40 days other genes showed slight upregulation or downregulation these results indicate that the dominant isozymes for po sorg are lacc10 laccases which further helped us characterize the po sorg biocatalyst 2 2 dye degradation by po sorg in laboratory buffer and stww among the four dye compounds tested reactive blue 19 rb 19 indigo carmine ic acid orange 7 ao 7 and acid red 1 ar 1 rb 19 degradation was relatively rapid decreasing to 10 1 mg l within 12 h and then leveling off as illustrated in fig 2 a laccase activity gradually increased until 12 h into the experiment when it peaked at 95 0 u l and slightly declined for the remainder of the trial ic was degraded to 3 91 mg l within 48 h and the laccase activity increased steadily to a maximum of 102 u l in 24 h fig 2b ao 7 was degraded to 4 65 mg l after 60 h with a maximum laccase activity with 279 u l at 48 h into the experiment after which it declined to 118 u l 12 h later fig 2c ar 1 was the least degraded by po sorg reaching 22 4 mg l after 60 h its laccase activity increased throughout the duration of the experiment reaching 437 u l fig 2d the killed and abiotic controls did not show observable degradation of any dyes in descending order the degradation efficiency of po sorg can be sorted as rb 19 ic ao 7 and ar 1 anthraquinone dye showed the most rapid decolorization while the azo dyes were harder to degrade and the rate of indigo dye degradation fell between these two these results are consistent with previously reported studies champagne and ramsay 2010 gao et al 2022b and can be attributed to the dye structures ao 7 and ar 1 have an azo group n n with higher bond energy and are less thermodynamically favorable for laccase as the substrate compared to the c n bond in rb 19 and ic additionally laccase activity presented distinct profiles among dyes in both azo dye groups laccase activity peaked above initial activity over time which is also reported in other studies han et al 2014 liu et al 2021 one possible reason is that products generated from azo dye degradation serve as inducers for laccase secretion these products might even be utilized for fungal growth in contrast the parent compounds or products of anthraquinone and indigo dyes play a role in fungal growth inhibition friedman et al 2020 saleem et al 2022 it is also possible that more rapid degradation of the anthraquinone and indigo dyes prevented the need for enhanced enzyme production in more complex stww samples rb 19 degradation was initially slower but still reached a similar final dye concentration of 14 1 mg l as that in the enzyme buffer with respect to ar 1 degradation was much slower in stww than in the buffer and reached a higher minimum dye concentration fig 3 a the slower degradation of ar 1 could be attributed to the other constituents of the stww such as trace metals and salts that could act as inhibitors to laccase resulting in slower catalysis champagne et al 2013 however in the rb 19 group laccase activity did not show apparent inhibition this is likely due to rb 19 and formed products association with components in stww which lowered any inhibitory effects it was supported by different or unidentified bisphenol a degradation products in real tertiary treated wastewater ozyildiz et al 2019 these results demonstrate that po sorg can effectively degrade various commonly used dye classes even in complex matrices which justifies further exploration of its applications in actual dye containing industrial wastewaters 2 3 degradation and detoxification of rtww by po sorg as illustrated in fig 3b po sorg was tested in a rtww sample to assess its degradation potential under realistic textile wastewater matrices multiple uv vis spectra 200 800 nm were collected over a 72 h period the peak maximum at 520 nm showed no change during the first 24 h but rapidly decreased thereafter this result may have occurred as during the first 24 h po sorg expressed lower laccase activity while acclimating to complex components of rtww resulting in minimal dye degradation however after 24 h inhibiting components might have reacted so the degradation rate increased the toxicity of rtww to escherichia coli was also reduced 2 fold after a 72 h treatment by po sorg fig s3 these results indicate that po sorg can be applied to treatment of dye effluents under non sterile conditions within a reasonable timeframe and that it can reduce the whole effluent toxicity of industrial dye wastewater 2 4 biodegradation products of dye degradation we confirmed several degradation products of rb 19 that could be generated by a previously proposed pathway dauda and erkurt 2020 osma et al 2010 and also identified new products phthalic acid c8h6o4 and c6h6so4 after ring opening reactions fig 4 a we also identified the formation of possible products by another pathway pathway 2 in fig 4a via generating an aniline group at another c n bond during ar 1 degradation pathway 1 fig 4b the hydroxyl group was converted to a phenoxy radical and sequentially oxidized to a ketone group and carbonium ion water then showed a nucleophilic attack followed by c n bond cleavage further we propose another asymmetrical oxidation pathway 3 owing to observing potential products a similar mechanism pathway 3 was reported for methyl orange fungal laccase degradation telke et al 2010 we also identified products that might be formed by azo group reduction pathway 2 probably due to fungal reductase al tohamy et al 2020 goud et al 2020 mani et al 2019 another azo dye ao 7 shares similar mechanisms as ar 1 degradation and have three possible pathways fig s4 among them pathway 1 was previously confirmed ali et al 2021 chivukula and renganathan 1995 wang et al 2014 zille et al 2005 and products generated by we also proposed degradation pathways for ic which are shown in fig s5 in addition we examined preliminary product profiles esi of rtww degradation illustrated in fig s6 which showed the disappearance of initial compounds and the appearance of new compounds within 48 or 60 h e g esi m z 144 08 295 23 and 337 23 esi m z 207 01 313 24 and 329 23 future research should focus on the identification of these compounds in rtww 2 5 stability and reusability of po sorg the temperature and ph of textile wastewater can vary greatly even within a single factory the stability of a biocatalyst to resist these fluctuations is directly related to the treatment performance as illustrated in fig 5 a even when the temperature was increased to 70 c after 12 h po sorg still achieved around 58 removal efficiency demonstrating its high stability towards thermal stress however when the ph was increased to 10 the dye removal efficiency greatly decreased these results indicate that po sorg performs poorly in highly basic media consistent with the reported favorable acidic ph range of p ostreatus laccase vinoth et al 2022 we hypothesize that the added stability of po sorg is due to the protection afforded by its attachment to the solid sorghum surface there is a possibility that laccase secreted by p ostreatus also is immobilized on the surface which results in enhanced thermal and ph stability from an enconomic and environmental perspective the reusability of a biocatalyst is a crucial factor for practical application to wastewater treatment zdarta et al 2022 as illustrated in fig 5b effective dye degradation was observed over three successive catalyst uses there was no degradation observed in the control groups fig s7 after three cycles po sorg still degraded rb 19 from 51 mg l to 15 mg l after 72 h moreover by using nylon mesh bags po sorg was easily removed from the test solutions after each cycle demonstrating its excellent operational potential however additional time was needed after each cycle to achieve maximum degradation this could be ascribed to a decrease in laccase activity from 105 u l to 20 u l because the rate of laccase synthesis was slower than the replacement of the dye solution therefore po sorg required a regrowth period between each round after 1 day of recovering at 30 c po sorg could be used for up to six rounds fig s8 overall these results demonstrate the potential of po sorg as a robust biocatalyst for treating dye wastewater 3 conclusions an effective biocatalyst system consisting of fungi inoculated on solid sorghum po sorg was developed and demonstrated treatment of dye containing wastewater po sorg showed prolonged laccase production and robust structure making it practical for dye treatment four representative dye compounds in deionized water as well as synthetic and real wastewater solutions were successfully degraded by po sorg to less toxic substances the biocatalyst material performed well under temperature and ph variations typical of actual textile effluents and was shown to be reused for three successive cycles with minimal loss in degradation efficiency overall our findings demonstrate the sustainability of the po sorg material and its potential as a practical and robust biocatalyst for treating textile wastewater streams further studies on process scale up and testing are needed to assess this system s utility for various commercial applications 4 materials and methods 4 1 microorganisms and chemicals p ostreatus taxid 5322 was isolated from the fungal culture purchased from root mushroom farm bob s red mill sorghum jiva organic whole psyllium husk and bob s red mill wheat bran were used for fungal growth the rtww was obtained from an active textile factory in vernon california dye compounds rb 19 ic ao 7 and ar 1 were obtained from sigma aldrich other chemicals were purchased from thermo fisher scientific 4 2 preparation of solid substrate grown fungi p ostreatus was cultivated on yeast extract peptone dextrose ypd agar plates for 6 days at 30 c until the entire plate was fully colonized to prepare each bioreactor 20 g of sorghum bran or husk was added to a 250 ml polypropylene erlenmeyer flask and autoclaved in an aseptic environment six p ostreatus mycelium agar plugs 1 cm 1 cm collected from the ypd plates and 8 ml of liquid tisma medium tišma et al 2011 were added to each flask to initiate growth and maintain appropriate humidity level next a sterile cotton ball was wrapped in an ethanol sterilized kimwipe to plug the top of the reactor each bioreactor containing po sorg po bran or po husk was placed in a stationary incubator at 30 c the bioreactors were mixed by gentle swirling every 3 days to ensure homogenization 4 3 laccase activity of solid substrate grown fungi laccase activity was evaluated by measuring the absorbance change at 420 nm as 2 mm 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts was oxidized in a cuvette 10 μl of enzyme extract was combined with 490 μl of 2 mm abts in sodium phosphate buffer the activity was determined by observing the absorbance change every 2 s for 2 min ε 36 000 l mol cm on nanodrop 2000 the activity in the supernatant u l was first calculated using a previously reported equation lothe et al 2020 next the activity was converted to units per gram of fungi grown on solid substrates f ss u g based on the following equation 1 acti vity u g f ss acti vity u ml 4 5 ml of di water 0 5 g of f ss 4 4 characterization of solid substrate grown fungal systems laccase activity was quantified frequently over the incubation time before sampling the po sorg was well mixed to homogenize the material subsequently 0 5 g of the colonized sorghum was added to a falcon tube along with 5 ml of sterile deionized water the falcon tube was inverted 5 times to mix the contents and then incubated at 30 c for 15 min the supernatant was then collected for laccase activity measurement gao et al 2022b small fungal mycelia were collected after 20 days from all media using a previously reported method soh et al 2021 except that the drying period was 6 h 48 c samples were sputter coated with pt for sem imaging genes coding for laccase isozymes were amplified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr using the method described in the si details in s1 to examine the expression of laccase isozymes from po sorg forward and reverse primers are listed in table s1 the schematic of po sorg production and characterization is shown in fig s1 4 5 dye degradation in buffer four different dye compounds rb 19 ic ao 7 and ar 1 were selected to represent the common dye categories of anthraquinone rb 19 indigo ic and azo dyes ao 7 and ar 1 live experimental groups were prepared in 250 ml polypropylene erlenmeyer flasks each consisted of pre grown po sorg and 50 ml of a 50 mg l dye solution dissolved in a ph 5 na po4 buffer the enzyme activity in units per gram of po sorg u g was measured before the experiment subsequently a calculated amount of po sorg details in s2 was added to reach 100 u l of the initial laccase activity an abiotic control contained dye buffer and uncolonized sorghum a killed control solution contained dye and autoclaved po sorg to distinguish dye sorption from degradation all solutions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate at each sampling event 500 μl was taken from each flask the dye concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the sample at the maximum absorbance wavelength table s2 and laccase activity was also measured the effects of temperature and ph on dye degradation in buffered solutions were also examined details in s3 in the ranges reported for textile wastewaters yaseen and scholz 2019 the reusability of po sorg was tested in the buffer by using the same set of po sorg materials in consecutive dye degradation trials po sorg was placed in sterile nylon tea bags for confinement and used in the next round the first degradation round ceased when the dye concentrations remained unchanged after 12 h the degraded dye solutions were removed from the live and control flasks and replaced with a fresh 50 ml rb 19 solution 50 mg l to begin subsequent rounds 4 6 dye degradation in stww and rtww the stww was prepared according to a previously reported composition details in s4 yaseen and scholz 2019 rb 19 and ar 1 were dissolved in stww and degraded by po sorg following the same conditions described above since the rtww matrix was too concentrated to obtain uv vis spectra it was diluted 5 fold using non sterile tap water po sorg with an initial laccase activity of 500 u l was added to 50 ml of the diluted rtww under non sterile conditions spectra were collected over a wavelength range from 200 to 700 nm using a uv vis spectrometer lambda 365 perkin elmer whole effluent toxicity of rtww before and after po sorg treatment was measured in terms of atp content of e coli using reported method gao et al 2022b 4 7 analysis of degradation products for rb 19 and ao 7 groups five 2 ml samples were collected at different time stamps 6 12 24 48 and 60 h the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 98 sulfuric acid

19899,the synthetic dye discharge is responsible for nearly one fifth of the total water pollution from textile industry which poses both environmental and public health risks herein a solid substrate inoculated with fungi is proposed as an effective and environmentally friendly approach for catalyzing organic dye degradation pleurotus ostreatus was inoculated onto commercially available solid substrates such as sorghum bran and husk among these p ostreatus grown on sorghum po sorg produced the highest enzyme activity and was further tested for its dye biodegradation ability four dye compounds reactive blue 19 rb 19 indigo carmine acid orange 7 and acid red 1 were degraded by po sorg with removal efficiencies of 93 95 95 and 78 respectively under more industrially relevant conditions po sorg successfully degraded dyes in synthetic wastewater and in samples collected from a local textile factory which reveals its potential for practical usage various biotransformation intermediates and end products were identified for each dye po sorg exhibited high stability even under relatively extreme temperatures and ph conditions over 85 removal of rb 19 was achieved after three consecutive batch cycles demonstrating reusability of this approach altogether po sorg demonstrated outstanding reusability and sustainability and offers considerable potential for treating wastewater streams containing synthetic organic dyes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biocatalysts white rot fungus solid state fermentation dye biodegradation textile wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dyeing industry brings enormous profits to many developing countries góralczyk bińkowska et al 2021 however without proper legislation manufacturers discharge nearly 11 million tons of dye polluted wastewater into aquatic systems about 20 of textile industrial pollution chauhan and choudhury 2021 kant 2012 routoula and patwardhan 2020 dye containing wastewater is characterized by light absorbing pigments high biological and chemical oxygen demand and toxic ingredients which negatively impact receiving environments if not properly treated lellis et al 2019 shindhal et al 2021 while several physicochemical techniques such as membrane filtration ozonation and flocculation shindhal et al 2021 have been used to treat dye effluents these methods can be inefficient costly and generate secondary pollutants agrawal and verma 2019 a potentially safer and cost effective involves using microbes and their enzymes to biodegrade synthetic dyes lellis et al 2019 recent research efforts have focused on the use of fungi in wastewater treatment applications arikan et al 2019 dalecka et al 2020 grelska and noszczyńska 2020 wood decaying fungi are well suited for removing contaminants because they produce powerful oxidative enzymes merino et al 2023 these extracellular ligninolytic enzymes can catalyze the degradation of many organic compounds including dye compounds sen et al 2016 one of the most commonly reported fungal enzymes is laccase laccase is a copper containing oxidoreductase that uses oxygen molecules as the terminal electron acceptor to catalyze various organic reactions gao et al 2022a however adding free fungal organisms to wastewater often clogs pipelines and limits reusability more et al 2010 another approach involving fungal enzyme extracts in pollutant degradation has also been limited due to production costs environmental stress e g ph and temperature and limited ability to recover the catalyst materials rodríguez couto 2009 wang et al 2019 to circumvent these concerns fermenting solid substrates with live fungi has been proposed to produce effective and green biocatalysts reported solid substrates include rice hull li and jia 2008 sawdust przystaś et al 2018 and other materials for example luffa cylindrica a natural biomass material was utilized to support stropharia sp itcc 8422 which in turn was able to degrade and detoxify anthraquinone violet r agrawal and verma 2019 solid substrate grown fungi offer many advantages including high abundance low cost ease of operation and resilience the inoculation process is simple and requires only one step incubating the fungi and the substrate materials together in addition the rich and diverse nutrients in these solid substrates support fungal growth providing sustained enzyme release during experiments technically it is an immobilization process that enhances the biocatalysts stability making them less susceptible to environmental stresses the solid associated fungal biomass is also easy to separate from the reaction medium allowing easy replacement furthermore these natural materials can be sourced locally and from naturally grown plants making them more sustainable and environmentally friendly than other supports collectively fungi grown on natural solid substrates offer multiple advantages as biocatalysts wang et al 2019 zahmatkesh et al 2018 making them good candidates for degrading dye compounds the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient and green biocatalyst system based on solid substrate immobilized fungi and investigate its performance in treating individual dye compounds synthetic textile wastewater stww and a sample of real textile wastewater rtww effluent to further evaluate the biocatalyst performance degradation products were identified enzyme stability under a range of temperatures and ph was examined and reusability in sequential batch experiments was assessed 2 results and discussion 2 1 characterization of pleurotus ostreatus grown on different substrates among the laccase activities of p ostreatus grown on sorghum po sorg bran po bran or husk po husk measured over 75 days po sorg showed the highest laccase activity 1 60 u g on average fig 1 a on the other hand po husk showed the lowest laccase activity throughout the experiment therefore we selected po sorg and po bran to further study mycelia morphologies by scanning electron microscopy sem fig 1b the hyphae of po sorg appeared to be straight and wired to each other whereas po bran was characterized by flaky mycelia these distinct structures of p ostreatus could be due to the different nutrients in sorghum and bran in addition the healthy mycelium on sorghum suggested that the ingredients of sorghum are preferred for fungal growth furthermore as shown in fig 1b po bran was easily disintegrated making it unfavorable for practical usage more importantly po sorg maintained its structure even after a 120 day storage at room temperature superior to previously reported trametes versicolor cultivated on sorghum fig s2 zahmatkesh et al 2018 the morphology and longevity of po sorg further demonstrated that it could be a robust biocatalyst for wastewater treatment applications transcriptional analysis has been used to study molecular mechanism of biodegradation zhang et al 2021 we further profiled the transcription levels of laccase isozymes produced by po sorg along with growth fig 1c among the six identified genes coding for laccase isozymes in p ostreatus lacc3 5 7 10 11 and 12 durán sequeda et al 2022 lacc10 showed the highest average upregulation 5 25 fold within 40 days other genes showed slight upregulation or downregulation these results indicate that the dominant isozymes for po sorg are lacc10 laccases which further helped us characterize the po sorg biocatalyst 2 2 dye degradation by po sorg in laboratory buffer and stww among the four dye compounds tested reactive blue 19 rb 19 indigo carmine ic acid orange 7 ao 7 and acid red 1 ar 1 rb 19 degradation was relatively rapid decreasing to 10 1 mg l within 12 h and then leveling off as illustrated in fig 2 a laccase activity gradually increased until 12 h into the experiment when it peaked at 95 0 u l and slightly declined for the remainder of the trial ic was degraded to 3 91 mg l within 48 h and the laccase activity increased steadily to a maximum of 102 u l in 24 h fig 2b ao 7 was degraded to 4 65 mg l after 60 h with a maximum laccase activity with 279 u l at 48 h into the experiment after which it declined to 118 u l 12 h later fig 2c ar 1 was the least degraded by po sorg reaching 22 4 mg l after 60 h its laccase activity increased throughout the duration of the experiment reaching 437 u l fig 2d the killed and abiotic controls did not show observable degradation of any dyes in descending order the degradation efficiency of po sorg can be sorted as rb 19 ic ao 7 and ar 1 anthraquinone dye showed the most rapid decolorization while the azo dyes were harder to degrade and the rate of indigo dye degradation fell between these two these results are consistent with previously reported studies champagne and ramsay 2010 gao et al 2022b and can be attributed to the dye structures ao 7 and ar 1 have an azo group n n with higher bond energy and are less thermodynamically favorable for laccase as the substrate compared to the c n bond in rb 19 and ic additionally laccase activity presented distinct profiles among dyes in both azo dye groups laccase activity peaked above initial activity over time which is also reported in other studies han et al 2014 liu et al 2021 one possible reason is that products generated from azo dye degradation serve as inducers for laccase secretion these products might even be utilized for fungal growth in contrast the parent compounds or products of anthraquinone and indigo dyes play a role in fungal growth inhibition friedman et al 2020 saleem et al 2022 it is also possible that more rapid degradation of the anthraquinone and indigo dyes prevented the need for enhanced enzyme production in more complex stww samples rb 19 degradation was initially slower but still reached a similar final dye concentration of 14 1 mg l as that in the enzyme buffer with respect to ar 1 degradation was much slower in stww than in the buffer and reached a higher minimum dye concentration fig 3 a the slower degradation of ar 1 could be attributed to the other constituents of the stww such as trace metals and salts that could act as inhibitors to laccase resulting in slower catalysis champagne et al 2013 however in the rb 19 group laccase activity did not show apparent inhibition this is likely due to rb 19 and formed products association with components in stww which lowered any inhibitory effects it was supported by different or unidentified bisphenol a degradation products in real tertiary treated wastewater ozyildiz et al 2019 these results demonstrate that po sorg can effectively degrade various commonly used dye classes even in complex matrices which justifies further exploration of its applications in actual dye containing industrial wastewaters 2 3 degradation and detoxification of rtww by po sorg as illustrated in fig 3b po sorg was tested in a rtww sample to assess its degradation potential under realistic textile wastewater matrices multiple uv vis spectra 200 800 nm were collected over a 72 h period the peak maximum at 520 nm showed no change during the first 24 h but rapidly decreased thereafter this result may have occurred as during the first 24 h po sorg expressed lower laccase activity while acclimating to complex components of rtww resulting in minimal dye degradation however after 24 h inhibiting components might have reacted so the degradation rate increased the toxicity of rtww to escherichia coli was also reduced 2 fold after a 72 h treatment by po sorg fig s3 these results indicate that po sorg can be applied to treatment of dye effluents under non sterile conditions within a reasonable timeframe and that it can reduce the whole effluent toxicity of industrial dye wastewater 2 4 biodegradation products of dye degradation we confirmed several degradation products of rb 19 that could be generated by a previously proposed pathway dauda and erkurt 2020 osma et al 2010 and also identified new products phthalic acid c8h6o4 and c6h6so4 after ring opening reactions fig 4 a we also identified the formation of possible products by another pathway pathway 2 in fig 4a via generating an aniline group at another c n bond during ar 1 degradation pathway 1 fig 4b the hydroxyl group was converted to a phenoxy radical and sequentially oxidized to a ketone group and carbonium ion water then showed a nucleophilic attack followed by c n bond cleavage further we propose another asymmetrical oxidation pathway 3 owing to observing potential products a similar mechanism pathway 3 was reported for methyl orange fungal laccase degradation telke et al 2010 we also identified products that might be formed by azo group reduction pathway 2 probably due to fungal reductase al tohamy et al 2020 goud et al 2020 mani et al 2019 another azo dye ao 7 shares similar mechanisms as ar 1 degradation and have three possible pathways fig s4 among them pathway 1 was previously confirmed ali et al 2021 chivukula and renganathan 1995 wang et al 2014 zille et al 2005 and products generated by we also proposed degradation pathways for ic which are shown in fig s5 in addition we examined preliminary product profiles esi of rtww degradation illustrated in fig s6 which showed the disappearance of initial compounds and the appearance of new compounds within 48 or 60 h e g esi m z 144 08 295 23 and 337 23 esi m z 207 01 313 24 and 329 23 future research should focus on the identification of these compounds in rtww 2 5 stability and reusability of po sorg the temperature and ph of textile wastewater can vary greatly even within a single factory the stability of a biocatalyst to resist these fluctuations is directly related to the treatment performance as illustrated in fig 5 a even when the temperature was increased to 70 c after 12 h po sorg still achieved around 58 removal efficiency demonstrating its high stability towards thermal stress however when the ph was increased to 10 the dye removal efficiency greatly decreased these results indicate that po sorg performs poorly in highly basic media consistent with the reported favorable acidic ph range of p ostreatus laccase vinoth et al 2022 we hypothesize that the added stability of po sorg is due to the protection afforded by its attachment to the solid sorghum surface there is a possibility that laccase secreted by p ostreatus also is immobilized on the surface which results in enhanced thermal and ph stability from an enconomic and environmental perspective the reusability of a biocatalyst is a crucial factor for practical application to wastewater treatment zdarta et al 2022 as illustrated in fig 5b effective dye degradation was observed over three successive catalyst uses there was no degradation observed in the control groups fig s7 after three cycles po sorg still degraded rb 19 from 51 mg l to 15 mg l after 72 h moreover by using nylon mesh bags po sorg was easily removed from the test solutions after each cycle demonstrating its excellent operational potential however additional time was needed after each cycle to achieve maximum degradation this could be ascribed to a decrease in laccase activity from 105 u l to 20 u l because the rate of laccase synthesis was slower than the replacement of the dye solution therefore po sorg required a regrowth period between each round after 1 day of recovering at 30 c po sorg could be used for up to six rounds fig s8 overall these results demonstrate the potential of po sorg as a robust biocatalyst for treating dye wastewater 3 conclusions an effective biocatalyst system consisting of fungi inoculated on solid sorghum po sorg was developed and demonstrated treatment of dye containing wastewater po sorg showed prolonged laccase production and robust structure making it practical for dye treatment four representative dye compounds in deionized water as well as synthetic and real wastewater solutions were successfully degraded by po sorg to less toxic substances the biocatalyst material performed well under temperature and ph variations typical of actual textile effluents and was shown to be reused for three successive cycles with minimal loss in degradation efficiency overall our findings demonstrate the sustainability of the po sorg material and its potential as a practical and robust biocatalyst for treating textile wastewater streams further studies on process scale up and testing are needed to assess this system s utility for various commercial applications 4 materials and methods 4 1 microorganisms and chemicals p ostreatus taxid 5322 was isolated from the fungal culture purchased from root mushroom farm bob s red mill sorghum jiva organic whole psyllium husk and bob s red mill wheat bran were used for fungal growth the rtww was obtained from an active textile factory in vernon california dye compounds rb 19 ic ao 7 and ar 1 were obtained from sigma aldrich other chemicals were purchased from thermo fisher scientific 4 2 preparation of solid substrate grown fungi p ostreatus was cultivated on yeast extract peptone dextrose ypd agar plates for 6 days at 30 c until the entire plate was fully colonized to prepare each bioreactor 20 g of sorghum bran or husk was added to a 250 ml polypropylene erlenmeyer flask and autoclaved in an aseptic environment six p ostreatus mycelium agar plugs 1 cm 1 cm collected from the ypd plates and 8 ml of liquid tisma medium tišma et al 2011 were added to each flask to initiate growth and maintain appropriate humidity level next a sterile cotton ball was wrapped in an ethanol sterilized kimwipe to plug the top of the reactor each bioreactor containing po sorg po bran or po husk was placed in a stationary incubator at 30 c the bioreactors were mixed by gentle swirling every 3 days to ensure homogenization 4 3 laccase activity of solid substrate grown fungi laccase activity was evaluated by measuring the absorbance change at 420 nm as 2 mm 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts was oxidized in a cuvette 10 μl of enzyme extract was combined with 490 μl of 2 mm abts in sodium phosphate buffer the activity was determined by observing the absorbance change every 2 s for 2 min ε 36 000 l mol cm on nanodrop 2000 the activity in the supernatant u l was first calculated using a previously reported equation lothe et al 2020 next the activity was converted to units per gram of fungi grown on solid substrates f ss u g based on the following equation 1 acti vity u g f ss acti vity u ml 4 5 ml of di water 0 5 g of f ss 4 4 characterization of solid substrate grown fungal systems laccase activity was quantified frequently over the incubation time before sampling the po sorg was well mixed to homogenize the material subsequently 0 5 g of the colonized sorghum was added to a falcon tube along with 5 ml of sterile deionized water the falcon tube was inverted 5 times to mix the contents and then incubated at 30 c for 15 min the supernatant was then collected for laccase activity measurement gao et al 2022b small fungal mycelia were collected after 20 days from all media using a previously reported method soh et al 2021 except that the drying period was 6 h 48 c samples were sputter coated with pt for sem imaging genes coding for laccase isozymes were amplified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr using the method described in the si details in s1 to examine the expression of laccase isozymes from po sorg forward and reverse primers are listed in table s1 the schematic of po sorg production and characterization is shown in fig s1 4 5 dye degradation in buffer four different dye compounds rb 19 ic ao 7 and ar 1 were selected to represent the common dye categories of anthraquinone rb 19 indigo ic and azo dyes ao 7 and ar 1 live experimental groups were prepared in 250 ml polypropylene erlenmeyer flasks each consisted of pre grown po sorg and 50 ml of a 50 mg l dye solution dissolved in a ph 5 na po4 buffer the enzyme activity in units per gram of po sorg u g was measured before the experiment subsequently a calculated amount of po sorg details in s2 was added to reach 100 u l of the initial laccase activity an abiotic control contained dye buffer and uncolonized sorghum a killed control solution contained dye and autoclaved po sorg to distinguish dye sorption from degradation all solutions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate at each sampling event 500 μl was taken from each flask the dye concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the sample at the maximum absorbance wavelength table s2 and laccase activity was also measured the effects of temperature and ph on dye degradation in buffered solutions were also examined details in s3 in the ranges reported for textile wastewaters yaseen and scholz 2019 the reusability of po sorg was tested in the buffer by using the same set of po sorg materials in consecutive dye degradation trials po sorg was placed in sterile nylon tea bags for confinement and used in the next round the first degradation round ceased when the dye concentrations remained unchanged after 12 h the degraded dye solutions were removed from the live and control flasks and replaced with a fresh 50 ml rb 19 solution 50 mg l to begin subsequent rounds 4 6 dye degradation in stww and rtww the stww was prepared according to a previously reported composition details in s4 yaseen and scholz 2019 rb 19 and ar 1 were dissolved in stww and degraded by po sorg following the same conditions described above since the rtww matrix was too concentrated to obtain uv vis spectra it was diluted 5 fold using non sterile tap water po sorg with an initial laccase activity of 500 u l was added to 50 ml of the diluted rtww under non sterile conditions spectra were collected over a wavelength range from 200 to 700 nm using a uv vis spectrometer lambda 365 perkin elmer whole effluent toxicity of rtww before and after po sorg treatment was measured in terms of atp content of e coli using reported method gao et al 2022b 4 7 analysis of degradation products for rb 19 and ao 7 groups five 2 ml samples were collected at different time stamps 6 12 24 48 and 60 h the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 98 sulfuric acid and the samples were incubated for 30 min then 2 ml of ethyl acetate was added to the extract products and the sample was vacuum concentrated into crystal which was in turn dissolved in 100 μl of methanol for the ic ar 1 and rtww groups 2 ml of the solution was subjected to solid phase extraction wang et al 2019b and concentrated in 100 μl of methanol concentrated samples were analyzed using
