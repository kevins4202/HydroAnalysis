17435,in this work a novel metal free black red phosphorus brp was prepared from red phosphorus rp and applied in fe2 peroxymonosulfate pms process compared with that of rp the contaminant degradation performance of brp was significantly elevated due to the enhanced electron transfer from brp to fe3 this enhancement was mainly induced by size decrease effect the removal of oxidation layer and the partial phase conversion moreoevr brp avoided the radical quenching reaction caused by reductant itself whereas it was inevitable using homogeneous reductant like hydroxylamine more importantly the system had a superior recyclability and strong resistance to natural water though concurrent side reaction between pms and brp occured multiple pms dosage could remarkedly alleviated the side reaction thus elevating pms utilization efficiency the dominant brp oxidation products included phosphite and phosphate interestingly moderate increase of fe3 concentration could efficiently reduce the by product formation via the prompt pms activation by regenerated fe2 our work clarified the acceleration mechanism of fe3 fe2 cycle by brp and proposed the control strategy of by prodoct formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords black red phosphorus peroxymonosulfate fe3 fe2 cycle mechanism 1 introduction fe2 activated h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds advanced oxidation processes eqs 1 3 pignatello et al 2006 xiao et al 2020 have been intensively investigated for decades of years due to their high oxidation capacity and low environmental toxicity anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rastogi et al 2009 however the rate limiting regeneration of fe2 from fe3 heavily hampers the successive activation of these peroxides which is generally considered as the achille s heels in fe based peroxide activation reactions pignatello et al 2006 besides excessive fe2 dosage might also result in secondary iron sludge pollution zhang et al 2019a therefore accelerating fe3 fe2 cycle has become one of the most intractable issues for their application to date many efforts have been made to overcome this bottleneck like the introduction of electric field brillas et al 2009 uv vis light andreozzi et al 2006 wang et al 2007 and reducing agents fukuchi et al 2014 xing et al 2018 especially the introduction of reducing agents like homogeneous hydroxylamine li et al 2019 and cysteine li et al 2016 as well as heterogeneous metal sulfides liu et al 2018a has been broadly studied due to their strong reducibility and operating simplicity nevertheless some intrinsic drawbacks are still hard to overcome like the toxicity and non recyclability of hydroxylamine the extra total organic carbon of cysteine and the secondary pollution of heavy metal dissolution 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h k 76 m 1 s 1 2 f e 2 hso 5 f e 3 so 4 o h k 3 10 4 m 1 s 1 3 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 k 3 10 1 m 1 s 1 compared with the metal bearing reductants non metallic element like boron carbon sulfur and phosphorus and their oxyacid anions are usually possessed with lower toxicity the final oxidation products like carbonate sulfate and phosphate are also ubiquitous in the natural matrix moreover previous studies have also pointed out the excellent physicochemical properties of these non metallic elements for instance in environmental remediation non metallic elements have been previously investigated such as organic adsorption by multi wall carbon nanotube mwcnt apul and karanfil 2015 and photocatalytic bacteria inactivation by red phosphorus rp xia et al 2015 recently duan et al 2019 also found that non metallic boron and black phosphorus bp could directly activate pms to produce hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 indicating the strong electron donating ability of these non metallic elements however the direct activation performance seemed inferior and the recyclability was unsatisfactory similarly in our previous work we also found that mos2 could directly activate pms and pds but the re utilization efficiency gradually declined after several runs zhou et al 2020 of note it was reported that the addition of fe3 in mos2 pms sheng et al 2019 mos2 pds he et al 2020 and mos2 h2o2 xing et al 2018 systems could significantly promote the decomposition of peroxides and accelerate target contaminant degradation inspired by these facts we expect that the combination of electron rich non metallic elements fe3 and different peroxides could also boost radical generation and expedite contaminant degradation herein in this work we first studied the potential of different non metallic elements i e amorphous boron mwcnt rp silica sulfur and selenium in promoting fe3 fe2 cycle for pms activation carbamazepine cbz was selected as the target contaminant due to its potential threat to aquatic lives soufan et al 2013 then we dominantly investigate the performance of rp due to its moderate performance and low cost furthermore we modified rp into hydrothermal red phosphorus hrp and black red phosphorus brp to enhance its reducibility the performance of hrp and brp was evaluated and the crucial factors that enhanced the reducibility of pristine rp were discerned the practical application performance in actual water and influence of water parameters like ph and dissolved o2 were also investigated besides the reaction kinetics and the effects of multiple dosage modes on cbz degradation were in detail discussed moreover the generation and transformation of intermediate phosphorus anions were monitored and the chemisorption of pms was simulated via density functional theory dft calculation based on experimental and theoretical results the reaction mechanism among fe3 pms and brp was elucidated finally the control strategies of phosphorus by product generation were also proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the details of materials were listed in text s1 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 brp synthesis brp was synthesized using an ethylenediamine eda method liu et al 2019 first 1 5 g commercial rp and 60 ml deionized water were added in 100 ml stainless teflon lined autoclave and sealed at 200 c for 12 h to obtain hrp then the hrp was washed with deionized water and ethanol 3 times respectively and dried at 50 c in vacuum overnight next 1 0 g hrp and 60 ml eda were simultaneously added into 100 ml stainless teflon lined autoclave and sealed at 140 c for 12 h after cooling down the black products were washed with deoxygenated water and ethanol 3 times respectively and then dried at 50 c in vacuum overnight the obtained powder was thoroughly ground and then sifted through a 200 mesh sieve 2 2 2 degradation

through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter discs for the analysis of residual contaminant concentration for cr vi removal experiment the experimental prodedures were similar to the above except that no fe3 and etoh were added and the sample volume was 3 ml 2 3 characterization the morphologies of rp hrp and brp were investigated using scanning electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi japan transmission

different non metallic elements for fe3 reduction to evaluate the feasibility of various non metallic elements in promoting fe3 fe2 cycle we selected six typical elemental materials including amorphous boron hydroxyl modified mwcnt mwcnt oh silica powder rp sublimed sulfur and selenium and introduced them in fe2 pms or fe3 pms system for cbz degradation as shown in fig 1 only 31 3 and 5 58 cbz could be degraded in 60 min by fe2 pms system and fe3 pms system respectively however with the addition of amorphous boron and rp the cbz degradation efficiency significantly increased to 100 and 83 2 even in fe3 pms system in comparison silica powder sublimed sulfur and selenium powder were all ineffective for enhancing cbz degradation mwcnt oh had a superior adsorption ability towards cbz 43 4 while the addition of pms and fe3 20 81 in turn inhibited cbz removal besdies to exclude the influence of functional groups unfunctionalized mwcnt and carboxyl modified mwcnt mwcnt cooh were also compared and the results showed that none of them were effective for cbz degradation fig s1 this demonstrated that direct fe3 reduction by mwcnt was unfavorable although it was not consistent with the results of seo et al 2015 where mwcnt could directly reduce fe3 the reductant dosage in their work was far more than that in this work fig s2 also depicted that in the absence of pms amorphous boron and rp could reduce 91 5 and 28 fe3 in 60 min respectively whereas marginal fe2 was generated by other non metallic elemental materials this further demonstrated the superior roles of amorphous boron and rp in pms activation given the earth abundant and cost effective properties tian et al 2018 xia et al 2015 rp was then selected and investigated in our work to confirm its efficiency rp was also introduced into fe3 h2o2 and fe3 pds systems fig s3 60 5 and 43 7 cbz could be degraded in 60 min respectively suggesting the efficiency followed the order of pms h2o2 pds this order could be mainly ascribed to the different reaction rates between fe2 and the three peroxides eqs 1 3 since the initial fe2 concentration generated by rp in three systems was similar we further replaced fe3 with different metal ions cu2 ag ce3 mn2 ni2 to investigate the role of fe3 fig s4 the degradation of cbz was drastically enhanced in the presence of cu2 83 5 which could be due to the generation of reactive cu lee et al 2016 however other metal ions were relatively inert to cbz degradation suggesting the generation of low valence metal ions was an essential step in promoting peroxide activation 3 2 characterization of rp hrp and brp to further enhance the reducibility of pristine rp a facile two step modification method was conducted to prepare hrp and brp respectively liu et al 2019 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy results showed that the pristine rp was mainly comprised of p with a part of o which might derive from the surface oxidation layer fig s5 as shown in fig 2 a c after the hydrothermal treatment the bulk rp was split into substantial fragments and the size of pristine rp decreased from 100 μm to around 5 μm accordingly the bet surface area appreciably increased from 0 1 m2 g to 40 2 m2 g which would facilitate its interaction with fe3 subsequently the eda modification further transformed the fragments into flower like spheres with some rodlike sheets sticking out the tem images of brp clearly displayed an overlapped sheet structure fig 2d the bet surface area slightly declined to 16 4 m2 g possibly due to this overlapped structure from the hrtem images it could be observed that brp was composed of both amorphous phase and crystalline phase fig s6 the lattice fringes corresponded to the 0 2 0 lattice plane of bp which confirmed the partial phase transformation after eda modification the digital graph also showed that the color of rp turned bright red and further black after the two modification steps fig s7 moreover compared with pristine rp and hrp three obvious peaks emerged at 2θ 17 3 27 4 and 57 4 in the xrd patterns of brp fig 3 a which could be assigned to 0 2 0 0 2 1 and 1 5 1 planes of bp antonatos et al 2020 shen et al 2015 similarly raman spectra also confirmed the partial conversion from rp phase to bp phase fig 3b for pristine rp the raman band at 346 and 393 cm 1 could be assigned to the fundamental mode b1 and symmetric stretch mode a1 of rp respectively hrp exhibited no new band compared with pristine rp however for brp apart from the bands of rp three characteristic bands appeared at 362 444 and 467 cm 1 which could be attributed to the ag 1 out of plane mode b2g and ag 2 in plane mode of bp batmunkh et al 2019 xps was also acquired to probe the modification induced surface chemical state conversion from fig 3c it could be observed that n 1s peak appeared in brp which was induced by the eda treatment nevertheless fig s8 revealed that the addition of eda could not accelerate cbz degradation and fe3 reduction in fe3 pms system which excluded the involvement of eda in the reaction fig 3d further exhibited the p 2p core level spectra for pristine rp a broad peak at 134 5 ev indicated the partial surface coverage by a p2o5 oxidation layer which was unfavorable for the electron transfer from rp to fe3 tian et al 2018 after the hydrothermal process the oxidation peak completely disappeared suggesting the surface p2o5 dissolution the surfacial atomic ratios of o to p from xps results were listed in table s2 the results also demonstrated that after the hydrothermal process the oxygen content obviously decreased from 1 05 to 0 49 furthermore a weak oxidation peak of o p o appeared at 133 0 ev in brp this could be ascribed to the partial re oxidation of reactive brp during the preparation process ft ir results showed no obvious change after the modification processes fig 3e moreover no characteristic peaks of eda like c n bond 1065 cm 1 and n h 1608 cm 1 appeared after eda treatment krishnan and plane 1966 corroborating the minor eda amount in brp 3 3 enhanced cbz degradation performance cbz degradation experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of pristine rp hrp and brp as shown in fig 4 a all of them showed a weak direct activation ability towards pms though fe2 pms alone could degrade 24 8 cbz this reaction almost terminated within 30 s besides this two stage kinetic bottleneck could not be mitigated even with higher fe2 or pms dosage fig s9 however after the addition of rp hrp and brp the two stage kinetic bottleneck was greatly mitigated specifically compared with the incomplete cbz degradation by pristine rp 100 cbz degradation could be observed in 7 5 min by hrp this confirmed that the size decrease effect and the removal of surface oxidation layer could greatly elevate the reducibility of rp moreover complete cbz depletion was observed even within 5 min using brp to exclude the influence of specific surface area the bet normalized k obs was calculated and it increased from 0 01 g min 1 m 2 of hrp to 0 06 g min 1 m 2 of brp table s3 this implied that apart from size decrease effect and oxidation layer removal the role of partial phase conversion was also crucial in accelerating the electron transfer to regenerate fe2 according to the quenching experiments fig s10 sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh were identified as the reactive species in the system so4 played a dominant role since the quenching effect of ethanol was more significant than that of tert butyl alcohol zhou et al 2020 epr results further demonstrated that the radical generation was most boosted in the order of brp hrp and pristine rp fig 4b the detected cbz degradation intermediates and the possible degradation pathways were similar to other so4 dominated systems more details in text s4 table s4 and fig s11 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 acridone acon m z 196 0755 was also the detected final products of cbz to investigate whether acon which is hard to be completely degraded through conventional treatment process kosjek et al 2009 would accumulate in this system the degradation of acon was also conducted fig s12 the results showed that though a little slower than cbz acon would be still degraded in fe3 pms brp system manifesting the minor accumulation of this hazardous intermediate to compare the intrinsic reducibility of rp hrp and brp we first monitored the concentration of fe2 and residual pms obviously rp hrp and brp could directly reduce 0 18 mg l 1 24 mg l and 1 57 mg l fe3 in 20 min respectively fig 5 a besides these materials could not adsorb fe2 suggesting the generated fe2 would not accumulate on the surfaces of these materials fig s13 in the presence of pms the fe2 concentration remained low within 15 min due to the fast reaction between regenerated fe2 and pms after 15 min it gradually rebounded owing to the depletion of pms this phenomenon was also consistent with previous studies using zero valent metal or metal sulfides as the reductants sheng et al 2019 yi et al 2019 the time profiles of pms decomposition showed that 31 2 and 62 3 pms could be directly consumed by hrp and brp in 20 min due to their strong reducibility fig 5b with the addition of fe3 pms consumption rate accelerated and most of the pms could be depleted in 15 min this implied that the addition of fe3 could promote the electron transfer from brp to fe3 and further to pms besdies the enhanced electron transfer efficiency could be also reflected by the nyquist plots and tafel scans fig 5c and d the arc sizes of hrp and brp were smaller than rp indicating the higher electron conductivity of hrp and brp than that of rp lim et al 2019 of note the arc size of brp in high frequency region was greater than that of hrp which might be ascribed to the partial re oxidation of brp as shown in xps spectra fig 3d however despite a lower electron conductivity than hrp the corrosion currents of rp hrp and brp calculated from the tafel slope were 3 17 10 8 5 04 10 8 and 1 05 10 7 a respectively the higher corrosion current of brp suggested that brp was more liable to be corroded and donate electrons to oxidants during a redox reaction which might be ascribed to the presence of more reactive bp phase 3 4 stability and broad applicability to study the stability of brp after the reaction the reacted brp was then characterized from the sem image the brp surface was corroded due to the oxidation by fe3 and pms fig s14 it could be also observed from the xrd pattern that the peak intensity declined after the reaction fig s15a raman spectrum showed that the characteristic band of bp still existed whereas the oxidation degree of brp increased as the ratio of ag 1 to ag 2 declined from 1 56 to 0 94 fig s15b favron et al 2015 p 2p core level spectra confirmed the surface oxidation of brp as well since the peak intensity of o p o at 133 0 ev decreased while the peak of p2o5 at 134 4 ev emerged again fig s16 the atomic ratio of o to p also slightly increased to 0 57 after the reaction however the cyclic performance and fe3 reduction ability did not decline severely fig 6 a and fig s17 even after five successive experiments 100 cbz could be still degraded this suggested that the slight re oxidation would not severely decrease the reactivity of brp furthermore to investigate its applicability in various conditions the influence of ph dissolved o2 and actual water was discussed first this system had a strong resistance to initial ph 3 6 1 due to the release of h from pms fig s18 however when buffered with acetic acid the optimal ph was less than 5 this was because the increase of buffer ph would result in the hydrolysis of fe3 which would be unfavorable for both the reduction of fe3 and the activation of pms moreover dissolved o2 only showed a slight impact on cbz degradation revealing that this system was not sensitive to dissolved o2 fig 6b more importantly even in some actual water samples like tap water funan river jingcheng lake and yangtze river 100 cbz could be removed in 10 min which exhibited its strong resistance to water matrix table s5 and fig 6c besides the superior efficiency could be also reflected from the fast degradation of 9 typical contaminants including atrazine levofloxacin bisphenol s p nitrophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol benzoic acid bezafibrate iohexol and diphenhydramine fig s19 furthermore to confirm the broad applicability of brp the activation of h2o2 and pds was also conducted fig s20 82 8 and 64 5 cbz could be also effectively degraded with h2o2 and pds respectively which suggested the universality of brp in catalytic organic oxidation finally apart from orgaic degradation brp could be also applied in high valent metal like cr vi reduction specifically 86 3 cr vi could be efficiently removed by 0 4 g l brp in 30 min which indicated its strong reducibility fig 6d 3 5 the influence of reagent dosage and the mitigation of competition reaction to figure out the primary factors that determine the overall reaction kinetics the influence of brp dosage fe2 dosage pms dosage and initial cbz concentration was studied and analyzed in detail in text s5 fig s21 and fig s22 from the analysis results the influence of brp dosage fe2 dosage and initial cbz concentration on the degradation efficiency and the corresponding k obs was primary whereas the influence of pms dosage was minor according to fig 5a the transient fe2 concentration during 15 min was low therefore the initial pms dosage was relatively excessive compared with fe2 concentration even with a high pms dosage the reaction rate would not obviously increase besides the excessive pms present in the system would be also ineffectively consumed by reductive brp without cbz degradation fig 5b herein to alleviate this competition reaction multiple dosage was conducted since multiple dosage could avoid the unnecessary interaction between brp and pms a higher cbz concentration was used to evaluate the overall pms utilization efficiency besdies the total pms and brp dosages were kept constant to compare the final cbz degradation efficiency as shown in fig 7 a the degradation efficiency after 30 min increased from 64 8 to 78 4 and 80 7 with twice and four time pms dosage respectively this confirmed that multiple pms dosage could actually alleviate the side reaction between pms and brp and reduce pms consumption thus promoting more radical generation conversely multiple brp dosage hampered cbz degradation fig 7b though multiple brp dosage could also alleviate the side reaction the reduction of fe3 by brp was also slowed down herein multiple brp dosage was unfavourable for the overall cbz degradation efficiency to comprehend the behavior of brp thoroughly the influence of multiple dosage on the performance of two benchmark reductants based on substantial previous works table s6 i e homogeneous nh2oh and heterogeneous mos2 was also investigated from fig 7c and e multiple pms dosage was less effective for mos2 and nh2oh this could be ascribed to their relatively slow direct reaction with pms which would not cause prompt pms consumption sheng et al 2019 zou et al 2013 similar to brp multiple mos2 and nh2oh dosage could not promote cbz degradation either which was due to the slower fe3 reduction rate fig 7d and f li et al 2020 the intrinsic reducibility of nh2oh mos2 and brp was also compared via fe2 generation amount fig s23 the result showed that homogeneous nh2oh quickly reduced fe3 within 1 min whereas heterogeneous brp and mos2 gradually generated fe2 though the fe3 reduction reaction by nh2oh proceeded promptly the final cbz degradation efficiency was only 50 no matter which dosage mode was conducted this indicated that the quenching effects between nh2oh and radicals in homogeneous solution were inevitable zou et al 2013 however the final cbz degradation efficiencies were 64 8 and 69 1 for brp and mos2 respectively this suggested the superiority of heterogeneous reductants in avoiding radical quenching by reductants themselves although the side reaction would hamper the performance of brp compared with mos2 multiple brp dosage could significantly alleviate the side reaction and promote cbz degradation to 80 7 thus with less radical quenching than hydroxylamine and stronger reducibility than mos2 brp exhibited a great potential as fe3 reductant in pms activation 3 6 phosphorus by product formation and corresponding control strategy as a reductant brp would proceed self transformation and generate various phosphorus by products such as hypophosphite 1 phosphite 3 phosphate 5 and pyrophosphate 5 zhang et al 2019c to control the phosphorus by product formation it was of vital importance to get insights into their formation mechanism thus we utilized ion chromatography to investigate by product formation under various conditions fig s24 depicted the time profiles of different phosphorus by product formation in fe3 pms brp system obviously phosphite and phosphate were the primary phosphorus intermediates while hypophosphite and pyrophosphate only accounted for a small proportion fig 8 a further depicted the oxidation of brp by fe3 alone with the increase of fe3 dosage the phosphite and phosphate concentration gradually ascended to 27 μm and 13 5 μm respectively although hypophosphite and phosphite were reported to be moderate reductants feng et al 2018 they could not reduce fe3 and accelerate cbz degradation under our experimental conditions fig s25 herein the reduction of fe3 was primarily a surface reaction compared with fe3 the contribution of pms to p by product generation was more remarkable fig 8b the concentration of phosphite and phosphate significantly ascended to 68 μm and 44 8 μm while hypophosphite and pyrophosphate gradually ascended to 12 6 μm and 9 4 μm as pms dosage increased to 0 8 mm of note though hypophosphite could be partially oxidized to phosphite by pms alone through an oxygen transfer reaction dubey et al 2002 phosphite was less oxidized to phosphate by pms alone fig s26 therefore the formation of phosphorus products dominantly derived from the surface brp oxidation by pms given the minor cbz degradation efficiency in pms brp alone system fig 4a the one electron transfer pathway of pms generating radicals could be excluded gábor et al 2009 based on the above facts a plausible reaction mechanism could be proposed that pms mainly oxidized brp through a two electron transfer pathway without radcial generation specifically pms could first oxidize brp through a two electron reaction with minor surface p 0 disproportionating into hypophosphite 1 and phophite 3 then the residual surface p would be further oxidized through another two electron transfer reaction and disproportionate into phosphite 3 and phosphate 5 or pyrophosphate incidentally the concentration of phosphite approximately equalled the sum of the concentration of hypophosphite phosphate and pyrophosphate which also substantiated this mechanism eq 6 fig s27 6 p phosphite 3 p hypophosphite 1 p phosphate 5 p pyrophosphate 5 moreover the reaction between brp and pms was also simulated via dft calculation given that the structure of amorphous rp is still under dispute zhang et al 2019b the calculation model was established using the bp phase to investigate their interaction preliminarily from fig 9 it could be found that pms was mainly adsorbed at the h site above the p6 hexagon of bp surface kulish et al 2015 the adsorption energy was calculated as 1 18 ev implying the reaction between brp and pms could proceed spontaneously the charge density difference illustrated an obvious charge accumulation in pms and charge depletion in bp fig s28 besides the o o bond length also increased from 1 347 å to 1 473 å suggesting the cleavage tendency of o o bond overall strong electron transfer would occur between brp and pms which might lead to the unnecessary consumption of pms furthermore the influence of fe3 on brp oxidation in the presence of pms and the influence of pms on brp oxidation in the presence of fe3 were studied in fig 8c the phosphite phosphate and total p concentration first ascended a little at small fe3 dosage but then gradually descended at higher fe3 dosage the initial minor increase could be ascribed to the faster and more pms decomposition compared with no fe3 addition fig 5b then as the fe3 concentration increased more fe2 could be generated which could effectively utilize pms and thus inhibit the undesirable side reaction between brp and pms of note the oxidation of brp by so4 and oh should be marginal since the p intermediate generation decreased when more radicals were generated with more fe3 dosage in contrast increasing the pms concentration with a fixed amount of fe3 even resulted in more p oxidation product generation than pms alone fig 8d this could be also ascribed to the faster and more pms decomposition in the presence of fe3 all these confirmed that adequate fe2 formation was conducive to mitigating p by product formation and elevating pms utilization efficiency moreover the influence of these p oxidation products on cbz degradation efficiency was further studied fig s29 the four p oxidation products were disadvantageous to the cbz degradation and the degradation efficiency declined in the order of phosphite hypophosphite phosphate and pyrophosphate the secondary reaction rate constants k of so4 and oh with these anions pms and cbz were listed in table s7 and the corresponding ck values were calculated table s8 although the ck value of oh with cbz is lower than those with hypophosphite and phosphite the ck values of so4 with cbz is comparable to those with hypophosphite and phosphite thus in view of the more so4 generation in this system the influence of hypophosphite and phosphite on cbz degradation should be minor as for phosphate and pyrophosphate despite the lower ck values they could otherwise complex with fe3 and thus retard fe3 reduction nevertheless given the small amount of these anions the actual inhibition effects were marginal finally according to the above discussion all the reactions in fe3 pms brp system were illustrated in scheme 1 obviously the competition reaction between pms and brp mainly contributed to phosphorus by product formation therefore an appropriate initial fe3 concentration and a multiple pms dosage might be essential to inhibit phosphorus by product generation and promote target contaminant degradation however despite these strategies a part of phosphite and phosphate could still remain in the effluent phosphate could be removed via precipitation process while phosphite might require an extra step to remove to efficiently solve this problem and reduce the treatment costs some newly emerging techniques like capacitive deionization could be investigated in the future nevertheless compared with other oxidation system using polyphosphate as the ligand kim et al 2015 zong et al 2020 or cuxp as the reagents kim et al 2019 the phosphorus generation stress in this system was minor suggesting its great potential in organic oxidation 4 conclusion in this work we developed a metal free heterogenenous reductant to accelerate fe3 fe2 cycle for pms activation we found that after two step modification the obtained brp possessed a greater bet surface area with a less oxidation layer and partially converted to bp phase all these aspects contributed to the enhanced electron transfer capacity from brp to fe3 besides brp exhibited an excellent recyclability and strong resistance to dissolved oxygen and water matrix as a heterogeneous reductant brp avoided the quenching reaction with radicals which was inevitable when using homogeneous reductants though undesirable competition reaction between pms and brp would occur multiple pms dosage could remarkedly alleviate the competetion reaction and elevate pms utilization efficiency the dominant brp oxidation products included phosphite and phosphate which mainly derived from the surface two electron reaction between pms and brp interestingly moderate increase of fe3 dosage could efficiently reduce by product generation via the prompt pms activation by regenerated fe2 hence with a comparable efficiency for promoting fe3 fe2 cycle the emergence of metal free and environment benign brp could avoid the use of heavy metal bearing materials or toxic hydroxylamine we

17435,in this work a novel metal free black red phosphorus brp was prepared from red phosphorus rp and applied in fe2 peroxymonosulfate pms process compared with that of rp the contaminant degradation performance of brp was significantly elevated due to the enhanced electron transfer from brp to fe3 this enhancement was mainly induced by size decrease effect the removal of oxidation layer and the partial phase conversion moreoevr brp avoided the radical quenching reaction caused by reductant itself whereas it was inevitable using homogeneous reductant like hydroxylamine more importantly the system had a superior recyclability and strong resistance to natural water though concurrent side reaction between pms and brp occured multiple pms dosage could remarkedly alleviated the side reaction thus elevating pms utilization efficiency the dominant brp oxidation products included phosphite and phosphate interestingly moderate increase of fe3 concentration could efficiently reduce the by product formation via the prompt pms activation by regenerated fe2 our work clarified the acceleration mechanism of fe3 fe2 cycle by brp and proposed the control strategy of by prodoct formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords black red phosphorus peroxymonosulfate fe3 fe2 cycle mechanism 1 introduction fe2 activated h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds advanced oxidation processes eqs 1 3 pignatello et al 2006 xiao et al 2020 have been intensively investigated for decades of years due to their high oxidation capacity and low environmental toxicity anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rastogi et al 2009 however the rate limiting regeneration of fe2 from fe3 heavily hampers the successive activation of these peroxides which is generally considered as the achille s heels in fe based peroxide activation reactions pignatello et al 2006 besides excessive fe2 dosage might also result in secondary iron sludge pollution zhang et al 2019a therefore accelerating fe3 fe2 cycle has become one of the most intractable issues for their application to date many efforts have been made to overcome this bottleneck like the introduction of electric field brillas et al 2009 uv vis light andreozzi et al 2006 wang et al 2007 and reducing agents fukuchi et al 2014 xing et al 2018 especially the introduction of reducing agents like homogeneous hydroxylamine li et al 2019 and cysteine li et al 2016 as well as heterogeneous metal sulfides liu et al 2018a has been broadly studied due to their strong reducibility and operating simplicity nevertheless some intrinsic drawbacks are still hard to overcome like the toxicity and non recyclability of hydroxylamine the extra total organic carbon of cysteine and the secondary pollution of heavy metal dissolution 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h k 76 m 1 s 1 2 f e 2 hso 5 f e 3 so 4 o h k 3 10 4 m 1 s 1 3 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 k 3 10 1 m 1 s 1 compared with the metal bearing reductants non metallic element like boron carbon sulfur and phosphorus and their oxyacid anions are usually possessed with lower toxicity the final oxidation products like carbonate sulfate and phosphate are also ubiquitous in the natural matrix moreover previous studies have also pointed out the excellent physicochemical properties of these non metallic elements for instance in environmental remediation non metallic elements have been previously investigated such as organic adsorption by multi wall carbon nanotube mwcnt apul and karanfil 2015 and photocatalytic bacteria inactivation by red phosphorus rp xia et al 2015 recently duan et al 2019 also found that non metallic boron and black phosphorus bp could directly activate pms to produce hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 indicating the strong electron donating ability of these non metallic elements however the direct activation performance seemed inferior and the recyclability was unsatisfactory similarly in our previous work we also found that mos2 could directly activate pms and pds but the re utilization efficiency gradually declined after several runs zhou et al 2020 of note it was reported that the addition of fe3 in mos2 pms sheng et al 2019 mos2 pds he et al 2020 and mos2 h2o2 xing et al 2018 systems could significantly promote the decomposition of peroxides and accelerate target contaminant degradation inspired by these facts we expect that the combination of electron rich non metallic elements fe3 and different peroxides could also boost radical generation and expedite contaminant degradation herein in this work we first studied the potential of different non metallic elements i e amorphous boron mwcnt rp silica sulfur and selenium in promoting fe3 fe2 cycle for pms activation carbamazepine cbz was selected as the target contaminant due to its potential threat to aquatic lives soufan et al 2013 then we dominantly investigate the performance of rp due to its moderate performance and low cost furthermore we modified rp into hydrothermal red phosphorus hrp and black red phosphorus brp to enhance its reducibility the performance of hrp and brp was evaluated and the crucial factors that enhanced the reducibility of pristine rp were discerned the practical application performance in actual water and influence of water parameters like ph and dissolved o2 were also investigated besides the reaction kinetics and the effects of multiple dosage modes on cbz degradation were in detail discussed moreover the generation and transformation of intermediate phosphorus anions were monitored and the chemisorption of pms was simulated via density functional theory dft calculation based on experimental and theoretical results the reaction mechanism among fe3 pms and brp was elucidated finally the control strategies of phosphorus by product generation were also proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the details of materials were listed in text s1 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 brp synthesis brp was synthesized using an ethylenediamine eda method liu et al 2019 first 1 5 g commercial rp and 60 ml deionized water were added in 100 ml stainless teflon lined autoclave and sealed at 200 c for 12 h to obtain hrp then the hrp was washed with deionized water and ethanol 3 times respectively and dried at 50 c in vacuum overnight next 1 0 g hrp and 60 ml eda were simultaneously added into 100 ml stainless teflon lined autoclave and sealed at 140 c for 12 h after cooling down the black products were washed with deoxygenated water and ethanol 3 times respectively and then dried at 50 c in vacuum overnight the obtained powder was thoroughly ground and then sifted through a 200 mesh sieve 2 2 2 degradation

through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter discs for the analysis of residual contaminant concentration for cr vi removal experiment the experimental prodedures were similar to the above except that no fe3 and etoh were added and the sample volume was 3 ml 2 3 characterization the morphologies of rp hrp and brp were investigated using scanning electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi japan transmission

different non metallic elements for fe3 reduction to evaluate the feasibility of various non metallic elements in promoting fe3 fe2 cycle we selected six typical elemental materials including amorphous boron hydroxyl modified mwcnt mwcnt oh silica powder rp sublimed sulfur and selenium and introduced them in fe2 pms or fe3 pms system for cbz degradation as shown in fig 1 only 31 3 and 5 58 cbz could be degraded in 60 min by fe2 pms system and fe3 pms system respectively however with the addition of amorphous boron and rp the cbz degradation efficiency significantly increased to 100 and 83 2 even in fe3 pms system in comparison silica powder sublimed sulfur and selenium powder were all ineffective for enhancing cbz degradation mwcnt oh had a superior adsorption ability towards cbz 43 4 while the addition of pms and fe3 20 81 in turn inhibited cbz removal besdies to exclude the influence of functional groups unfunctionalized mwcnt and carboxyl modified mwcnt mwcnt cooh were also compared and the results showed that none of them were effective for cbz degradation fig s1 this demonstrated that direct fe3 reduction by mwcnt was unfavorable although it was not consistent with the results of seo et al 2015 where mwcnt could directly reduce fe3 the reductant dosage in their work was far more than that in this work fig s2 also depicted that in the absence of pms amorphous boron and rp could reduce 91 5 and 28 fe3 in 60 min respectively whereas marginal fe2 was generated by other non metallic elemental materials this further demonstrated the superior roles of amorphous boron and rp in pms activation given the earth abundant and cost effective properties tian et al 2018 xia et al 2015 rp was then selected and investigated in our work to confirm its efficiency rp was also introduced into fe3 h2o2 and fe3 pds systems fig s3 60 5 and 43 7 cbz could be degraded in 60 min respectively suggesting the efficiency followed the order of pms h2o2 pds this order could be mainly ascribed to the different reaction rates between fe2 and the three peroxides eqs 1 3 since the initial fe2 concentration generated by rp in three systems was similar we further replaced fe3 with different metal ions cu2 ag ce3 mn2 ni2 to investigate the role of fe3 fig s4 the degradation of cbz was drastically enhanced in the presence of cu2 83 5 which could be due to the generation of reactive cu lee et al 2016 however other metal ions were relatively inert to cbz degradation suggesting the generation of low valence metal ions was an essential step in promoting peroxide activation 3 2 characterization of rp hrp and brp to further enhance the reducibility of pristine rp a facile two step modification method was conducted to prepare hrp and brp respectively liu et al 2019 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy results showed that the pristine rp was mainly comprised of p with a part of o which might derive from the surface oxidation layer fig s5 as shown in fig 2 a c after the hydrothermal treatment the bulk rp was split into substantial fragments and the size of pristine rp decreased from 100 μm to around 5 μm accordingly the bet surface area appreciably increased from 0 1 m2 g to 40 2 m2 g which would facilitate its interaction with fe3 subsequently the eda modification further transformed the fragments into flower like spheres with some rodlike sheets sticking out the tem images of brp clearly displayed an overlapped sheet structure fig 2d the bet surface area slightly declined to 16 4 m2 g possibly due to this overlapped structure from the hrtem images it could be observed that brp was composed of both amorphous phase and crystalline phase fig s6 the lattice fringes corresponded to the 0 2 0 lattice plane of bp which confirmed the partial phase transformation after eda modification the digital graph also showed that the color of rp turned bright red and further black after the two modification steps fig s7 moreover compared with pristine rp and hrp three obvious peaks emerged at 2θ 17 3 27 4 and 57 4 in the xrd patterns of brp fig 3 a which could be assigned to 0 2 0 0 2 1 and 1 5 1 planes of bp antonatos et al 2020 shen et al 2015 similarly raman spectra also confirmed the partial conversion from rp phase to bp phase fig 3b for pristine rp the raman band at 346 and 393 cm 1 could be assigned to the fundamental mode b1 and symmetric stretch mode a1 of rp respectively hrp exhibited no new band compared with pristine rp however for brp apart from the bands of rp three characteristic bands appeared at 362 444 and 467 cm 1 which could be attributed to the ag 1 out of plane mode b2g and ag 2 in plane mode of bp batmunkh et al 2019 xps was also acquired to probe the modification induced surface chemical state conversion from fig 3c it could be observed that n 1s peak appeared in brp which was induced by the eda treatment nevertheless fig s8 revealed that the addition of eda could not accelerate cbz degradation and fe3 reduction in fe3 pms system which excluded the involvement of eda in the reaction fig 3d further exhibited the p 2p core level spectra for pristine rp a broad peak at 134 5 ev indicated the partial surface coverage by a p2o5 oxidation layer which was unfavorable for the electron transfer from rp to fe3 tian et al 2018 after the hydrothermal process the oxidation peak completely disappeared suggesting the surface p2o5 dissolution the surfacial atomic ratios of o to p from xps results were listed in table s2 the results also demonstrated that after the hydrothermal process the oxygen content obviously decreased from 1 05 to 0 49 furthermore a weak oxidation peak of o p o appeared at 133 0 ev in brp this could be ascribed to the partial re oxidation of reactive brp during the preparation process ft ir results showed no obvious change after the modification processes fig 3e moreover no characteristic peaks of eda like c n bond 1065 cm 1 and n h 1608 cm 1 appeared after eda treatment krishnan and plane 1966 corroborating the minor eda amount in brp 3 3 enhanced cbz degradation performance cbz degradation experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of pristine rp hrp and brp as shown in fig 4 a all of them showed a weak direct activation ability towards pms though fe2 pms alone could degrade 24 8 cbz this reaction almost terminated within 30 s besides this two stage kinetic bottleneck could not be mitigated even with higher fe2 or pms dosage fig s9 however after the addition of rp hrp and brp the two stage kinetic bottleneck was greatly mitigated specifically compared with the incomplete cbz degradation by pristine rp 100 cbz degradation could be observed in 7 5 min by hrp this confirmed that the size decrease effect and the removal of surface oxidation layer could greatly elevate the reducibility of rp moreover complete cbz depletion was observed even within 5 min using brp to exclude the influence of specific surface area the bet normalized k obs was calculated and it increased from 0 01 g min 1 m 2 of hrp to 0 06 g min 1 m 2 of brp table s3 this implied that apart from size decrease effect and oxidation layer removal the role of partial phase conversion was also crucial in accelerating the electron transfer to regenerate fe2 according to the quenching experiments fig s10 sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh were identified as the reactive species in the system so4 played a dominant role since the quenching effect of ethanol was more significant than that of tert butyl alcohol zhou et al 2020 epr results further demonstrated that the radical generation was most boosted in the order of brp hrp and pristine rp fig 4b the detected cbz degradation intermediates and the possible degradation pathways were similar to other so4 dominated systems more details in text s4 table s4 and fig s11 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 acridone acon m z 196 0755 was also the detected final products of cbz to investigate whether acon which is hard to be completely degraded through conventional treatment process kosjek et al 2009 would accumulate in this system the degradation of acon was also conducted fig s12 the results showed that though a little slower than cbz acon would be still degraded in fe3 pms brp system manifesting the minor accumulation of this hazardous intermediate to compare the intrinsic reducibility of rp hrp and brp we first monitored the concentration of fe2 and residual pms obviously rp hrp and brp could directly reduce 0 18 mg l 1 24 mg l and 1 57 mg l fe3 in 20 min respectively fig 5 a besides these materials could not adsorb fe2 suggesting the generated fe2 would not accumulate on the surfaces of these materials fig s13 in the presence of pms the fe2 concentration remained low within 15 min due to the fast reaction between regenerated fe2 and pms after 15 min it gradually rebounded owing to the depletion of pms this phenomenon was also consistent with previous studies using zero valent metal or metal sulfides as the reductants sheng et al 2019 yi et al 2019 the time profiles of pms decomposition showed that 31 2 and 62 3 pms could be directly consumed by hrp and brp in 20 min due to their strong reducibility fig 5b with the addition of fe3 pms consumption rate accelerated and most of the pms could be depleted in 15 min this implied that the addition of fe3 could promote the electron transfer from brp to fe3 and further to pms besdies the enhanced electron transfer efficiency could be also reflected by the nyquist plots and tafel scans fig 5c and d the arc sizes of hrp and brp were smaller than rp indicating the higher electron conductivity of hrp and brp than that of rp lim et al 2019 of note the arc size of brp in high frequency region was greater than that of hrp which might be ascribed to the partial re oxidation of brp as shown in xps spectra fig 3d however despite a lower electron conductivity than hrp the corrosion currents of rp hrp and brp calculated from the tafel slope were 3 17 10 8 5 04 10 8 and 1 05 10 7 a respectively the higher corrosion current of brp suggested that brp was more liable to be corroded and donate electrons to oxidants during a redox reaction which might be ascribed to the presence of more reactive bp phase 3 4 stability and broad applicability to study the stability of brp after the reaction the reacted brp was then characterized from the sem image the brp surface was corroded due to the oxidation by fe3 and pms fig s14 it could be also observed from the xrd pattern that the peak intensity declined after the reaction fig s15a raman spectrum showed that the characteristic band of bp still existed whereas the oxidation degree of brp increased as the ratio of ag 1 to ag 2 declined from 1 56 to 0 94 fig s15b favron et al 2015 p 2p core level spectra confirmed the surface oxidation of brp as well since the peak intensity of o p o at 133 0 ev decreased while the peak of p2o5 at 134 4 ev emerged again fig s16 the atomic ratio of o to p also slightly increased to 0 57 after the reaction however the cyclic performance and fe3 reduction ability did not decline severely fig 6 a and fig s17 even after five successive experiments 100 cbz could be still degraded this suggested that the slight re oxidation would not severely decrease the reactivity of brp furthermore to investigate its applicability in various conditions the influence of ph dissolved o2 and actual water was discussed first this system had a strong resistance to initial ph 3 6 1 due to the release of h from pms fig s18 however when buffered with acetic acid the optimal ph was less than 5 this was because the increase of buffer ph would result in the hydrolysis of fe3 which would be unfavorable for both the reduction of fe3 and the activation of pms moreover dissolved o2 only showed a slight impact on cbz degradation revealing that this system was not sensitive to dissolved o2 fig 6b more importantly even in some actual water samples like tap water funan river jingcheng lake and yangtze river 100 cbz could be removed in 10 min which exhibited its strong resistance to water matrix table s5 and fig 6c besides the superior efficiency could be also reflected from the fast degradation of 9 typical contaminants including atrazine levofloxacin bisphenol s p nitrophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol benzoic acid bezafibrate iohexol and diphenhydramine fig s19 furthermore to confirm the broad applicability of brp the activation of h2o2 and pds was also conducted fig s20 82 8 and 64 5 cbz could be also effectively degraded with h2o2 and pds respectively which suggested the universality of brp in catalytic organic oxidation finally apart from orgaic degradation brp could be also applied in high valent metal like cr vi reduction specifically 86 3 cr vi could be efficiently removed by 0 4 g l brp in 30 min which indicated its strong reducibility fig 6d 3 5 the influence of reagent dosage and the mitigation of competition reaction to figure out the primary factors that determine the overall reaction kinetics the influence of brp dosage fe2 dosage pms dosage and initial cbz concentration was studied and analyzed in detail in text s5 fig s21 and fig s22 from the analysis results the influence of brp dosage fe2 dosage and initial cbz concentration on the degradation efficiency and the corresponding k obs was primary whereas the influence of pms dosage was minor according to fig 5a the transient fe2 concentration during 15 min was low therefore the initial pms dosage was relatively excessive compared with fe2 concentration even with a high pms dosage the reaction rate would not obviously increase besides the excessive pms present in the system would be also ineffectively consumed by reductive brp without cbz degradation fig 5b herein to alleviate this competition reaction multiple dosage was conducted since multiple dosage could avoid the unnecessary interaction between brp and pms a higher cbz concentration was used to evaluate the overall pms utilization efficiency besdies the total pms and brp dosages were kept constant to compare the final cbz degradation efficiency as shown in fig 7 a the degradation efficiency after 30 min increased from 64 8 to 78 4 and 80 7 with twice and four time pms dosage respectively this confirmed that multiple pms dosage could actually alleviate the side reaction between pms and brp and reduce pms consumption thus promoting more radical generation conversely multiple brp dosage hampered cbz degradation fig 7b though multiple brp dosage could also alleviate the side reaction the reduction of fe3 by brp was also slowed down herein multiple brp dosage was unfavourable for the overall cbz degradation efficiency to comprehend the behavior of brp thoroughly the influence of multiple dosage on the performance of two benchmark reductants based on substantial previous works table s6 i e homogeneous nh2oh and heterogeneous mos2 was also investigated from fig 7c and e multiple pms dosage was less effective for mos2 and nh2oh this could be ascribed to their relatively slow direct reaction with pms which would not cause prompt pms consumption sheng et al 2019 zou et al 2013 similar to brp multiple mos2 and nh2oh dosage could not promote cbz degradation either which was due to the slower fe3 reduction rate fig 7d and f li et al 2020 the intrinsic reducibility of nh2oh mos2 and brp was also compared via fe2 generation amount fig s23 the result showed that homogeneous nh2oh quickly reduced fe3 within 1 min whereas heterogeneous brp and mos2 gradually generated fe2 though the fe3 reduction reaction by nh2oh proceeded promptly the final cbz degradation efficiency was only 50 no matter which dosage mode was conducted this indicated that the quenching effects between nh2oh and radicals in homogeneous solution were inevitable zou et al 2013 however the final cbz degradation efficiencies were 64 8 and 69 1 for brp and mos2 respectively this suggested the superiority of heterogeneous reductants in avoiding radical quenching by reductants themselves although the side reaction would hamper the performance of brp compared with mos2 multiple brp dosage could significantly alleviate the side reaction and promote cbz degradation to 80 7 thus with less radical quenching than hydroxylamine and stronger reducibility than mos2 brp exhibited a great potential as fe3 reductant in pms activation 3 6 phosphorus by product formation and corresponding control strategy as a reductant brp would proceed self transformation and generate various phosphorus by products such as hypophosphite 1 phosphite 3 phosphate 5 and pyrophosphate 5 zhang et al 2019c to control the phosphorus by product formation it was of vital importance to get insights into their formation mechanism thus we utilized ion chromatography to investigate by product formation under various conditions fig s24 depicted the time profiles of different phosphorus by product formation in fe3 pms brp system obviously phosphite and phosphate were the primary phosphorus intermediates while hypophosphite and pyrophosphate only accounted for a small proportion fig 8 a further depicted the oxidation of brp by fe3 alone with the increase of fe3 dosage the phosphite and phosphate concentration gradually ascended to 27 μm and 13 5 μm respectively although hypophosphite and phosphite were reported to be moderate reductants feng et al 2018 they could not reduce fe3 and accelerate cbz degradation under our experimental conditions fig s25 herein the reduction of fe3 was primarily a surface reaction compared with fe3 the contribution of pms to p by product generation was more remarkable fig 8b the concentration of phosphite and phosphate significantly ascended to 68 μm and 44 8 μm while hypophosphite and pyrophosphate gradually ascended to 12 6 μm and 9 4 μm as pms dosage increased to 0 8 mm of note though hypophosphite could be partially oxidized to phosphite by pms alone through an oxygen transfer reaction dubey et al 2002 phosphite was less oxidized to phosphate by pms alone fig s26 therefore the formation of phosphorus products dominantly derived from the surface brp oxidation by pms given the minor cbz degradation efficiency in pms brp alone system fig 4a the one electron transfer pathway of pms generating radicals could be excluded gábor et al 2009 based on the above facts a plausible reaction mechanism could be proposed that pms mainly oxidized brp through a two electron transfer pathway without radcial generation specifically pms could first oxidize brp through a two electron reaction with minor surface p 0 disproportionating into hypophosphite 1 and phophite 3 then the residual surface p would be further oxidized through another two electron transfer reaction and disproportionate into phosphite 3 and phosphate 5 or pyrophosphate incidentally the concentration of phosphite approximately equalled the sum of the concentration of hypophosphite phosphate and pyrophosphate which also substantiated this mechanism eq 6 fig s27 6 p phosphite 3 p hypophosphite 1 p phosphate 5 p pyrophosphate 5 moreover the reaction between brp and pms was also simulated via dft calculation given that the structure of amorphous rp is still under dispute zhang et al 2019b the calculation model was established using the bp phase to investigate their interaction preliminarily from fig 9 it could be found that pms was mainly adsorbed at the h site above the p6 hexagon of bp surface kulish et al 2015 the adsorption energy was calculated as 1 18 ev implying the reaction between brp and pms could proceed spontaneously the charge density difference illustrated an obvious charge accumulation in pms and charge depletion in bp fig s28 besides the o o bond length also increased from 1 347 å to 1 473 å suggesting the cleavage tendency of o o bond overall strong electron transfer would occur between brp and pms which might lead to the unnecessary consumption of pms furthermore the influence of fe3 on brp oxidation in the presence of pms and the influence of pms on brp oxidation in the presence of fe3 were studied in fig 8c the phosphite phosphate and total p concentration first ascended a little at small fe3 dosage but then gradually descended at higher fe3 dosage the initial minor increase could be ascribed to the faster and more pms decomposition compared with no fe3 addition fig 5b then as the fe3 concentration increased more fe2 could be generated which could effectively utilize pms and thus inhibit the undesirable side reaction between brp and pms of note the oxidation of brp by so4 and oh should be marginal since the p intermediate generation decreased when more radicals were generated with more fe3 dosage in contrast increasing the pms concentration with a fixed amount of fe3 even resulted in more p oxidation product generation than pms alone fig 8d this could be also ascribed to the faster and more pms decomposition in the presence of fe3 all these confirmed that adequate fe2 formation was conducive to mitigating p by product formation and elevating pms utilization efficiency moreover the influence of these p oxidation products on cbz degradation efficiency was further studied fig s29 the four p oxidation products were disadvantageous to the cbz degradation and the degradation efficiency declined in the order of phosphite hypophosphite phosphate and pyrophosphate the secondary reaction rate constants k of so4 and oh with these anions pms and cbz were listed in table s7 and the corresponding ck values were calculated table s8 although the ck value of oh with cbz is lower than those with hypophosphite and phosphite the ck values of so4 with cbz is comparable to those with hypophosphite and phosphite thus in view of the more so4 generation in this system the influence of hypophosphite and phosphite on cbz degradation should be minor as for phosphate and pyrophosphate despite the lower ck values they could otherwise complex with fe3 and thus retard fe3 reduction nevertheless given the small amount of these anions the actual inhibition effects were marginal finally according to the above discussion all the reactions in fe3 pms brp system were illustrated in scheme 1 obviously the competition reaction between pms and brp mainly contributed to phosphorus by product formation therefore an appropriate initial fe3 concentration and a multiple pms dosage might be essential to inhibit phosphorus by product generation and promote target contaminant degradation however despite these strategies a part of phosphite and phosphate could still remain in the effluent phosphate could be removed via precipitation process while phosphite might require an extra step to remove to efficiently solve this problem and reduce the treatment costs some newly emerging techniques like capacitive deionization could be investigated in the future nevertheless compared with other oxidation system using polyphosphate as the ligand kim et al 2015 zong et al 2020 or cuxp as the reagents kim et al 2019 the phosphorus generation stress in this system was minor suggesting its great potential in organic oxidation 4 conclusion in this work we developed a metal free heterogenenous reductant to accelerate fe3 fe2 cycle for pms activation we found that after two step modification the obtained brp possessed a greater bet surface area with a less oxidation layer and partially converted to bp phase all these aspects contributed to the enhanced electron transfer capacity from brp to fe3 besides brp exhibited an excellent recyclability and strong resistance to dissolved oxygen and water matrix as a heterogeneous reductant brp avoided the quenching reaction with radicals which was inevitable when using homogeneous reductants though undesirable competition reaction between pms and brp would occur multiple pms dosage could remarkedly alleviate the competetion reaction and elevate pms utilization efficiency the dominant brp oxidation products included phosphite and phosphate which mainly derived from the surface two electron reaction between pms and brp interestingly moderate increase of fe3 dosage could efficiently reduce by product generation via the prompt pms activation by regenerated fe2 hence with a comparable efficiency for promoting fe3 fe2 cycle the emergence of metal free and environment benign brp could avoid the use of heavy metal bearing materials or toxic hydroxylamine we

17436,arsenic as is a toxic element present in many ground water sources in the world most conventional as removal techniques require pre oxidation of the neutral arsenite as iii species to the negatively charged arsenate as v oxyanion to optimize as removal and minimize chemical use in this work a novel continuous flow as removal system was developed that combines biological as iii oxidation by bacteria with fe electrocoagulation ec an fe 0 based electrochemical technology that generates reactive fe iii precipitates to bind as the bio integrated feec system bio feec showed effective oxidation and removal of 150 µg l as iii without the need of chemicals to remove as to below the who guideline of 10 µg l 10 times lower charge dosage was required for the bio feec system compared to conventional feec this lower fe dosage requirement reduced sludge production and energy consumption the as iii oxidizing biomass was found to consist of bacteria belonging to comamonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and acidovorax which are capable of oxidizing as iii and are common in drinking water biofilms characterization of the as laden fe solids by x ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that both bio feec and conventional feec produced solids consistent with a mixture of lepidocrocite and 2 line ferrihydrite arsenic bound to the solids was dominantly as v but a slightly higher fraction of as v was detected in the bio feec solids compared to the conventional feec graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic electrocoagulation drinking water iron groundwater 1 introduction arsenic as contamination of drinking water sources especially groundwater has been a major global concern affecting many countries in the world including argentina bangladesh cambodia china india mexico the united states and vietnam it has been estimated that around 94 220 million people worldwide have been exposed to groundwater with toxic as concentrations podgorski and berg 2020 in water sources as is mainly present in two inorganic forms arsenite as iii and arsenate as v wan et al 2011 with the as iii species being more toxic and more prevalent in reduced groundwater aquifers than as v katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 nicomel et al 2015 chronic exposure to as in drinking water causes various diseases such as skin bladder and lung cancers reproductive disorders and neurodevelopmental disease in children kapaj et al 2006 tseng 1977 hence it is essential to remove as from contaminated water meant for drinking purposes with the provisional drinking water guideline of 10 µg l set by the world health organization who who 2004 many techniques have been proposed to remove as from drinking water such as coagulation and flocculation ion exchange adsorption to activated alumina or iron based sorbents and reverse osmosis feenstra et al 2007 mondal et al 2013 the efficiency of these techniques is improved by pre oxidation of the neutral as iii species to the negatively charged as v oxyanion h2aso4 haso4 2 goren et al 2020 kim and nriagu 2000 which is removed more readily by ion exchange precipitation and adsorption kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 effective as iii oxidation can be performed with chemical oxidants including o3 naclo and kmno4 kim and nriagu 2000 sorlini and gialdini 2010 however chemical oxidants can be expensive and can generate unwanted by products jackman and hughes 2010 that require additional treatment which increases the cost and complexity of treatment katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 hence new methods are needed that can overcome the drawbacks of conventional chemical methods to oxidize and remove as iii the biological oxidation of as iii by arsenic oxidizing bacteria asob is a promising alternative to chemical oxidation because asobs do not need auxiliary chemicals to oxidize as iii which reduces the supply chain and costs of as removal kamei ishikawa et al 2017 native asobs have been detected in a wide range of conditions including in as contaminated water and sediments ito et al 2012 and are hypothesized to oxidize as iii as a detoxification or energy generation for growth mechanism muller et al 2003 santini et al 2000 recently biological oxidation of as iii has also been reported in laboratory and industrial scale rapid sand filter systems due to growth and accumulation of an asob community in filter beds ripened with as iii contaminated groundwater crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018 lytle et al 2007 after biological as iii oxidation an additional treatment step is subsequently required to remove the dissolved as v one low cost and chemical free method is fe 0 electrolysis also known as fe electrocoagulation ec which involves in situ generation of fe iii precipitates to potentially bind as holt et al 2005 mollah et al 2004 moussa et al 2017 in ec a small electric current is applied to fe 0 electrodes in contact with contaminated water to generate fe ii ions which are then oxidized by dissolved oxygen do to produce reactive fe iii precipitates with a high as sorption affinity van genuchten et al 2012 after as sorption the as rich fe iii precipitates generated by ec can be removed by rapid sand filtration or gravitational settling while feec can remove both as iii and as v from water the removal of as iii requires substantially more fe proportional to charge passed and treatment time than as v amrose et al 2013 wan et al 2011 therefore pre oxidizing as iii should be considered to decrease the required energy and amount of produced sludge for equivalent as removal in this study biological as iii oxidation and feec were combined in a continuous flow setup this type of bio feec system according to our knowledge has not been demonstrated previously but has the potential to substantially reduce fe sludge production and energy consumption we evaluated the as removal efficacy of bio integrated feec and conventional feec in view of the biological conversion of dissolved as iii and the molecular scale structure and as uptake mechanism of the generated solid fe iii precipitates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dutch non chlorinated tap water characteristics in table s1 was used as the model water for all experiments both as iii and as v were added to the tap water from as iii and as v stock solutions that were prepared by dissolving defined amounts of sodium meta arsenite naaso2 or sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o sigma aldrich to 18 2 mω cm ultrapure water the ph of the experimental solutions was adjusted with naoh or h2so4 merck millipore and the water conductivity was increased to 1200 300 µs cm by adding nacl sigma aldrich 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 feec batch reactor batch ec experiments were conducted to understand the impact of charge dosage cd charge dosage rate cdr and initial as oxidation state on as removal which informed our selection of operating parameters during the pilot scale continuous flow experiments the feec batch reactor consisted of a 1 l glass beaker containing 0 8 l as solution tap water spiked with as iii or as v and two fe electrodes one cathode and one anode steel s235 in contact with the solution fig 1 a the electrodes had dimensions of 50 mm x 20 mm x 0 5 mm with a total submerged surface area of 12 cm2 each and an inter electrode gap of 1 cm before experiments the electrodes were immersed in 0 01 m h2so4 for 2 min and abraded with sand paper to remove any scale and rinsed with demineralized water the electrodes were connected to a direct current dc power supply tenma 72 10 500 to generate the fe precipitates the initial ph of the solution in all experiments was measured using a multimeter wtwtm multilinetm multi 3630 ids and was maintained between 7 0 8 0 by manual additions of 0 01 m h2so4 and 0 1 m naoh in all ec batch experiments the solutions were stirred using a magnetic stirrer labinco l23 at 150 rpm the initial do was measured between 8 0 9 0 mg o2 l using the multimeter in feec the as removal efficiency depends on the amount of fe generated in the solution and the rate at which it is generated amrose et al 2013 the amount and rate of fe generated is proportional to the cd q in c l and cdr dq dt in c l min by faraday s law eq 1 and 2 1 w qm nf itm nfv 2 dq dt i v where w amount of dissolved electrode material mg l i current ma t electrolysis time min m molecular weight of fe mg mol 55 845 f faraday s constant 96 485 c mol n number of transferred electrons 2 for fe v solution volume l the batch experiments were performed by applying a range of cd and cdrs to tap water containing 150 µg l as iii or as v table 1 shows the applied cd and cdrs for the batch experiments along with the corresponding electrolysis time applied current and the theoretical amount of fe generated by faraday s law to determine as removal for a given cd water samples were collected before and after ec without additional mixing time or precipitate settling and analyzed for total as and fe as well as aqueous as iii and as v 2 2 2 biological filter columns biological filter columns were used to establish an as iii oxidizing microbial community in the filter beds through ripening with as iii water the setup consisted of two duplicate down flow cylindrical columns 2 m high 9 cm diameter made from pvc containing an anthracite layer size fraction 2 0 4 0 mm coarse sand layer size fraction 1 4 2 0 mm and garnet layer size fraction 0 3 0 6 mm each 30 cm high fig 1 b before the experiments the columns were backwashed with tap water until the supernatant was visually clear the columns were then loaded continuously with tap water spiked with 150 µg l as iii for 49 days at a flow rate of 1 m h to establish the oxidizing biomass a supernatant level of 40 cm was maintained above the anthracite bed the development of as iii oxidation in the columns was monitored by measuring as speciation in the influent and effluent at 7 day intervals after ripening column effluents from both columns were taken from the bottom location of the anthracite bed as speciation showed 95 oxidation of 150 µg l influent as iii in the anthracite bed at 49 days and feec was applied in batch mode these separate experiments were performed to verify the performance of feec in solutions where as iii was oxidized biologically and to determine the minimum cd i e fe dosage required to remove 150 µg l oxidized as v below 10 µg l 2 2 3 bio feec system after performing the feec batch experiments and establishing the as iii oxidizing biomass the integrated bio feec set up was assembled the setup for the bio feec system consisted of a similar down flow column as described in section 2 2 2 augmented with an feec electrochemical cell the column contained the ripened anthracite layer containing oxidizing biomass at the top followed by an feec cell consisting of two fe electrodes 60 mm x 30 mm x 0 5 mm connected to the dc power supply the bottom of the column contained sand layers to collect the generated fe solids during feec fig 1 c an identical control feec flow through system was created that consisted of only a conventional feec cell without a biological oxidation pre layer fig 1 c tap water spiked with 150 µg l as iii was introduced to both systems at 1 m h the bio feec and conventional feec systems were run for 3 days with an experimental run time of 6 h each day during which the feec cell was operated after 6 h the current applied to the feec cell was stopped and the as iii spiked tap water was allowed to flow through the columns continuously after 3 days the two systems were backwashed to collect the as laden fe solids that were trapped in the bottom sand layers for molecular scale characterization by fe and as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy xas for both column systems the as removal efficiency was determined over the 6 h operating cycles by measuring the difference in dissolved as concentrations at the influent and just above the lower sand layers 2 3 chemical analyses water samples in triplicates were collected 1 unfiltered 2 filtered over 0 45 µm polysthersulfone filters macherey nagel gmbh co kg and 3 filtered over 0 45 µm filters and an anionic resin for as speciation after collection the samples were acidified using ultrapure nitric acid rotipuran ultra 69 to dissolve any fe precipitates the samples were then stored at 4 c before analysis for total as and fe as well as aqueous as iii and as v by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analytikal jena model plasmaquant ms for as speciation an anionic exchange resin amberlite ira 400 chlorite form resin was used following the clifford method as explained in gude et al 2018 2 4 x ray absorption spectroscopy solids for fe and as k edge xas analysis were obtained by backwashing the bio feec and conventional feec columns and filtering the backwashed water with filter papers the filter papers containing the solids were then stored at 80 c before preparation for xas analysis fe and as k edge xas data were collected at beam line 2 2 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl menlo park usa fe k edge xas data were recorded at room temperature out to k of 13 å 1 and as k edge xas data were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures 80 k in fluorescence mode out to k of 14 å 1 beam calibration was performed by setting the maximum of the first derivative of fe 0 to 7112 ev or au 0 to 11 919 ev for fe and as k edge xas data respectively the sixpack software was used for spectral alignment averaging and background subtraction webb 2005 following standard procedures van genuchten et al 2012 the exafs spectra were extracted using k3 weighting and were fourier transformed using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 over the k range 2 to 11 å 1 for fe data or 2 to 13 å 1 for as data the as k edge xas data were analyzed by linear combination fits lcfs of the xanes spectra and shell by shell fits of the exafs spectra using the sixpack software the lcfs were performed over the energy range of 11 860 to 11 880 ev using reference spectra of as iii and as v adsorbed to two line ferrihydrite 2lfh which were collected previously at beam line 4 1 of ssrl under similar conditions as the current data set the shell by shell fits were performed in r δr space based on algorithms derived from ifeffit newville 2001 theoretical phase and amplitude functions for single and multiple scattering paths used in the fits were calculated using feff6 rehr et al 1992 and were derived from the structure of scorodite kitahama et al 1975 additional details on xas sample preparation and data collection and the shell by shell fitting procedure are provided in the supplementary materials 2 5 microbial characterization to characterize the as iii oxidizing biomass that grew and accumulated in the biological sand filters due to ripening with as iii rich water a set of duplicate up flow biological sand columns 1 m x 4 cm diameter pvc containing quartz filter sand size fraction 0 7 1 25 mm bed height 75 cm was ripened with tap water containing 100 µg l as iii for a period of 60 days figure s1 after establishing the oxidizing biomass on the sand bed sand samples 100 ml were taken for dna extraction at the bottom 15 cm of the columns location of influent to characterize the biomass by high throughput sequencing hts of 16s rrna genes total genome dna of the biomass on the sand samples was extracted using ctab sds method the concentration and purity of the dna was monitored on 1 agarose gels and the dna was diluted to 1 ng μl using sterile water depending on the concentration the bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using specific primer and the pcr reactions were carried out with a phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs the pcr products were mixed with same volume of 1x loading buffer to operate electrophoresis on 2 agarose gel for detection samples with a bright main strip between 400 and 450 bp were considered for further analysis the pcr products were then mixed in equidensity ratios and purified using qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany nebnex t ultra dna library pre kit illumina was then used to generate sequencing libraries the library quality was assessed on the qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo scientific and agilent bioanalyzer 2100 system and sequenced on an illumina platform to generate 250 bp paired end reads paired end reads were merged using flash v1 2 7 magoč et al 2011 to generate raw tags on which quality filtering was performed according to the qiime v1 7 0 caporaso et al 2010 to generate high quality clean tags the tags were then compared with the reference gold database using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 to obtain effective tags by detecting and removing chimera sequences uparse software uparse v7 0 100 edgar 2013 was used for sequence analysis and sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus to obtain taxonomic information the representative sequence for each otu was annotated by the rdp classifier version 2 2 wang et al 2007 algorithm using greengene database desantis et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 as removal in feec batch experiments in order to understand the dependency of as v and as iii removal on different ec operational parameters in the specific test water matrix batch feec experiments were conducted fig 2 shows the changes in dissolved as iii and as v concentrations over the various applied cd values 0 200 c l at a cdr of 15 c l min it was observed that as the cd increased the dissolved as concentration decreased which is consistent with previously reported ec batch studies amrose et al 2013 delaire et al 2017 goren et al 2020 van genuchten et al 2012 wan et al 2011 the concentration of total fe increased linearly with cd and matched the theoretical fe concentration based on faraday s law eq 1 i e faradaic efficiency 1 müller et al 2019 at cd values of 100 c l and above i e fe dosages 29 mg l or fe as 260 mol mol the dissolved as level decreased below the who guideline of 10 µg l regardless the initial as oxidation state and reached as low as 2 µg l for cds of 150 and 200 c l since as removal in feec occurs via sorption to co precipitated fe iii oxyhydr oxides kobya et al 2016 the enhanced as removal at increasing cd can be explained by a higher concentration of fe iii precipitates and the corresponding availability of more as sorption sites although both as iii and as v removal was observed in feec batch experiments solutions initially containing as v required a lower cd 10 c l or fe as 26 mol mol than as iii 100 c l or fe as 260 mol mol to meet the who guideline of 10 µg l this result can be explained by the higher affinity of the generated fe precipitates for as v than as iii roberts et al 2004 with as iii as the initial species the oxidation to as v in solution was observed for cd values of 10 25 and 50 c l which is consistent with the formation of reactive intermediates during feec operation that oxidize as iii to as v van genuchten et al 2012 at higher cd dissolved as v was not observed which can be explained by the presence of excess fe leading to complete adsorption of dissolved as v dixit and hering 2003 raven et al 1998 when cdr was varied slightly more effective as iii removal was observed at the lowest cdr of 5 c l min figure s2 and s3 consistent with previous work delaire et al 2017 li et al 2012 3 2 biological as iii oxidation in filter columns the as speciation in the effluent of the duplicate down flow biological filter columns over the experimental period of 49 days is shown in fig 3 at the start of this ripening stage day 1 28 30 10 of the influent as iii was recovered in the filtrate however by 35 days complete oxidation of 150 µg l as iii developed in the columns which remained stable until the end of the experiment the ph do electrical conductivity and temperature were steady during the experimental period at 7 5 0 5 8 1 mg l 300 100 μs cm and 20 2 c respectively also it must be noted that the total as concentration in the effluent was consistently lower 3 26 than in influent indicating adsorption to the fresh filter materials anthracite sand and garnet on day 49 additional samples were collected for as speciation after the anthracite layer revealing that 95 of as iii was oxidized in the top layer therefore this 30 cm layer was considered suitable for biological pre treatment and was shifted upward prior to feec for follow up experiments a similar as iii oxidation pattern was observed in the two up flow columns which were used for characterization of the accumulated as iii oxidizing biomass figure s4 high throughput sequencing hts of the biomass dna generated otus of 730 and 811 and 609 and 562 from duplicate samples of each column respectively fig 4 a depicts the relative abundance ra percentage of total otus of the top 10 classes which accounted for more than 97 of the entire biomass in each sample alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were the two most abundant classes in the two columns having a ra of 55 67 and 21 28 respectively which is in agreement with findings of cavalca et al 2013 both of these classes belong to the most abundant phylum proteobacteria figure s5 furthermore classification at the family level showed the presence of microorganisms affiliated with comamonadaceae ra 15 20 class betaproteobacteria and rhodobacteraceae ra 7 5 10 class alphaproteobacteria fig 4 b which are known to oxidize as iii crognale et al 2019 additionally the as iii oxidizing genus acidovorax ra 0 6 1 4 in the comamonadaceae family was also observed fig 4 c which is a genus that is common in the rapid sand filters of drinking water treatment plants treating as free water vandermaesen et al 2017 but that also oxidize as iii cavalca et al 2013 while as iii oxidizing biomass is commonly reported in sand filters for groundwater treatment crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 our results indicate that a similar as iii oxidizing biomass can also develop in sand filters running on chlorine free tap water sourced from a surface water body 3 3 as iii removal by bio feec 3 3 1 batch experiments after ripening of the biological columns batch feec experiments were performed on the column effluent which contained 150 µg l as v to determine the optimal operational parameters for the continuous flow experiments fig 5 shows the change in dissolved as iii and as v concentrations after applying various cds 0 200 c l at a cdr of 5 c l min to the column effluent and to an unoxidized as iii spiked tap water solution for reference the as removal in the column effluent was similar to that of the feec experiment using tap water containing as v as the initial as species figure s2 left for feec experiments in both the biological column effluent and the as v solution a cd of 10 c l at cdr of 5 c l min was able to remove 150 μg l as to below the 10 μg l who guideline whereas a cd of 100 c l was needed to achieve the same level with the reference as iii solution the faradaic efficiency for the feec experiments in the column effluents containing oxidized as v was near 1 which was similar to the values obtained for feec experiments in standard as v solution figure s2 left this result suggests that biological as iii oxidation did not impact the electrochemical oxidation of fe 0 and the release of fe ii to the bulk solution 3 3 2 continuous flow experiments the operating parameters of cd 10 c l applied at cdr 5 c l min were selected for the continuous flow bio feec experiments based on the results from the batch ec experiments using the biological column effluent the voltage observed in the dc current supplier to achieve the required cd and cdr in both column systems was 2 1 v fig 6 depicts the results during the 3 day experimental duration for both the bio feec left and the conventional feec right continuous flow systems the results indicate that both systems removed as but only the bio feec system was able to decrease as levels to below the who guideline of 10 μg l despite identical operating parameters i e flow rate cd cdr in the bio feec system the dissolved as concentration decreased from 150 30 μg l to approximately 2 1 μg l 98 removal the dissolved as concentration was consistently higher than the who guideline in the conventional feec system with approximately 38 4 μg l remaining in solution 73 removal which consisted of 75 5 as iii it was also observed that the as iii removal efficiency of the conventional feec column was higher 73 as removal than the feec batch experiments using the as iii spiked tap water 42 as removal despite the similar operating parameters cd 10 c l and cdr 5 c l min this result can be explained by the accumulation of fe solids on top of the supporting filter layers in the continuous flow system this explanation is based on the measured total fe concentration of approximately 7 mg l in unfiltered samples of the conventional feec column system which is greater than the theoretical fe value of 3 mg l eq 1 expected based on faraday s law the accumulated fe solids allow for extended contact time with dissolved as resulting in greater as adsorption per fe mass although the fe concentration was also significantly higher than the theoretical faradaic value in the bio feec column no difference in as removal per charge passed was observed in the bio feec because of the nearly complete removal of the oxidized as v however the accumulation of fe in both continuous flow systems suggests that the bio feec column could be operated at even lower cd and still achieve as iii removal to below 10 μg l 3 4 characterization of fe as solids after the 6 h operating cycles over the 3 day experimental duration the filter columns were backwashed and the solids were characterized by fe and as k edge xas fig 7 the fe k edge exafs spectra showed no notable difference in line shape or phase of the oscillations for samples collected from the bio feec and conventional feec columns indicating a similar average structure of the generated fe iii precipitates based on characteristic fingerprints in the exafs spectra including the asymmetric first oscillation from 3 to 5 5 å 1 the solids are consistent with a mixture of lepidocrocite γ feooh and poorly ordered fe iii precipitates e g 2 line ferrihydrite 2lfh fig 7 a the formation of a mixture of lepidocrocite and 2lfh can be attributed to the composition of the as iii rich tap water table s1 and is consistent with solids formed in previous feec studies at similar ph and total as fe ratios van genuchten et al 2014 wan et al 2011 previous studies on fe oxidizing bacteria have shown that fe iii precipitates produced by various types of bacteria often have unique structures because biogenic dissolved organic compounds can interfere with fe iii oxyhydr oxide crystallization pathway toner et al 2009 however the fe k edge exafs spectra of solids from both systems were similar indicating that the bacteria upstream of the feec cell did not interfere with fe iii polymerization instead the inorganic composition of the solution played a more important role in determining the fe iii precipitate structure the formation of poorly ordered solids such as 2lfh in the bio feec and conventional feec system can be advantageous for as adsorption because of their higher proportion of reactive surface area per mass i e specific surface area compared to more crystalline fe phases dixit and hering 2003 the as k edge xanes data for samples collected from the bio feec and conventional feec systems indicate that the oxidation state of as bound to the solids was predominantly as v for both systems based on the position of the absorption maximum near 11 875 ev fig 7 b and c the predominance of solid phase as v in the conventional feec system is in line with the oxidation of as iii during feec due to the formation of reactive intermediates li et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2012 although as v was the major species inbound to both bio feec and conventional feec solids the lcfs of the xanes spectra indicated a slightly higher as iii percentage for solids in the conventional feec system 8 compared to those of the bio feec system 2 these results confirm that the as removal pathway for both columns involved as iii oxidation however unlike the bio feec system the abiotic as iii oxidation pathway of the conventional feec column was not sufficient to oxidize all as iii consequently as iii was observed bound to the fe solids of the conventional feec column and was the dominant form of as in effluent which was substantially higher 38 4 μg l than the bio feec system 2 1 μg l the as k edge exafs spectra of the solids collected from both continuous flow systems were similar consistent with the as k edge xanes data and both matched the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to 2lfh to confirm the exact as bonding mode to the fe iii precipitates in both systems shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed exafs spectra were performed the output of the fits is overlain to the data in fig 7 d and the fitting parameters are summarized in table s2 the fitting results were identical for both conventional feec and bio feec samples within fit derived standard errors indicating a similar as uptake mode the fitting output for both samples also matched that of the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed 2lfh the first shell fits of the samples returned values for the as o coordination number cnas o of 4 3 to 4 6 and as o interatomic distance ras o of 1 69 å which is consistent with tetrahedrally coordinated as v waychunas et al 1993 the second shell fits of both samples yielded cnas fe values of 1 4 to 1 6 and an ras fe of 3 28 å which was identical to the fits of as v adsorbed to 2lfh within fit derived standard errors table s2 based on these fit derived parameters we conclude that as was taken up by the solids produced in both bio feec and conventional feec systems via the binuclear corner sharing 2c surface complex where as v tetrahedra bind to the apical oxygen atoms of two adjacent edge sharing feo6 octahedra van genuchten et al 2012 waychunas et al 1993 we noted that the xanes lcfs revealed a slightly larger fraction of as iii in the conventional feec sample that was not reflected in the shell by shell fitting results which can be explained by the higher sensitivity of xanes analysis to small changes in as oxidation state therefore the conclusions obtained with shell by shell fits of the exafs data did not account for the additional complexity of the feec solids which contained 8 sorbed as iii 3 5 benefits and challenges of bio feec our results indicate that integrating biological as iii oxidation with feec can be advantageous to treat as iii contaminated water because of the lower fe dosage or cd requirement to achieve sufficiently low as levels in the effluent at a cd value of 10 c l the bio feec column removed as iii to well below 10 μg l whereas as in the effluent of the conventional feec column was considerably greater than the who recommended limit based on the results of the batch experiments the conventional feec column could have eventually achieved as removal to below 10 μg l but a much higher cd would be needed this higher cd for equivalent as removal requires a substantially higher applied current or electrolysis time which would lead to greater electricity consumption and a larger amount of fe sludge generated for instance in the bio feec column the average energy consumption and sludge production to remove 150 µg l as iii below 10 µg l for a cd of 10 c l under a constant voltage u of 2 1 v was 0 006 kwh m3 by eq 3 and 0 007 kg m3 respectively similarly for the conventional feec column to remove 150 µg l as iii below 10 µg l a cd of 100 c l might be necessary as observed in the batch feec system fig 2 which is 10 times higher than bio feec resulting in a tenfold increase in energy consumption and sludge generation of 0 06 kwh m3 by eq 3 and 0 07 kg m3 respectively compared to other removal techniques the power required for treating the as contaminated water by bio feec 0 06 kwh m3 is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the power requirement 3 4 kwh m3 reported for as treatment by membrane techniques schmidt et al 2016 furthermore because fe iii precipitates form in the presence of as during feec the amount of reactive surface area available for as sorption per mass of solid 50 µg as mg fe is significantly higher than for other fe based strategies including adsorption to pre synthesized fe iii oxide adsorbents or fe oxide coated sand filters thirunavukkarasu et al 2003 therefore the amount of sludge generated by bio feec for a given electrolyte composition is lower than other methods however it is important to note that direct comparisons of the power requirement and sludge production of different techniques is difficult because these parameters are highly dependent on solution composition hence the values of power consumption and sludge generation obtained for the bio feec system are relevant to the solution conditions used in this study and might not reflect exactly the values obtained in other types of as contaminated water 3 c energy uq where cenergy consumption of electricity per m3 of water treated wh m3 u total cell potential v q charge dosage c l the advantage of pre oxidizing as iii in feec in terms of lower cd and fe required for complete removal has been reported previously in systems where as iii was oxidized by chemical or electrochemical methods flores et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 however in the bio feec system the oxidation is performed biologically without the need of chemicals or electricity which is a benefit because chemicals can create secondary by products in water disinfection by products for naclo jackman and hughes 2010 and more electricity would lead to higher energy consumption furthermore a separate chemical oxidation step can lead to more complex supply chains for as treatment which is a major barrier to sustained operation of technologies particularly in decentralized areas finally the lower fe sludge production in the bio feec system compared to conventional feec also requires less waste management i e landfill disposal and reduces the backwashing frequency of the post filtration step due to less clogging of the filter beds although the bio feec system produces less as rich fe sludge than conventional feec proper handling and disposal of the sludge is still important from the perspective of safety and circularity identifying the most appropriate sludge disposal method is beyond the scope of our study but one method could be to dewater the sludge by passive settling and subsequent drying for re use in industry e g brick production hassan et al 2014 sullivan et al 2010 another approach can be stabilizing the sludge in concrete for re use in local construction roy et al 2019 however in both cases the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp test must be performed first to identify the leaching behavior of the waste which ensures minimal environmental contamination sullivan et al 2010 although our work suggests that the bio feec system can be an effective alternative to conventional feec or other standard as removal techniques some potential challenges of the system must be investigated before implementing it in practice for example whereas the biological layer can oxidize ammonium nh4 in groundwater gude et al 2018 which is an added benefit the biological layer can also enhance fe ii and manganese mn ii oxidation gülay et al 2018 vandenabeele et al 1992 the oxidation of fe ii and mn ii in the biological layer can result in their removal due to deposition of the solid oxidation products in the layer but this can also be disadvantageous as the deposited solids can clog the layer requiring more frequent backwashing or a conventional aeration filtration step prior to bio feec furthermore the presence of high concentrations of natural organic matter nom and total organic carbon toc in groundwater can impact the speciation of aqueous fe ii by complexation sundman 2014 which alters fe ii oxidation kinetics can decrease as adsorption on fe solids by competing for sorption sites redman et al 2002 and can enhance growth of the biological layer kott et al 1997 which can potentially lead to increased amounts of organic matter in subsequent treatment stages due to washout of biological material however we note that feec is effective at removing organic matter which suggests that washout from the biological layer might not substantially decrease the quality of treated water mcbeath et al 2020 the bio feec system also requires a startup period to establish the asob containing biofilm on the sand bed which can lead to additional energy needed for continuous water pumping during ripening this disadvantage can be avoided through accelerating the ripening phase by inoculating with already ripened sand from an existing as iii treatment plant or by adding more fe via feec to achieve sufficient as removal at the onset of treatment overall the attractiveness of the bio feec system lies particularly in that it can be implemented using locally available materials in conventional or decentralized systems with electricity consumption offset by solar panels which is appropriate for rural areas of south asia where as contamination of drinking water sources has led to catastrophic health impacts chakraborti et al 2010 4 conclusions in this study the novel integrated system of biological as iii oxidation and fe electrocoagulation to treat as iii contaminated water was investigated compared to the abiotic conventional feec system the integrated biological feec system showed more effective oxidation and removal of 150 µg l as iii to below 10 µg l without the need of chemicals the bio feec system reduced the fe dosage required by 10 times compared to conventional feec hence we propose that this integrated biological and electrochemical system can be a sustainable approach to remove as iii from water particularly in areas where costly

17436,arsenic as is a toxic element present in many ground water sources in the world most conventional as removal techniques require pre oxidation of the neutral arsenite as iii species to the negatively charged arsenate as v oxyanion to optimize as removal and minimize chemical use in this work a novel continuous flow as removal system was developed that combines biological as iii oxidation by bacteria with fe electrocoagulation ec an fe 0 based electrochemical technology that generates reactive fe iii precipitates to bind as the bio integrated feec system bio feec showed effective oxidation and removal of 150 µg l as iii without the need of chemicals to remove as to below the who guideline of 10 µg l 10 times lower charge dosage was required for the bio feec system compared to conventional feec this lower fe dosage requirement reduced sludge production and energy consumption the as iii oxidizing biomass was found to consist of bacteria belonging to comamonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and acidovorax which are capable of oxidizing as iii and are common in drinking water biofilms characterization of the as laden fe solids by x ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that both bio feec and conventional feec produced solids consistent with a mixture of lepidocrocite and 2 line ferrihydrite arsenic bound to the solids was dominantly as v but a slightly higher fraction of as v was detected in the bio feec solids compared to the conventional feec graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic electrocoagulation drinking water iron groundwater 1 introduction arsenic as contamination of drinking water sources especially groundwater has been a major global concern affecting many countries in the world including argentina bangladesh cambodia china india mexico the united states and vietnam it has been estimated that around 94 220 million people worldwide have been exposed to groundwater with toxic as concentrations podgorski and berg 2020 in water sources as is mainly present in two inorganic forms arsenite as iii and arsenate as v wan et al 2011 with the as iii species being more toxic and more prevalent in reduced groundwater aquifers than as v katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 nicomel et al 2015 chronic exposure to as in drinking water causes various diseases such as skin bladder and lung cancers reproductive disorders and neurodevelopmental disease in children kapaj et al 2006 tseng 1977 hence it is essential to remove as from contaminated water meant for drinking purposes with the provisional drinking water guideline of 10 µg l set by the world health organization who who 2004 many techniques have been proposed to remove as from drinking water such as coagulation and flocculation ion exchange adsorption to activated alumina or iron based sorbents and reverse osmosis feenstra et al 2007 mondal et al 2013 the efficiency of these techniques is improved by pre oxidation of the neutral as iii species to the negatively charged as v oxyanion h2aso4 haso4 2 goren et al 2020 kim and nriagu 2000 which is removed more readily by ion exchange precipitation and adsorption kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 effective as iii oxidation can be performed with chemical oxidants including o3 naclo and kmno4 kim and nriagu 2000 sorlini and gialdini 2010 however chemical oxidants can be expensive and can generate unwanted by products jackman and hughes 2010 that require additional treatment which increases the cost and complexity of treatment katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 hence new methods are needed that can overcome the drawbacks of conventional chemical methods to oxidize and remove as iii the biological oxidation of as iii by arsenic oxidizing bacteria asob is a promising alternative to chemical oxidation because asobs do not need auxiliary chemicals to oxidize as iii which reduces the supply chain and costs of as removal kamei ishikawa et al 2017 native asobs have been detected in a wide range of conditions including in as contaminated water and sediments ito et al 2012 and are hypothesized to oxidize as iii as a detoxification or energy generation for growth mechanism muller et al 2003 santini et al 2000 recently biological oxidation of as iii has also been reported in laboratory and industrial scale rapid sand filter systems due to growth and accumulation of an asob community in filter beds ripened with as iii contaminated groundwater crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018 lytle et al 2007 after biological as iii oxidation an additional treatment step is subsequently required to remove the dissolved as v one low cost and chemical free method is fe 0 electrolysis also known as fe electrocoagulation ec which involves in situ generation of fe iii precipitates to potentially bind as holt et al 2005 mollah et al 2004 moussa et al 2017 in ec a small electric current is applied to fe 0 electrodes in contact with contaminated water to generate fe ii ions which are then oxidized by dissolved oxygen do to produce reactive fe iii precipitates with a high as sorption affinity van genuchten et al 2012 after as sorption the as rich fe iii precipitates generated by ec can be removed by rapid sand filtration or gravitational settling while feec can remove both as iii and as v from water the removal of as iii requires substantially more fe proportional to charge passed and treatment time than as v amrose et al 2013 wan et al 2011 therefore pre oxidizing as iii should be considered to decrease the required energy and amount of produced sludge for equivalent as removal in this study biological as iii oxidation and feec were combined in a continuous flow setup this type of bio feec system according to our knowledge has not been demonstrated previously but has the potential to substantially reduce fe sludge production and energy consumption we evaluated the as removal efficacy of bio integrated feec and conventional feec in view of the biological conversion of dissolved as iii and the molecular scale structure and as uptake mechanism of the generated solid fe iii precipitates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dutch non chlorinated tap water characteristics in table s1 was used as the model water for all experiments both as iii and as v were added to the tap water from as iii and as v stock solutions that were prepared by dissolving defined amounts of sodium meta arsenite naaso2 or sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o sigma aldrich to 18 2 mω cm ultrapure water the ph of the experimental solutions was adjusted with naoh or h2so4 merck millipore and the water conductivity was increased to 1200 300 µs cm by adding nacl sigma aldrich 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 feec batch reactor batch ec experiments were conducted to understand the impact of charge dosage cd charge dosage rate cdr and initial as oxidation state on as removal which informed our selection of operating parameters during the pilot scale continuous flow experiments the feec batch reactor consisted of a 1 l glass beaker containing 0 8 l as solution tap water spiked with as iii or as v and two fe electrodes one cathode and one anode steel s235 in contact with the solution fig 1 a the electrodes had dimensions of 50 mm x 20 mm x 0 5 mm with a total submerged surface area of 12 cm2 each and an inter electrode gap of 1 cm before experiments the electrodes were immersed in 0 01 m h2so4 for 2 min and abraded with sand paper to remove any scale and rinsed with demineralized water the electrodes were connected to a direct current dc power supply tenma 72 10 500 to generate the fe precipitates the initial ph of the solution in all experiments was measured using a multimeter wtwtm multilinetm multi 3630 ids and was maintained between 7 0 8 0 by manual additions of 0 01 m h2so4 and 0 1 m naoh in all ec batch experiments the solutions were stirred using a magnetic stirrer labinco l23 at 150 rpm the initial do was measured between 8 0 9 0 mg o2 l using the multimeter in feec the as removal efficiency depends on the amount of fe generated in the solution and the rate at which it is generated amrose et al 2013 the amount and rate of fe generated is proportional to the cd q in c l and cdr dq dt in c l min by faraday s law eq 1 and 2 1 w qm nf itm nfv 2 dq dt i v where w amount of dissolved electrode material mg l i current ma t electrolysis time min m molecular weight of fe mg mol 55 845 f faraday s constant 96 485 c mol n number of transferred electrons 2 for fe v solution volume l the batch experiments were performed by applying a range of cd and cdrs to tap water containing 150 µg l as iii or as v table 1 shows the applied cd and cdrs for the batch experiments along with the corresponding electrolysis time applied current and the theoretical amount of fe generated by faraday s law to determine as removal for a given cd water samples were collected before and after ec without additional mixing time or precipitate settling and analyzed for total as and fe as well as aqueous as iii and as v 2 2 2 biological filter columns biological filter columns were used to establish an as iii oxidizing microbial community in the filter beds through ripening with as iii water the setup consisted of two duplicate down flow cylindrical columns 2 m high 9 cm diameter made from pvc containing an anthracite layer size fraction 2 0 4 0 mm coarse sand layer size fraction 1 4 2 0 mm and garnet layer size fraction 0 3 0 6 mm each 30 cm high fig 1 b before the experiments the columns were backwashed with tap water until the supernatant was visually clear the columns were then loaded continuously with tap water spiked with 150 µg l as iii for 49 days at a flow rate of 1 m h to establish the oxidizing biomass a supernatant level of 40 cm was maintained above the anthracite bed the development of as iii oxidation in the columns was monitored by measuring as speciation in the influent and effluent at 7 day intervals after ripening column effluents from both columns were taken from the bottom location of the anthracite bed as speciation showed 95 oxidation of 150 µg l influent as iii in the anthracite bed at 49 days and feec was applied in batch mode these separate experiments were performed to verify the performance of feec in solutions where as iii was oxidized biologically and to determine the minimum cd i e fe dosage required to remove 150 µg l oxidized as v below 10 µg l 2 2 3 bio feec system after performing the feec batch experiments and establishing the as iii oxidizing biomass the integrated bio feec set up was assembled the setup for the bio feec system consisted of a similar down flow column as described in section 2 2 2 augmented with an feec electrochemical cell the column contained the ripened anthracite layer containing oxidizing biomass at the top followed by an feec cell consisting of two fe electrodes 60 mm x 30 mm x 0 5 mm connected to the dc power supply the bottom of the column contained sand layers to collect the generated fe solids during feec fig 1 c an identical control feec flow through system was created that consisted of only a conventional feec cell without a biological oxidation pre layer fig 1 c tap water spiked with 150 µg l as iii was introduced to both systems at 1 m h the bio feec and conventional feec systems were run for 3 days with an experimental run time of 6 h each day during which the feec cell was operated after 6 h the current applied to the feec cell was stopped and the as iii spiked tap water was allowed to flow through the columns continuously after 3 days the two systems were backwashed to collect the as laden fe solids that were trapped in the bottom sand layers for molecular scale characterization by fe and as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy xas for both column systems the as removal efficiency was determined over the 6 h operating cycles by measuring the difference in dissolved as concentrations at the influent and just above the lower sand layers 2 3 chemical analyses water samples in triplicates were collected 1 unfiltered 2 filtered over 0 45 µm polysthersulfone filters macherey nagel gmbh co kg and 3 filtered over 0 45 µm filters and an anionic resin for as speciation after collection the samples were acidified using ultrapure nitric acid rotipuran ultra 69 to dissolve any fe precipitates the samples were then stored at 4 c before analysis for total as and fe as well as aqueous as iii and as v by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analytikal jena model plasmaquant ms for as speciation an anionic exchange resin amberlite ira 400 chlorite form resin was used following the clifford method as explained in gude et al 2018 2 4 x ray absorption spectroscopy solids for fe and as k edge xas analysis were obtained by backwashing the bio feec and conventional feec columns and filtering the backwashed water with filter papers the filter papers containing the solids were then stored at 80 c before preparation for xas analysis fe and as k edge xas data were collected at beam line 2 2 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl menlo park usa fe k edge xas data were recorded at room temperature out to k of 13 å 1 and as k edge xas data were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures 80 k in fluorescence mode out to k of 14 å 1 beam calibration was performed by setting the maximum of the first derivative of fe 0 to 7112 ev or au 0 to 11 919 ev for fe and as k edge xas data respectively the sixpack software was used for spectral alignment averaging and background subtraction webb 2005 following standard procedures van genuchten et al 2012 the exafs spectra were extracted using k3 weighting and were fourier transformed using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 over the k range 2 to 11 å 1 for fe data or 2 to 13 å 1 for as data the as k edge xas data were analyzed by linear combination fits lcfs of the xanes spectra and shell by shell fits of the exafs spectra using the sixpack software the lcfs were performed over the energy range of 11 860 to 11 880 ev using reference spectra of as iii and as v adsorbed to two line ferrihydrite 2lfh which were collected previously at beam line 4 1 of ssrl under similar conditions as the current data set the shell by shell fits were performed in r δr space based on algorithms derived from ifeffit newville 2001 theoretical phase and amplitude functions for single and multiple scattering paths used in the fits were calculated using feff6 rehr et al 1992 and were derived from the structure of scorodite kitahama et al 1975 additional details on xas sample preparation and data collection and the shell by shell fitting procedure are provided in the supplementary materials 2 5 microbial characterization to characterize the as iii oxidizing biomass that grew and accumulated in the biological sand filters due to ripening with as iii rich water a set of duplicate up flow biological sand columns 1 m x 4 cm diameter pvc containing quartz filter sand size fraction 0 7 1 25 mm bed height 75 cm was ripened with tap water containing 100 µg l as iii for a period of 60 days figure s1 after establishing the oxidizing biomass on the sand bed sand samples 100 ml were taken for dna extraction at the bottom 15 cm of the columns location of influent to characterize the biomass by high throughput sequencing hts of 16s rrna genes total genome dna of the biomass on the sand samples was extracted using ctab sds method the concentration and purity of the dna was monitored on 1 agarose gels and the dna was diluted to 1 ng μl using sterile water depending on the concentration the bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using specific primer and the pcr reactions were carried out with a phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs the pcr products were mixed with same volume of 1x loading buffer to operate electrophoresis on 2 agarose gel for detection samples with a bright main strip between 400 and 450 bp were considered for further analysis the pcr products were then mixed in equidensity ratios and purified using qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany nebnex t ultra dna library pre kit illumina was then used to generate sequencing libraries the library quality was assessed on the qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo scientific and agilent bioanalyzer 2100 system and sequenced on an illumina platform to generate 250 bp paired end reads paired end reads were merged using flash v1 2 7 magoč et al 2011 to generate raw tags on which quality filtering was performed according to the qiime v1 7 0 caporaso et al 2010 to generate high quality clean tags the tags were then compared with the reference gold database using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 to obtain effective tags by detecting and removing chimera sequences uparse software uparse v7 0 100 edgar 2013 was used for sequence analysis and sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus to obtain taxonomic information the representative sequence for each otu was annotated by the rdp classifier version 2 2 wang et al 2007 algorithm using greengene database desantis et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 as removal in feec batch experiments in order to understand the dependency of as v and as iii removal on different ec operational parameters in the specific test water matrix batch feec experiments were conducted fig 2 shows the changes in dissolved as iii and as v concentrations over the various applied cd values 0 200 c l at a cdr of 15 c l min it was observed that as the cd increased the dissolved as concentration decreased which is consistent with previously reported ec batch studies amrose et al 2013 delaire et al 2017 goren et al 2020 van genuchten et al 2012 wan et al 2011 the concentration of total fe increased linearly with cd and matched the theoretical fe concentration based on faraday s law eq 1 i e faradaic efficiency 1 müller et al 2019 at cd values of 100 c l and above i e fe dosages 29 mg l or fe as 260 mol mol the dissolved as level decreased below the who guideline of 10 µg l regardless the initial as oxidation state and reached as low as 2 µg l for cds of 150 and 200 c l since as removal in feec occurs via sorption to co precipitated fe iii oxyhydr oxides kobya et al 2016 the enhanced as removal at increasing cd can be explained by a higher concentration of fe iii precipitates and the corresponding availability of more as sorption sites although both as iii and as v removal was observed in feec batch experiments solutions initially containing as v required a lower cd 10 c l or fe as 26 mol mol than as iii 100 c l or fe as 260 mol mol to meet the who guideline of 10 µg l this result can be explained by the higher affinity of the generated fe precipitates for as v than as iii roberts et al 2004 with as iii as the initial species the oxidation to as v in solution was observed for cd values of 10 25 and 50 c l which is consistent with the formation of reactive intermediates during feec operation that oxidize as iii to as v van genuchten et al 2012 at higher cd dissolved as v was not observed which can be explained by the presence of excess fe leading to complete adsorption of dissolved as v dixit and hering 2003 raven et al 1998 when cdr was varied slightly more effective as iii removal was observed at the lowest cdr of 5 c l min figure s2 and s3 consistent with previous work delaire et al 2017 li et al 2012 3 2 biological as iii oxidation in filter columns the as speciation in the effluent of the duplicate down flow biological filter columns over the experimental period of 49 days is shown in fig 3 at the start of this ripening stage day 1 28 30 10 of the influent as iii was recovered in the filtrate however by 35 days complete oxidation of 150 µg l as iii developed in the columns which remained stable until the end of the experiment the ph do electrical conductivity and temperature were steady during the experimental period at 7 5 0 5 8 1 mg l 300 100 μs cm and 20 2 c respectively also it must be noted that the total as concentration in the effluent was consistently lower 3 26 than in influent indicating adsorption to the fresh filter materials anthracite sand and garnet on day 49 additional samples were collected for as speciation after the anthracite layer revealing that 95 of as iii was oxidized in the top layer therefore this 30 cm layer was considered suitable for biological pre treatment and was shifted upward prior to feec for follow up experiments a similar as iii oxidation pattern was observed in the two up flow columns which were used for characterization of the accumulated as iii oxidizing biomass figure s4 high throughput sequencing hts of the biomass dna generated otus of 730 and 811 and 609 and 562 from duplicate samples of each column respectively fig 4 a depicts the relative abundance ra percentage of total otus of the top 10 classes which accounted for more than 97 of the entire biomass in each sample alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were the two most abundant classes in the two columns having a ra of 55 67 and 21 28 respectively which is in agreement with findings of cavalca et al 2013 both of these classes belong to the most abundant phylum proteobacteria figure s5 furthermore classification at the family level showed the presence of microorganisms affiliated with comamonadaceae ra 15 20 class betaproteobacteria and rhodobacteraceae ra 7 5 10 class alphaproteobacteria fig 4 b which are known to oxidize as iii crognale et al 2019 additionally the as iii oxidizing genus acidovorax ra 0 6 1 4 in the comamonadaceae family was also observed fig 4 c which is a genus that is common in the rapid sand filters of drinking water treatment plants treating as free water vandermaesen et al 2017 but that also oxidize as iii cavalca et al 2013 while as iii oxidizing biomass is commonly reported in sand filters for groundwater treatment crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 our results indicate that a similar as iii oxidizing biomass can also develop in sand filters running on chlorine free tap water sourced from a surface water body 3 3 as iii removal by bio feec 3 3 1 batch experiments after ripening of the biological columns batch feec experiments were performed on the column effluent which contained 150 µg l as v to determine the optimal operational parameters for the continuous flow experiments fig 5 shows the change in dissolved as iii and as v concentrations after applying various cds 0 200 c l at a cdr of 5 c l min to the column effluent and to an unoxidized as iii spiked tap water solution for reference the as removal in the column effluent was similar to that of the feec experiment using tap water containing as v as the initial as species figure s2 left for feec experiments in both the biological column effluent and the as v solution a cd of 10 c l at cdr of 5 c l min was able to remove 150 μg l as to below the 10 μg l who guideline whereas a cd of 100 c l was needed to achieve the same level with the reference as iii solution the faradaic efficiency for the feec experiments in the column effluents containing oxidized as v was near 1 which was similar to the values obtained for feec experiments in standard as v solution figure s2 left this result suggests that biological as iii oxidation did not impact the electrochemical oxidation of fe 0 and the release of fe ii to the bulk solution 3 3 2 continuous flow experiments the operating parameters of cd 10 c l applied at cdr 5 c l min were selected for the continuous flow bio feec experiments based on the results from the batch ec experiments using the biological column effluent the voltage observed in the dc current supplier to achieve the required cd and cdr in both column systems was 2 1 v fig 6 depicts the results during the 3 day experimental duration for both the bio feec left and the conventional feec right continuous flow systems the results indicate that both systems removed as but only the bio feec system was able to decrease as levels to below the who guideline of 10 μg l despite identical operating parameters i e flow rate cd cdr in the bio feec system the dissolved as concentration decreased from 150 30 μg l to approximately 2 1 μg l 98 removal the dissolved as concentration was consistently higher than the who guideline in the conventional feec system with approximately 38 4 μg l remaining in solution 73 removal which consisted of 75 5 as iii it was also observed that the as iii removal efficiency of the conventional feec column was higher 73 as removal than the feec batch experiments using the as iii spiked tap water 42 as removal despite the similar operating parameters cd 10 c l and cdr 5 c l min this result can be explained by the accumulation of fe solids on top of the supporting filter layers in the continuous flow system this explanation is based on the measured total fe concentration of approximately 7 mg l in unfiltered samples of the conventional feec column system which is greater than the theoretical fe value of 3 mg l eq 1 expected based on faraday s law the accumulated fe solids allow for extended contact time with dissolved as resulting in greater as adsorption per fe mass although the fe concentration was also significantly higher than the theoretical faradaic value in the bio feec column no difference in as removal per charge passed was observed in the bio feec because of the nearly complete removal of the oxidized as v however the accumulation of fe in both continuous flow systems suggests that the bio feec column could be operated at even lower cd and still achieve as iii removal to below 10 μg l 3 4 characterization of fe as solids after the 6 h operating cycles over the 3 day experimental duration the filter columns were backwashed and the solids were characterized by fe and as k edge xas fig 7 the fe k edge exafs spectra showed no notable difference in line shape or phase of the oscillations for samples collected from the bio feec and conventional feec columns indicating a similar average structure of the generated fe iii precipitates based on characteristic fingerprints in the exafs spectra including the asymmetric first oscillation from 3 to 5 5 å 1 the solids are consistent with a mixture of lepidocrocite γ feooh and poorly ordered fe iii precipitates e g 2 line ferrihydrite 2lfh fig 7 a the formation of a mixture of lepidocrocite and 2lfh can be attributed to the composition of the as iii rich tap water table s1 and is consistent with solids formed in previous feec studies at similar ph and total as fe ratios van genuchten et al 2014 wan et al 2011 previous studies on fe oxidizing bacteria have shown that fe iii precipitates produced by various types of bacteria often have unique structures because biogenic dissolved organic compounds can interfere with fe iii oxyhydr oxide crystallization pathway toner et al 2009 however the fe k edge exafs spectra of solids from both systems were similar indicating that the bacteria upstream of the feec cell did not interfere with fe iii polymerization instead the inorganic composition of the solution played a more important role in determining the fe iii precipitate structure the formation of poorly ordered solids such as 2lfh in the bio feec and conventional feec system can be advantageous for as adsorption because of their higher proportion of reactive surface area per mass i e specific surface area compared to more crystalline fe phases dixit and hering 2003 the as k edge xanes data for samples collected from the bio feec and conventional feec systems indicate that the oxidation state of as bound to the solids was predominantly as v for both systems based on the position of the absorption maximum near 11 875 ev fig 7 b and c the predominance of solid phase as v in the conventional feec system is in line with the oxidation of as iii during feec due to the formation of reactive intermediates li et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2012 although as v was the major species inbound to both bio feec and conventional feec solids the lcfs of the xanes spectra indicated a slightly higher as iii percentage for solids in the conventional feec system 8 compared to those of the bio feec system 2 these results confirm that the as removal pathway for both columns involved as iii oxidation however unlike the bio feec system the abiotic as iii oxidation pathway of the conventional feec column was not sufficient to oxidize all as iii consequently as iii was observed bound to the fe solids of the conventional feec column and was the dominant form of as in effluent which was substantially higher 38 4 μg l than the bio feec system 2 1 μg l the as k edge exafs spectra of the solids collected from both continuous flow systems were similar consistent with the as k edge xanes data and both matched the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed to 2lfh to confirm the exact as bonding mode to the fe iii precipitates in both systems shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed exafs spectra were performed the output of the fits is overlain to the data in fig 7 d and the fitting parameters are summarized in table s2 the fitting results were identical for both conventional feec and bio feec samples within fit derived standard errors indicating a similar as uptake mode the fitting output for both samples also matched that of the reference spectrum of as v adsorbed 2lfh the first shell fits of the samples returned values for the as o coordination number cnas o of 4 3 to 4 6 and as o interatomic distance ras o of 1 69 å which is consistent with tetrahedrally coordinated as v waychunas et al 1993 the second shell fits of both samples yielded cnas fe values of 1 4 to 1 6 and an ras fe of 3 28 å which was identical to the fits of as v adsorbed to 2lfh within fit derived standard errors table s2 based on these fit derived parameters we conclude that as was taken up by the solids produced in both bio feec and conventional feec systems via the binuclear corner sharing 2c surface complex where as v tetrahedra bind to the apical oxygen atoms of two adjacent edge sharing feo6 octahedra van genuchten et al 2012 waychunas et al 1993 we noted that the xanes lcfs revealed a slightly larger fraction of as iii in the conventional feec sample that was not reflected in the shell by shell fitting results which can be explained by the higher sensitivity of xanes analysis to small changes in as oxidation state therefore the conclusions obtained with shell by shell fits of the exafs data did not account for the additional complexity of the feec solids which contained 8 sorbed as iii 3 5 benefits and challenges of bio feec our results indicate that integrating biological as iii oxidation with feec can be advantageous to treat as iii contaminated water because of the lower fe dosage or cd requirement to achieve sufficiently low as levels in the effluent at a cd value of 10 c l the bio feec column removed as iii to well below 10 μg l whereas as in the effluent of the conventional feec column was considerably greater than the who recommended limit based on the results of the batch experiments the conventional feec column could have eventually achieved as removal to below 10 μg l but a much higher cd would be needed this higher cd for equivalent as removal requires a substantially higher applied current or electrolysis time which would lead to greater electricity consumption and a larger amount of fe sludge generated for instance in the bio feec column the average energy consumption and sludge production to remove 150 µg l as iii below 10 µg l for a cd of 10 c l under a constant voltage u of 2 1 v was 0 006 kwh m3 by eq 3 and 0 007 kg m3 respectively similarly for the conventional feec column to remove 150 µg l as iii below 10 µg l a cd of 100 c l might be necessary as observed in the batch feec system fig 2 which is 10 times higher than bio feec resulting in a tenfold increase in energy consumption and sludge generation of 0 06 kwh m3 by eq 3 and 0 07 kg m3 respectively compared to other removal techniques the power required for treating the as contaminated water by bio feec 0 06 kwh m3 is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the power requirement 3 4 kwh m3 reported for as treatment by membrane techniques schmidt et al 2016 furthermore because fe iii precipitates form in the presence of as during feec the amount of reactive surface area available for as sorption per mass of solid 50 µg as mg fe is significantly higher than for other fe based strategies including adsorption to pre synthesized fe iii oxide adsorbents or fe oxide coated sand filters thirunavukkarasu et al 2003 therefore the amount of sludge generated by bio feec for a given electrolyte composition is lower than other methods however it is important to note that direct comparisons of the power requirement and sludge production of different techniques is difficult because these parameters are highly dependent on solution composition hence the values of power consumption and sludge generation obtained for the bio feec system are relevant to the solution conditions used in this study and might not reflect exactly the values obtained in other types of as contaminated water 3 c energy uq where cenergy consumption of electricity per m3 of water treated wh m3 u total cell potential v q charge dosage c l the advantage of pre oxidizing as iii in feec in terms of lower cd and fe required for complete removal has been reported previously in systems where as iii was oxidized by chemical or electrochemical methods flores et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 however in the bio feec system the oxidation is performed biologically without the need of chemicals or electricity which is a benefit because chemicals can create secondary by products in water disinfection by products for naclo jackman and hughes 2010 and more electricity would lead to higher energy consumption furthermore a separate chemical oxidation step can lead to more complex supply chains for as treatment which is a major barrier to sustained operation of technologies particularly in decentralized areas finally the lower fe sludge production in the bio feec system compared to conventional feec also requires less waste management i e landfill disposal and reduces the backwashing frequency of the post filtration step due to less clogging of the filter beds although the bio feec system produces less as rich fe sludge than conventional feec proper handling and disposal of the sludge is still important from the perspective of safety and circularity identifying the most appropriate sludge disposal method is beyond the scope of our study but one method could be to dewater the sludge by passive settling and subsequent drying for re use in industry e g brick production hassan et al 2014 sullivan et al 2010 another approach can be stabilizing the sludge in concrete for re use in local construction roy et al 2019 however in both cases the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp test must be performed first to identify the leaching behavior of the waste which ensures minimal environmental contamination sullivan et al 2010 although our work suggests that the bio feec system can be an effective alternative to conventional feec or other standard as removal techniques some potential challenges of the system must be investigated before implementing it in practice for example whereas the biological layer can oxidize ammonium nh4 in groundwater gude et al 2018 which is an added benefit the biological layer can also enhance fe ii and manganese mn ii oxidation gülay et al 2018 vandenabeele et al 1992 the oxidation of fe ii and mn ii in the biological layer can result in their removal due to deposition of the solid oxidation products in the layer but this can also be disadvantageous as the deposited solids can clog the layer requiring more frequent backwashing or a conventional aeration filtration step prior to bio feec furthermore the presence of high concentrations of natural organic matter nom and total organic carbon toc in groundwater can impact the speciation of aqueous fe ii by complexation sundman 2014 which alters fe ii oxidation kinetics can decrease as adsorption on fe solids by competing for sorption sites redman et al 2002 and can enhance growth of the biological layer kott et al 1997 which can potentially lead to increased amounts of organic matter in subsequent treatment stages due to washout of biological material however we note that feec is effective at removing organic matter which suggests that washout from the biological layer might not substantially decrease the quality of treated water mcbeath et al 2020 the bio feec system also requires a startup period to establish the asob containing biofilm on the sand bed which can lead to additional energy needed for continuous water pumping during ripening this disadvantage can be avoided through accelerating the ripening phase by inoculating with already ripened sand from an existing as iii treatment plant or by adding more fe via feec to achieve sufficient as removal at the onset of treatment overall the attractiveness of the bio feec system lies particularly in that it can be implemented using locally available materials in conventional or decentralized systems with electricity consumption offset by solar panels which is appropriate for rural areas of south asia where as contamination of drinking water sources has led to catastrophic health impacts chakraborti et al 2010 4 conclusions in this study the novel integrated system of biological as iii oxidation and fe electrocoagulation to treat as iii contaminated water was investigated compared to the abiotic conventional feec system the integrated biological feec system showed more effective oxidation and removal of 150 µg l as iii to below 10 µg l without the need of chemicals the bio feec system reduced the fe dosage required by 10 times compared to conventional feec hence we propose that this integrated biological and electrochemical system can be a sustainable approach to remove as iii from water particularly in areas where costly

17437,ammonium is typically removed from wastewater by converting it to nitrogen gas using microorganisms precluding its recovery copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf is known to reversibly intercalate alkali cations in aqueous electrolytes due to the prussian blue crystal structure we used this property to create a carbon based intercalation electrode within an electrochemical cell depending on the electrode potential it can recover nh4 from wastewater via insertion regeneration while leaving organics in the first phase different binders were evaluated towards creating a stable electrode matrix with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose giving the best performance subsequently based on voltammetry we determined an intercalation potential for nh4 removal of 0 3 v vs ag agcl while the regeneration potential of the electrode was 1 1 v vs ag agcl using the cuhcf electrodes 95 of the nh4 in a synthetic wastewater containing 56 mm nh4 and 68 mm methanol was removed with an energy input of 0 34 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 a similar removal of 93 was obtained using an actual industrial wastewater 56 mm nh4 68 mm methanol 0 02 mm no2 0 05 mm no3 0 04 mm so4 2 and 0 34 mm ethanol with an energy input of 0 40 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 in both cases there was negligible removal of organics the stability of cuhcf electrodes was evaluated either by open circuit potential monitoring 61 h or by cyclic voltammetry 50 h 116 cycles the stability during cycling of the electrode was determined in both synthetic and real streams for 25 h 125 cycles the charge density c cm 1 of the cuhcf electrodes declined by 17 and 19 after 125 cycles in the synthetic stream and the actual wastewater respectively this study highlights the possibility of low cost cuhcf coated electrodes for achieving separation of nh4 from streams containing methanol the stability of electrodes has been improved but needs to be further enhanced for large scale applications and long term operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen removal electrochemical separation organics and inorganics separation industrial wastewater 1 introduction industrial sites such as tanneries urea and fertilizer producers generate waste streams containing ammonium nitrogen nh4 n the concentration of ammonium in wastewater generated from the fertilizer industry can range from 6 to 1700 mg l 1 bhandari et al 2016 a wide range of established technologies has been investigated to reduce the release of nh4 n into the environment removal by conversion to nitrogen gas via biological nitrification and denitrification and recovery via ammonia stripping ion exchange membrane technologies or precipitation as struvite nevertheless each of these technologies has high energetic and operational costs for example 26 to 31 kwh kg 1 n using ammonia stripping eekert van et al 2012 substantial chemical addition is often needed for ph control in stripping and for carbon supplementation during denitrification moreover incomplete separation of ammonium from nitrogen based fertilizer processing wastewater due to impurities such as methanol and ethanol krishnaswamy et al 2012 the major method for ammonia production is the haber bosch process which produces more than 96 of global production of ammonia per year as this process uses natural gas or oil directly as an energy source it is one of the largest global energy consumers 14 kwh kg 1 n and greenhouse gas emitters qin et al 2017 smith et al 2020 thus an effective and economical method is needed to remove and recover ammonium from wastewater here we investigated a newly developed strategy using an electrochemical cell ec with intercalation electrodes containing copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf for removing and recovering ammonium from a wastewater containing methanol metal hexacyanoferrate mhcf analogues axm fe cn 6 y zh2o have a well studied prussian blue open framework crystal structure which have ion insertion properties and have diverse applications such as

highly crystalline nanoparticles of copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf have been studied for nh4 removal and recovery due to their electrocatalytic ion exchange capacity low toxicity and chemical stability in a wide ph range of 0 1 to 10 parajuli et al 2016 in cuhcf the cu2 ions are octahedrally coordinated to the nitrogen ends of the cn groups and the fe3 ions to carbon ends few k ions probably occupies the a sites during nanoparticles synthesis process on the insertion of nh4 ions a sites are occupied by nh4 ions corresponding to the reduction of some of the carbon coordinated fe3 supporting information figure s1 the carbon coordinated fe2 ions are oxidized during regeneration while nh4 ions in the a sites are extracted out of the cuhcf son et al 2020 achieved 8 4 1 4 g nh4 g electrode cell voltage 0 3 v removal capacity of the cuhcf electrodes in a background electrolyte of 10 mm mgcl2 over a range of 10 to 100 mm nh4cl kim et al 2018b used cuhcf based electrodes to remove nh4 from domestic wastewater 5 or 3 4 mmol l 1 and obtained a maximum nh4 removal efficiency of 85 with high selectivity over na under a constant cell voltage over 200 s however the performance of electrodes with industrial wastewaters and the effects of potentials on insertion regeneration were not examined moreover the many previously reported tests only reported the stability over hours whereas in practice an electrode will need to be stable over many months to years the goal of this study was to evaluate the performance and stability of cuhcf based electrodes under fixed potentials for insertion regeneration of nh4 from a specific industrial wastewater containing methanol we initially assessed the suitability of two binders for the assembly of cuhcf electrodes and studied the impact of potentials on the removal efficiency of nh4 from a synthetic stream in order to establish the potential window nh4 removal tests were then performed with both synthetic and actual industrial streams after establishing an optimal binder and working potentials the stability and cycling life of the electrodes were examined through the evolution of the current density and the dissolution of the functional coating material over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of cuhcf and electrode preparation cuhcf powder was synthesized through co precipitation wessells et al 2011 equal

deionized water for washing out unreacted ions the final product was dried in a 105 c oven for 5 h to obtain a cuhcf powder the dried cuhcf powder was ground into a uniform powder with a ceramic

current collector and glued to the non treated surface of graphite carbon plate by silver paint finally the four lateral sides of the electrodes comprising the silver painted surfaces were insulated with epoxy glue ts10 thorlabs europe new electrodes were rinsed with milli q water before applying in tests and a new electrode was used in each removal test 2 2 screening of binding agents

conductivity of the electrode which were examined as binding agents three tested slurry compositions slurry a b and c containing one of the two binding agents supporting information table s1 were used to evaluate the impact of binders on the performance of cuhcf electrode by cyclic voltammetry cv electrodes coated with one of the three different cuhcf slurry compositions were firstly weighed to unify weights before analyses then the electrodes were rinsed with milli q water and separately moved into a 3 electrode setup 60 ml open glass beakers filled with 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl for performing cv

after completing 10 cycles of cv program for each electrode cuhcf electrodes were separately immersing into a setup containing fresh electrolyte 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl accompanied by constant stirring over 72 h then electrodes were moved back to the electrochemical setup for another 10 cycles of cv analyses to evaluate the effect of binding agents on the stability of the cuhcf electrode over long term immersion 2 3 ammonium removal tests ammonium removal tests were performed in a custom built electrochemical cell ec fig 1 the ec consisted of two compartments internal dimensions 2 5 0 25 cm made from two perspex frames separated by an anion exchange membrane aem ultrex ami 7001 membranes international inc usa a graphite carbon electrode without cuhcf coating was used as counter electrode dimensions 2 5 0 25 cm the cuhcf working electrode slurry c and counter electrode were inlaid in the anode and cathode compartment respectively rubber sheet seals were sandwiched between compartments and aem to create a liquid tight seal and the frames were bolted together a vsp multi potentiostat bio logic science instruments sas claix france was used for electrochemical control the half cell potential of the working electrode was determined with a ag agcl reference electrode assumed as 0 197 v vs she in the compartment of cuhcf electrode the appropriate insertion and regeneration potentials were evaluated by performing nh4 removal tests using the synthetic stream table 1 under constant insertion potentials of 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 v and regeneration potentials of 0 9 1 0 and 1 1 v vs ag agcl the operational time for each potential was defined as the time needed for the absolute current to reach a steady state both anode and cathode compartments were first fed with synthetic wastewater and then recirculated at a flow rate of 8 ml min 1 with a peristaltic pump watson marlow 530u usa the total volume of the recirculated solution that filled the flow cell and tubing was 40 ml in terms of recirculation rate of 20 ml min 1 hrt of 2 min for each compartment the same electrode was applied in insertion or regeneration tests to prevent differences due to possible inconsistencies in the preparation of the coating material the charge densities and the nh4 concentrations were recorded and analyzed to investigate the appropriate insertion and regeneration potentials longer ammonium removal tests which included 20 cycles of alternating insertion and regeneration processes were run with synthetic and industrial wastewater at the selected insertion and regeneration potentials of 0 3 and 1 1v vs ag agcl electrochemical cell with same configuration as previous tests was applied in long term ammonium removal experiments the real wastewater table 1 was collected from the effluent of a chemical company producing nitrogen fertilizer and nitrogen based chemicals the wastewater was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size filter type gvwp milliporesigma before use the working electrode was regenerated before the beginning of the tests by applying a potential of 1 1 v vs ag agcl until the current reached a steady state a fresh synthetic stream was applied in each regeneration cycle but the same synthetic or real stream was maintained during the 20 cycles of insertion process the concentration of nh4 was evaluated to determine the capacity of insertion and regeneration for each cycle 2 4 stability and long term cycling of cuhcf electrode the stability of the cuhcf electrode was assessed with a 3 electrode system in a beaker containing 60 ml electrolyte a graphite rod dimensions 0 03 cm2 x 6 cm national electrical carbon bv netherlands was used as counter electrode the electrolyte containing 1 mol l 1 nh4no3 or nh4cl was used to evaluate the stability of the cuhcf based electrode through open circuit potential ocp and cv analyses the ocp analysis was performed in a three electrode setup 60 ml glass beaker with continuous stirring and the cvs were performed at a scan rate of 1 mv s 1 in a suitable medium the stability of electrodes was evaluated via ocp and cv by observing the changes in the current density and cuhcf particles physically peeling off in the electrolyte the long term cycling performance of cuhcf based electrodes over more than 100 insertion and regeneration cycles was performed in a flow cell using either synthetic or actual wastewaters using only a single insertion and regeneration potential 0 3 and 1 1 v ag agcl samples for cu2 analysis were taken regularly centrifuged at 14650 xg for 5 min filtered through a 0 22 μm pore diameter syringe filter type gvwp milliporesigma and acidified with nitric acid 10 before storage and later analysis 2 5 analytical methods xrd measurements of cuhcf particles were carried out on a bruker d8 discover xrd system equipped with a cu x ray source λ 1 5406 å and a linear x ray detector using a si sample cup ex situ xrd measurements were carried out in air at atmospheric pressure at 24 c scanning electron microscopy sem images of cuhcf particles were recorded at an acceleration voltage of 15 kev with a jsm 7600f field emission sem instrument phenom prox thermo fisher scientific usa samples were mounted on aluminum stubs using a double sided adhesive carbon tape and sputtered with au to reduce charging effects the particle size of cuhcf after

measured by flame atomic adsorption spectrometry aas shimadzu aa 6300 shimadzu scientific instruments somerset nj usa prior to analysis samples were filtered with 0 02 µm and acidified with 10 nitric

supp 5 150 4 column equipped with a metrosep a supp 4 5 guard column 4 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 copper hexacyanoferrate synthesis and binder selection the cuhcf powder had a highly crystalline structure that consisted of aggregates of nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 20 50 nm fig 2 a b the determined composition based on x ray diffraction fig 2a was k0 76 cu fe cn 6 0 66 the size of most of cuhcf nanoparticles was below 50 µm after the granulometric separation but complete dispersion of the nps could not be achieved as cuhcf nanoparticles coalesced as large agglomerates under the conditions of preparation of the adsorbent supporting information fig s1 cv analysis 3 electrode system of three electrode slurries created with different binders resulted in similar mid point potentials of 0 79 0 03 v vs ag agcl before the immersion test indicating no impact of the type of binders on the oxidation or reduction reactions fig 3 the ratio between the anodic and cathodic peak current density was close to 1 for all electrodes consistent with a reversible electrochemical reaction kim et al 2018a slurry c cmc and carbon black had the highest redox peak current densities of 0 58 and 0 54 a g cuhcf 1 the conductivity of slurry c was in between that of slurry a and b which indicated that the high current density of slurry c was most likely the result of a more efficient interaction of the cuhcf with the nh4 ions rather than an increased material conductivity supporting information table s2 after 72 h of immersion in 60 ml glass beakers the electrolytes in tests with slurry a and c remained clear and no particles were observed in the solution at ph 6 15 the impact of carbon black on electrode stability was further investigated by comparing cv analysis of slurry b with other two slurries the oxidation regeneration peak of the electrode with slurry b decreased from 0 35 to 0 18 a g cuhcf 1 while the reduction insertion peak current density declined from 0 35 to 0 2 a g cuhcf 1 which were all lower than other two slurries fig 3 the electrolyte in the experiment with slurry b turned brownish after immersion indicating degradation of the electrode although pedot pss and cmc can be independently used as sole binders li et al 2017 wang et al 2012 carbon black is still needed to ensure a close electrical connection between cuhcf material and binders as well as to stabilize the electrochemical performance of the electrodes shi et al 2017 the redox peak current densities of slurry c remained considerably higher compared with the other two slurries fig 3 indicating a more stable performance of the cmc binder than the pedot pss therefore the cmc binder slurry c was selected for further experiments 3 2 ammonium removal from synthetic and industrial wastewater the optimal nh4 insertion and electrode regeneration potentials for ammonia removal were selected based on four parameters the charge density c cm 2 supporting information fig s5 the concentration of inserted extracted nh4 mg l 1 the energy input wh g 1 nh4 supporting information eq 1 and the insertion regeneration capacity mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 the effect of the insertion regeneration potential on the insertion desertion of nh4 was investigated with a constant potential from 0 2 to 1 1 v vs ag agcl the highest insertion capacity of 70 mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 and associated lowest energy input of 0 11 wh g 1 nh4 were achieved at 0 3 v vs ag agcl supporting information table s3 therefore this potential was selected for further tests for regeneration 1 1 v vs ag agcl was chosen since it resulted in the highest concentration of released nh4 and had lowest energy input among all the tested regeneration potentials supporting information table s4 the highest removal rate of nh4 was obtained through 20 cycles of ammonium removal tests but the insertion capacity of electrodes declined steadily over time in the first 10 insertion cycles ph 6 15 772 1 mg l 1 nh4 was removed from a total nh4 concentration of 1008 mg l 1 at an energy input of 0 34 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 fig 4 a c which indicated a removal rate of 715 1 22 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 corresponding to 17 16 0 03 g nh4 l 1 d 1 with a removal capacity of 40 1 12 mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 per cycle the removal rate after 10 cycles was higher than conventional nh4 removal rates such as nitrification denitrification 33 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 and nh4 stripping 42 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 from streams containing more than 1000 mg l 1 of ammonia sharma and sanghi 2012 zöllig et al 2017 which suggested the material could be useful for nh4 removal recovery if maintained at this level however over the next 10 cycles the insertion capacity declined sharply to only 0 01 g nh4 g cuhcf 1 by the final cycle with a removal rate of 166 0 17 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 and a cumulative 957 0 12 mg nh4 l 1 ammonium removed from the synthetic stream 1008 mg nh4 l 1 the decrease in nh4 removal capacity of the electrode over successive cycles could have occurred for at least three different reasons degradation of cuhcf material incomplete regeneration and decreasing nh4 concentrations first the electrochemical activity of cuhcf lost over time due to the degradation of cuhcf should play the dominant role in the declined removal capacity in addition the adsorption kinetics of cuhcf was unusual in that there was an appreciable decline of capacity after reaching a pseudomaximum parajuli 2016 probably due to the degradation of cuhcf material released k and introduced through competition by k ions during cycling second the incomplete regeneration of the electrode between cycles could have contributed to a declined capacity of the electrode the extraction efficiency over the first 5 regeneration cycles averaged 80 1 0 4 calculated based on the amount of nh4 that remained in the electrode from the previous insertion and it rose slightly to 88 9 0 4 after 20 cycles nevertheless the insertion capacity decreased by 65 between the first and the last cycle of the experiment fig 4 thus 10 of the inserted nh4 remained in the cuhcf electrode after regeneration xrd analysis of cuhcf particles after 20 cycles showed that the crystal framework of cuhcf particles was stable but the peak at 2θ of 17 8 after cycling was higher than in the original particles supporting information fig s2 this peak area can be attributed to a partial replacement of k ions by nh4 ions parajuli 2016 which would result in a declined insertion capacity third the initial liquid nh4 concentration in each cycle probably affected the observed insertion capacity this was investigated in a separate test with a new cuhcf electrode in a synthetic stream containing a lower initial nh4 concentration of 30 mmol l 1 540 mg l 1 after 10 cycles the insertion capacity of the electrode was 0 089 g nh4 g cuhcf 1 which was similar to the insertion capacity of 0 091 g nh4 g cuhcf 1 measured in an electrolyte with 30 mmol l 1 supporting information fig s4 jiang et al 2018 indicated that the concentration of removed nh4 declined when the liquid nh4 concentration was below 10 mmol l 1 nonetheless son et al 2020 reported that the insertion capacity maintained constant over a range of 10 to 100 mmol l 1 of nh4 therefore the insertion capacity of electrodes is likely only affected when the initial concentration of nh4 in the liquid is lower than 10 mmol l 1 the energy input needed for the regeneration process grew steadily over 20 cycles the energy input of regeneration in the first 5 cycles was 1 21 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 supporting information table s5 compared to 2 53 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 after 20 cycles the energy input of insertion also increased from 0 19 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 in the first 5 cycles compared to 0 34 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 at the end fig 4c therefore the energy input of nh4 recovery in the first 5 cycles was combined 1 40 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 in total and then it grew to 2 87 0 01wh kg 1 nh4 after 20 cycles the regeneration process resulted in higher energy input for nh4 recovery indicating the lattice distortion of cuhcf over multiple cycles led to higher energy needs to push the inserted nh4 back out of the material the nh4 removal from a real wastewater fig 4b c was similar to that obtained for the synthetic wastewater after 20 insertion cycles on the real stream ph 7 02 936 5 0 5 mg nh4 l 1 were removed out of the initial 1008 0 mg l 1 at an energy input of 0 40 0 01wh g 1 nh4 the removal rate over 20 cycles was 425 7 0 3 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 corresponding to 10 2 0 1 g nh4 l 1 d 1 with a removal capacity of 31 8 1 1 mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 per cycle as we had observed when using synthetic wastewater the electrode could not be completely regenerated after each cycle the regeneration efficiency of the electrode rose slightly from 87 82 0 55 in the first 5 cycles to 89 19 0 19 after 20 cycles table s6 the energy input of the first 5 regeneration cycles was 1 3 0 1 wh g 1 nh4 and increased gradually to 2 5 0 1 wh g 1 nh4 at the end the energy input needed for insertion and regeneration was 2 8 0 2 wh g 1 nh4 in total this indicated that the matrix in the real stream did not noticeably affect the performance of the electrode since both tests with synthetic and real stream revealed similar trends over the cycles fig 4 additionally the concentration of anions and organics in the real stream was not affected by the insertion regeneration process supporting information table s7 3 3 stability and long term cycling test of cuhcf electrode as the anions in solution might react with the electrode and affect its stability the effect of chloride and nitrate containing electrolytes was examined in cv cycling tests over 62 h in 3 electrode system supporting information fig s8a the anodic peak potentials epa from nh4cl and nh4no3 were very similar 0 83 and 0 85 v vs ag agcl respectively and the cathodic peak potentials epc from the two supporting electrolytes were comparable as well with 0 77 v for nh4cl and 0 74 v vs ag agcl for nh4no3 the mid point potential e1 2 of nh4no3 was 0 79 v vs ag agcl after 10 h of analysis which was only 0 01 v lower than the e1 2 at the onset indicating a reversible process after 10 h however there was no peak observed after 10 h of cv analysis in nh4cl and accompanied by a noticeable odor the conductive material completely disintegrated after rinsing with distilled water probably due to cl2 produced by the oxidation at the carbon anode under the high counter potential supporting information fig s9 nh4no3 was selected as supporting electrolyte to investigate the stability of cuhcf electrode over time to avoid possible damage to it by chlorine generation first the open circuit potential ocp over time was examined during immersion of the electrode in a 1 m nh4no3 electrolyte 3 electrode system 60 ml glass beaker the ocp showed a slight decrease during the first 60 h with a more significant reduction after 61 h fig 5 the dissolution of the electrode was reflected in the change in the color of the electrolyte from clear to light brown after 61 h fine particles were visible in the solution and on the bottom of the flask supporting information fig s6a b analysis of the composition of the electrolyte revealed copper in solution showing electrical current was not essential to cause damage to the electrode released k was observed after the ocp analysis of the cuhcf electrode over 50 h indicating binder degradation during the long term tests supporting information fig s7 further structural modification of cuhcf electrodes and an optimal binder are needed to be investigated to improve stability the stability of the cuhcf electrode was further evaluated in a cv analysis with 1 mmol l 1 of nh4no3 during 62 hours in 3 electrode system fig 6 a sequence of cvs contained repeated insertion and regeneration cycles was performed during this time the anodic and cathodic potentials peaks slightly shifted to more positive and negative potentials at 48 h respectively then further distanced until 51 h at which time pieces of the conductive material peeled off of the electrode finally the cv after 62 h showed anodic and cathodic current peaks at 0 63 and 0 93 v vs ag agcl respectively two phenomena were probably responsible for the shift in the redox potentials in this system insufficient regeneration that could limit the adsorption sites and physical and or chemical separation of the catalyst from the conductive support during the ammonium removal test on both the synthetic and real stream part of the active sites on the electrode surface was occupied by the inserted nh4 after regeneration therefore the limiting amount of electroactive spots on the surface lead to a shift in the cv towards more anodic cathodic potentials champagne and kirtman 2001 at the same time detachment of the material was observed after 51 h indicating that the cuhcf material lost physical contact with the electrode substrate due to the lattice distortion fig 7 xrd comparison of a new cuhcf electrode with the electrode after long term cv analysis showed no evident change from the position of three main peaks at 2 θ 17 8 25 and 35 demonstrating that the crystal structure of the cuhcf on the electrode could be maintained upon the insertion regeneration process however the peak height of those three main peaks decreased dramatically and peaks broadening after long term cv analysis indicated a lattice distortion of the cuhcf structure caused by residual stress during insertion and regeneration pasta et al 2016 pothanamkandathil et al 2020 yeh et al 2007 wang et al 2020 indicated the transformable structure of cuhcf particles during cycling which can be considered as a distortion of the internal atoms thus an unaccommodated binding material and morphology controlling method were needed for improving cuhcf structure the long term cycling behavior of cuhcf electrodes under appropriate potentials was evaluated with synthetic and real industrial streams supporting information fig s10 after 115 cycles 6 12 the charge density from the synthetic stream dropped by 17 compared to 19 for the real stream the target operational time was 50 h however dissolved copper from the coating was measured and coating particles peeled off from the electrode after 24 h as well supporting information fig s12 in the synthetic stream only 0 009 mg l 1 cu2 was detected after 6 h supporting information fig s11 the concentration of dissolved copper increased up to 0 417 mg l 1 after 25 h also in the real stream copper were measured in the solution after 6 h of 0 008 mg l and it reached concentrations of 0 628 mg l 1 after 25 h operation a consequence of the instability of cuhcf during long term cycling test is the oxidation and reduction of copper bound to the nitrogen atom pothanamkandathil et al 2020 the poor stability of cuhcf coating was further affected by the high flux rate of the stream over long term cycling analysis takahashi et al 2015 observed that the crystallite size of cuhcf aggregates decreased from 22 nm to 11 nm when using a micro mixer and increasing the flow rate of a synthetic stream containing cs to 100 ml min 1 thus the reduced crystallite size of cuhcf in our study led to a weak bonding between the binding material and the small sized cuhcf material which in turn caused cuhcf material to loose electrical contact with the electrode matrix over long term cycling although the results so far demonstrated the feasibility of this cuhcf approach for ammonia recovery further studies are clearly needed to improve the stability of the electrodes a conformal layer could be introduced to prevent the dissolution of cuhcf for example by adding metal oxides such as al2o3 and tio2 amines such as ethylenediamine and insoluble transition metal sulfides such as cu2s and zns to the aqueous solution containing synthesized cuhcf wessells and huggins 2017 moreover the dissolution of cations from mhcfs could be reduced by structural modifications as well for example the highly crystallized core shell structured cobalt nickel hexacyanoferrate can be coated by the nihcf to suppress lattice distortion and side reactions yin et al 2019 it was found that benefitting from limited charge discharge depth the inactive ni2 ions introduced to the mhcf framework can minimize the atom distortions in an inert atmosphere of argon thereby improving the electrochemical stability of coin sized electrodes electrodes with long term stability would enable further investigating insertion and regeneration potentials to improve stability not necessarily aiming at maximizing insertion regeneration capacity additionally an optimal binder to accommodate the volume variation of cuhcf during cycling tests still needs to be identified other possibilities include a binder synthesized by song et al 2014 using a low cost water soluble poly acrylic acid paa and polyvinyl alcohol pva precursors this binder was found to enhance bonding between si and the binding material which accommodated the large volume change of the silicon anode during adsorption resulting in excellent cycling stability 1663 mah g 1 after 80 h 4 conclusions cuhcf coated electrodes were shown to separate and recover nh4 from a real industrial wastewater at 0 3 v vs ag agcl without interference from anions and organics present at a regeneration potential of 1 1 v vs ag agcl 88 9 0 4 of inserted nh4 was released back to the solution cl ions negatively affected the stability of the cuhcf coated electrodes due to cl2 production at the carbon anode caused by the high counter potential a minimal nh4 concentration of 71 57 0 12 mg l 1 was achieved after 20 cycles of nh4 removal on the real stream which corresponded to the highest nh4 removal efficiency of 92 9 0 01 cv and ca analyses showed that the cuhcf electrodes tested here had a poor stability over time a conductive and resilient binder is needed for the transformable structure of the cuhcf framework and a low temperature cure separation of nh4 from wastewater containing organics by cuhcf coated electrodes under constant potential appears to be a promising technology for nh4 removal and recovery and should be further investigated for application in the treatment of complex wastewaters containing high concentrations of ammonia declaration of competing interest the author

17437,ammonium is typically removed from wastewater by converting it to nitrogen gas using microorganisms precluding its recovery copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf is known to reversibly intercalate alkali cations in aqueous electrolytes due to the prussian blue crystal structure we used this property to create a carbon based intercalation electrode within an electrochemical cell depending on the electrode potential it can recover nh4 from wastewater via insertion regeneration while leaving organics in the first phase different binders were evaluated towards creating a stable electrode matrix with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose giving the best performance subsequently based on voltammetry we determined an intercalation potential for nh4 removal of 0 3 v vs ag agcl while the regeneration potential of the electrode was 1 1 v vs ag agcl using the cuhcf electrodes 95 of the nh4 in a synthetic wastewater containing 56 mm nh4 and 68 mm methanol was removed with an energy input of 0 34 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 a similar removal of 93 was obtained using an actual industrial wastewater 56 mm nh4 68 mm methanol 0 02 mm no2 0 05 mm no3 0 04 mm so4 2 and 0 34 mm ethanol with an energy input of 0 40 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 in both cases there was negligible removal of organics the stability of cuhcf electrodes was evaluated either by open circuit potential monitoring 61 h or by cyclic voltammetry 50 h 116 cycles the stability during cycling of the electrode was determined in both synthetic and real streams for 25 h 125 cycles the charge density c cm 1 of the cuhcf electrodes declined by 17 and 19 after 125 cycles in the synthetic stream and the actual wastewater respectively this study highlights the possibility of low cost cuhcf coated electrodes for achieving separation of nh4 from streams containing methanol the stability of electrodes has been improved but needs to be further enhanced for large scale applications and long term operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen removal electrochemical separation organics and inorganics separation industrial wastewater 1 introduction industrial sites such as tanneries urea and fertilizer producers generate waste streams containing ammonium nitrogen nh4 n the concentration of ammonium in wastewater generated from the fertilizer industry can range from 6 to 1700 mg l 1 bhandari et al 2016 a wide range of established technologies has been investigated to reduce the release of nh4 n into the environment removal by conversion to nitrogen gas via biological nitrification and denitrification and recovery via ammonia stripping ion exchange membrane technologies or precipitation as struvite nevertheless each of these technologies has high energetic and operational costs for example 26 to 31 kwh kg 1 n using ammonia stripping eekert van et al 2012 substantial chemical addition is often needed for ph control in stripping and for carbon supplementation during denitrification moreover incomplete separation of ammonium from nitrogen based fertilizer processing wastewater due to impurities such as methanol and ethanol krishnaswamy et al 2012 the major method for ammonia production is the haber bosch process which produces more than 96 of global production of ammonia per year as this process uses natural gas or oil directly as an energy source it is one of the largest global energy consumers 14 kwh kg 1 n and greenhouse gas emitters qin et al 2017 smith et al 2020 thus an effective and economical method is needed to remove and recover ammonium from wastewater here we investigated a newly developed strategy using an electrochemical cell ec with intercalation electrodes containing copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf for removing and recovering ammonium from a wastewater containing methanol metal hexacyanoferrate mhcf analogues axm fe cn 6 y zh2o have a well studied prussian blue open framework crystal structure which have ion insertion properties and have diverse applications such as

highly crystalline nanoparticles of copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf have been studied for nh4 removal and recovery due to their electrocatalytic ion exchange capacity low toxicity and chemical stability in a wide ph range of 0 1 to 10 parajuli et al 2016 in cuhcf the cu2 ions are octahedrally coordinated to the nitrogen ends of the cn groups and the fe3 ions to carbon ends few k ions probably occupies the a sites during nanoparticles synthesis process on the insertion of nh4 ions a sites are occupied by nh4 ions corresponding to the reduction of some of the carbon coordinated fe3 supporting information figure s1 the carbon coordinated fe2 ions are oxidized during regeneration while nh4 ions in the a sites are extracted out of the cuhcf son et al 2020 achieved 8 4 1 4 g nh4 g electrode cell voltage 0 3 v removal capacity of the cuhcf electrodes in a background electrolyte of 10 mm mgcl2 over a range of 10 to 100 mm nh4cl kim et al 2018b used cuhcf based electrodes to remove nh4 from domestic wastewater 5 or 3 4 mmol l 1 and obtained a maximum nh4 removal efficiency of 85 with high selectivity over na under a constant cell voltage over 200 s however the performance of electrodes with industrial wastewaters and the effects of potentials on insertion regeneration were not examined moreover the many previously reported tests only reported the stability over hours whereas in practice an electrode will need to be stable over many months to years the goal of this study was to evaluate the performance and stability of cuhcf based electrodes under fixed potentials for insertion regeneration of nh4 from a specific industrial wastewater containing methanol we initially assessed the suitability of two binders for the assembly of cuhcf electrodes and studied the impact of potentials on the removal efficiency of nh4 from a synthetic stream in order to establish the potential window nh4 removal tests were then performed with both synthetic and actual industrial streams after establishing an optimal binder and working potentials the stability and cycling life of the electrodes were examined through the evolution of the current density and the dissolution of the functional coating material over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of cuhcf and electrode preparation cuhcf powder was synthesized through co precipitation wessells et al 2011 equal volumes of 0 1 m cu no3 2 sigma aldrich 99 100 and 0 05 m k3 fe cn 6 sigma aldrich 99 were simultaneously added at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 to deionized water ultrasound bandelin hf frequency 35

deionized water for washing out unreacted ions the final product was dried in a 105 c oven for 5 h to obtain a cuhcf powder the dried cuhcf powder was ground into a uniform powder with a ceramic

conductivity of the electrode which were examined as binding agents three tested slurry compositions slurry a b and c containing one of the two binding agents supporting information table s1 were used to evaluate the impact of binders on the performance of cuhcf electrode by cyclic voltammetry cv electrodes coated with one of the three different cuhcf slurry compositions were firstly weighed to unify weights before analyses then the electrodes were rinsed with milli q water and separately moved into a 3 electrode setup 60 ml open glass beakers filled with 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl for performing cv

after completing 10 cycles of cv program for each electrode cuhcf electrodes were separately immersing into a setup containing fresh electrolyte 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl accompanied by constant stirring over 72 h then electrodes were moved back to the electrochemical setup for another 10 cycles of cv analyses to evaluate the effect of binding agents on the stability of the cuhcf electrode over long term immersion 2 3 ammonium removal tests ammonium removal tests were performed in a custom built electrochemical cell ec fig 1 the ec consisted of two compartments internal dimensions 2 5 0 25 cm made from two perspex frames separated by an anion exchange membrane aem ultrex ami 7001 membranes international inc usa a graphite carbon electrode without cuhcf coating was used as counter electrode dimensions 2 5 0 25 cm the cuhcf working electrode slurry c and counter electrode were inlaid in the anode and cathode compartment respectively rubber sheet seals were sandwiched between compartments and aem to create a liquid tight seal and the frames were bolted together a vsp multi potentiostat bio logic science instruments sas claix france was used for electrochemical control the half cell potential of the working electrode was determined with a ag agcl reference electrode assumed as 0 197 v vs she in the compartment of cuhcf electrode the appropriate insertion and regeneration potentials were evaluated by performing nh4 removal tests using the synthetic stream table 1 under constant insertion potentials of 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 v and regeneration potentials of 0 9 1 0 and 1 1 v vs ag agcl the operational time for each potential was defined as the time needed for the absolute current to reach a steady state both anode and cathode compartments were first fed with synthetic wastewater and then recirculated at a flow rate of 8 ml min 1 with a peristaltic pump watson marlow 530u usa the total volume of the recirculated solution that filled the flow cell and tubing was 40 ml in terms of recirculation rate of 20 ml min 1 hrt of 2 min for each compartment the same electrode was applied in insertion or regeneration tests to prevent differences due to possible inconsistencies in the preparation of the coating material the charge densities and the nh4 concentrations were recorded and analyzed to investigate the appropriate insertion and regeneration potentials longer ammonium removal tests which included 20 cycles of alternating insertion and regeneration processes were run with synthetic and industrial wastewater at the selected insertion and regeneration potentials of 0 3 and 1 1v vs ag agcl electrochemical cell with same configuration as previous tests was applied in long term ammonium removal experiments the real wastewater table 1 was collected from the effluent of a chemical company producing nitrogen fertilizer and nitrogen based chemicals the wastewater was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size filter type gvwp milliporesigma before use the working electrode was regenerated before the beginning of the tests by applying a potential of 1 1 v vs ag agcl until the current reached a steady state a fresh synthetic stream was applied in each regeneration cycle but the same synthetic or real stream was maintained during the 20 cycles of insertion process the concentration of nh4 was evaluated to determine the capacity of insertion and regeneration for each cycle 2 4 stability and long term cycling of cuhcf electrode the stability of the cuhcf electrode was assessed with a 3 electrode system in a beaker containing 60 ml electrolyte a graphite rod dimensions 0 03 cm2 x 6 cm national electrical carbon bv netherlands was used as counter electrode the electrolyte containing 1 mol l 1 nh4no3 or nh4cl was used to evaluate the stability of the cuhcf based electrode through open circuit potential ocp and cv analyses the ocp analysis was performed in a three electrode setup 60 ml glass beaker with continuous stirring and the cvs were performed at a scan rate of 1 mv s 1 in a suitable medium the stability of electrodes was evaluated via ocp and cv by observing the changes in the current density and cuhcf particles physically peeling off in the electrolyte the long term cycling performance of cuhcf based electrodes over more than 100 insertion and regeneration cycles was performed in a flow cell using either synthetic or actual wastewaters using only a single insertion and regeneration potential 0 3 and 1 1 v ag agcl samples for cu2 analysis were taken regularly centrifuged at 14650 xg for 5 min filtered through a 0 22 μm pore diameter syringe filter type gvwp milliporesigma and acidified with nitric acid 10 before storage and later analysis 2 5 analytical methods xrd measurements of cuhcf

air at atmospheric pressure at 24 c scanning electron microscopy sem images of cuhcf particles were recorded at an acceleration voltage of 15 kev with a jsm 7600f field emission sem instrument phenom prox thermo fisher scientific usa samples were mounted on aluminum stubs using a double sided adhesive carbon tape and sputtered with au to reduce charging effects the particle size of cuhcf after

measured by flame atomic adsorption spectrometry aas shimadzu aa 6300 shimadzu scientific instruments somerset nj usa prior to analysis samples were filtered with 0 02 µm and acidified with 10 nitric

real stream were determined in a 930 compact ion chromatography system metrohm ag herisau switzerland with chemical suppression and conductivity detector separation occurred at 15 c in a metrosep a supp 5 150 4 column equipped with a metrosep a supp 4 5 guard column 4 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 copper hexacyanoferrate synthesis and binder selection the cuhcf powder had a highly crystalline structure that consisted of aggregates of nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 20 50 nm fig 2 a b the determined composition based on x ray diffraction fig 2a was k0 76 cu fe cn 6 0 66 the size of most of cuhcf nanoparticles was below 50 µm after the granulometric separation but complete dispersion of the nps could not be achieved as cuhcf nanoparticles coalesced as large agglomerates under the conditions of preparation of the adsorbent supporting information fig s1 cv analysis 3 electrode system of three electrode slurries created with different binders resulted in similar mid point potentials of 0 79 0 03 v vs ag agcl before the immersion test indicating no impact of the type of binders on the oxidation or reduction reactions fig 3 the ratio between the anodic and cathodic peak current density was close to 1 for all electrodes consistent with a reversible electrochemical reaction kim et al 2018a slurry c cmc and carbon black had the highest redox peak current densities of 0 58 and 0 54 a g cuhcf 1 the conductivity of slurry c was in between that of slurry a and b which indicated that the high current density of slurry c was most likely the result of a more efficient interaction of the cuhcf with the nh4 ions rather than an increased material conductivity supporting information table s2 after 72 h of immersion in 60 ml glass beakers the electrolytes in tests with slurry a and c remained clear and no particles were observed in the solution at ph 6 15 the impact of carbon black on electrode stability was further investigated by comparing cv analysis of slurry b with other two slurries the oxidation regeneration peak of the electrode with slurry b decreased from 0 35 to 0 18 a g cuhcf 1 while the reduction insertion peak current density declined from 0 35 to 0 2 a g cuhcf 1 which were all lower than other two slurries fig 3 the electrolyte in the experiment with slurry b turned brownish after immersion indicating degradation of the electrode although pedot pss and cmc can be independently used as sole binders li et al 2017 wang et al 2012 carbon black is still needed to ensure a close electrical connection between cuhcf material and binders as well as to stabilize the electrochemical performance of the electrodes shi et al 2017 the redox peak current densities of slurry c remained considerably higher compared with the other two slurries fig 3 indicating a more stable performance of the cmc binder than the pedot pss therefore the cmc binder slurry c was selected for further experiments 3 2 ammonium removal from synthetic and industrial wastewater the optimal nh4 insertion and electrode regeneration potentials for ammonia removal were selected based on four parameters the charge density c cm 2 supporting information fig s5 the concentration of inserted extracted nh4 mg l 1 the energy input wh g 1 nh4 supporting information eq 1 and the insertion regeneration capacity mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 the effect of the insertion regeneration potential on the insertion desertion of nh4 was investigated with a constant potential from 0 2 to 1 1 v vs ag agcl the highest insertion capacity of 70 mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 and associated lowest energy input of 0 11 wh g 1 nh4 were achieved at 0 3 v vs ag agcl supporting information table s3 therefore this potential was selected for further tests for regeneration 1 1 v vs ag agcl was chosen since it resulted in the highest concentration of released nh4 and had lowest energy input among all the tested regeneration potentials supporting information table s4 the highest removal rate of nh4 was obtained through 20 cycles of ammonium removal tests but the insertion capacity of electrodes declined steadily over time in the first 10 insertion cycles ph 6 15 772 1 mg l 1 nh4 was removed from a total nh4 concentration of 1008 mg l 1 at an energy input of 0 34 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 fig 4 a c which indicated a removal rate of 715 1 22 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 corresponding to 17 16 0 03 g nh4 l 1 d 1 with a removal capacity of 40 1 12 mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 per cycle the removal rate after 10 cycles was higher than conventional nh4 removal rates such as nitrification denitrification 33 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 and nh4 stripping 42 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 from streams containing more than 1000 mg l 1 of ammonia sharma and sanghi 2012 zöllig et al 2017 which suggested the material could be useful for nh4 removal recovery if maintained at this level however over the next 10 cycles the insertion capacity declined sharply to only 0 01 g nh4 g cuhcf 1 by the final cycle with a removal rate of 166 0 17 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 and a cumulative 957 0 12 mg nh4 l 1 ammonium removed from the synthetic stream 1008 mg nh4 l 1 the decrease in nh4 removal capacity of the electrode over successive cycles could have occurred for at least three different reasons degradation of cuhcf material incomplete regeneration and decreasing nh4 concentrations first the electrochemical activity of cuhcf lost over time due to the degradation of cuhcf should play the dominant role in the declined removal capacity in addition the adsorption kinetics of cuhcf was unusual in that there was an appreciable decline of capacity after reaching a pseudomaximum parajuli 2016 probably due to the degradation of cuhcf material released k and introduced through competition by k ions during cycling second the incomplete regeneration of the electrode between cycles could have contributed to a declined capacity of the electrode the extraction efficiency over the first 5 regeneration cycles averaged 80 1 0 4 calculated based on the amount of nh4 that remained in the electrode from the previous insertion and it rose slightly to 88 9 0 4 after 20 cycles nevertheless the insertion capacity decreased by 65 between the first and the last cycle of the experiment fig 4 thus 10 of the inserted nh4 remained in the cuhcf electrode after regeneration xrd analysis of cuhcf particles after 20 cycles showed that the crystal framework of cuhcf particles was stable but the peak at 2θ of 17 8 after cycling was higher than in the original particles supporting information fig s2 this peak area can be attributed to a partial replacement of k ions by nh4 ions parajuli 2016 which would result in a declined insertion capacity third the initial liquid nh4 concentration in each cycle probably affected the observed insertion capacity this was investigated in a separate test with a new cuhcf electrode in a synthetic stream containing a lower initial nh4 concentration of 30 mmol l 1 540 mg l 1 after 10 cycles the insertion capacity of the electrode was 0 089 g nh4 g cuhcf 1 which was similar to the insertion capacity of 0 091 g nh4 g cuhcf 1 measured in an electrolyte with 30 mmol l 1 supporting information fig s4 jiang et al 2018 indicated that the concentration of removed nh4 declined when the liquid nh4 concentration was below 10 mmol l 1 nonetheless son et al 2020 reported that the insertion capacity maintained constant over a range of 10 to 100 mmol l 1 of nh4 therefore the insertion capacity of electrodes is likely only affected when the initial concentration of nh4 in the liquid is lower than 10 mmol l 1 the energy input needed for the regeneration process grew steadily over 20 cycles the energy input of regeneration in the first 5 cycles was 1 21 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 supporting information table s5 compared to 2 53 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 after 20 cycles the energy input of insertion also increased from 0 19 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 in the first 5 cycles compared to 0 34 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 at the end fig 4c therefore the energy input of nh4 recovery in the first 5 cycles was combined 1 40 0 01 wh g 1 nh4 in total and then it grew to 2 87 0 01wh kg 1 nh4 after 20 cycles the regeneration process resulted in higher energy input for nh4 recovery indicating the lattice distortion of cuhcf over multiple cycles led to higher energy needs to push the inserted nh4 back out of the material the nh4 removal from a real wastewater fig 4b c was similar to that obtained for the synthetic wastewater after 20 insertion cycles on the real stream ph 7 02 936 5 0 5 mg nh4 l 1 were removed out of the initial 1008 0 mg l 1 at an energy input of 0 40 0 01wh g 1 nh4 the removal rate over 20 cycles was 425 7 0 3 mg nh4 l 1 h 1 corresponding to 10 2 0 1 g nh4 l 1 d 1 with a removal capacity of 31 8 1 1 mg nh4 g cuhcf 1 per cycle as we had observed when using synthetic wastewater the electrode could not be completely regenerated after each cycle the regeneration efficiency of the electrode rose slightly from 87 82 0 55 in the first 5 cycles to 89 19 0 19 after 20 cycles table s6 the energy input of the first 5 regeneration cycles was 1 3 0 1 wh g 1 nh4 and increased gradually to 2 5 0 1 wh g 1 nh4 at the end the energy input needed for insertion and regeneration was 2 8 0 2 wh g 1 nh4 in total this indicated that the matrix in the real stream did not noticeably affect the performance of the electrode since both tests with synthetic and real stream revealed similar trends over the cycles fig 4 additionally the concentration of anions and organics in the real stream was not affected by the insertion regeneration process supporting information table s7 3 3 stability and long term cycling test of cuhcf electrode as the anions in solution might react with the electrode and affect its stability the effect of chloride and nitrate containing electrolytes was examined in cv cycling tests over 62 h in 3 electrode system supporting information fig s8a the anodic peak potentials epa from nh4cl and nh4no3 were very similar 0 83 and 0 85 v vs ag agcl respectively and the cathodic peak potentials epc from the two supporting electrolytes were comparable as well with 0 77 v for nh4cl and 0 74 v vs ag agcl for nh4no3 the mid point potential e1 2 of nh4no3 was 0 79 v vs ag agcl after 10 h of analysis which was only 0 01 v lower than the e1 2 at the onset indicating a reversible process after 10 h however there was no peak observed after 10 h of cv analysis in nh4cl and accompanied by a noticeable odor the conductive material completely disintegrated after rinsing with distilled water probably due to cl2 produced by the oxidation at the carbon anode under the high counter potential supporting information fig s9 nh4no3 was selected as supporting electrolyte to investigate the stability of cuhcf electrode over time to avoid possible damage to it by chlorine generation first the open circuit potential ocp over time was examined during immersion of the electrode in a 1 m nh4no3 electrolyte 3 electrode system 60 ml glass beaker the ocp showed a slight decrease during the first 60 h with a more significant reduction after 61 h fig 5 the dissolution of the electrode was reflected in the change in the color of the electrolyte from clear to light brown after 61 h fine particles were visible in the solution and on the bottom of the flask supporting information fig s6a b analysis of the composition of the electrolyte revealed copper in solution showing electrical current was not essential to cause damage to the electrode released k was observed after the ocp analysis of the cuhcf electrode over 50 h indicating binder degradation during the long term tests supporting information fig s7 further structural modification of cuhcf electrodes and an optimal binder are needed to be investigated to improve stability the stability of the cuhcf electrode was further evaluated in a cv analysis with 1 mmol l 1 of nh4no3 during 62 hours in 3 electrode system fig 6 a sequence of cvs contained repeated insertion and regeneration cycles was performed during this time the anodic and cathodic potentials peaks slightly shifted to more positive and negative potentials at 48 h respectively then further distanced until 51 h at which time pieces of the conductive material peeled off of the electrode finally the cv after 62 h showed anodic and cathodic current peaks at 0 63 and 0 93 v vs ag agcl respectively two phenomena were probably responsible for the shift in the redox potentials in this system insufficient regeneration that could limit the adsorption sites and physical and or chemical separation of the catalyst from the conductive support during the ammonium removal test on both the synthetic and real stream part of the active sites on the electrode surface was occupied by the inserted nh4 after regeneration therefore the limiting amount of electroactive spots on the surface lead to a shift in the cv towards more anodic cathodic potentials champagne and kirtman 2001 at the same time detachment of the material was observed after 51 h indicating that the cuhcf material lost physical contact with the electrode substrate due to the lattice distortion fig 7 xrd comparison of a new cuhcf electrode with the electrode after long term cv analysis showed no evident change from the position of three main peaks at 2 θ 17 8 25 and 35 demonstrating that the crystal structure of the cuhcf on the electrode could be maintained upon the insertion regeneration process however the peak height of those three main peaks decreased dramatically and peaks broadening after long term cv analysis indicated a lattice distortion of the cuhcf structure caused by residual stress during insertion and regeneration pasta et al 2016 pothanamkandathil et al 2020 yeh et al 2007 wang et al 2020 indicated the transformable structure of cuhcf particles during cycling which can be considered as a distortion of the internal atoms thus an unaccommodated binding material and morphology controlling method were needed for improving cuhcf structure the long term cycling behavior of cuhcf electrodes under appropriate potentials was evaluated with synthetic and real industrial streams supporting information fig s10 after 115 cycles 6 12 the charge density from the synthetic stream dropped by 17 compared to 19 for the real stream the target operational time was 50 h however dissolved copper from the coating was measured and coating particles peeled off from the electrode after 24 h as well supporting information fig s12 in the synthetic stream only 0 009 mg l 1 cu2 was detected after 6 h supporting information fig s11 the concentration of dissolved copper increased up to 0 417 mg l 1 after 25 h also in the real stream copper were measured in the solution after 6 h of 0 008 mg l and it reached concentrations of 0 628 mg l 1 after 25 h operation a consequence of the instability of cuhcf during long term cycling test is the oxidation and reduction of copper bound to the nitrogen atom pothanamkandathil et al 2020 the poor stability of cuhcf coating was further affected by the high flux rate of the stream over long term cycling analysis takahashi et al 2015 observed that the crystallite size of cuhcf aggregates decreased from 22 nm to 11 nm when using a micro mixer and increasing the flow rate of a synthetic stream containing cs to 100 ml min 1 thus the reduced crystallite size of cuhcf in our study led to a weak bonding between the binding material and the small sized cuhcf material which in turn caused cuhcf material to loose electrical contact with the electrode matrix over long term cycling although the results so far demonstrated the feasibility of this cuhcf approach for ammonia recovery further studies are clearly needed to improve the stability of the electrodes a conformal layer could be introduced to prevent the dissolution of cuhcf for example by adding metal oxides such as al2o3 and tio2 amines such as ethylenediamine and insoluble transition metal sulfides such as cu2s and zns to the aqueous solution containing synthesized cuhcf wessells and huggins 2017 moreover the dissolution of cations from mhcfs could be reduced by structural modifications as well for example the highly crystallized core shell structured cobalt nickel hexacyanoferrate can be coated by the nihcf to suppress lattice distortion and side reactions yin et al 2019 it was found that benefitting from limited charge discharge depth the inactive ni2 ions introduced to the mhcf framework can minimize the atom distortions in an inert atmosphere of argon thereby improving the electrochemical stability of coin sized electrodes electrodes with long term stability would enable further investigating insertion and regeneration potentials to improve stability not necessarily aiming at maximizing insertion regeneration capacity additionally an optimal binder to accommodate the volume variation of cuhcf during cycling tests still needs to be identified other possibilities include a binder synthesized by song et al 2014 using a low cost water soluble poly acrylic acid paa and polyvinyl alcohol pva precursors this binder was found to enhance bonding between si and the binding material which accommodated the large volume change of the silicon anode during adsorption resulting in excellent cycling stability 1663 mah g 1 after 80 h 4 conclusions cuhcf coated electrodes were shown to separate and recover nh4 from a real industrial wastewater at 0 3 v vs ag agcl without interference from anions and organics present at a regeneration potential of 1 1 v vs ag agcl 88 9 0 4 of inserted nh4 was released back to the solution cl ions negatively affected the stability of the cuhcf coated electrodes due to cl2 production at the carbon anode caused by the high counter potential a minimal nh4 concentration of 71 57 0 12 mg l 1 was achieved after 20 cycles of nh4 removal on the real stream which corresponded to the highest nh4 removal efficiency of 92 9 0 01 cv and ca analyses showed that the cuhcf electrodes tested here had a poor stability over time a conductive and resilient binder is needed for the transformable structure of the cuhcf framework and a low temperature cure separation of nh4 from wastewater containing organics by cuhcf coated electrodes under constant potential appears to be a promising technology for nh4 removal and recovery and should be further investigated for application in the treatment of complex wastewaters containing high concentrations of ammonia declaration of competing interest the author

17438,this study integrates microfluidic experiments and mathematical modeling to study the impacts of biofilms on flow in porous media and to explore approaches to simplify modeling permeability with complicated biofilm geometries e coli biofilms were grown in a microfluidic channel packed with a single layer of glass beads to reach three biofilm levels low intermediate and high with biofilm ratios βr of 2 7 17 6 and 55 2 respectively two dimensional biofilm structures and distributions in the porous medium were modeled by digitizing confocal images and considering broad ranges of biofilm permeability kb from 10 15 m2 to 10 7 m2 and biofilm porosity εb from 0 2 to 0 8 the overall permeability of the porous medium k the flow pathways and the overall local pressure gradients were found to be highly dependent on βr and kb but were moderately impacted by εb when the biofilm levels were high and intermediate with kb 10 11 m2 when biofilm structures are well developed simplified biofilm geometries such as uniform coating and symmetric contact filling can provide reasonable approximations of k graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilms hydrodynamics microfluidics permeability porous media 1 introduction bacteria can deposit and grow in nature and in engineered porous environments after initial attachment to the surface of porous media bacteria can excrete extracellular polymeric substances eps and develop biofilms in the presence of moisture and nutrients eps play a significant role in the formation and structure of biofilms while protecting cells from environmental stresses and antimicrobial compounds benioug et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the presence and growth of biofilms can modify the physical and chemical properties of porous media such as surface roughness chemical composition hydrophobicity and surface charge liu and li 2008 redman et al 2004 walker et al 2004 moreover the growth of biofilms in pore spaces and on grain surfaces changes the flow paths pressure gradients and flow velocities inside the porous medium carrel et al 2018a nivala et al 2012 however it has been challenging to conduct controlled experiments and to mathematically simulate how biofilm formation and growth influence the hydrodynamics in porous media traditionally biofilms have been modeled as an impermeable domain in porous media in such models no water can enter biofilms and contaminants can only enter biofilms via molecular diffusion bottero et al 2013 eberl et al 2000 peszynska et al 2016 pintelon et al 2009 taylor and jaffé 1990 such a modeling approach is based on the assumption that the permeability of biofilms is similar to that of eps which are considered to have negligible permeability billings et al 2015 however some experimental studies have demonstrated that the structure of biofilms is in fact very heterogeneous with many pores and channels present flemming et al 2019 radu et al 2012 stoodley et al 1994 seymour et al 2004 and the permeability of biofilms is higher than that of eps jafari et al 2018 stoodley et al 1994 a pioneering work seymour et al 2004 used magnetic resonance measurements to sample flow within biofilms in porous media and provided evidence that the physical characteristics of biofilms such as biofilm porosity and biofilm permeability can strongly affect the flow dynamics and transport of solutes carrel et al 2018 davit et al 2013 another study thullner and baveye 2008 showed that only when biofilms were considered permeable could computer models reasonably predict the reduction in hydraulic conductivity caused by biofilms pintelon et al 2012 conducted a systematic study on the influence of biofilm permeability on the overall biomass growth and showed that non zero biofilm permeability should be included in all biofilm models deng et al 2013 investigated the effect of permeable biofilms on macroscale and microscale flow in porous media they developed a model that predicted bulk permeability based on biofilm permeability and the biofilm volume ratio which demonstrated a significant effect of biofilm permeability on shear stress distribution to produce an accurate model it is crucial to correctly account for the effects of biofilms on hydrodynamics in porous media previous studies that considered biofilms to be permeable are mostly theoretical landa marbán et al 2020 pintelon et al 2012 qin and hassanizadeh 2015 radu et al 2012 thullner and baveye 2008 a few experimental works studied permeable biofilms by imaging slices of bioclogged columns abbasi et al 2018 deng et al 2013 such images may not accurately represent the overall porous medium because only a small domain of the porous medium can be imaged for the columns and the porous structure is highly random at the column scale as columns are sometimes referred to as black boxes correlating the hydrodynamics of the pore space with biofilm distribution is very difficult and often inaccurate in such systems recently microfluidic channels have been widely used to study biofilms in porous systems pousti et al 2019 subramanian et al 2020 because they can provide a unique platform to control liquid flow at a scale comparable with typical biofilm dimensions in porous media although microfluidic channels can be useful tools to explore the spatiotemporal properties of biofilms in porous media valiei et al 2012 most microfluidic based biofilm studies have focused on qualitative observations of channels without porous media gottschamel et al 2009 kim et al 2013 mosier et al 2012 few works have attempted to mathematically simulate the influence of biofilms on the hydrodynamics in porous microfluidic channels based on experimental observations aufrecht et al 2019 singh and olson 2012 complicated biofilm structures evolve over time ghanbari et al 2016 hung et al 2013 making it challenging to model the ever evolving biofilms various approaches have been used to simplify the geometry of growing biofilms for modeling of the flow and transport in biofilm clogged porous media ezeuko et al 2011 peszynska et al 2016 pintelon et al 2009 in modeling studies it has been a common practice to simplify biofilm geometries as a uniformly coated layer on porous media abbasi et al 2018 cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 some studies have proposed conceptual models in which biofilms mainly fill in the gaps between porous medium grains jaiswal et al 2014 vandevivere 1995 these simplifications can reduce the time needed for image analysis and facilitate repeatability however these approaches are sometimes questioned for accuracy boudarel et al 2018 little is known about how different simplified biofilm geometries impact the permeability of porous media with evolving biofilm structures the goal of this study is to utilize a microfluidic channel to compare multiple approaches in modeling the impact of evolving biofilms on the flow in porous media we aim to answer the following research questions 1 how does biofilm growth impact the flow and overall permeability of porous media 2 how do biofilm properties affect the flow fields pressure gradient and permeability of porous media and 3 how well can simplified biofilm geometries pave the way in predicting the permeability of porous media in the present study e coli biofilms were grown in a microfluidic channel that was densely packed with uniform glass beads confocal microscope images were collected at three different biofilm growth stages in the microfluidic channel and digitized images were used as inputs to simulate water flow in the biofilm covered porous medium we estimated the overall permeability of the biofilm covered porous medium by solving the navier stokes equations for flow in the pore spaces and a forchheimer corrected version of the brinkman equation for flow inside biofilms biofilm properties including biofilm porosity and biofilm permeability were altered to examine their effects on the overall permeability of the porous medium finally we evaluated two simplified models of biofilm geometries i e uniform coating and symmetric contact filling to pursue a possible abridged approach in modeling real biofilm geometries 2 materials and methods 2 1 microfluidic channel and pumping system a μ slide i 0 6 luer ibidi gmbh martinsried munich germany microfluidic channel length 50 mm width 5 mm height 0 6 mm was packed with 0 5 0 6 mm diameter barium titanate solid glass microspheres cospheric usa with a high density of 4 16 g cm3 the μ slide i 0 6 luer microfluidic channels has a thin 180 µm polymer coverslip bottom that has an optical quality comparable to glass refractive index of 1 52 and abbe number of 56 and is suitable for culture under flow and high resolution microscopy a computer controlled pump system ibidi gmbh martinsried munich germany containing an ibidi air pump fluidic unit and perfusion set length 50 cm id 0 8 mm 10 ml reservoirs was used to create a unidirectional and continuous medium flow fig 1 illustrates the experimental setup the packed channel and perfusion set were autoclaved before the experiments after the removal of air bubbles the flow rate and pressure were set at 1 ml min and 17 4 mbar respectively via the ibidi pumpcontrol software 2 2 biofilm cultivation e coli strain k 12 mg1655 was used as the model bacteria in this study a volume of 0 9 ml bacterial stock was added to 150 ml of autoclaved luria bertani lb broth base solution and was then placed on a shaker for 22 h at 23 c to reach the late log phase then the bacterial solution was pipetted into the packed channel under a biosafety cabinet and the channel was put aside for 12 h to allow initial bacterial attachment next the channel was connected to the pumping system under the biosafety cabinet and 10 ml of 1 8 strength autoclaved lb broth was used as the model flow in the microfluidic device under a unidirectional flow mode 2 3 experimental observations and image analysis a nikon a1r laser scanning confocal microscope nikon corporation japan was used to image the biofilms and porous medium inside the microfluidic channel the confocal microscope images had 2343 2323 pixels with a resolution of 2 47 μm pixel more information is provided in the supplementary materials about the staining procedure and confocal laser scanning microscopy in all the preliminary tests data not shown the biofilm growth was basically following the same trend of evolving except in the 1 cm adjacency of the inlet and outlet therefore a 5 mm 5 6 mm area noted by a red rectangle in figure s1 was chosen as the constant imaging frame for all further imaging sessions this region of the microfluidic device was selected to accommodate the specifics of the microscopy method avoid interference from the inlet outlet of the device and ensure a balanced biofilm distribution the reference point used for each imaging calibration is also shown in figure s1 based on preliminary tests data not shown 15 36 and 61 h of net feeding were required for biofilms to reach low intermediate and high levels in the channel respectively at these three time points hereafter referred to as day 1 2 and 3 the microfluidic channel was taken off the line fm 1 43 invitrogen molecular probes usa a lipophilic styryl dye with peak excitation and emission wavelengths of 510 and 626 nm was used to stain the biofilms without affecting the viability of the cells bahlmann et al 2001 dahal et al 2018 the raw nd2 confocal microscopy images were analyzed using fiji https fiji sc which is an open source image processing package based on imagej 1 52p national institutes of health usa autocad 2019 software autodesk usa was used to edit and prepare the geometry of the biofilm covered porous medium as dxf files for computational fluid dynamics models finally the porosity of the porous medium φ and the biofilm ratio βr were estimated by the color thresholding feature of fiji φ was calculated as the percent ratio of the pore area to the total area and βr was defined as the percent ratio of the area covered by biofilm to the pore area 2 4 modeling comsol multiphysics 5 3a comsol inc sweden was used to model the flow in the channel a free and porous media flow fp interface was used to solve the navier stokes equations eqs 1 and 2 in the fluid domain of the pores for a single phase incompressible steady state flow 1 ρ u u pi μ u u t 2 u 0 where ρ is the density of the fluid 1000 kg m3 u u v is the velocity vector for 2d simulation in the free flow domain µ is the dynamic viscosity of water 0 001 pa s and p is the pressure in this work biofilms were considered a porous medium and water flow through the biofilm domain was simulated simultaneously as the flow in the fluid domain of the pore space the reynolds number in this study was estimated as 15 which is higher than the upper limit of darcy s law in the case of a bio clogged porous medium the growth of biofilm results in an alteration in flow conditions in sporadically distributed locations and thus a turbulent contribution of the resistance to flow must be considered the flow of water inside the biofilm domain was therefore simulated using a forchheimer corrected version of the brinkman equation eqs 3 and 4 3 μ k b u f pi μ ε b u f u f t β f u f u f 4 u f 0 where εb is the biofilm porosity kb is the biofilm permeability m2 uf uf vf is the darcy flux vector and βf is the forchheimer coefficient that is defined as eq 5 5 β f ρ ε b c f k b where cf is the dimensionless friction coefficient and is calculated by eq 6 as follows 6 c f 1 75 150 ε b 3 the brinkman equation accounts for fast moving fluids in porous media with the kinetic potential from fluid velocity pressure and gravity driving the flow which often describes transitions between slow flow in porous media that is governed by darcy s law and fast flow in channels described by the navier stokes equations the forchheimer equation amends the brinkman equations with forces opposed to the flow direction i e the momentum sink which adds a correction for turbulent drag contributions in comsol multiphysics this extra drag is applied as βf a constant flowrate boundary condition was applied to the inlet of the domain and a constant pressure boundary condition was applied to the domain outlet a no slip boundary condition was applied to the glass bead surfaces and walls of the channel a physics controlled mesh sequence type with extra fine element sizes discretized the entire computational domain into approximately 350 000 mesh elements at the end of the simulation the average pressures of the inlet and outlet were calculated based on the simulated pressure distribution the difference between the inlet and outlet average pressures was used to estimate the overall permeability of the porous channel based on darcy s law eq 7 7 k μ l q a δ p where k is the permeability of the porous medium m2 l is the length between the inlet and outlet boundaries m q is the discharge through the porous medium m3 s and a is the cross sectional area m2 in the simulations in this study q was 1 67 10 8 m3 s as set in the experiments by the pumping system computer and l was 5 6 mm biofilm properties including kb and εb are critical parameters to model water flow through the biofilm domain determining the exact values of kb and εb is challenging due to the heterogeneity of biofilm structures and technical limitations a wide variety of values for kb and εb have been reported in the literature for instance picioreanu et al 2018 considered values of 0 6 and 10 15 m2 for εb and kb respectively deng et al 2013 used a range of 0 6 to 0 9 for εb while changing the value of kb from 10 15 to 0 5 10 9 m2 in this work we also considered a wide range of εb from 0 2 to 0 8 and kb from 10 15 m2 to 10 7 m2 values to evaluate how these biofilm properties influence the flow and permeability due to the small size of the microfluidic channel and very low range of pressure measuring the physical pressure drop before and after the microfluidic channel was impossible however the intrinsic permeability of the domain ki was estimated using the kozeny carman equation eq 8 8 k i φ 3 d 2 180 1 φ 2 where d is the average diameter of the beads that is 0 5 mm with an average φ of 0 3 for the porous media ki is estimated as 7 65 10 11 m2 later in section 3 1 table 1 the estimated values of ki for each day is presented alongside the modeled k of the porous domain without biofilms 2 5 simplified biofilm geometries in this study two geometry simplification approaches namely uniform coating and symmetric contact filling were evaluated for their ability to approximate the equivalent permeability of biofilm covered porous media the βr values in the segmented simplified models were set at the same level as those determined experimentally from confocal images after simplifying the biofilm shapes and distribution water flow in a porous medium with simplified biofilm geometries was simulated using the same modeling approach described above in the uniform coating approach biofilms were distributed as a uniform layer on each bead while maintaining the same βr value obtained in the experiments on each day for this purpose the area covered by biofilms was divided by the number of beads in each image the resulting value for each day was then used as a reference to manually create the outer layer on each bead based on the size of that bead which was then scaled up via autocad by a factor of 1 00687 1 03871 and 1 14697 for day 1 day 2 and day 3 images respectively it should be noted that for day 1 the uniform biofilm coating on the beads had a negligible thickness the symmetric contact filling approach assumes that the biofilms are formed in contact areas of the porous medium that are narrower and have higher local flowrates based on the porous medium geometry 0 035 mm was set as the threshold for the distance of beads in contact areas the βr on each day obtained from the experiments was symmetrically distributed between the contact areas in the porous medium that were closer than 0 035 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental domain analysis fig 2 presents the biofilm levels on days 1 2 and 3 in the same imaging area of the microfluidic channel figs 2 a and b show the brightfield and fluorescence views and fig 2 c shows the final digitized and segmented images obtained with autocad and fiji it should be noted that the flow direction was from right to left as shown in fig 2 the biofilm levels increased over the course of 3 days in this study biofilm attached to glass beads and biofilm in the void space were not differentiated in the model and were assumed to have the same permeability and porosity table 1 summarizes the βr values and porous media characteristics analyzed with fiji in addition to the values of ki from the kozeny carman equation and k of the modeled domain without biofilms βr increased from 2 7 on day 1 to 17 6 and 55 2 on day 2 and day 3 respectively while the porosity of the system remained nearly constant with a less than 5 difference based on these values of φ ki was estimated using the kozeny carman equation interestingly the k values we got from modeling the domain in each day without the presence of biofilm are very close to the estimated values of ki by the kozeny carman equation as shown in table 1 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 simulated flow fields fig 3 shows the field of flow velocity normalized by the maximum velocity of each simulation in the porous medium with different biofilm levels the simulations were for three kb values of 10 9 m2 10 12 m2 and 10 15 m2 while εb remained at 0 6 it should be noted that the quantitative analysis of flow pathways is beyond the scope of this paper however we show that the flow paths at different growth stages depend on the biofilm properties when kb was 10 15 m2 the biofilm was nearly impermeable because liquid hardly flowed through the thick biofilm structures it had to change flow pathways when the kb value increased to 10 12 m2 water could still not easily flow through the biofilm structures but the flow pathways changed in contrast when the kb value was increased to 10 9 m2 biofilms nearly lost their resistance to water penetration and showed a minimal effect on the flow the impacts of biofilms on the flow paths in bioclogged porous media have been discussed in the literature franklin et al 2019 morales et al 2010 rubol et al 2014 in this regard bottero et al 2013 investigated the dynamics of preferential flow paths in porous media with development of biofilms their results showed that under constant liquid flow at the inlet a quasi steady state permeability was reached and they concluded that shear forces alone could lead to the formation of preferential flow paths that maintain their location in time although they accounted for attachment growth decay lysis and detachment of biofilms all their results concerning flow paths and solute transport were based on assignment of a no slip wall to biofilms in their model based on a paper published in 1991 fowler and robertson 1991 suggesting that the permeability of biofilms is in the range of 10 16 m2 i e impermeable our results demonstrate that the flow paths at different growth stages clearly depend on the biofilm permeability qin and hassanizadeh 2015 reported that biofilm permeability had a large impact on biofilm growth and flow pathways when the biofilm level was high but had minimal impact at a low biofilm level qin and hassanizadeh 2015 used a pore network model in their simulation which largely simplified the geometry in pore spaces even though they assigned a non zero permeability to the biofilms in our simulations we observed significant impacts of biofilm permeability on the flow pathways even with a βr of 2 7 i e day 1 the impact was intensified under higher biofilm coverage i e days 2 and 3 moreover our simulations incorporated real biofilm geometries in the porous medium therefore our approach is more sensitive for capturing the impact of biofilms on flow pathways 3 2 2 pressure distribution fig 4 depicts the local pressure gradient normalized by the maximum pressure in each simulation with different biofilm levels the overall pressure difference in the 5 mm 5 6 mm area is presented in figure s3 in all simulations normalized pressure was higher at the inlet right than at the outlet left the overall pressure gradient is higher on day 3 for all three kb values compared to earlier days on each day the overall pressure gradient is higher with lower kb values these results are expected according to darcy s law and reflected by higher k on day 1 than the other days and higher k with higher kb values furthermore local pressure differences around and inside biofilms lead to changes in shear stress that eventually could play a significant role in biofilm detachment in fig 4 a fixed area designated with red is enlarged to illustrate local pressure differences under various biofilm permeabilities the areas were picked based on the amount and the location of the biofilm to better illustrate how the local pressure gradient in evolving biofilms is affected by βr and kb fig 4 illustrates the pressure gradient on day 1 across a biofilm structure that bridged two glass beads under different kb values when kb was 10 15 m2 the nearly impermeable biofilm significantly affected the local pressure in biofilm adjacencies the pressure dropped almost five times across the biofilm and the pressure gradient inside the biofilm was very high when kb was increased to 10 12 m2 the pressure dropped gradually inside the biofilm structures when the kb value reached 10 9 m2 the biofilm showed a minimal effect on the pressure distribution interestingly as the biofilm grew thicker on day 2 and day 3 the pressure inside the biofilm was more gradually attenuated than it was on day 1 these simulations explain why thinner biofilms that are bridging the particles in a porous medium in the early stages of biofilm development are more susceptible to detachment due to abrupt alterations in local pressure and shear stress for all three days the pressure drops in the designated areas were clearly impacted by kb values on day 1 and day 2 when kb values decreased from 10 9 m2 to 10 15 m2 the pressure gradient in the designated areas increased substantially in day 3 large pressure drops in the vicinity of biofilms was observed and the pressure gradient increased when kb decreased from 10 9 m2 to 10 12 m2 however further decreasing the kb from 10 12 m2 to 10 15 m2 did not significantly affect the normalized pressure drop and distribution this is because the denser and more evenly distributed biofilms present on day 3 had already clogged most pore spaces and allowed very little water flow to permeate thus the further decrease in the kb value did not have a significant impact on water flow our results suggest that βr and kb are crucial parameters to consider when predicting the behavior of biofilms such as detachment in porous systems 3 2 3 impacts of biofilm properties on the overall porous medium permeability fig 5 illustrates the sensitivity of the overall permeability k to biofilm permeability kb the very left points in all the graphs in fig 5 represent nearly impermeable biofilms kb 10 15 m2 and as kb increases the biofilm becomes more permeable the highest kb value of 10 7 m2 indicates very permeable biofilms for each simulation the final simulated values of k were normalized to the k of the original porous medium without any biofilms as shown in fig 5 normalized k was very sensitive to changes in kb for all three levels the overall permeability was the smallest when biofilms were impermeable on day 1 when biofilms were considered nearly impermeable 10 15 m2 the normalized k value was reduced to only half of the original k without the biofilm presence on days 2 and 3 the normalized k value approached zero when biofilms were defined as impermeable as biofilm permeability increased the overall permeability for all three biofilm ratios also increased as an example the impacts of kb on normalized k are elaborated with a fixed εb value of 0 6 in the lowest biofilm level day 1 normalized k was reduced from 0 98 to 0 49 when kb decreased from 10 7 m2 to 10 15 m2 respectively on day 2 with an intermediate biofilm level for the fixed εb value of 0 6 normalized k dropped from a maximum of 0 87 for a kb of 10 7 m2 to a minimum of 0 0006 for a kb of 10 15 m2 on day 3 with a high biofilm level the effect of βr in the pore space outweighed the effect of kb because the porous medium was very clogged even for the highly permeable biofilms with kb values of 10 7 m2 the maximum normalized k value was only 0 65 for the fixed εb value of 0 6 in this study we showed that εb had a minimal effect on k when biofilm levels were low in the system and when kb was also low fig 5 shows when the kb values were smaller than 10 11 m2 changes in εb values in the range of 0 2 to 0 8 had a negligible effect on normalized k in all three biofilm levels however when the kb values were higher than 10 11 m2 the effect of εb became obvious especially on days 2 and 3 for instance on day 2 with a kb of 10 9 m2 the normalized k changed from 0 63 to 0 9 for εb values of 0 2 and 0 8 respectively under the same conditions the difference became even greater on day 3 when normalized k could be as low as 0 22 for an εb of 0 2 and as high as 0 63 for an εb of 0 8 however a previous study deng et al 2013 claimed that k is almost insensitive to εb and neglected the effect of εb in the development of a predictive equation for k we believe the discrepancy between our study and that work is due to different modeling approaches domain sizes and ranges of kb and εb tested that work deng et al 2013 used the brinkman equation for the biofilm domain while we used the forchheimer corrected version of the brinkman equation additionally they sampled a 0 45 mm 0 45 mm domain from a column study while our simulation domain was 5 mm 5 6 mm moreover the ranges of kb and εb were 10 15 to 5 10 9 m2 and 0 6 to 0 9 in that study while in our study they were 10 15 to 10 7 m2 and 0 2 to 0 9 respectively the effect of εb in our simulation can be explained by eq 3 decreasing kb gradually drives the equation towards darcy s law in which εb is typically not a very sensitive parameter while with an increasing kb the equation gradually moves towards the steady state form of the navier stokes equations determining the exact values of kb and εb are beyond the scope of this paper however the sensitivity of flow to εb in porous media highly depends on βr and kb depending on the experimental conditions biofilms may form structures with different porosities and permeabilities the wide ranges and various combinations of kb and εb used in the present study which resulted in significantly different permeabilities flow fields and pressure distributions illustrate the importance of accurate determination of biofilm properties for modeling the hydrodynamics of biofilm covered porous media at different stages we successfully generated a series of realistic 2d models of porous media with evolving permeable biofilms based on confocal images of continuous biofilm growth in porous media inside a microfluidic channel in most available theoretical studies biofilms are arbitrarily distributed in pore spaces or on grains and small modeling domains are typically used cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 qin and hassanizadeh 2015 tang and liu 2017 the use of digitized confocal images allowed us to consider actual biofilm geometries in simulating the flow and permeability of porous media deng and co workers deng et al 2013 generated 2d models of biofilm filled porous media based on confocal images however their domain size was only 0 45 mm 0 45 mm with 1024 1024 pixels and the domain contained 20 glass beads whole or partial with a size of 0 1 0 15 mm diameter in our study the domain size is 5 mm 5 6 mm with 2343 2323 pixels and the domain has 93 glass beads with an average size of 0 5 mm similar to the limitation of any other 2d models our model cannot simulate the impact of biofilm on flow in the vertical dimension however our images were based on maxip pictures that included all biofilms in the entire vertical space of the channel such that the complexity of biofilm morphology in the vertical direction was somewhat preserved throughout the whole domain 3 3 simplified biofilm geometries fig 6 presents segmented images with simplified biofilm geometries i e uniform coating and symmetric contact filling these images were compared with the digitized images of real biofilms to ensure that βr values were the same for all time points under both simplification approaches fig 7 compares the normalized k simulated using the simplified biofilm geometries and modeled experiments in the full range of kb for four εb values additional simulation results based on the simplified geometries for a full range of kb and εb are provided in figure s4 on day 1 with low biofilm levels in the system the uniform coating was so thin that the impacts of biofilm on k were negligible therefore the uniform coating method cannot be used for low biofilm ratios fig 7 also clearly indicates that the symmetric contact filling approach largely underestimated k for the full range of kb and all four εb values although the discrepancy seems reduced at the higher kb and εb values based on this the symmetric contact filling approach was not accurate in approximating the actual experiments on day 1 and thus is not effective in examining low biofilm levels the results for the intermediate biofilm level on day 2 were very similar between the uniform coating and the symmetric contact filling simplification scenarios both simplified geometries underestimated the normalized k over the range of kb for all four εb values the discrepancy was higher at lower εb values when εb was as high as 0 8 the normalized k values estimated from these simplified geometries were approximately 90 of the normalized k estimated from actual experiments for the high biofilm levels on day 3 estimations from both simplified geometries significantly improved compared to those for days 1 and 2 the symmetric contact filling approach slightly overestimated the normalized k values the discrepancy seemed higher at higher kb and lower εb values for the highest kb of 10 7 m2 the absolute error of the symmetric contact filling approach was 0 11 0 09 0 07 and 0 04 for εb values of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively on the other hand the uniform coating method slightly underestimated the normalized k values but with less discrepancy similar to the symmetric contact filling approach this method produced higher discrepancies at higher kb and lower εb values for the highest kb of 10 7 m2 the absolute error of the uniform coating approach was 0 04 0 04 0 04 and 0 02 for εb values of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively these data indicate that uniform coating and symmetric contact filling could provide a reasonable approximation of k when the biofilm levels are high in porous media with high biofilm levels the uniform coating method produced acceptable estimates for all combinations of εb and kb values and the symmetric contact filling approach seemed to be more accurate when εb values were higher these findings also emphasize the importance of accurately determining biofilm properties such as εb and kb to simplify the modeling and design of porous systems 4 conclusions this study integrated lab experiments and mathematical modeling to better understand the effects of biofilm formation growth and properties on the hydrodynamics of porous media inside a microfluidic channel furthermore we evaluated the possibility of using two simplified biofilm geometries uniform coating and symmetric contact filling to more effectively estimate the overall permeability of biofilm clogged porous media the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows the presence growth and properties kb and εb of biofilms clearly affect the flow fields and overall local pressure gradients the permeability of porous media is highly dependent on kb although with high biofilm levels the effect of βr outweighs the effect of kb the effect of εb cannot be neglected in modeling intermediate and high biofilm levels and becomes more obvious when the biofilm is considered to be more permeable kb 10 11 m2 neither the uniform coating approach nor the symmetric contact filling approach could predict the k accurately for the low biofilm level on day 1 or the intermediate biofilm level on day 2 although the discrepancies decreased on day 2 especially with higher εb values however both approaches provided improved estimation of k for the high biofilm level on day 3 thus simplifying the biofilm geometries by symmetric contact filling and uniform coating methods for permeability studies in porous media can be implemented if the biofilm levels are high in the system the results from the modeled experiments and simplified biofilm

17438,this study integrates microfluidic experiments and mathematical modeling to study the impacts of biofilms on flow in porous media and to explore approaches to simplify modeling permeability with complicated biofilm geometries e coli biofilms were grown in a microfluidic channel packed with a single layer of glass beads to reach three biofilm levels low intermediate and high with biofilm ratios βr of 2 7 17 6 and 55 2 respectively two dimensional biofilm structures and distributions in the porous medium were modeled by digitizing confocal images and considering broad ranges of biofilm permeability kb from 10 15 m2 to 10 7 m2 and biofilm porosity εb from 0 2 to 0 8 the overall permeability of the porous medium k the flow pathways and the overall local pressure gradients were found to be highly dependent on βr and kb but were moderately impacted by εb when the biofilm levels were high and intermediate with kb 10 11 m2 when biofilm structures are well developed simplified biofilm geometries such as uniform coating and symmetric contact filling can provide reasonable approximations of k graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilms hydrodynamics microfluidics permeability porous media 1 introduction bacteria can deposit and grow in nature and in engineered porous environments after initial attachment to the surface of porous media bacteria can excrete extracellular polymeric substances eps and develop biofilms in the presence of moisture and nutrients eps play a significant role in the formation and structure of biofilms while protecting cells from environmental stresses and antimicrobial compounds benioug et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the presence and growth of biofilms can modify the physical and chemical properties of porous media such as surface roughness chemical composition hydrophobicity and surface charge liu and li 2008 redman et al 2004 walker et al 2004 moreover the growth of biofilms in pore spaces and on grain surfaces changes the flow paths pressure gradients and flow velocities inside the porous medium carrel et al 2018a nivala et al 2012 however it has been challenging to conduct controlled experiments and to mathematically simulate how biofilm formation and growth influence the hydrodynamics in porous media traditionally biofilms have been modeled as an impermeable domain in porous media in such models no water can enter biofilms and contaminants can only enter biofilms via molecular diffusion bottero et al 2013 eberl et al 2000 peszynska et al 2016 pintelon et al 2009 taylor and jaffé 1990 such a modeling approach is based on the assumption that the permeability of biofilms is similar to that of eps which are considered to have negligible permeability billings et al 2015 however some experimental studies have demonstrated that the structure of biofilms is in fact very heterogeneous with many pores and channels present flemming et al 2019 radu et al 2012 stoodley et al 1994 seymour et al 2004 and the permeability of biofilms is higher than that of eps jafari et al 2018 stoodley et al 1994 a pioneering work seymour et al 2004 used magnetic resonance measurements to sample flow within biofilms in porous media and provided evidence that the physical characteristics of biofilms such as biofilm porosity and biofilm permeability can strongly affect the flow dynamics and transport of solutes carrel et al 2018 davit et al 2013 another study thullner and baveye 2008 showed that only when biofilms were considered permeable could computer models reasonably predict the reduction in hydraulic conductivity caused by biofilms pintelon et al 2012 conducted a systematic study on the influence of biofilm permeability on the overall biomass growth and showed that non zero biofilm permeability should be included in all biofilm models deng et al 2013 investigated the effect of permeable biofilms on macroscale and microscale flow in porous media they developed a model that predicted bulk permeability based on biofilm permeability and the biofilm volume ratio which demonstrated a significant effect of biofilm permeability on shear stress distribution to produce an accurate model it is crucial to correctly account for the effects of biofilms on hydrodynamics in porous media previous studies that considered biofilms to be permeable are mostly theoretical landa marbán et al 2020 pintelon et al 2012 qin and hassanizadeh 2015 radu et al 2012 thullner and baveye 2008 a few experimental works studied permeable biofilms by imaging slices of bioclogged columns abbasi et al 2018 deng et al 2013 such images may not accurately represent the overall porous medium because only a small domain of the porous medium can be imaged for the columns and the porous structure is highly random at the column scale as columns are sometimes referred to as black boxes correlating the hydrodynamics of the pore space with biofilm distribution is very difficult and often inaccurate in such systems recently microfluidic channels have been widely used to study biofilms in porous systems pousti et al 2019 subramanian et al 2020 because they can provide a unique platform to control liquid flow at a scale comparable with typical biofilm dimensions in porous media although microfluidic channels can be useful tools to explore the spatiotemporal properties of biofilms in porous media valiei et al 2012 most microfluidic based biofilm studies have focused on qualitative observations of channels without porous media gottschamel et al 2009 kim et al 2013 mosier et al 2012 few works have attempted to mathematically simulate the influence of biofilms on the hydrodynamics in porous microfluidic channels based on experimental observations aufrecht et al 2019 singh and olson 2012 complicated biofilm structures evolve over time ghanbari et al 2016 hung et al 2013 making it challenging to model the ever evolving biofilms various approaches have been used to simplify the geometry of growing biofilms for modeling of the flow and transport in biofilm clogged porous media ezeuko et al 2011 peszynska et al 2016 pintelon et al 2009 in modeling studies it has been a common practice to simplify biofilm geometries as a uniformly coated layer on porous media abbasi et al 2018 cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 some studies have proposed conceptual models in which biofilms mainly fill in the gaps between porous medium grains jaiswal et al 2014 vandevivere 1995 these simplifications can reduce the time needed for image analysis and facilitate repeatability however these approaches are sometimes questioned for accuracy boudarel et al 2018 little is known about how different simplified biofilm geometries impact the permeability of porous media with evolving biofilm structures the goal of this study is to utilize a microfluidic channel to compare multiple approaches in modeling the impact of evolving biofilms on the flow in porous media we aim to answer the following research questions 1 how does biofilm growth impact the flow and overall permeability of porous media 2 how do biofilm properties affect the flow fields pressure gradient and permeability of porous media and 3 how well can simplified biofilm geometries pave the way in predicting the permeability of porous media in the present study e coli biofilms were grown in a microfluidic channel that was densely packed with uniform glass beads confocal microscope images were collected at three different biofilm growth stages in the microfluidic channel and digitized images were used as inputs to simulate water flow in the biofilm covered porous medium we estimated the overall permeability of the biofilm covered porous medium by solving the navier stokes equations for flow in the pore spaces and a forchheimer corrected version of the brinkman equation for flow inside biofilms biofilm properties including biofilm porosity and biofilm permeability were altered to examine their effects on the overall permeability of the porous medium finally we evaluated two simplified models of biofilm geometries i e uniform coating and symmetric contact filling to pursue a possible abridged approach in modeling real biofilm geometries 2 materials and methods 2 1 microfluidic channel and pumping system a μ slide i 0 6 luer ibidi gmbh martinsried munich germany microfluidic channel length 50 mm width 5 mm height 0 6 mm was packed with 0 5 0 6 mm diameter barium titanate solid glass microspheres cospheric usa with a high density of 4 16 g cm3 the μ slide i 0 6 luer microfluidic channels has a thin 180 µm polymer coverslip bottom that has an optical quality comparable to glass refractive index of 1 52 and abbe number of 56 and is suitable for culture under flow and high resolution microscopy a computer controlled pump system ibidi gmbh martinsried munich germany containing an ibidi air pump fluidic unit and perfusion set length 50 cm id 0 8 mm 10 ml reservoirs was used to create a unidirectional and continuous medium flow fig 1 illustrates the experimental setup the packed channel and perfusion set were autoclaved before the experiments after the removal of air bubbles the flow rate and pressure were set at 1 ml min and 17 4 mbar respectively via the ibidi pumpcontrol software 2 2 biofilm cultivation e coli strain k 12 mg1655 was used as the model bacteria in this study a volume of 0 9 ml bacterial stock was added to 150 ml of autoclaved luria bertani lb broth base solution and was then placed on a shaker for 22 h at 23 c to reach the late log phase then the bacterial solution was pipetted into the packed channel under a biosafety cabinet and the channel was put aside for 12 h to allow initial bacterial attachment next the channel was connected to the pumping system under the biosafety cabinet and 10 ml of 1 8 strength autoclaved lb broth was used as the model flow in the microfluidic device under a unidirectional flow mode 2 3 experimental observations and image analysis a nikon a1r laser scanning confocal microscope nikon corporation japan was used to image the biofilms and porous medium inside the microfluidic channel the confocal microscope images had 2343 2323 pixels with a resolution of 2 47 μm pixel more information is provided in the supplementary materials about the staining procedure and confocal laser scanning microscopy in all the preliminary tests data not shown the biofilm growth was basically following the same trend of evolving except in the 1 cm adjacency of the inlet and outlet therefore a 5 mm 5 6 mm area noted by a red rectangle in figure s1 was chosen as the constant imaging frame for all further imaging sessions this region of the microfluidic device was selected to accommodate the specifics of the microscopy method avoid interference from the inlet outlet of the device and ensure a balanced biofilm distribution the reference point used for each imaging calibration is also shown in figure s1 based on preliminary tests data not shown 15 36 and 61 h of net feeding were required for biofilms to reach low intermediate and high levels in the channel respectively at these three time points hereafter referred to as day 1 2 and 3 the microfluidic channel was taken off the line fm 1 43 invitrogen molecular probes usa a lipophilic styryl dye with peak excitation and emission wavelengths of 510 and 626 nm was used to stain the biofilms without affecting the viability of the cells bahlmann et al 2001 dahal et al 2018 the raw nd2 confocal microscopy images were analyzed using fiji https fiji sc which is an open source image processing package based on imagej 1 52p national institutes of health usa autocad 2019 software autodesk usa was used to edit and prepare the geometry of the biofilm covered porous medium as dxf files for computational fluid dynamics models finally the porosity of the porous medium φ and the biofilm ratio βr were estimated by the color thresholding feature of fiji φ was calculated as the percent ratio of the pore area to the total area and βr was defined as the percent ratio of the area covered by biofilm to the pore area 2 4 modeling comsol multiphysics 5 3a comsol inc sweden was used to model the flow in the channel a free and porous media flow fp interface was used to solve the navier stokes equations eqs 1 and 2 in the fluid domain of the pores for a single phase incompressible steady state flow 1 ρ u u pi μ u u t 2 u 0 where ρ is the density of the fluid 1000 kg m3 u u v is the velocity vector for 2d simulation in the free flow domain µ is the dynamic viscosity of water 0 001 pa s and p is the pressure in this work biofilms were considered a porous medium and water flow through the biofilm domain was simulated simultaneously as the flow in the fluid domain of the pore space the reynolds number in this study was estimated as 15 which is higher than the upper limit of darcy s law in the case of a bio clogged porous medium the growth of biofilm results in an alteration in flow conditions in sporadically distributed locations and thus a turbulent contribution of the resistance to flow must be considered the flow of water inside the biofilm domain was therefore simulated using a forchheimer corrected version of the brinkman equation eqs 3 and 4 3 μ k b u f pi μ ε b u f u f t β f u f u f 4 u f 0 where εb is the biofilm porosity kb is the biofilm permeability m2 uf uf vf is the darcy flux vector and βf is the forchheimer coefficient that is defined as eq 5 5 β f ρ ε b c f k b where cf is the dimensionless friction coefficient and is calculated by eq 6 as follows 6 c f 1 75 150 ε b 3 the brinkman equation accounts for fast moving fluids in porous media with the kinetic potential from fluid velocity pressure and gravity driving the flow which often describes transitions between slow flow in porous media that is governed by darcy s law and fast flow in channels described by the navier stokes equations the forchheimer equation amends the brinkman equations with forces opposed to the flow direction i e the momentum sink which adds a correction for turbulent drag contributions in comsol multiphysics this extra drag is applied as βf a constant flowrate boundary condition was applied to the inlet of the domain and a constant pressure boundary condition was applied to the domain outlet a no slip boundary condition was applied to the glass bead surfaces and walls of the channel a physics controlled mesh sequence type with extra fine element sizes discretized the entire computational domain into approximately 350 000 mesh elements at the end of the simulation the average pressures of the inlet and outlet were calculated based on the simulated pressure distribution the difference between the inlet and outlet average pressures was used to estimate the overall permeability of the porous channel based on darcy s law eq 7 7 k μ l q a δ p where k is the permeability of the porous medium m2 l is the length between the inlet and outlet boundaries m q is the discharge through the porous medium m3 s and a is the cross sectional area m2 in the simulations in this study q was 1 67 10 8 m3 s as set in the experiments by the pumping system computer and l was 5 6 mm biofilm properties including kb and εb are critical parameters to model water flow through the biofilm domain determining the exact values of kb and εb is challenging due to the heterogeneity of biofilm structures and technical limitations a wide variety of values for kb and εb have been reported in the literature for instance picioreanu et al 2018 considered values of 0 6 and 10 15 m2 for εb and kb respectively deng et al 2013 used a range of 0 6 to 0 9 for εb while changing the value of kb from 10 15 to 0 5 10 9 m2 in this work we also considered a wide range of εb from 0 2 to 0 8 and kb from 10 15 m2 to 10 7 m2 values to evaluate how these biofilm properties influence the flow and permeability due to the small size of the microfluidic channel and very low range of pressure measuring the physical pressure drop before and after the microfluidic channel was impossible however the intrinsic permeability of the domain ki was estimated using the kozeny carman equation eq 8 8 k i φ 3 d 2 180 1 φ 2 where d is the average diameter of the beads that is 0 5 mm with an average φ of 0 3 for the porous media ki is estimated as 7 65 10 11 m2 later in section 3 1 table 1 the estimated values of ki for each day is presented alongside the modeled k of the porous domain without biofilms 2 5 simplified biofilm geometries in this study two geometry simplification approaches namely uniform coating and symmetric contact filling were evaluated for their ability to approximate the equivalent permeability of biofilm covered porous media the βr values in the segmented simplified models were set at the same level as those determined experimentally from confocal images after simplifying the biofilm shapes and distribution water flow in a porous medium with simplified biofilm geometries was simulated using the same modeling approach described above in the uniform coating approach biofilms were distributed as a uniform layer on each bead while maintaining the same βr value obtained in the experiments on each day for this purpose the area covered by biofilms was divided by the number of beads in each image the resulting value for each day was then used as a reference to manually create the outer layer on each bead based on the size of that bead which was then scaled up via autocad by a factor of 1 00687 1 03871 and 1 14697 for day 1 day 2 and day 3 images respectively it should be noted that for day 1 the uniform biofilm coating on the beads had a negligible thickness the symmetric contact filling approach assumes that the biofilms are formed in contact areas of the porous medium that are narrower and have higher local flowrates based on the porous medium geometry 0 035 mm was set as the threshold for the distance of beads in contact areas the βr on each day obtained from the experiments was symmetrically distributed between the contact areas in the porous medium that were closer than 0 035 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental domain analysis fig 2 presents the biofilm levels on days 1 2 and 3 in the same imaging area of the microfluidic channel figs 2 a and b show the brightfield and fluorescence views and fig 2 c shows the final digitized and segmented images obtained with autocad and fiji it should be noted that the flow direction was from right to left as shown in fig 2 the biofilm levels increased over the course of 3 days in this study biofilm attached to glass beads and biofilm in the void space were not differentiated in the model and were assumed to have the same permeability and porosity table 1 summarizes the βr values and porous media characteristics analyzed with fiji in addition to the values of ki from the kozeny carman equation and k of the modeled domain without biofilms βr increased from 2 7 on day 1 to 17 6 and 55 2 on day 2 and day 3 respectively while the porosity of the system remained nearly constant with a less than 5 difference based on these values of φ ki was estimated using the kozeny carman equation interestingly the k values we got from modeling the domain in each day without the presence of biofilm are very close to the estimated values of ki by the kozeny carman equation as shown in table 1 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 simulated flow fields fig 3 shows the field of flow velocity normalized by the maximum velocity of each simulation in the porous medium with different biofilm levels the simulations were for three kb values of 10 9 m2 10 12 m2 and 10 15 m2 while εb remained at 0 6 it should be noted that the quantitative analysis of flow pathways is beyond the scope of this paper however we show that the flow paths at different growth stages depend on the biofilm properties when kb was 10 15 m2 the biofilm was nearly impermeable because liquid hardly flowed through the thick biofilm structures it had to change flow pathways when the kb value increased to 10 12 m2 water could still not easily flow through the biofilm structures but the flow pathways changed in contrast when the kb value was increased to 10 9 m2 biofilms nearly lost their resistance to water penetration and showed a minimal effect on the flow the impacts of biofilms on the flow paths in bioclogged porous media have been discussed in the literature franklin et al 2019 morales et al 2010 rubol et al 2014 in this regard bottero et al 2013 investigated the dynamics of preferential flow paths in porous media with development of biofilms their results showed that under constant liquid flow at the inlet a quasi steady state permeability was reached and they concluded that shear forces alone could lead to the formation of preferential flow paths that maintain their location in time although they accounted for attachment growth decay lysis and detachment of biofilms all their results concerning flow paths and solute transport were based on assignment of a no slip wall to biofilms in their model based on a paper published in 1991 fowler and robertson 1991 suggesting that the permeability of biofilms is in the range of 10 16 m2 i e impermeable our results demonstrate that the flow paths at different growth stages clearly depend on the biofilm permeability qin and hassanizadeh 2015 reported that biofilm permeability had a large impact on biofilm growth and flow pathways when the biofilm level was high but had minimal impact at a low biofilm level qin and hassanizadeh 2015 used a pore network model in their simulation which largely simplified the geometry in pore spaces even though they assigned a non zero permeability to the biofilms in our simulations we observed significant impacts of biofilm permeability on the flow pathways even with a βr of 2 7 i e day 1 the impact was intensified under higher biofilm coverage i e days 2 and 3 moreover our simulations incorporated real biofilm geometries in the porous medium therefore our approach is more sensitive for capturing the impact of biofilms on flow pathways 3 2 2 pressure distribution fig 4 depicts the local pressure gradient normalized by the maximum pressure in each simulation with different biofilm levels the overall pressure difference in the 5 mm 5 6 mm area is presented in figure s3 in all simulations normalized pressure was higher at the inlet right than at the outlet left the overall pressure gradient is higher on day 3 for all three kb values compared to earlier days on each day the overall pressure gradient is higher with lower kb values these results are expected according to darcy s law and reflected by higher k on day 1 than the other days and higher k with higher kb values furthermore local pressure differences around and inside biofilms lead to changes in shear stress that eventually could play a significant role in biofilm detachment in fig 4 a fixed area designated with red is enlarged to illustrate local pressure differences under various biofilm permeabilities the areas were picked based on the amount and the location of the biofilm to better illustrate how the local pressure gradient in evolving biofilms is affected by βr and kb fig 4 illustrates the pressure gradient on day 1 across a biofilm structure that bridged two glass beads under different kb values when kb was 10 15 m2 the nearly impermeable biofilm significantly affected the local pressure in biofilm adjacencies the pressure dropped almost five times across the biofilm and the pressure gradient inside the biofilm was very high when kb was increased to 10 12 m2 the pressure dropped gradually inside the biofilm structures when the kb value reached 10 9 m2 the biofilm showed a minimal effect on the pressure distribution interestingly as the biofilm grew thicker on day 2 and day 3 the pressure inside the biofilm was more gradually attenuated than it was on day 1 these simulations explain why thinner biofilms that are bridging the particles in a porous medium in the early stages of biofilm development are more susceptible to detachment due to abrupt alterations in local pressure and shear stress for all three days the pressure drops in the designated areas were clearly impacted by kb values on day 1 and day 2 when kb values decreased from 10 9 m2 to 10 15 m2 the pressure gradient in the designated areas increased substantially in day 3 large pressure drops in the vicinity of biofilms was observed and the pressure gradient increased when kb decreased from 10 9 m2 to 10 12 m2 however further decreasing the kb from 10 12 m2 to 10 15 m2 did not significantly affect the normalized pressure drop and distribution this is because the denser and more evenly distributed biofilms present on day 3 had already clogged most pore spaces and allowed very little water flow to permeate thus the further decrease in the kb value did not have a significant impact on water flow our results suggest that βr and kb are crucial parameters to consider when predicting the behavior of biofilms such as detachment in porous systems 3 2 3 impacts of biofilm properties on the overall porous medium permeability fig 5 illustrates the sensitivity of the overall permeability k to biofilm permeability kb the very left points in all the graphs in fig 5 represent nearly impermeable biofilms kb 10 15 m2 and as kb increases the biofilm becomes more permeable the highest kb value of 10 7 m2 indicates very permeable biofilms for each simulation the final simulated values of k were normalized to the k of the original porous medium without any biofilms as shown in fig 5 normalized k was very sensitive to changes in kb for all three levels the overall permeability was the smallest when biofilms were impermeable on day 1 when biofilms were considered nearly impermeable 10 15 m2 the normalized k value was reduced to only half of the original k without the biofilm presence on days 2 and 3 the normalized k value approached zero when biofilms were defined as impermeable as biofilm permeability increased the overall permeability for all three biofilm ratios also increased as an example the impacts of kb on normalized k are elaborated with a fixed εb value of 0 6 in the lowest biofilm level day 1 normalized k was reduced from 0 98 to 0 49 when kb decreased from 10 7 m2 to 10 15 m2 respectively on day 2 with an intermediate biofilm level for the fixed εb value of 0 6 normalized k dropped from a maximum of 0 87 for a kb of 10 7 m2 to a minimum of 0 0006 for a kb of 10 15 m2 on day 3 with a high biofilm level the effect of βr in the pore space outweighed the effect of kb because the porous medium was very clogged even for the highly permeable biofilms with kb values of 10 7 m2 the maximum normalized k value was only 0 65 for the fixed εb value of 0 6 in this study we showed that εb had a minimal effect on k when biofilm levels were low in the system and when kb was also low fig 5 shows when the kb values were smaller than 10 11 m2 changes in εb values in the range of 0 2 to 0 8 had a negligible effect on normalized k in all three biofilm levels however when the kb values were higher than 10 11 m2 the effect of εb became obvious especially on days 2 and 3 for instance on day 2 with a kb of 10 9 m2 the normalized k changed from 0 63 to 0 9 for εb values of 0 2 and 0 8 respectively under the same conditions the difference became even greater on day 3 when normalized k could be as low as 0 22 for an εb of 0 2 and as high as 0 63 for an εb of 0 8 however a previous study deng et al 2013 claimed that k is almost insensitive to εb and neglected the effect of εb in the development of a predictive equation for k we believe the discrepancy between our study and that work is due to different modeling approaches domain sizes and ranges of kb and εb tested that work deng et al 2013 used the brinkman equation for the biofilm domain while we used the forchheimer corrected version of the brinkman equation additionally they sampled a 0 45 mm 0 45 mm domain from a column study while our simulation domain was 5 mm 5 6 mm moreover the ranges of kb and εb were 10 15 to 5 10 9 m2 and 0 6 to 0 9 in that study while in our study they were 10 15 to 10 7 m2 and 0 2 to 0 9 respectively the effect of εb in our simulation can be explained by eq 3 decreasing kb gradually drives the equation towards darcy s law in which εb is typically not a very sensitive parameter while with an increasing kb the equation gradually moves towards the steady state form of the navier stokes equations determining the exact values of kb and εb are beyond the scope of this paper however the sensitivity of flow to εb in porous media highly depends on βr and kb depending on the experimental conditions biofilms may form structures with different porosities and permeabilities the wide ranges and various combinations of kb and εb used in the present study which resulted in significantly different permeabilities flow fields and pressure distributions illustrate the importance of accurate determination of biofilm properties for modeling the hydrodynamics of biofilm covered porous media at different stages we successfully generated a series of realistic 2d models of porous media with evolving permeable biofilms based on confocal images of continuous biofilm growth in porous media inside a microfluidic channel in most available theoretical studies biofilms are arbitrarily distributed in pore spaces or on grains and small modeling domains are typically used cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 qin and hassanizadeh 2015 tang and liu 2017 the use of digitized confocal images allowed us to consider actual biofilm geometries in simulating the flow and permeability of porous media deng and co workers deng et al 2013 generated 2d models of biofilm filled porous media based on confocal images however their domain size was only 0 45 mm 0 45 mm with 1024 1024 pixels and the domain contained 20 glass beads whole or partial with a size of 0 1 0 15 mm diameter in our study the domain size is 5 mm 5 6 mm with 2343 2323 pixels and the domain has 93 glass beads with an average size of 0 5 mm similar to the limitation of any other 2d models our model cannot simulate the impact of biofilm on flow in the vertical dimension however our images were based on maxip pictures that included all biofilms in the entire vertical space of the channel such that the complexity of biofilm morphology in the vertical direction was somewhat preserved throughout the whole domain 3 3 simplified biofilm geometries fig 6 presents segmented images with simplified biofilm geometries i e uniform coating and symmetric contact filling these images were compared with the digitized images of real biofilms to ensure that βr values were the same for all time points under both simplification approaches fig 7 compares the normalized k simulated using the simplified biofilm geometries and modeled experiments in the full range of kb for four εb values additional simulation results based on the simplified geometries for a full range of kb and εb are provided in figure s4 on day 1 with low biofilm levels in the system the uniform coating was so thin that the impacts of biofilm on k were negligible therefore the uniform coating method cannot be used for low biofilm ratios fig 7 also clearly indicates that the symmetric contact filling approach largely underestimated k for the full range of kb and all four εb values although the discrepancy seems reduced at the higher kb and εb values based on this the symmetric contact filling approach was not accurate in approximating the actual experiments on day 1 and thus is not effective in examining low biofilm levels the results for the intermediate biofilm level on day 2 were very similar between the uniform coating and the symmetric contact filling simplification scenarios both simplified geometries underestimated the normalized k over the range of kb for all four εb values the discrepancy was higher at lower εb values when εb was as high as 0 8 the normalized k values estimated from these simplified geometries were approximately 90 of the normalized k estimated from actual experiments for the high biofilm levels on day 3 estimations from both simplified geometries significantly improved compared to those for days 1 and 2 the symmetric contact filling approach slightly overestimated the normalized k values the discrepancy seemed higher at higher kb and lower εb values for the highest kb of 10 7 m2 the absolute error of the symmetric contact filling approach was 0 11 0 09 0 07 and 0 04 for εb values of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively on the other hand the uniform coating method slightly underestimated the normalized k values but with less discrepancy similar to the symmetric contact filling approach this method produced higher discrepancies at higher kb and lower εb values for the highest kb of 10 7 m2 the absolute error of the uniform coating approach was 0 04 0 04 0 04 and 0 02 for εb values of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively these data indicate that uniform coating and symmetric contact filling could provide a reasonable approximation of k when the biofilm levels are high in porous media with high biofilm levels the uniform coating method produced acceptable estimates for all combinations of εb and kb values and the symmetric contact filling approach seemed to be more accurate when εb values were higher these findings also emphasize the importance of accurately determining biofilm properties such as εb and kb to simplify the modeling and design of porous systems 4 conclusions this study integrated lab experiments and mathematical modeling to better understand the effects of biofilm formation growth and properties on the hydrodynamics of porous media inside a microfluidic channel furthermore we evaluated the possibility of using two simplified biofilm geometries uniform coating and symmetric contact filling to more effectively estimate the overall permeability of biofilm clogged porous media the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows the presence growth and properties kb and εb of biofilms clearly affect the flow fields and overall local pressure gradients the permeability of porous media is highly dependent on kb although with high biofilm levels the effect of βr outweighs the effect of kb the effect of εb cannot be neglected in modeling intermediate and high biofilm levels and becomes more obvious when the biofilm is considered to be more permeable kb 10 11 m2 neither the uniform coating approach nor the symmetric contact filling approach could predict the k accurately for the low biofilm level on day 1 or the intermediate biofilm level on day 2 although the discrepancies decreased on day 2 especially with higher εb values however both approaches provided improved estimation of k for the high biofilm level on day 3 thus simplifying the biofilm geometries by symmetric contact filling and uniform coating methods for permeability studies in porous media can be implemented if the biofilm levels are high in the system the results from the modeled experiments and simplified biofilm

17439,historically little consideration has been given to water performance of urban developments such as hydrological naturalness or local water self sufficiency this has led to problems with increased stormwater runoff flooding and lack of local contributions to urban water security architectural design water servicing technologies and environmental conditions are each known to influence water performance however most existing models have overlooked the integration of these factors in this work we asked how the water performance of urban developments at site scale can be quantified with joint consideration of architectural design water servicing technologies and environmental context i e climate and soil answering this question led to the development of a new method and tool called site scale urban water mass balance assessment suwmba it uses a daily urban water mass balance to simulate design technology environment configurations key features include i a three dimensional boundary focussed on the entity of development ii a comprehensive water balance accounting for all urban water flows iii methods that include key variables capturing the interactions of natural built environment and socio technological systems on water performance suwmba s capabilities were demonstrated through an evaluation of a residential infill development case study with alternative design technology environment configurations combining three dwelling designs seven water technologies and three environmental contexts the evaluation showed how a configuration can be identified that strikes a balance between the conflicting objectives of achieving the desired dwelling densities whilst simultaneously improving water performance for two climate zones the optimal configuration increases the total number of residents by 300 while reducing the imported water per capita and stormwater discharge by 45 and 15 respectively we infer that suwmba could have strong potential to contribute to performance based urban design and planning by enabling the water performance of dwelling designs to be quantified and by facilitating the setting of locally specific water performance objectives and targets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water sensitive urban design wsud performance based urban planning urban infill integrated urban water system modelling urban water metabolism recycling 1 introduction urban development especially infill provides a great opportunity to reshape cities and address their water related challenges newton et al 2012 such as flooding drought reduced water security and urban heat amongst others however this opportunity is not being embraced and business as usual development is recognised to have significant negative water related impacts murray et al 2011 it is generally well established that water extraction from and wastewater discharge to the environment to support urban areas should be reduced and urban hydrology needs to mimic the pre urbanised natural hydrological flows this is being promoted in a variety of programs water sensitive urban design australia sponge city china nature based solutions eu and low impact development usa fletcher et al 2015 however evidence for how best to do this at the local scale is missing due to a lack of suitable methods this work aims to improve the quantification of the water performance of residential dwelling design to provide evidence that can support better urban development water sensitive performance or water wise performance includes biophysical societal and ecological attributes outlined by rogers et al 2020 and international water association 2016 in this study water performance refers to the biophysical attributes related to the protection and functionality of water in the urban landscape including the maintenance of pre urbanised hydrological flows i e hydrological naturalness and water resource management renouf et al 2020a the societal and ecological attributes are beyond the scope of the current study architectural design and technology solutions are the main opportunities for improving water performance architectural design solutions aim to accommodate greater dwelling density whilst retaining green space and permeability to restore pre urbanised hydrology and improve liveability examples include sustainable urban greening strategies jim 2013 water sensitive planning carmon and shamir 2010 and improved infill housing design london et al 2020a murray et al 2011 technological solutions aim to generate supplementary water supplies to reduce reliance on imported water and to mitigate the effects of changed hydrology examples include water harvesting and recycling water efficient appliances fixtures and runoff retention detention and infiltration measures a very large number of solutions emerge when architectural design and technologies are jointly considered hereafter design technology configurations how to systematically quantify evaluate and compare these configurations is not clear in conventional urban design and planning water technologies are commonly considered after the urban form has been designed this overlooks the interactions between urban design and urban water systems and the potential that can be unlocked by better integrating the two collaborative urban design and planning is suggested to foster better integration mcevoy et al 2018 serrao neumann et al 2017 van de ven et al 2016 however it needs to be supported by quantitative evidence of the water performance of design technology configurations furthermore urban designers and architects typically follow planning and construction policy and regulations influencing and changing these policies also requires scientific evidence of the dis benefits a review of current methods that evaluate aspects of water performance is provided in table 1 the review showed that current methods have three main limitations in terms of our objectives i inappropriate system boundary i e the assessed entity and spatial scale ii inadequate consideration of urban water flows leading to incomplete water performance evaluation with some exceptions discussed later iii lack of appropriate architectural design and technology variables or their integration the assessed entity for most methods is the urban water infrastructure which is useful for engineering design purposes but less useful for informing urban design and planning methods with a landscape perspective which assess the urban entity indicated by ue in the table have generally been considered at large urban scale i e city scale and do not have the required detail to observe the design technology interactions current methods often do not consider both natural and anthropogenic flows leading to an incomplete water performance evaluation of the solutions and their impacts on the urban water cycle methods using urban water mass balance i e with black ticks for both natural and anthropogenic flows can be useful for our purposes as they consider all urban water flows but have been used for large urban scale some methods focusing on urban drainage e g swmm music mike urban etc are too complex for users outside the engineering community elliott and trowsdale 2007 our review did not cover sustainability rating systems e g breeam leed due to limitations that have been previously described including lack of hydrological performance local condition consideration and strong scientific basis berardi 2012 komeily and srinivasan 2015 sharifi and murayama 2013 siew et al 2013 to fill the gap in methods that suit our purposes we sought to find out how the water performance of urban developments at site scale can be quantified with joint consideration of architectural design water servicing technologies and environmental context i e climate and soil the result was the site scale urban water mass balance assessment suwmba tool a key novelty of suwmba is that it enables systematic quantification and evaluation of architectural design and water servicing technologies using quantitative water performance indicators three key innovations to answer the research question were the underpinning urban water mass balance explicit definition of the physical system boundary of urban developments i e landscape perspective and integration of key variables representing the interactions of natural built environment and socio technological systems which are elaborated in the discussion section this novel development helps overcome current limitations of methods including inappropriate system boundary partial consideration of urban water flows lack of architectural design variables and limited range of technologies refer to table 1 this paper describes suwmba s development and its underlying methods section 2 suwmba s capabilities are demonstrated through a case study in sections 3 and 4 we answer the research question in section 5 by highlighting the attributes of the suwmba tool that were found to be needed to achieve our objective limitations and future research needs are discussed in detail in section 5 1 our overall conclusions are provided in section 6 2 description of suwmba method 2 1 development suwmba is an integrated urban water system model it integrates i all urban water flows natural and anthropogenic ii decentralised and centralised urban water systems and iii architectural design and water servicing technologies framed by the environmental context suwmba is based on urban water mass balance originally developed by kenway et al 2011 and further developed by renouf et al 2018 and farooqui et al 2016 for city and precinct scale applications suwmba advances this approach for applications at the site scale fig 1 details how the urban water mass balance is modelled in suwmba arrows depict the movement of water between various surfaces and storages the transformation of water inflows into outflows are due to interactions between the hydrological and socio technological systems sections 2 2 2 7 describe how these are modelled in suwmba the urban water mass balance is derived from the estimated urban water flows as per eq 1 water performance indicators are derived from this data as described in section 2 8 all parameters flows and acronyms used in suwmba are explained in table 2 suwmba was developed in microsoft excel s visual basic for applications excel vba and matlab both versions have the same objective which is to quantify water performance of urban design technology configurations the microsoft excel version is a more rapid tool with in built libraries and suited to collaborative urban design and planning context it was developed as part of water sensitive outcomes for infill developments project irp4 of the cooperative research centres for water sensitive cities crcwsc https watersensitivecities org au content project irp4 the matlab version is more suited for performing high resolution urban water mass balance and automating scenario analysis hence more useful for research purposes details about their differences and screenshots of suwmba s microsoft excel user interface are presented in the supplementary material the matlab version was used in this work to automate calculations further details of the microsoft excel version can be found in the tool s user manual moravej et al 2020 for accessing suwmba contact the corresponding author suwmba s development was informed by input from stakeholders with expertise in building and landscape design urban water policy research teaching community engagement and environmental management details of tool testing by the stakeholders and the synthesis of their feedback that informed the tool s iterative development can be found in the supplementary material the role of tools such as suwmba in real world knowledge generation decision making and collaborative planning is an interesting extension of this work however it is not explored significantly in this paper instead we focus on its primary function of quantifying water performance 2 2 urban water mass balance the urban water mass balance is a key output from suwmba eq 1 shows the water mass balance developed for the defined urban system boundary fig 1 the terms and units of which are defined in table 2 it is based on the principle of mass conservation such that the sum of inflows the sum of outflows change in storage this equation holds for any given time period and urban system boundary following farooqui et al 2016 approach recycling and reuse wregw and wreww were accounted for by considering them as both a flow out of the urban system boundary and then a flow back into the system boundary as an input 1 p w w rain w sw w regw w reww w reaqu et sw s w rc ww w w rc w regw w reww gw i δ s 2 3 urban system boundary and temporal resolution the three dimensional urban system boundary fig 1 is defined horizontally by the spatial scope of the urban area being assessed defined by user and vertically from rooftop treetops to the root zone i e 1 m below surface consistent with the three dimensional definition used by renouf et al 2018 and kenway et al 2011 suwmba simulates all water flows on a daily time step but the output can be reported at any larger time scales some flows happen in shorter time frames such as seconds for toilet flushing and minutes for rainfall runoff and multiple times per day however sub daily time step was not considered because it increases the complexity and input data requirements which would limit suwmba s appeal for informing collaborative design and planning processes complexity is recognised as one of the main barriers to the adoption of integrated urban water models bach et al 2014 more detail on the temporal resolution is provided in the supplementary material 2 4 hydrological model hydrological flows infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff are estimated using a widely used algorithm adapted from chiew and mcmahon 1999 and used in the music model ewater 2011 the algorithm was modified so that suwmba can also account for anthropogenic flows and technologies that influence hydrological flows such as irrigation harvest and use of rainwater and stormwater runoff permeable paving and green roofs the model treats some of the water technologies green roof and permeable pavement as land cover types and simulates their water flows based on their specifications e g infiltration rate thickness storage capacity etc hydrological flows are estimated for each land cover depending on its impervious fraction storage capacity and soil type this estimation approach enables modelling of hydrological connectivity between different surfaces which is an important urban design aspect the hydrological model can be calibrated for a specific context however general calibrations exist for australian capital cities ewater 2011 and for specific soil types myers et al 2015 the hydrological model used in suwmba is presented in fig 2 and eqs 2 17 see table 2 for the definitions of the terms first the units for hydrological parameters were converted from mm to m3 based on the land cover areas eqs 2 5 precipitation on impervious surfaces generates impervious runoff once a small initial loss is exceeded eq 6 the initial loss storage is assumed to fully evaporate at the end of each day irrigation demand is calculated using soil moisture deficiency defined by the irrigation trigger factor eq 7 which enables exploring the potential impacts of different level of water restrictions and irrigation habits of residents on water performance irrigation is set to zero for impervious and non irrigated pervious surfaces infiltration is calculated using an infiltration rate defined by soil moisture storage as an exponential function eq 8 maximum infiltration occurs when the soil moisture is empty and gradually decreases to a minimum when soil moisture is full infiltration excess forms one part of the stormwater runoff from pervious surfaces eq 9 the other part is generated if the infiltrated water exceeds soil moisture store capacity eq 10 called the saturation excess evapotranspiration is subtracted from soil moisture eq 11 water further percolates and recharges the storage aquifer as a constant percentage of soil moisture above field capacity eq 12 the soil moisture is calculated eq 13 considering all inflows and outflows to from the soil stormwater runoff is generated as a summation of impervious runoff infiltration excess and saturation excess eq 14 stormwater runoff can flow to other land cover surfaces or leave the urban system boundary depending on the urban design configuration stormwater discharge from the system boundary sw see table 2 and fig 1 is a summation of the stormwater of land covers directed to the outlet eq 17 finally evapotranspiration and infiltration are summed over all land covers eqs 15 and 16 2 i m p s c i i m p s c i a i i m p f i 1000 3 f c i f c i a i 1 i m p f i 1000 4 c o e f f i c o e f f i a i 1 i m p f i 1000 5 s m s c i s

5 water demand model indoor water demand is estimated using algorithms developed by makki et al 2015 for six indoor water end uses toilet flushing washing machine dishwasher shower tap and bath the algorithms were derived from a linear regression of a large high resolution water use dataset for south east queensland in australia and have been found to be predictive of indoor water use in australia generally it enables consideration of consumer water use behaviours frequency duration etc appliances and water fixtures efficiency level type capacity etc demographics gender age profiles and household socio demographics income outdoor water use irrigation is estimated using eq 7 summed up for all land covers giving the the total outdoor water demand previous studies have shown that built environment variables such as lot size land cover housing value as a proxy of income density and housing age as a proxy of efficiency of appliances maturity of garden and leakage are influential stoker et al 2019 the combination of indoor and outdoor water demand models and architectural design variables in suwmba allows for quantifying the impacts of these variables on water performance and exploring the influence of behaviours and the built environment on water use 2 6 water harvesting and storage model a storage behaviour model is used to model the supply demand behaviour of each storage in the assessed urban system it is a daily water mass balance for each storage that models how the storage meets the demand set by the water demand model and the demand supply connection matrices see section 2 7 for given tank size and inflow calculated from the hydrological model the storage behaviour model uses a yield before spill operating rule fewkes and butler 2000 makropoulos

their corresponding demand suwmba can explicitly define i the connection between different water sources and end uses matrix sd ii the contribution of end uses as an input to the treatment system for reuse recycling matrix rem and iii the priority of usages when multiple sources are available for the same end use matrix sd arrays in rem are binary indicating inputs to the treatment system or the storage from specified end use component see the supplementary material for an example the structure of sd and rem matrices allows for flexible consideration of any treatment systems and associated water quality implications this novel feature enables suwmba s users to explore the impacts of treatment systems to meet a range of end uses on water performance for example they can explore the water performance implication of treating harvested rainwater i e a water source to drinking quality compared to a less sophisticated treatment system that is only suitable for irrigation purposes moreover current local policies place limitations on suitable end uses depending on water quality and the type of dwellings e g indoor greywater reuse is not allowed for multi dwellings suwmba can be used to test these local policies and the potential dis benefits if they were to change 2 8 water performance indicators water performance indicators derived from the urban water mass balance data are another key output from suwmba they were based on indicators proposed by renouf et al 2020a the full list of which can be found in the supplementary material a sub set of three indicators were used to demonstrate suwmba in this paper hydrological naturalness imported water use per capita and water self sufficiency hydrological naturalness shows the extent to which hydrological flows of the urban system have changed relative to a pre urbanised case for evapotranspiration et stormwater discharge sw and infiltration i it is a ratio of the annual volume of the hydrological flow in the assessed case to that of the pre urbanised case expressed as a percentage it helps gauge progress toward mimicking natural flows imported water per capita and water self sufficiency represent the reliance of the assessed urban system on water mains performance can be improved through a combination of i reducing water demand ii utilising supplementary water sourced from within the urban system i e internalisation of supply and iii reuse recycling and cascading agudelo vera et al 2013 self sufficiency is defined as the fraction of demand that is met by water sourced from within the urban system boundary 3 case study testing of design technology environment configurations the purpose of the case study was to demonstrate the capabilities of suwmba for understanding interactions between design water technologies and the environmental context water performance was quantified for twenty one design technology configurations see fig 3 combining three dwelling architectural designs table 3 and seven technologies table 4 the identifiers for the configurations are denoted by the dwelling design typologies a single storey detached houses b sub divided single storey houses and c two storey semi detached units and the technology table 4 for example b gwr represents sub divided single storey houses with greywater reuse see fig 3 the configurations were modelled in the context of three australian cities brisbane melbourne and adelaide representing sub tropical temperate and semi arid climates with different soil types the architectural designs were sourced from london et al 2020a and represent typical dwelling typologies associated with suburban densification occurring in australian capital cities murray et al 2011 they are fundamentally different in terms of architectural design principles london et al 2020a this study focuses on the water performance of these designs with different technologies and under different environmental conditions other dis benefits such as green space quality thermal comfort land consumption density and liveability are also important and can be found elsewhere renouf et al 2020b london et al 2020b design a is the reference case representing 71 of current dwelling types in australia abs 2016 it is characterised by generous indoor and outdoor private space providing green space enabling infiltration evapotranspiration and associated benefits london et al 2020a being a low density typology it has a high land consumption leading to extensive horizontal growth and low efficiency in utilising land design b represents the business as usual infill development occurring in australia which is sub division of single lots to achieve a higher density than design a it is typically characterised by large impervious areas i e building footprints driveways parking spaces etc that leave little or no quality outdoor space for permeable surfaces greening and mature trees london et al 2020a potential negative water related impacts of design b have been mentioned in the literature murray et al 2011 renouf et al 2019a but quantifications of these impacts are rare design c has been proposed as an alternative infill development typology that aims for similar or higher dwelling density to design b but maintaining outdoor spaces on the site london et al 2020a murray et al 2011 it provides more capacity to plan and incorporate water sensitive design solutions by consolidating lots rather than sub dividing the occupancies residents per dwelling were assumed based on the statistics for the relevant city 2 5 for brisbane and adelaide and 2 3 for melbourne abs 2016 so the total number of residents provided by designs a b and c are respectively 5 10 and 15 in brisbane and adelaide and 4 6 9 2 and 13 8 in melbourne a pre urbanised case pre for each city was also evaluated as a reference case for the hydrological flows the pre was assumed to be 90 short vegetation and 10 bare soil daily flows were simulated for each configuration over a 14 year period from 01 01 2005 to 31 12 2018 using daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data bom 2019 this period includes wet and dry years so the design technology configurations could be considered for a range of climatic conditions the efficiency of appliances and fixtures were characterised using water efficiency labelling standards wels www waterrating gov au wels is a water rating scheme that labels appliances and fixtures from 1 to 6 stars depending on the water consumption the more stars the more water efficient we assumed 3 star appliances and fixtures in most cases in the efficient appliances and fixtures ea technology case 5 star appliances and fixtures was assumed see table 4 water rating label of 5 and 6 starts are considered efficient according to wels suwmba was run for an average australian water use behaviour which consists of 7 1 min shower duration and average tap usages of 1 min per instance other indoor water demand parameters are defined in the supplementary material in terms of outdoor water demand the base case assumes all vegetated areas are irrigated the crop factors and irrigation trigger factors defined in fig 3 the parameters of technologies are detailed in table 4 4 results the urban water mass balance and water performance indicators generated for the case study configurations demonstrate the function of suwmba for jointly considering architectural design water technologies and environmental context the urban water mass balance results table 5 7 allowed us to observe how the key influencing variables of the design technology environment configurations influence all urban water flows the results of selected performance indicators table 8 fig 4 and fig 5 allowed us to draw out the interactions between design technology and environment 4 1 influence of design technology environment variables on hydrology comparing the water mass balance data of different cities table 5 7 shows that environmental context has the most influence on the hydrological flows the flows are greater for brisbane than melbourne table 6 and adelaide due to higher precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in brisbane s sub tropical climate see p and e t 0 values in fig 3 soil characteristics particularly soil moisture store capacity are also influential therefore climate and soil variables are key variables in suwmba the degree in which architectural design influences water performance can be observed in the hydrological naturalness ratios table 8 by comparing a bc b bc and c bc excluding the impacts of technologies in general architectural designs negatively impact the hydrology by increasing sw 100 and decreasing et and i 100 to varying degrees exceptions discussed later corresponding well with imperviousness the highest impact was seen for b bc followed by c bc and a bc designs for example in adelaide b bc was found to increase sw to 301 reduce i and et to 24 and 80 due to it having the highest impervious fraction with 79 of the site is covered with hard surfaces such as roof and pavement see table 3 therefore land cover characteristics influenced strongly by architectural design are key variables in suwmba et naturalness ratios for a bc in melbourne and adelaide and for c bc in adelaide were estimated to be more than 100 which is due to irrigating vegetated areas by imported water w irrigation water subsequently evapotranspires adding to natural evapotranspiration the irrigated areas in a bc and c bc designs are 59 and 38 of the total site see table 3 the irrigation of these areas is enough to offset the loss of evapotranspiration due to lost vegetation and evan more than needed to restore it to pre urbanised levels therefore the extent of vegetated area whether irrigated or not is an important land cover variable in suwmba when those areas are irrigated the conflicting issue of water demand for irrigation needs to be considered discussed in section 4 2 water technologies can mitigate the negative impacts of architectural designs to a degree that depends on interactions with the environmental context and the architectural design table 8 shows that none of the configurations were able to restore pre urbanised sw and i to pre urbanised levels i e sw naturalness is always 100 and i naturalness is always 100 however pre urbanised et could be restored with certain configurations e g a gr some technologies are more effective in this regard in certain environmental context for example gr is the most effective technology to reduce stormwater discharge for design b due to large roof areas in brisbane and melbourne but not as effective as swh in adelaide configurations with the best water performance in terms of lowest sw were found to be those with the largest total storage smax in terms of combined built storage e g tanks and natural storage e g soil moisture capacity for example sw naturalness of design a in melbourne range from 113 to 174 with a swh having the largest storage 36 m3 being the best and a bc having the smallest storage 26 m3 being the worst although the importance of total storage seems obvious the degree to which it impacts water performance is not well understood and utilised in urban design total storage is a key variable that is determined by both architectural design e g permeable area for facilitating soil moisture storage and technology specifications e g tank size the other important technology variable that influences hydrology is how the tank storages are managed for example although smax of b gr 26 m3 is larger than of b swh 23 m3 in adelaide the latter has a better lower sw naturalness 216 compared to 222 because the stormwater store is actively managed to meet the demand this variable also influences water demand and supply which is discussed in section 4 2 and 4 3 4 2 influence of design technology environment variables on water supply and demand urbanisation results in more water passing through the urban system compared to the pre urbanised case due to the import of water into the urban system to meet water demand the amount of imported water w depends on the environmental context the architectural design and the water technologies in place architectural design determines the number of occupants and the irrigated areas which influence indoor and outdoor water demand respectively the degree to which water demand has been influenced by the architectural design can be observed by comparing w of a bc b bc and c bc configurations for example in brisbane the values were 376 515 and 790 m3 yr for a bc b bc and c bc respectively higher water demand observed for c bc configurations is due to more residents 15 in c compared to 5 in a and relatively large irrigated areas see green areas in table 3 the environmental context also influences irrigation demand via the amount of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture store capacity smsc for example adelaide has a higher water demand than the other locations due to the need for higher and more frequent irrigation because the soil moisture capacity is small it is not frequently restored by precipitation and it rapidly depletes due to high evapotranspiration water technologies have the greatest potential to reduce demand for w and also wastewater discharge ww for example greywater reuse can potentially reduce w by 24 b gwr in brisbane to 32 c gwr in adelaide the important variables are the water demand both indoor and outdoor piping configurations and the supply demand matrices i e sd and rem and storage volume water demand in turn depends on the number of dwellings occupants per dwelling technology specifications e g appliances efficiency types capacity etc and irrigated areas piping configurations which determine how the water source s supply end uses is particularly important for example b rwh configuration includes 4 rainwater tanks one for each dwelling of 2m3 to give a total of 8m3 compared to the b swh configuration which consists of 1 stormwater tank of 10 m3 while the smax of b swh is larger than that of b rwh the demand for the latter is lower higher demand in this case strikes a better balance between inflow to and outflow of the rainwater tanks the balance is a combination of architectural design variables e g roof areas and associated demand i e pipe configurations this result indicates how suwmba can be used to analyse the implication of different treatment systems on water performance the case study assessment has highlighted the need for joint consideration of design technology environment variables because the configurations not only impact water supply and demand but also impact hydrology failing to consider the impact of all relevant variables might lead to solutions that improve one aspect of water performance but worsen others which is explored in the next section 4 3 interactions between design technology and environment fig 4 allows us to observe trade offs between the two objectives of reducing reliance on w and reducing sw these indicators are shown together ranked from highest to lowest in terms of w per capita the w per capita for a bc in brisbane melbourne and adelaide is 206 231 270 l person day respectively the highest reduction in w per capita in each of the cities ranged from 50 to 61 the highest reduction in brisbane and melbourne was achieved by b rwh whereas in adelaide it was b gwr this suggests that no one design technology configuration performs best in all circumstances the reason for the substantial reduction in w per capita for the b configurations is two fold firstly the limited garden area for design b minimises outdoor water demand per capita secondly the presence of supplementary water supplies i e greywater reuse rainwater harvesting meet a fraction of the total demand leading to further reduction of w the concept of water sensitivity promotes water s functionality for greening cooling amenity etc which is lost in design b so the lowest w per capita although desirable in terms of water performance should be considered along with the lost benefits of other functionalities of water design b generally performs best in terms of w per capita 50 61 reduction but ranks amongst the worst in terms of sw increased by 39 72 compared to a bc these trade offs show that achieving one water performance objective in isolation e g w reduction without considering other aspects e g sw does not necessarily lead to an overall water performance improvement therefore a comprehensive water performance evaluation across a range of indicators is required to prevent unintended impacts which was enabled by suwmba the case study analysis found middle ground configurations where multiple water performance objectives are simultaneously met for example fig 4 shows that in c swh w per capita is reduced relative to a bc by roughly 45 and sw is only increased by 14 in brisbane and reduced by around 15 in melbourne and adelaide noting that design c accommodate 300 more residents compared to a this result shows how architectural design and technologies with certain specifications can work together to achieve multiple objectives in a given environmental context this example has shown the potential for joint evaluation of design and water technologies in order to optimise for both water efficiency and stormwater management a similar process could be performed for other performance indicators that are important in other contexts for example increasing evapotranspiration by more irrigation for heat mitigation versus water self sufficiency water performance varies under different climatic conditions eg wet versus dry years the indicator of water self sufficiency was used to show suwmba s ability to explore the influence of such variations fig 5 understanding the variability of water performance is important because a configuration that provides a medium level of water self sufficiency but with low variability might be favourable over the one that has high self sufficiency in normal or wet years but fails in times of droughts when water self sufficiency is most needed as evidenced by the a swh case in melbourne see fig 5 fig 5 shows that self sufficiency can vary significantly depending on the configuration it can be as low as 10 for a rwh in adelaide or as high as 36 for a swh in melbourne the highest degree of water self sufficiency was found to be achieved by gwr except for design b in brisbane and melbourne gwr also shows lower variability meaning that it provides relatively constant water self sufficiency in both wet and dry years so it is more reliable than other technologies the reason is the steady inflow to the gwr system compared to other technologies which rely on precipitation 5 discussion we identified that the suwmba needed to have the following innovative features in order to jointly examine the influence of architectural design water technologies and environmental context a framework based on urban water mass balance a landscape perspective a site scale system boundary and methods that are parameterised for key variables to model design technology interactions urban water mass balance is a fundamental feature of suwmba it enabled an explicit definition of the urban system which led to a unique landscape perspective satisfying the urban water mass balance required consideration of all water flows into and out the defined system as well as changes in storage therefore it ensured a holistic quantification of water performance which could not be achieved by other methods that focus on urban water infrastructure or that capture a partial picture of water flows see table 1 the need for a holistic picture of water performance was evidenced by the results showing potentially conflicting water performance objectives require integrated design and technology solutions the need to account for all urban water flows both natural and anthropogenic to prevent unintended problem shifting has been recognised previously renouf et al 2018 however this is the first time it has been possible to provide detailed evidence to support the need for integrated solutions by virtue of higher resolution possible at the site scale a novel aspect of suwmba is the landscape perspective which is different from the urban water infrastructure or urban catchment perspectives taken in other methods collaborative discussions between urban designers planners water managers engineers stakeholders decision makers as well as other disciplines urban heat liveability etc revolve around land parcels therefore suwmba s landscape perspective allows it to be used in collaborative urban design and planning processes the case study results demonstrated how suwmba can be used to identify a best case for a given landscape configuration which balances multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives in this case storage was shown to be an important variable which can feed into discussions between architects and water engineers about how best to accommodate the required storage into the assessed landscape and how this would in turn affect water performance and urban water infrastructure the site scale system boundary opted for in suwmba was motivated by the fact that decisions about architectural design and water technologies are mostly made at this scale previous work using this holistic approach has focused on larger urban scales for example city or precinct scale e g farooqui et al 2016 last 2011 renouf et al 2018 which is useful for strategic planning but less useful for decision making at operational level we found that site scale provided the higher resolution needed to observe the interactions between design and water technologies the case study evaluation enabled the key variables that influence performance to be identified key design variables were found to be number of dwellings land cover characteristics irrigated area and occupants per dwelling key water technology variables are the total storage capacity the demand supply matrix and the type of supplementary water harnessed the methods used in suwmba needed to be parameterised so that these variables can be modified to explore what if scenarios the importance of environmental variables was also highlighted showing that no one design technology combination fits all environmental contexts the inclusion of architectural design and environmental variables is important for developers and planners because it helps them to analyse if choices made in one setting are applicable to another suwmba is an important advancement over other models that generally lack architectural design variables refer to table 1 the ability to jointly explore both architectural design variables and water technologies with consideration of the environmental context is a feature that differentiates suwmba from existing methods preliminary use of suwmba to explore most common design technology configurations seen in australia showed the impacts of densification is substantially different for alternative configurations i e compare the performance of design b with c therefore decisions about boosting or limiting densification are influenced by the interactions between design technology and environmental context this result suggests policies that solely consider densification indicators e g people ha might limit creativity for creating integrated solutions in architectural and technology space 5 1 limitation and future research needs suwmba does not account for the nutrients and energy implications of water servicing options there may be synergies and trade offs between water nutrients and water related energy which should also be explored this is an opportunity for future iterations of the tool suwmba s conceptualisation of water flows may be limited for some regional contexts for example it does not account for snow accumulation which is important for colder climates or water supply by tankers which is important for some cities in developing countries nor does it provide a good representation of areas with complex groundwater systems such aspects would need to be added for use in regions other than australia future research could consider linking site scale evaluation using the suwmba tool to larger scale frameworks while suwmba focuses on site scale assessment it is recognised there is interest in extrapolating an understanding water performance up to larger urban scales precinct or city scale as evidenced by other tools and models that operate at this scale table 1 we suggest that future research can link suwmba to urban water systems transition models e g crc scenario tool rauch et al 2017 to scale up the dis benefits from site scale design technology interventions to meet water performance objectives set at the larger scales e g city scale as outlined by hoffmann et al 2020 as a research priority another interesting extension could be the identification of water performance pathways due to the uptake of alternative site scale architectural design and new water technologies as a response to societal transitions and climate change since current transition models do not capture design technology interactions as shown in table 1 they cannot perform such analysis without use of suwmba or developing similar site scale models future work should focus on the application of suwmba in a variety of locations and contexts to further elicit its capacities future applications could use suwmba to simultaneously optimise architectural design and technologies to achieve some pre defined targets this would be a multi objective optimisation maximising different water performance objectives to check if and how for example the natural water balance can be achieved another research need is the consideration of multiple technologies together we analysed technologies in isolation for simplicity to demonstrate suwmba s capabilities however multiple interactions exist when technologies are considered together which are also captured in suwmba an interesting direction for future research could be exploring the role of suwmba in real world knowledge generation decision making and collaborative planning the interactions between models tools and people using them in a collaborative urban design and planning context are not well understood mcevoy et al 2018 recent studies showed that the context including style of use e g interactive nature of the tool style of facilitation etc phase of planning that a tool is used and societal context e g culture capacity of local stakeholders etc could have an impact on the use and the added value of the tools in real world participatory workshops mcevoy et al 2019 different tools seem to deliver different types of participation and outcomes e g learning vs final product mcevoy et al 2018 our limited observation in suwmba s testing and development process see the supplementary material in australian context inferred that suwmba improved both learning and the quality the design as the results of collaborative activities however these societal aspects need further research that was beyond our scope finally it is acknowledged that decisions about urban design at the site scale are not made solely based on water performance other environmental performance aspects such as urban heat liveability and green space quality are needed prior to cost benefit analysis and in turn for guiding multi criteria decision making processes suwmba could be used alongside other performance evaluation processes an example of which is provided by renouf et al 2020a to feed into cost benefit analysis and multi criteria decision support systems the investment framework for economics of water sensitive cities pannell 2020 is a recent example that could benefit from the quantifications provided by suwmba current multi criteria decision support systems for site scale design process inter alia jalilzadehazhari and johansson 2019 and hu 2019 do not have water performance elements therefore a priority for future research could be the use of suwmba in a multi criteria decision support systems that include cost benefit analysis alongside other environmental performance 6 conclusions this paper introduced a new approach i e suwmba for quantifying the water performance of site scale urban developments and their holistic impacts on the urban water cycle in answering the research question we found that the water performance of design technology environment configurations can be quantified by i defining a three dimensional urban entity ii accounting for all water flows both natural and anthropogenic and iii capturing the interactions between natural built environment and socio technological systems by incorporating key influential variables related to hydrology architectural design technologies and end use water demand suwmba is an important advancement over other site scale models because it specifically i accounts for architectural design variables such as number of dwellings land cover characteristics irrigated area and occupancy ii holistically quantifies water performance such as hydrological naturalness and self sufficiency amongst others and iii focuses on assessed entity of development this focus gives greater clarity regarding the impacts of design compared to other models which typically have a wider focus for example urban catchment or urban water infrastructure refer to table 1 suwmba s successful application for evaluating representative site scale design technology environment configurations in australia showed substantial variation in water performance for example certain architectural design i e sub divided single storey houses can have 301 more stormwater discharge compared to pre urbanised levels while others i e single storey detached houses with stormwater harvesting only mildly escalate it up to 113 suwmba helped to identify trade offs indicating that although some configurations perform best by having low imported water per capita they show a poor performance in other water performance aspects e g high stormwater discharge this demonstrated that comprehensive water performance evaluation across a range of indicators is required to prevent unintended impacts suwmba could also identify configurations that simultaneously met conflicting objectives such as densification improve hydrology and reduce reliance on imported water the result showed design c i e two storey semi detached units with 10 m3 stormwater harvesting system can not only increase the total number of residents by 300 but also can reduce the imported water per capita and stormwater discharge by 45 and 15 respectively this result shows the importance of joint consideration of architectural design and technologies to achieve multiple objectives in a given environmental context from the case study application of suwmba we have inferred future uses including its potential to i jointly evaluate the influence of both design and technology interventions given local environmental conditions on the water performance of an urban development ii understand trade offs and conflicting objectives of different performance objectives iii screen water performance improvements for a particular environmental context iv identify the required architectural design and technology specifications needed to reach water performance targets for a particular environmental context v compare benchmark and monitor the performance of developments types and their associated water servicing technologies and vi inform investment strategies by providing data for cost benefit analyses this knowledge can be used to inform better urban

17439,historically little consideration has been given to water performance of urban developments such as hydrological naturalness or local water self sufficiency this has led to problems with increased stormwater runoff flooding and lack of local contributions to urban water security architectural design water servicing technologies and environmental conditions are each known to influence water performance however most existing models have overlooked the integration of these factors in this work we asked how the water performance of urban developments at site scale can be quantified with joint consideration of architectural design water servicing technologies and environmental context i e climate and soil answering this question led to the development of a new method and tool called site scale urban water mass balance assessment suwmba it uses a daily urban water mass balance to simulate design technology environment configurations key features include i a three dimensional boundary focussed on the entity of development ii a comprehensive water balance accounting for all urban water flows iii methods that include key variables capturing the interactions of natural built environment and socio technological systems on water performance suwmba s capabilities were demonstrated through an evaluation of a residential infill development case study with alternative design technology environment configurations combining three dwelling designs seven water technologies and three environmental contexts the evaluation showed how a configuration can be identified that strikes a balance between the conflicting objectives of achieving the desired dwelling densities whilst simultaneously improving water performance for two climate zones the optimal configuration increases the total number of residents by 300 while reducing the imported water per capita and stormwater discharge by 45 and 15 respectively we infer that suwmba could have strong potential to contribute to performance based urban design and planning by enabling the water performance of dwelling designs to be quantified and by facilitating the setting of locally specific water performance objectives and targets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water sensitive urban design wsud performance based urban planning urban infill integrated urban water system modelling urban water metabolism recycling 1 introduction urban development especially infill provides a great opportunity to reshape cities and address their water related challenges newton et al 2012 such as flooding drought reduced water security and urban heat amongst others however this opportunity is not being embraced and business as usual development is recognised to have significant negative water related impacts murray et al 2011 it is generally well established that water extraction from and wastewater discharge to the environment to support urban areas should be reduced and urban hydrology needs to mimic the pre urbanised natural hydrological flows this is being promoted in a variety of programs water sensitive urban design australia sponge city china nature based solutions eu and low impact development usa fletcher et al 2015 however evidence for how best to do this at the local scale is missing due to a lack of suitable methods this work aims to improve the quantification of the water performance of residential dwelling design to provide evidence that can support better urban development water sensitive performance or water wise performance includes biophysical societal and ecological attributes outlined by rogers et al 2020 and international water association 2016 in this study water performance refers to the biophysical attributes related to the protection and functionality of water in the urban landscape including the maintenance of pre urbanised hydrological flows i e hydrological naturalness and water resource management renouf et al 2020a the societal and ecological attributes are beyond the scope of the current study architectural design and technology solutions are the main opportunities for improving water performance architectural design solutions aim to accommodate greater dwelling density whilst retaining green space and permeability to restore pre urbanised hydrology and improve liveability examples include sustainable urban greening strategies jim 2013 water sensitive planning carmon and shamir 2010 and improved infill housing design london et al 2020a murray et al 2011 technological solutions aim to generate supplementary water supplies to reduce reliance on imported water and to mitigate the effects of changed hydrology examples include water harvesting and recycling water efficient appliances fixtures and runoff retention detention and infiltration measures a very large number of solutions emerge when architectural design and technologies are jointly considered hereafter design technology configurations how to systematically quantify evaluate and compare these configurations is not clear in conventional urban design and planning water technologies are commonly considered after the urban form has been designed this overlooks the interactions between urban design and urban water systems and the potential that can be unlocked by better integrating the two collaborative urban design and planning is suggested to foster better integration mcevoy et al 2018 serrao neumann et al 2017 van de ven et al 2016 however it needs to be supported by quantitative evidence of the water performance of design technology configurations furthermore urban designers and architects typically follow planning and construction policy and regulations influencing and changing these policies also requires scientific evidence of the dis benefits a review of current methods that evaluate aspects of water performance is provided in table 1 the review showed that current methods have three main limitations in terms of our objectives i inappropriate system boundary i e the assessed entity and spatial scale ii inadequate consideration of urban water flows leading to incomplete water performance evaluation with some exceptions discussed later iii lack of appropriate architectural design and technology variables or their integration the assessed entity for most methods is the urban water infrastructure which is useful for engineering design purposes but less useful for informing urban design and planning methods with a landscape perspective which assess the urban entity indicated by ue in the table have generally been considered at large urban scale i e city scale and do not have the required detail to observe the design technology interactions current methods often do not consider both natural and anthropogenic flows leading to an incomplete water performance evaluation of the solutions and their impacts on the urban water cycle methods using urban water mass balance i e with black ticks for both natural and anthropogenic flows can be useful for our purposes as they consider all urban water flows but have been used for large urban scale some methods focusing on urban drainage e g swmm music mike urban etc are too complex for users outside the engineering community elliott and trowsdale 2007 our review did not cover sustainability rating systems e g breeam leed due to limitations that have been previously described including lack of hydrological performance local condition consideration and strong scientific basis berardi 2012 komeily and srinivasan 2015 sharifi and murayama 2013 siew et al 2013 to fill the gap in methods that suit our purposes we sought to find out how the water performance of urban developments at site scale can be quantified with joint consideration of architectural design water servicing technologies and environmental context i e climate and soil the result was the site scale urban water mass balance assessment suwmba tool a key novelty of suwmba is that it enables systematic quantification and evaluation of architectural design and water servicing technologies using quantitative water performance indicators three key innovations to answer the research question were the underpinning urban water mass balance explicit definition of the physical system boundary of urban developments i e landscape perspective and integration of key variables representing the interactions of natural built environment and socio technological systems which are elaborated in the discussion section this novel development helps overcome current limitations of methods including inappropriate system boundary partial consideration of urban water flows lack of architectural design variables and limited range of technologies refer to table 1 this paper describes suwmba s development and its underlying methods section 2 suwmba s capabilities are demonstrated through a case study in sections 3 and 4 we answer the research question in section 5 by highlighting the attributes of the suwmba tool that were found to be needed to achieve our objective limitations and future research needs are discussed in detail in section 5 1 our overall conclusions are provided in section 6 2 description of suwmba method 2 1 development suwmba is an integrated urban water system model it integrates i all urban water flows natural and anthropogenic ii decentralised and centralised urban water systems and iii architectural design and water servicing technologies framed by the environmental context suwmba is based on urban water mass balance originally developed by kenway et al 2011 and further developed by renouf et al 2018 and farooqui et al 2016 for city and precinct scale applications suwmba advances this approach for applications at the site scale fig 1 details how the urban water mass balance is modelled in suwmba arrows depict the movement of water between various surfaces and storages the transformation of water inflows into outflows are due to interactions between the hydrological and socio technological systems sections 2 2 2 7 describe how these are modelled in suwmba the urban water mass balance is derived from the estimated urban water flows as per eq 1 water performance indicators are derived from this data as described in section 2 8 all parameters flows and acronyms used in suwmba are explained in table 2 suwmba was developed in microsoft excel s visual basic for applications excel vba and matlab both versions have the same objective which is to quantify water performance of urban design technology configurations the microsoft excel version is a more rapid tool with in built libraries and suited to collaborative urban design and planning context it was developed as part of water sensitive outcomes for infill developments project irp4 of the cooperative research centres for water sensitive cities crcwsc https watersensitivecities org au content project irp4 the matlab version is more suited for performing high resolution urban water mass balance and automating scenario analysis hence more useful for research purposes details about their differences and screenshots of suwmba s microsoft excel user interface are presented in the supplementary material the matlab version was used in this work to automate calculations further details of the microsoft excel version can be found in the tool s user manual moravej et al 2020 for accessing suwmba contact the corresponding author suwmba s development was informed by input from stakeholders with expertise in building and landscape design urban water policy research teaching community engagement and environmental management details of tool testing by the stakeholders and the synthesis of their feedback that informed the tool s iterative development can be found in the supplementary material the role of tools such as suwmba in real world knowledge generation decision making and collaborative planning is an interesting extension of this work however it is not explored significantly in this paper instead we focus on its primary function of quantifying water performance 2 2 urban water mass balance the urban water mass balance is a key output from suwmba eq 1 shows the water mass balance developed for the defined urban system boundary fig 1 the terms and units of which are defined in table 2 it is based on the principle of mass conservation such that the sum of inflows the sum of outflows change in storage this equation holds for any given time period and urban system boundary following farooqui et al 2016 approach recycling and reuse wregw and wreww were accounted for by considering them as both a flow out of the urban system boundary and then a flow back into the system boundary as an input 1 p w w rain w sw w regw w reww w reaqu et sw s w rc ww w w rc w regw w reww gw i δ s 2 3 urban system boundary and temporal resolution the three dimensional urban system boundary fig 1 is defined horizontally by the spatial scope of the urban area being assessed defined by user and vertically from rooftop treetops to the root zone i e 1 m below surface consistent with the three dimensional definition used by renouf et al 2018 and kenway et al 2011 suwmba simulates all water flows on a daily time step but the output can be reported at any larger time scales some flows happen in shorter time frames such as seconds for toilet flushing and minutes for rainfall runoff and multiple times per day however sub daily time step was not considered because it increases the complexity and input data requirements which would limit suwmba s appeal for informing collaborative design and planning processes complexity is recognised as one of the main barriers to the adoption of integrated urban water models bach et al 2014 more detail on the temporal resolution is provided in the supplementary material 2 4 hydrological model hydrological flows infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff are estimated using a widely used algorithm adapted from chiew and mcmahon 1999 and used in the music model ewater 2011 the algorithm was modified so that suwmba can also account for anthropogenic flows and technologies that influence hydrological flows such as irrigation harvest and use of rainwater and stormwater runoff permeable paving and green roofs the model treats some of the water technologies green roof and permeable pavement as land cover types and simulates their water flows based on their specifications e g infiltration rate thickness storage capacity etc hydrological flows are estimated for each land cover depending on its impervious fraction storage capacity and soil type this estimation approach enables modelling of hydrological connectivity between different surfaces which is an important urban design aspect the hydrological model can be calibrated for a specific context however general calibrations exist for australian capital cities ewater 2011 and for specific soil types myers et al 2015 the hydrological model used in suwmba is presented in fig 2 and eqs 2 17 see table 2 for the definitions of the terms first the units for hydrological parameters were converted from mm to m3 based on the land cover areas eqs 2 5 precipitation on impervious surfaces generates impervious runoff once a small initial loss is exceeded eq 6 the initial loss storage is assumed to fully evaporate at the end of each day irrigation demand is calculated using soil moisture deficiency defined by the irrigation trigger factor eq 7 which enables exploring the potential impacts of different level of water restrictions and irrigation habits of residents on water performance irrigation is set to zero for impervious and non irrigated pervious surfaces infiltration is calculated using an infiltration rate defined by soil moisture storage as an exponential function eq 8 maximum infiltration occurs when the soil moisture is empty and gradually decreases to a minimum when soil moisture is full infiltration excess forms one part of the stormwater runoff from pervious surfaces eq 9 the other part is generated if the infiltrated water exceeds soil moisture store capacity eq 10 called the saturation excess evapotranspiration is subtracted from soil moisture eq 11 water further percolates and recharges the storage aquifer as a constant percentage of soil moisture above field capacity eq 12 the soil moisture is calculated eq 13 considering all inflows and outflows to from the soil stormwater runoff is generated as a summation of impervious runoff infiltration excess and saturation excess eq 14 stormwater runoff can flow to other land cover surfaces or leave the urban system boundary depending on the urban design configuration stormwater discharge from the system boundary sw see table 2 and fig 1 is a summation of the stormwater of land covers directed to the outlet eq 17 finally evapotranspiration and infiltration are summed over all land covers eqs 15 and 16 2 i m p s c i i m p s c i a i i m p f i 1000 3 f c i f c i a i 1 i m p f i 1000 4 c o e f f i c o e f f i a i 1 i m p f i 1000 5 s m s c i s

algorithms were derived from a linear regression of a large high resolution water use dataset for south east queensland in australia and have been found to be predictive of indoor water use in australia generally it enables consideration of consumer water use behaviours frequency duration etc appliances and water fixtures efficiency level type capacity etc demographics gender age profiles and household socio demographics income outdoor water use irrigation is estimated using eq 7 summed up for all land covers giving the the total outdoor water demand previous studies have shown that built environment variables such as lot size land cover housing value as a proxy of income density and housing age as a proxy of efficiency of appliances maturity of garden and leakage are influential stoker et al 2019 the combination of indoor and outdoor water demand models and architectural design variables in suwmba allows for quantifying the impacts of these variables on water performance and exploring the influence of behaviours and the built environment on water use 2 6 water harvesting and storage model a storage behaviour model is used to model the supply demand behaviour of each storage in the assessed urban system it is a daily water mass balance for each storage that models how the storage meets the demand set by the water demand model and the demand supply connection

their corresponding demand suwmba can explicitly define i the connection between different water sources and end uses matrix sd ii the contribution of end uses as an input to the treatment system for reuse recycling matrix rem and iii the priority of usages when multiple sources are available for the same end use matrix sd arrays in rem are binary indicating inputs to the treatment system or the storage from specified end use component see the supplementary material for an example the structure of sd and rem matrices allows for flexible consideration of any treatment systems and associated water quality implications this novel feature enables suwmba s users to explore the impacts of treatment systems to meet a range of end uses on water performance for example they can explore the water performance implication of treating harvested rainwater i e a water source to drinking quality compared to a less sophisticated treatment system that is only suitable for irrigation purposes moreover current local policies place limitations on suitable end uses depending on water quality and the type of dwellings e g indoor greywater reuse is not allowed for multi dwellings suwmba can be used to test these local policies and the potential dis benefits if they were to change 2 8 water performance indicators water performance indicators derived from the urban water mass balance data are another key output from suwmba they were based on indicators proposed by renouf et al 2020a the full list of which can be found in the supplementary material a sub set of three indicators were used to demonstrate suwmba in this paper hydrological naturalness imported water use per capita and water self sufficiency hydrological naturalness shows the extent to which hydrological flows of the urban system have changed relative to a pre urbanised case for evapotranspiration et stormwater discharge sw and infiltration i it is a ratio of the annual volume of the hydrological flow in the assessed case to that of the pre urbanised case expressed as a percentage it helps gauge progress toward mimicking natural flows imported water per capita and water self sufficiency represent the reliance of the assessed urban system on water mains performance can be improved through a combination of i reducing water demand ii utilising supplementary water sourced from within the urban system i e internalisation of supply and iii reuse recycling and cascading agudelo vera et al 2013 self sufficiency is defined as the fraction of demand that is met by water sourced from within the urban system boundary 3 case study testing of design technology environment configurations the purpose of the case study was to demonstrate the capabilities of suwmba for understanding interactions between design water technologies and the environmental context water performance was quantified for twenty one design technology configurations see fig 3 combining three dwelling architectural designs table 3 and seven technologies table 4 the identifiers for the configurations are denoted by the dwelling design typologies a single storey detached houses b sub divided single storey houses and c two storey semi detached units and the technology table 4 for example b gwr represents sub divided single storey houses with greywater reuse see fig 3 the configurations were modelled in the context of three australian cities brisbane melbourne and adelaide representing sub tropical temperate and semi arid climates with different soil types the architectural designs were sourced from london et al 2020a and represent typical dwelling typologies associated with suburban densification occurring in australian capital cities murray et al 2011 they are fundamentally different in terms of architectural design principles london et al 2020a this study focuses on the water performance of these designs with different technologies and under different environmental conditions other dis benefits such as green space quality thermal comfort land consumption density and liveability are also important and can be found elsewhere renouf et al 2020b london et al 2020b design a is the reference case representing 71 of current dwelling types in australia abs 2016 it is characterised by generous indoor and outdoor private space providing green space enabling infiltration evapotranspiration and associated benefits london et al 2020a being a low density typology it has a high land consumption leading to extensive horizontal growth and low efficiency in utilising land design b represents the business as usual infill development occurring in australia which is sub division of single lots to achieve a higher density than design a it is typically characterised by large impervious areas i e building footprints driveways parking spaces etc that leave little or no quality outdoor space for permeable surfaces greening and mature trees london et al 2020a potential negative water related impacts of design b have been mentioned in the literature murray et al 2011 renouf et al 2019a but quantifications of these impacts are rare design c has been proposed as an alternative infill development typology that aims for similar or higher dwelling density to design b but maintaining outdoor spaces on the site london et al 2020a murray et al 2011 it provides more capacity to plan and incorporate water sensitive design solutions by consolidating lots rather than sub dividing the occupancies residents per dwelling were assumed based on the statistics for the relevant city 2 5 for brisbane and adelaide and 2 3 for melbourne abs 2016 so the total number of residents provided by designs a b and c are respectively 5 10 and 15 in brisbane and adelaide and 4 6 9 2 and 13 8 in melbourne a pre urbanised case pre for each city was also evaluated as a reference case for the hydrological flows the pre was assumed to be 90 short vegetation and 10 bare soil daily flows were simulated for each configuration over a 14 year period from 01 01 2005 to 31 12 2018 using daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data bom 2019 this period includes wet and dry years so the design technology configurations could be considered for a range of climatic conditions the efficiency of appliances and fixtures were characterised using water efficiency labelling standards wels www waterrating gov au wels is a water rating scheme that labels appliances and fixtures from 1 to 6 stars depending on the water consumption the more stars the more water efficient we assumed 3 star appliances and fixtures in most cases in the efficient appliances and fixtures ea technology case 5 star appliances and fixtures was assumed see table 4 water rating label of 5 and 6 starts are considered efficient according to wels suwmba was run for an average australian water use behaviour which consists of 7 1 min shower duration and average tap usages of 1 min per instance other indoor water demand parameters are defined in the supplementary material in terms of outdoor water demand the base case assumes all vegetated areas are irrigated the crop factors and irrigation trigger factors defined in fig 3 the parameters of technologies are detailed in table 4 4 results the urban water mass balance and water performance indicators generated for the case study configurations demonstrate the function of suwmba for jointly considering architectural design water technologies and environmental context the urban water mass balance results table 5 7 allowed us to observe how the key influencing variables of the design technology environment configurations influence all urban water flows the results of selected performance indicators table 8 fig 4 and fig 5 allowed us to draw out the interactions between design technology and environment 4 1 influence of design technology environment variables on hydrology comparing the water mass balance data of different cities table 5 7 shows that environmental context has the most influence on the hydrological flows the flows are greater for brisbane than melbourne table 6 and adelaide due to higher precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in brisbane s sub tropical climate see p and e t 0 values in fig 3 soil characteristics particularly soil moisture store capacity are also influential therefore climate and soil variables are key variables in suwmba the degree in which architectural design influences water performance can be observed in the hydrological naturalness ratios table 8 by comparing a bc b bc and c bc excluding the impacts of technologies in general architectural designs negatively impact the hydrology by increasing sw 100 and decreasing et and i 100 to varying degrees exceptions discussed later corresponding well with imperviousness the highest impact was seen for b bc followed by c bc and a bc designs for example in adelaide b bc was found to increase sw to 301 reduce i and et to 24 and 80 due to it having the highest impervious fraction with 79 of the site is covered with hard surfaces such as roof and pavement see table 3 therefore land cover characteristics influenced strongly by architectural design are key variables in suwmba et naturalness ratios for a bc in melbourne and adelaide and for c bc in adelaide were estimated to be more than 100 which is due to irrigating vegetated areas by imported water w irrigation water subsequently evapotranspires adding to natural evapotranspiration the irrigated areas in a bc and c bc designs are 59 and 38 of the total site see table 3 the irrigation of these areas is enough to offset the loss of evapotranspiration due to lost vegetation and evan more than needed to restore it to pre urbanised levels therefore the extent of vegetated area whether irrigated or not is an important land cover variable in suwmba when those areas are irrigated the conflicting issue of water demand for irrigation needs to be considered discussed in section 4 2 water technologies can mitigate the negative impacts of architectural designs to a degree that depends on interactions with the environmental context and the architectural design table 8 shows that none of the configurations were able to restore pre urbanised sw and i to pre urbanised levels i e sw naturalness is always 100 and i naturalness is always 100 however pre urbanised et could be restored with certain configurations e g a gr some technologies are more effective in this regard in certain environmental context for example gr is the most effective technology to reduce stormwater discharge for design b due to large roof areas in brisbane and melbourne but not as effective as swh in adelaide configurations with the best water performance in terms of lowest sw were found to be those with the largest total storage smax in terms of combined built storage e g tanks and natural storage e g soil moisture capacity for example sw naturalness of design a in melbourne range from 113 to 174 with a swh having the largest storage 36 m3 being the best and a bc having the smallest storage 26 m3 being the worst although the importance of total storage seems obvious the degree to which it impacts water performance is not well understood and utilised in urban design total storage is a key variable that is determined by both architectural design e g permeable area for facilitating soil moisture storage and technology specifications e g tank size the other important technology variable that influences hydrology is how the tank storages are managed for example although smax of b gr 26 m3 is larger than of b swh 23 m3 in adelaide the latter has a better lower sw naturalness 216 compared to 222 because the stormwater store is actively managed to meet the demand this variable also influences water demand and supply which is discussed in section 4 2 and 4 3 4 2 influence of design technology environment variables on water supply and demand urbanisation results in more water passing through the urban system compared to the pre urbanised case due to the import of water into the urban system to meet water demand the amount of imported water w depends on the environmental context the architectural design and the water technologies in place architectural design determines the number of occupants and the irrigated areas which influence indoor and outdoor water demand respectively the degree to which water demand has been influenced by the architectural design can be observed by comparing w of a bc b bc and c bc configurations for example in brisbane the values were 376 515 and 790 m3 yr for a bc b bc and c bc respectively higher water demand observed for c bc configurations is due to more residents 15 in c compared to 5 in a and relatively large irrigated areas see green areas in table 3 the environmental context also influences irrigation demand via the amount of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture store capacity smsc for example adelaide has a higher water demand than the other locations due to the need for higher and more frequent irrigation because the soil moisture capacity is small it is not frequently restored by precipitation and it rapidly depletes due to high evapotranspiration water technologies have the greatest potential to reduce demand for w and also wastewater discharge ww for example greywater reuse can potentially reduce w by 24 b gwr in brisbane to 32 c gwr in adelaide the important variables are the water demand both indoor and outdoor piping configurations and the supply demand matrices i e sd and rem and storage volume water demand in turn depends on the number of dwellings occupants per dwelling technology specifications e g appliances efficiency types capacity etc and irrigated areas piping configurations which determine how the water source s supply end uses is particularly important for example b rwh configuration includes 4 rainwater tanks one for each dwelling of 2m3 to give a total of 8m3 compared to the b swh configuration which consists of 1 stormwater tank of 10 m3 while the smax of b swh is larger than that of b rwh the demand for the latter is lower higher demand in this case strikes a better balance between inflow to and outflow of the rainwater tanks the balance is a combination of architectural design variables e g roof areas and associated demand i e pipe configurations this result indicates how suwmba can be used to analyse the implication of different treatment systems on water performance the case study assessment has highlighted the need for joint consideration of design technology environment variables because the configurations not only impact water supply and demand but also impact hydrology failing to consider the impact of all relevant variables might lead to solutions that improve one aspect of water performance but worsen others which is explored in the next section 4 3 interactions between design technology and environment fig 4 allows us to observe trade offs between the two objectives of reducing reliance on w and reducing sw these indicators are shown together ranked from highest to lowest in terms of w per capita the w per capita for a bc in brisbane melbourne and adelaide is 206 231 270 l person day respectively the highest reduction in w per capita in each of the cities ranged from 50 to 61 the highest reduction in brisbane and melbourne was achieved by b rwh whereas in adelaide it was b gwr this suggests that no one design technology configuration performs best in all circumstances the reason for the substantial reduction in w per capita for the b configurations is two fold firstly the limited garden area for design b minimises outdoor water demand per capita secondly the presence of supplementary water supplies i e greywater reuse rainwater harvesting meet a fraction of the total demand leading to further reduction of w the concept of water sensitivity promotes water s functionality for greening cooling amenity etc which is lost in design b so the lowest w per capita although desirable in terms of water performance should be considered along with the lost benefits of other functionalities of water design b generally performs best in terms of w per capita 50 61 reduction but ranks amongst the worst in terms of sw increased by 39 72 compared to a bc these trade offs show that achieving one water performance objective in isolation e g w reduction without considering other aspects e g sw does not necessarily lead to an overall water performance improvement therefore a comprehensive water performance evaluation across a range of indicators is required to prevent unintended impacts which was enabled by suwmba the case study analysis found middle ground configurations where multiple water performance objectives are simultaneously met for example fig 4 shows that in c swh w per capita is reduced relative to a bc by roughly 45 and sw is only increased by 14 in brisbane and reduced by around 15 in melbourne and adelaide noting that design c accommodate 300 more residents compared to a this result shows how architectural design and technologies with certain specifications can work together to achieve multiple objectives in a given environmental context this example has shown the potential for joint evaluation of design and water technologies in order to optimise for both water efficiency and stormwater management a similar process could be performed for other performance indicators that are important in other contexts for example increasing evapotranspiration by more irrigation for heat mitigation versus water self sufficiency water performance varies under different climatic conditions eg wet versus dry years the indicator of water self sufficiency was used to show suwmba s ability to explore the influence of such variations fig 5 understanding the variability of water performance is important because a configuration that provides a medium level of water self sufficiency but with low variability might be favourable over the one that has high self sufficiency in normal or wet years but fails in times of droughts when water self sufficiency is most needed as evidenced by the a swh case in melbourne see fig 5 fig 5 shows that self sufficiency can vary significantly depending on the configuration it can be as low as 10 for a rwh in adelaide or as high as 36 for a swh in melbourne the highest degree of water self sufficiency was found to be achieved by gwr except for design b in brisbane and melbourne gwr also shows lower variability meaning that it provides relatively constant water self sufficiency in both wet and dry years so it is more reliable than other technologies the reason is the steady inflow to the gwr system compared to other technologies which rely on precipitation 5 discussion we identified that the suwmba needed to have the following innovative features in order to jointly examine the influence of architectural design water technologies and environmental context a framework based on urban water mass balance a landscape perspective a site scale system boundary and methods that are parameterised for key variables to model design technology interactions urban water mass balance is a fundamental feature of suwmba it enabled an explicit definition of the urban system which led to a unique landscape perspective satisfying the urban water mass balance required consideration of all water flows into and out the defined system as well as changes in storage therefore it ensured a holistic quantification of water performance which could not be achieved by other methods that focus on urban water infrastructure or that capture a partial picture of water flows see table 1 the need for a holistic picture of water performance was evidenced by the results showing potentially conflicting water performance objectives require integrated design and technology solutions the need to account for all urban water flows both natural and anthropogenic to prevent unintended problem shifting has been recognised previously renouf et al 2018 however this is the first time it has been possible to provide detailed evidence to support the need for integrated solutions by virtue of higher resolution possible at the site scale a novel aspect of suwmba is the landscape perspective which is different from the urban water infrastructure or urban catchment perspectives taken in other methods collaborative discussions between urban designers planners water managers engineers stakeholders decision makers as well as other disciplines urban heat liveability etc revolve around land parcels therefore suwmba s landscape perspective allows it to be used in collaborative urban design and planning processes the case study results demonstrated how suwmba can be used to identify a best case for a given landscape configuration which balances multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives in this case storage was shown to be an important variable which can feed into discussions between architects and water engineers about how best to accommodate the required storage into the assessed landscape and how this would in turn affect water performance and urban water infrastructure the site scale system boundary opted for in suwmba was motivated by the fact that decisions about architectural design and water technologies are mostly made at this scale previous work using this holistic approach has focused on larger urban scales for example city or precinct scale e g farooqui et al 2016 last 2011 renouf et al 2018 which is useful for strategic planning but less useful for decision making at operational level we found that site scale provided the higher resolution needed to observe the interactions between design and water technologies the case study evaluation enabled the key variables that influence performance to be identified key design variables were found to be number of dwellings land cover characteristics irrigated area and occupants per dwelling key water technology variables are the total storage capacity the demand supply matrix and the type of supplementary water harnessed the methods used in suwmba needed to be parameterised so that these variables can be modified to explore what if scenarios the importance of environmental variables was also highlighted showing that no one design technology combination fits all environmental contexts the inclusion of architectural design and environmental variables is important for developers and planners because it helps them to analyse if choices made in one setting are applicable to another suwmba is an important advancement over other models that generally lack architectural design variables refer to table 1 the ability to jointly explore both architectural design variables and water technologies with consideration of the environmental context is a feature that differentiates suwmba from existing methods preliminary use of suwmba to explore most common design technology configurations seen in australia showed the impacts of densification is substantially different for alternative configurations i e compare the performance of design b with c therefore decisions about boosting or limiting densification are influenced by the interactions between design technology and environmental context this result suggests policies that solely consider densification indicators e g people ha might limit creativity for creating integrated solutions in architectural and technology space 5 1 limitation and future research needs suwmba does not account for the nutrients and energy implications of water servicing options there may be synergies and trade offs between water nutrients and water related energy which should also be explored this is an opportunity for future iterations of the tool suwmba s conceptualisation of water flows may be limited for some regional contexts for example it does not account for snow accumulation which is important for colder climates or water supply by tankers which is important for some cities in developing countries nor does it provide a good representation of areas with complex groundwater systems such aspects would need to be added for use in regions other than australia future research could consider linking site scale evaluation using the suwmba tool to larger scale frameworks while suwmba focuses on site scale assessment it is recognised there is interest in extrapolating an understanding water performance up to larger urban scales precinct or city scale as evidenced by other tools and models that operate at this scale table 1 we suggest that future research can link suwmba to urban water systems transition models e g crc scenario tool rauch et al 2017 to scale up the dis benefits from site scale design technology interventions to meet water performance objectives set at the larger scales e g city scale as outlined by hoffmann et al 2020 as a research priority another interesting extension could be the identification of water performance pathways due to the uptake of alternative site scale architectural design and new water technologies as a response to societal transitions and climate change since current transition models do not capture design technology interactions as shown in table 1 they cannot perform such analysis without use of suwmba or developing similar site scale models future work should focus on the application of suwmba in a variety of locations and contexts to further elicit its capacities future applications could use suwmba to simultaneously optimise architectural design and technologies to achieve some pre defined targets this would be a multi objective optimisation maximising different water performance objectives to check if and how for example the natural water balance can be achieved another research need is the consideration of multiple technologies together we analysed technologies in isolation for simplicity to demonstrate suwmba s capabilities however multiple interactions exist when technologies are considered together which are also captured in suwmba an interesting direction for future research could be exploring the role of suwmba in real world knowledge generation decision making and collaborative planning the interactions between models tools and people using them in a collaborative urban design and planning context are not well understood mcevoy et al 2018 recent studies showed that the context including style of use e g interactive nature of the tool style of facilitation etc phase of planning that a tool is used and societal context e g culture capacity of local stakeholders etc could have an impact on the use and the added value of the tools in real world participatory workshops mcevoy et al 2019 different tools seem to deliver different types of participation and outcomes e g learning vs final product mcevoy et al 2018 our limited observation in suwmba s testing and development process see the supplementary material in australian context inferred that suwmba improved both learning and the quality the design as the results of collaborative activities however these societal aspects need further research that was beyond our scope finally it is acknowledged that decisions about urban design at the site scale are not made solely based on water performance other environmental performance aspects such as urban heat liveability and green space quality are needed prior to cost benefit analysis and in turn for guiding multi criteria decision making processes suwmba could be used alongside other performance evaluation processes an example of which is provided by renouf et al 2020a to feed into cost benefit analysis and multi criteria decision support systems the investment framework for economics of water sensitive cities pannell 2020 is a recent example that could benefit from the quantifications provided by suwmba current multi criteria decision support systems for site scale design process inter alia jalilzadehazhari and johansson 2019 and hu 2019 do not have water performance elements therefore a priority for future research could be the use of suwmba in a multi criteria decision support systems that include cost benefit analysis alongside other environmental performance 6 conclusions this paper introduced a new approach i e suwmba for quantifying the water performance of site scale urban developments and their holistic impacts on the urban water cycle in answering the research question we found that the water performance of design technology environment configurations can be quantified by i defining a three dimensional urban entity ii accounting for all water flows both natural and anthropogenic and iii capturing the interactions between natural built environment and socio technological systems by incorporating key influential variables related to hydrology architectural design technologies and end use water demand suwmba is an important advancement over other site scale models because it specifically i accounts for architectural design variables such as number of dwellings land cover characteristics irrigated area and occupancy ii holistically quantifies water performance such as hydrological naturalness and self sufficiency amongst others and iii focuses on assessed entity of development this focus gives greater clarity regarding the impacts of design compared to other models which typically have a wider focus for example urban catchment or urban water infrastructure refer to table 1 suwmba s successful application for evaluating representative site scale design technology environment configurations in australia showed substantial variation in water performance for example certain architectural design i e sub divided single storey houses can have 301 more stormwater discharge compared to pre urbanised levels while others i e single storey detached houses with stormwater harvesting only mildly escalate it up to 113 suwmba helped to identify trade offs indicating that although some configurations perform best by having low imported water per capita they show a poor performance in other water performance aspects e g high stormwater discharge this demonstrated that comprehensive water performance evaluation across a range of indicators is required to prevent unintended impacts suwmba could also identify configurations that simultaneously met conflicting objectives such as densification improve hydrology and reduce reliance on imported water the result showed design c i e two storey semi detached units with 10 m3 stormwater harvesting system can not only increase the total number of residents by 300 but also can reduce the imported water per capita and stormwater discharge by 45 and 15 respectively this result shows the importance of joint consideration of architectural design and technologies to achieve multiple objectives in a given environmental context from the case study application of suwmba we have inferred future uses including its potential to i jointly evaluate the influence of both design and technology interventions given local environmental conditions on the water performance of an urban development ii understand trade offs and conflicting objectives of different performance objectives iii screen water performance improvements for a particular environmental context iv identify the required architectural design and technology specifications needed to reach water performance targets for a particular environmental context v compare benchmark and monitor the performance of developments types and their associated water servicing technologies and vi inform investment strategies by providing data for cost benefit analyses this knowledge can be used to inform better urban
