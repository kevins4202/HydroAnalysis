4030,a deficit in rainy days can affect crop production and escalate groundwater abstraction leading to groundwater depletion thus may threaten food and water security in the indian subcontinent the available researches on rainfall occurrence in india represent inconsistency in several fundamental considerations spatial scale of analysis the definition of rainfall classes methods dataset study period etc and lack of studies for non monsoon seasons over large parts of the subcontinent here we attempt to deal with these inconsistencies by examining space time patterns in seasonal count of rainfall events and their count in different rainfall classes during 1951 2015 for all meteorological seasons of india using high resolution 0 25 gridded daily rainfall dataset the results show a widespread decline in monsoon rainy days over major crop growing regions including north central central and northeast india a reduction in rainy days is also observed over parts of central india in premonsoon over north central and northeast india in postmonsoon and over peninsular india in winter these trends are mainly observed in events with rainfall 95th percentile light to heavy rainfall events in all the seasons occurrence of extreme events above 95th and 99th percentile exhibits contrasting trends over different zones with mainly an increase over central and south central india and decline over central north india however trends in extremes are highly dispersed in space and are conclusive only over a few regions the observed trends substantially deviate from the patterns reported in past studies for different regions rainfall occurrence in different meteorological zones also represents strong interannual and decadal variability however the observed trends have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability the present findings provide an essential foundation for several future explorations with improved understanding of change in rainfall frequency and its possible impacts it would also assist in developing a comprehensive framework for year wide management of water resources and agriculture considering all crop seasons keywords rainfall occurrence rainy days trend analysis rainfall frequency rainfall variability india 1 introduction anthropogenic emissions in the post industrialization era are causing a rapid increase in global temperature 1 c above the pre industrial level until 2017 which is a well established global issue among the scientific community and political agendas in the recent times ipcc 2014 the warming of global temperatures is modulating the dynamics of atmosphere land ocean processes and their mutual interaction at the global and regional scale collins et al 2010 soden and held 2006 vecchi and soden 2007 wang et al 2004 an immediate effect of global warming is observed in the regional hydrologic cycle particularly as altered rainfall characteristics in different parts of the world allen and ingram 2002 chou and neelin 2004 the principal alterations appeared as a shift intensification or reduction in different rainfall attributes the changes in the intensity and frequency of rainfall are leading to frequent episodes of severe droughts in some parts while devastating floods in the others thus adversely affecting the water resources management and agriculture around the world including india arnell 1999 dai 2013 lobell et al 2011 roxy et al 2017 schiermeier 2011 trenberth et al 2014 rainfall serves as a lifeline for about 19 of the world s population living in india bhanja et al 2017 india s economy is primarily controlled by the agriculture sector constitute 16 of total gdp which provides livelihood to 60 of the working population singh et al 2014 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 as 56 of agriculture is rainfed the socio economic well being of the country is substantially dependent on the rainfall sahany et al 2018 singh et al 2014 in response an increasing number of researches have focused on understanding the changing attributes of rainfall in india over the last few decades owing to its importance and large variability in space dependent on track of summer monsoon and topography and time monsoon dominated seasonality numerous past studies have explored the changes in intensity duration and magnitude of rainfall in different parts of the country the frequency of rainfall or rainfall occurrence is another crucial aspect of rainfall characteristics but has received limited attention in the existing literature das et al 2014 dash et al 2009 kumar and jain 2011 the rainfall frequency directly influences the soil moisture evapotranspiration relative humidity land surface temperature and other related variables gong et al 2019 kamara and jackson 1997 indirectly its impact can be seen on natural vegetation health groundwater abstraction regional farming practices and the overall water availability in the region asoka et al 2017 dey and mujumdar 2019 fishman 2018 sahany et al 2018 a frequent and prolonged deficit in rainy days can adversely affect crop production in rainfed agriculture to the extent that it may subjugate the benefits of an increase in total rainfall for crop yield fishman 2018 2016 also a decrease in number of rainfall events during the cultivation period may invoke a rise in groundwater pumping in groundwater fed agriculture asoka et al 2017 singh et al 2014 for an agrarian economy like india a long term deficit in the count of rainfall events in conjunction with rapid depletion of groundwater reserves can be a serious threat to the food security and socio economic well being of the country sahany et al 2018 yet the frequency of rainfall events remains the least studied rainfall attribute in the literature on india the available research on rainfall occurrence has primarily focused on the summer monsoon season owing to its dominance on annual rainfall and wider impacts das et al 2014 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2015 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 for the non monsoon seasons only the regions with substantial rainfall events in respective seasons were considered for example south peninsular india for postmonsoon nageswararao et al 2019 naidu et al 2012 and northwest india for winter nageswararao et al 2016 whereas no work is available on rainfall occurrence in the premonsoon it leaves a large void of information on rainfall occurrence over wide agriculturally active parts of the country for most of the cultivation period the available studies on long term trends in the frequency of rainfall events are highly inconsistent in terms of reported change patterns das et al 2014 dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2015 krishnamurthy et al 2009 kumar and jain 2011 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the key responsible factors for this inconsistency are spatial scale of analysis methods adopted study period and dataset used a majority of previous works have investigated the trends in rainfall aggregated over large regions such as wide rectangular box homogeneous monsoon zones meteorological subdivisions river basins etc few recent studies performed spatial distributed analysis and found contradictory patterns in the regions previously reported to be exhibiting homogenous trends ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the analysis with area averaged rainfall fails to capture the local variations in trend patterns which questions the suitability of their results for regional scale water resources management and policymaking therefore a robust understanding of change patterns requires spatially distributed analysis especially in the backdrop of large spatial variability in rainfall over the indian subcontinent ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 further the frequency of extreme rainfall events particularly in the monsoon season has received more attention in the recent literature due to their direct association with devastating floods and associated risks ghosh et al 2012 goswami et al 2010 2006 krishnamurthy et al 2009 mahanta et al 2013 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 meanwhile only a handful of studies have investigated the trends in the frequency of rainfall events in different rainfall classes besides extreme events ghosh et al 2009 guhathakurta et al 2015 nageswararao et al 2019 another major concern in these studies is the nonuniformity in the criteria for defining the rainfall classes the definition of rainfall classes can substantially deviate the results and their relevance to impacts and policies das et al 2014 ghosh et al 2012 due to inconsistency in the definition of rainfall classes in different studies it is difficult to combine the study outcomes and draw affirmative conclusions thus limiting their credibility in the decision making process the available literature is also inconsistent in terms of dataset used as majority of initial studies used 1 gridded dataset by rajeevan et al 2006 while recent studies used 0 25 gridded dataset by pai et al 2014 a fundamental difference in these datasets is that 1 dataset is developed with fixed number of stations whereas 0 25 dataset is developed with varying number of stations a varying number of stations may have implications over the study results which remains unaddressed in the past works past studies also provide evidences of prominent interannual variability in rainfall of summer monsoon krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 as well as non monsoon seasons such as winter dimri 2013 however no past study has examined the inherent natural variability in rainfall occurrence over the indian subcontinent the knowledge on natural variability of rainfall occurrence would help to understand whether the observed trends are attributable to the anthropogenic climate change or emerging as a part of inherent natural variability evidently the available research on the frequency of rainfall events in india is characterized by several limitations including lack of studies for non monsoon seasons inadequate considerations zonal average analysis and methods used and inconsistency in few fundamental assumptions definition of rainfall classes and study period in the backdrop of these inhomogeneities and lack of information an important question arises as if water resources or agriculture planners must frame a management policy today using the available knowledge on rainfall occurrence what results one should adopt we have attempted to address this question in the present study by performing gridwise analysis of trends in the seasonal count of rainfall events and the count in different rainfall classes for four meteorological seasons over entire india during 1951 2015 considering all four seasons for the entire country would fill the void of information for non monsoon seasons in summary the present study aims to address the following questions and gaps in the existing literature inconsistency in the literature in terms of spatial domain data used study period methods etc and lack of information for non monsoon seasons over large parts of the country whether rainfall events of entire magnitude range exhibit similar patterns if not what are the patterns in occurrence for different rainfall classes whether the observed trends are a component of inherent natural variability or emerged independent of it the remaining paper is organized as follows section 2 describes various data and methods used in the present study results and discussion on different analyses performed in present work as summarized in section 3 section 4 provides a summary of key findings and future prospects of the present work 2 dataset and methods 2 1 dataset in the present study we used gridded daily rainfall record at 0 25 pai et al 2014 and 1 rajeevan et al 2006 resolution from the india meteorological department imd for 1951 2015 a total of 4964 grid points are available in 0 25 dataset covering entire india the dataset is prepared using daily rainfall records from 6955 rain gauge stations with a varying period of data availability pai et al 2014 for the period considered in the present work i e 1951 2015 the data is available from 3100 stations per day which is fairly higher than the previous years pai et al 2014 the station data were transformed to 0 25 resolution grids using the inverse distance weighted scheme shepard 1968 that retained the vital climatological patterns in rainfall over the country it is the finest resolution dataset available on long term observed daily rainfall over india which is also superior to previous datasets the dataset accurately captures the mean climatology and seasonality in the rainfall and provides a more realistic representation of heavy rainfall over the regions with hilly topography and large spatial variabilities such as western ghats northeast india and the himalayan regions nageswararao et al 2019 pai et al 2014 further the dataset provides a continuous record of daily rainfall without any missing value with complete coverage over the country thus most suitable for spatial distributed analysis of rainfall occurrence in the region on the other hand 1 gridded dataset by imd is developed with fixed number of rainfall stations 2140 stations over the entire country using the same interpolation scheme as used in 0 25 data rajeevan et al 2006 the daily rainfall of each year during 1951 2015 was separated for four meteorological seasons in india premonsoon march may monsoon june september postmonsoon october december and winter january february all the analyses were performed at individual grid locations and the results are reported at each grid as well as for six homogeneous monsoon rainfall zones hmzs defined by imd northwest nw central northeast cne northeast ne west central wc hilly regions hr and south peninsular region pr fig 1 a 2 2 definition of rainy days and rainfall classes most studies for monsoon season have adopted the threshold of 2 5 mm day 1 for rainy days while 1 mm day 1 is used as a threshold for non monsoon seasons also the world meteorological organisation wmo suggests 1 mm day 1 as the threshold of rainy days for worldwide applications wmo 2017 consistent with the definition of wmo and to maintain homogeneity across all the seasons we define rainy day as the day with rainfall intensity 1 mm day 1 further two commonly adopted criteria for the definition of rainfall classes are fixed threshold goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 roxy et al 2017 and fixed percentile ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the fixed threshold approach uses a single value of rainfall across an entire region to demarcate rainfall classes thus inappropriate for heterogeneous rainfall regions the fixed percentile based threshold varies spatially corresponding to the rainfall distribution at different locations therefore most suitable for gridwise analysis subsequently six rainfall classes are defined in the present study light 25th percentile moderate 25th 50th percentile moderate heavy 50th 75th percentile heavy 75th 95th percentile very heavy 95th 99th percentile and extremely heavy 99th percentile the percentiles are computed separately for each season using daily rainfall series with intensity 1 mm day 1 over a base period of 1961 1990 dey and mujumdar 2019 karl et al 1999 at individual grid location note that only the rainfall events regarded as a rainy day rainfall 1 mm day 1 are considered to compute the percentiles and to obtain the count of rainy days for further analyses 2 3 analysis of trend and its field significance the time series of rainy days is essentially a sequence of observations of a count variable the application of conventional or modified version of mann kendall trend test to a series of counts is not amenable due to the presence of a large number of ties frei and schär 2001 proposed a binomial logistic regression based approach to assess trends in count variables such as rainy days and frequency of rainfall events in a given rainfall class in this approach a linear relationship is established between the expected value of counts and time as 1 l o g i t π α β t in which 2 l o g i t π l o g π 1 π where α and β are coefficients of regression t is time year and π is the probability of counts or event probability computed as the ratio of number of successes rainy days to number of trials total days in a period season or year the trend magnitude is obtained from an output of logistic regression namely the odds ratio which denotes the relative change in the ratio of occurrences vs non occurrences during a period frei and schär 2001 the odds ratio can be computed as 3 θ π t n 1 π t n π t 1 1 π t 1 where π t is the probability of an event at time t frei and schär 2001 the trend magnitude is estimated as θ 1 in which a positive value represents a larger number of occurrences at the end of the period compared to the beginning increasing trend and vice versa decreasing trend if the value is negative frei and schär 2001 schmidli and frei 2005 for the convenience of representation the relative change is computed over a period of 100 years to denote the magnitude of trend multiple studies have used this method for examining trends in the frequency of climate variables such as rainfall and runoff burn et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2016 in the study trends and their significance at 5 significance level were estimated over 1951 2015 using r package developed by frei and schär 2001 we also examined the field significance of gridwise estimated trends for different hmzs using the bootstrap procedure suggested by douglas et al 2000 the most common challenge in determining the regional consistency of trends is the spatial correlation or spatial dependence between data at different locations spatial correlation in the data can substantially deviate the test results leading to biased conclusions a high resolution gridded rainfall data may represent significant spatial dependence thus require an adequate consideration in the analysis douglas et al 2000 proposed a bootstrap based procedure to include the effect of spatial correlation in testing the field significance past studies have applied this approach in conjunction with the mann kendall test to examine different climate variables here we demonstrate its application with the trend analysis method suggested by frei and schär 2001 in the process the actual number of grids with significant trend is compared against the critical value of significant results nc corresponding to a set regional significance level α the simulated sample of significant results n m m 1 n is obtained from trend analysis of bootstrapped samples of original data over n simulations the empirical quantile of the simulated sample n m corresponding to 1 α is regarded as the critical value nc the result with the actual count of significant trends over a region higher than the critical value nc is adopted as field significant for the region the stepwise procedure of sample bootstrapping is described in burn and hag elnur 2002 and renard et al 2008 with the only difference in trend analysis method our analysis drew 1000 bootstrap samples of daily rainfall value of rainy days to simulate a sample of significant results the field significance of negative and positive trends is estimated separately for different hmzs in each season at 5 significance level during 1951 2015 2 4 significance of change in rainy days between two halves of the study period the frequency of rainfall events is a count variable and corresponds to a sample drawn from the population following discrete distribution the conventional anderson darling test anderson and darling 1954 assumes that the random samples to be tested belong to a continuous population thus inappropriate for the discretely distributed count of rainy days therefore the statistical significance of change in distribution empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of rainy days between two halves of the study period 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 is estimated using the modified anderson darling test namely k sample anderson darling test proposed by scholz and stephens 1987 the k sample anderson darling test is a rank based test that establishes the difference between two samples without making any prior parametric assumptions scholz and stephens 1987 in the study the test is applied using the r package ksamples https cran r project org package ksamples the significance of departure in ecdf of rainy days is analyzed separately for different hmzs in each season we obtained the samples of rainy days for two periods 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 by combining the seasonal count of rainy days at all grids falling within an hmz during the respective periods the significance of the difference in the mean and standard deviation of rainy days between two periods 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 is tested using non parametric bootstrap approach the confidence interval on sampled mean and standard deviation is estimated at 5 significance level using a total of 1000 bootstrap samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution of rainy days in india the spatial distribution of mean annual count of rainy days at each grid location during 1951 2015 is shown in fig 1c evidently the spatial patterns in the annual climatology of rainy days are fairly congruent to that in the rainfall amount as documented in numerous past studies pai et al 2015 large variations can be seen in the spatial distribution of annual rainfall occurrence throughout the country the northeast india and the western ghats along the west coastline of india received largest number 140 200 of daily rainfall events owing to their hilly topography that provides an orographic barrier to the moisture laden winds especially during the summer monsoon season june september there exists a southeast to northwest falling gradient in rainfall occurrence over the flatter landmass of the indian subcontinent with a fairly high number 80 120 of rainy days over eastern and east central regions and scarcity 5 40 of rainfall occurrence over northwest india in north india the great himalayan ranges 6000 to 7500 m above sea level traverse along the southeast northwest direction that applies a topographic barrier to moist winds from south southwest monsoon winds and west northwest westerlies during winter fig 1b it causes heavy downpour along the windward face of the himalayan ranges during summer monsoon months and substantial rainfall during himalayan winters november april bookhagen and burbank 2010 2006 the orography induced precipitation over the himalayan region soaks most of the moisture from winds entering from different directions leaving relatively drier winds for higher elevations in the north bookhagen and burbank 2010 as a result eastern parts of north himalayas remain precipitation scarce for most part of the year similar patterns are also reflected in the spatial distribution of annual rainfall occurrence as the southern and western parts of north india covering uttarakhand himachal pradesh and western jammu kashmir experience considerable 80 120 annual rainfall events while eastern parts ladakh region remain relatively dry 20 60 rainy days throughout the year these results provide observable evidence of vast spatial heterogeneity in rainfall occurrence over india that demands spatially distributed analysis ideally at the finest resolution available for the rainfall dataset besides spatial variations rainfall occurrence over india also represents large intra annual variability characterized by the concentration of a large fraction of annual rainfall events to a few months of monsoon season the dominance of the summer monsoon season on annual rainfall over india is well documented in the existing literature gadgil and gadgil 2006 similar monsoon dominated seasonality can also be seen in the mean annual monthly distribution of rainy days as shown in fig 1d the average number of rainfall events in the summer monsoon months is substantially higher than the remaining months of the year for a large part of the country however the monthly distribution of rainy days further varies for different regions of the country fig 1d nw cne and wc zone receive most 60 80 of annual rainfall events during monsoon months among which the monthly count of rainy days for cne and wc region is remarkably similar throughout the year the nw zone is found to be the driest of all hmzs with the least number of rainfall events in almost all the months in the remaining zones i e ne hr and pr a considerable rainfall occurrence is observed during non monsoon months in addition to the dominant monsoon season the monsoon rainy days in the ne zone are highest of all hmzs where a considerable fraction of annual rainfall events 25 is also obtained during premonsoon season march may the hr zone covering the himalayan region in north india receives a fair count of rainfall events during winter and premonsoon months constituting a significant fraction 14 30 of the annual count in the pr zone the rainfall occurrence in postmonsoon season makes a large contribution 40 60 to the annual count even higher than monsoon season in some parts over tamil nadu state of south peninsular india the peninsular region also experiences reasonable rainfall events during premonsoon season particularly in april and may months overall these results reveal large seasonality in rainfall occurrence over india that varies among different regions of the country therefore various analyses in the present study are performed separately for four meteorological seasons experienced over the indian subcontinent in addition the regional scale significance of different results from gridwise analysis is also examined for six hmzs defined by imd 3 2 mean climatology of rainy days for different seasons fig 2 a d show the spatial distribution of the count of rainy days for four meteorological seasons over india the variation of seasonal rainy days is also examined among six hmzs of india as shown in fig 2e h evidently the number of rainfall events experienced in monsoon season is higher than all other seasons over the entire country the monsoon rainy days further exhibit large spatial variability with considerably higher 100 120 rainfall events over northeast india and western ghats and fewer 10 20 rainfall events over northwest india fig 2b which is fairly consistent with the familiar climatological patterns in rainfall magnitude over india pai et al 2015 sahany et al 2018 for the monsoon season the largest count of rainy days among all hmzs is experienced over the ne zone falling in the range 50 120 days fig 2f the number of monsoon rainfall events in hr zone varies over a wider range as indicated by an interquartile range of 30 80 days it is mainly because the parts of hr zone falling in northeast india experience 90 120 days of rainfall whereas the parts covering northern india receive 20 70 days of rainfall the cne and wc zone exhibit similar distribution of rainfall events ranging between 20 and 110 days with the interquartile range concentrated to 50 80 days the pr zone experience relatively fewer rainfall events 0 100 days than the other zones except for nw zone nw zone is driest among all hmzs of india during monsoon season where the count of rainy days lies between 0 and 80 days with an interquartile range of 20 50 days fig 2f apparently the spatial distribution of rainfall occurrence in monsoon season is fairly congruent to the spatial patterns in annual rainfall occurrence fig 1c reflecting the dominance of monsoon season on annual count for the premonsoon season the count of rainy days in ne and hr zone is higher than the other zones typically ranging between 0 and 80 days fig 2a e few traces of rainfall events 10 30 days in premonsoon season are also found over peninsular india and eastern parts of cne zone while the rest of the country seldom 0 5 days receives rainfall unlike other seasons the postmonsoon season brings substantial rainfall events 0 50 days over pr zone covering peninsular region of south india fig 2c g the northeast monsoon also known as retreating indian summer monsoon serves as the primary rainfall season for peninsular india constituting 40 60 of annual rainfall rajeevan et al 2012 sanap et al 2019 northeast monsoon is highly crucial for agricultural production in peninsular india as it coincides with the primary crop rabi season of the region nageswararao et al 2019 the other parts of the country on the other hand remain relatively dry during postmonsoon months receiving merely 5 10 days of rainfall the winter season is found to be the driest among all seasons in which majority of the country receives rainfall for 5 10 days except for hr zone fig 2d h the mean count of rainy days in hr zone during winter season is between 0 and 40 days that are mainly observed over the north himalayan region the eastward propagating synoptic weather systems called western disturbances are the primary source of winter precipitation over north india dimri and mohanty 2009 the western disturbances mid latitude westerlies interact with the heterogenous topography of the western himalayas resulting in considerable precipitation events over the region during winter months bookhagen and burbank 2010 dimri 2009 winter precipitation in the himalayan region is closely associated with the regional climate hydrology cryosphere and agriculture thus highly important for overall sustainability in the region dimri 2013a precipitation at sub freezing altitudes of the himalayas occurs as snow that controls the inter annual dynamics of glacial and snow mass balance kumar et al 2019 these glaciers and snow masses supply a considerable amount of freshwater to some large river networks of india in different seasons which explains the importance of winter precipitation to socio economic well being of the country yadav et al 2009 the seasonal climatology of rainy days is also examined with 1 gridded dataset by rajeevan et al 2006 for the same period fig s1 evidently the climatology of seasonal rainy days shows similar patterns as obtained from 0 25 gridded data over all the hmzs except for the hr zone in the monsoon season the interquartile range of rainy days for hr zone is wider and median value is lower in 0 25 dataset than the 1 dataset it indicates that 1 gridded dataset gives higher seasonal count of rainy days than 0 25 dataset over majority of the region on the other hand the interquartile range and the median value of rainy days in the premonsoon season is comparatively higher in 0 25 dataset the lack of rainfall stations over jammu kashmir region in both the datasets can be a primary cause of the observed inconsistency apart from these differences the seasonal count of rainy days obtained from both the datasets are highly consistent in all the zones for all the seasons broadly the comparison of rainy days across different seasons shows that considerable rainfall events in premonsoon season are experienced in ne and hr zone while monsoon season supplies significant rainfall events over the entire country in the postmonsoon and winter season rainfall events are mainly observed in pr and hr zone respectively these results reveal that wide areas of the country remain rainfall deprived for a large part of the year one of the large scale impacts of this seasonal scarcity in rainfall occurrence can be explained on agricultural practices and groundwater consumption especially after the green revolution the green revolution in india essentially aimed at an increase in agricultural production by enabling agricultural practices throughout the year however it required a reliable and consistent source of fresh water supply for crop growth which has been later served by a groundwater based irrigation system rodell et al 2009 therefore in regards to increased food demand and green revolution in india over the last half century the heterogeneity and scarcity in rainfall occurrence could be a primary driver of the mass shift from rainfed to groundwater fed agriculture particularly in semi arid and arid regions of india asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 further rainfed agriculture would reflect strong sensitivity to variability in rainfall occurrence as it significantly modulates the regional soil moisture at daily to weekly time scale therefore a robust understanding of space time variability in rainfall occurrence becomes crucial for adequate management of agricultural practices and sustainable water resources management in the country 3 3 natural variability of rainfall occurrence the natural variability of rainfall occurrence is examined by constructing long term time series of area averaged rainy days over different hmzs for the years 1901 2015 fig 3 the 7 year running mean of long term time series denotes the decadal component to identify the presence of interdecadal variability as evident in fig 3 the regionally averaged time series of rainy days for all the seasons exhibit large interannual variability in each zone besides significant interannual variability these time series also exhibit strong signals of decadal to multidecadal variability although the dominant mode of the observed decadal variability in rainfall occurrence is not consistent across different rainfall zones in the premonsoon season a clear signal of strong interdecadal 20 25 years variability in rainy days is evident over cne ne nw and hr zone fig 3a b c e the rainy days in cne ne and nw zone also show an insignificant decline over the last 114 years whereas an increase over the period 1951 2015 on the other hand a decline in wc zone and an increase in hr zone is evident in both the time periods the rainy days over pr zone represent a strong multidecadal variability 50 60 years with no significant trend in the long term or in the recent decades fig 3f the variability in premonsoon rainfall at different time scales and their associated climate drivers is a relatively lesser explored topic in the existing literature premonsoon rainfall over northwest himalayas and northern india is caused by east propagating synoptic scale systems called western disturbances wd dimri 2013b while thunderstorms and cyclonic systems emerging in the bay of bengal bob are the primary source of premonsoon rainfall over south peninsular india sinha et al 2019 the interannual variability in wd represents a strong response to el niño southern oscillations enso dimri 2013c 2013b yadav et al 2010 and deep convection anomalies over east indian ocean and maritime continent hoell et al 2013 the thunderstorm activities in bob and their propagation are largely influenced by the sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the north tropical indian ocean and western indian ocean yadav 2013 considering these underlying forcing to premonsoon rainfall the dominant modes of variability in the equatorial pacific and indian ocean i e enso and indian ocean dipole iod respectively can be associated with the interannual variability in premonsoon rainfall although a thorough investigation is necessary to ascertain their influence and mutual interaction a correlation based analysis also suggested significant positive correlations between atlantic multidecadal oscillations amo and premonsoon rainfall over peninsular and northeast india and significant negative correlation over northwest india kumar and naidu 2020 amo is a multidecadal 50 70 years mode of variability in north atlantic ocean delworth and mann 2000 that can be associated with the prominent multidecadal variability observed for pr zone in the present results the rainfall occurrence in monsoon season represents large interannual 5 10 years variability over all the zones fig 3g i 7 year running mean series further reveals the presence of multidecadal variability with varying dominant modes in different zones nw wc and pr zone exhibit 10 20 years mode of decadal variability whereas ne and hr zone show a low frequency decadal variability with an average cycle of 30 40 years indian summer monsoon ism is the main source of monsoon rainfall over south asia during boreal summers jjas ism exhibits pronounced variability on intraseasonal interannual and decadal time scales goswami 2006 goswami and mohan 2001 krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 enso serves as the dominant forcing for interannual variability in ism through the interaction between equatorial walker circulations and regional meridional hadley circulations webster and yang 1992 enso exhibits strong out of phase relationship with ism manifested as supressed monsoon circulation rainfall deficit during warm or el niño phase and an enhanced circulation above normal rainfall during cold or la niña phase pant and parthasarathy 1981 sikka 1980 it induces changes to the indo western pacific circulations that directly influence the ism whereas indirectly it influences the ism rainfall by modulating the north indian ocean sst kawamura et al 2001 wu and kirtman 2003 and atmospheric moisture content over the tropical indian ocean ashok et al 2004 wu and kirtman 2003 iod is another prominent forcing that alters the enso ism relationship at interannual scale ashok et al 2004 2001 the positive phase of iod characterized with enhanced supressed convention over western eastern equatorial indian ocean is found favourable for monsoon circulations over the indian subcontinent both observational and model analysis provide evidences for an inverse iod impact on enso ism relationship where the presence of positive dipole anomalous warm western indian ocean is accompanied with a suppressed influence of el niño on monsoon rainfall ashok et al 2001 in addition to the aforementioned external forcing the interannual variability of summer monsoon rainfall is partially forced by internal forcing that persist as intraseasonal oscillations in the monsoon circulations the intraseasonal variability in summer monsoon is typically associated with north south fluctuations in the intertropical convergence zone itcz and manifest in the form of spells of dry and wet conditions widely referred to as active and break spells gadgil and joseph 2003 sikka and gadgil 1980 several factors including synoptic scale systems e g low pressure systems and madden julian oscillations mjo driven poleward propagating convection anomalies in the equatorial indian ocean contribute to the intraseasonal variability in monsoon rainfall gadgil and asha 1992 joseph et al 2009 krishnamurthy and shukla 2007 krishnamurti and ardanuy 1980 the circulation patterns of intraseasonal oscillations closely resembles with the mean monsoon circulation where a positive active phase interaction results in enhanced seasonal rainfall and a negative break phase interaction causes reduced rainfall it should be noted here that past studies on climatic drivers of variability in monsoon rainfall have mainly considered all india monsoon rainfall or the monsoon core region covering central east central and southeast india thus the relative influence of different identified modes of climate variability on monsoon rainfall may vary for different parts of the indian subcontinent it is also reflected in the present results as the modes of decadal variability are not consistent across different zones also regional factors such as topography dominate the rainfall patterns over certain regions including northwest himalayas northeast india and along the western ghats unlike rest of the country the monsoon rainfall over northeast india in particular has shown limited response to the large scale climate systems enso and iod a recent study choudhury et al 2019 suggested a stronger influence of the decadal mode in north pacific ocean i e pacific decadal oscillations pdo on the variability of monsoon rainfall over northeast india and attributed the recent decline in rainfall over the region to the phase shift in decadal mode of pdo ism rainfall also exhibits prominent decadal variability that are found to be associated with amo and pdo at distinct modes of variability past studies suggest a strong positive linkage between monsoon rainfall and amo while a negative linkage with pdo these decadal modes of variability can be directly associated with monsoon rainfall or indirectly modulates the relationship between interannual e g enso and iod and intraseasonal e g mjo modes of variability and monsoon rainfall depending on the relative phase of the decadal mode the influence of high frequency modes of variability on monsoon rainfall may enhance or dampen krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 pdo shows an out of phase linkage with the summer monsoon rainfall i e positive negative phase of pdo is associated with a deficit increase in monsoon rainfall over the indian subcontinent its direct influence on monsoon circulations is hypothesised through a seasonal footprint mechanism that affect equatorial trade winds indirectly pdo alters the enso monsoon relation where an in phase out of phase interaction between enso and pdo causes enhanced suppressed influence of enso on monsoon circulations the positive association between amo and ism rainfall is because of amo driven shifts in itcz causing increased moisture convergence in the monsoon trough region the influence of amo on ism is also explained through tropospheric temperature anomalies over eurasia although it stands in debate in the literature krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 li et al 2008 lu et al 2006 the decadal variability observed in the present results indicates a possible linkage between monsoon rainfall occurrence and pdo on decadal time scale besides the natural variability rainy days over cne ne and wc zone experienced a statistically significant decline in the long term that further intensified during 1951 2015 the monsoon rainy days in hr zone shows a significant increase in both the time periods while no observable trends can be seen for nw and pr zone the 7 year running mean of rainy days for postmonsoon season reveals the presence of strong interdecadal variability in all the zones with a mean cycle of 15 20 years fig 3m r along with the interdecadal variability rainfall occurrence in postmonsoon season experienced a steep decline in the recent decades 1951 2015 while no significant change can be observed in the long term 1901 2015 over all the zones except for hr zone rainfall occurrence in the hr zone show significant increase in the long term whereas significant decline over the last six decades the interannual variability in postmonsoon or northeast monsoon nem rainfall is also driven by enso and iod however unlike ism both enso and iod exhibit a positive linkage with postmonsoon rainfall as positive phase of enso iod and equinoo atmospheric component of iod favours above normal rainfall kripalani and kumar 2004 sreekala et al 2012 zubair and ropelewski 2006 in addition intraseasonal oscillations in postmonsoon rainfall modulate the influence of enso and iod at interannual time scale past studies suggest a close relationship between intraseasonal oscillations in postmonsoon rainfall and various phases of mjo the occurrence of phase 2 3 and 4 of mjo has an overall enhancing influence on the positive impact of el niño and positive iod on nem rainfall and it results in an increase in number of rainfall events and mean rainfall conversely phase 5 6 7 8 and 1 of mjo has a suppressing influence on postmonsoon rainfall during el niño and positive iod years sreekala et al 2018 few earlier studies have suggested a strengthening of nem enso relationship after 1980 kumar et al 2007 zubair and ropelewski 2006 however a recent study elaborated that the nem enso relationship represents significant decadal fluctuations rajeevan et al 2012 the decades of 1940 1950 and 1980 1990 were perhaps the phases of stronger relationship along with intermittent phases of weaker association including the recent decade 2001 2010 of sharp weakening the driving climatic modes for these decadal variations are still unknown although they may possibly be associated with the decadal scale mode of variability in north pacific and north atlantic such as pdo and amo the strong signal of decadal scale variability in postmonsoon rainfall occurrence observed in the present results also indicates a possible linkage with these decadal scale modes the rainfall occurrence in winter season exhibits a significant decline in the long term over cne ne wc and pr zone and significant increase over hr zone fig 3s x although the decline has weakened in the recent decades the 7 year running mean reveal the presence of interdecadal variability along with significant signals of interannual variability over all the zones note that the rainfall occurrence over hr zone shows significant increase in the long term for all the seasons with an abrupt increase after 1960 winter precipitation over the indian subcontinent is mainly received over northwest himalayas and parts of northwest india the northwest himalayas share the climate system of southwest asia that receive major fraction 70 80 of precipitation during winter of southwest asia november april from wds guided by upper tropospheric westerlies barlow et al 2016 dimri et al 2015 the wds cause sparse but heavy precipitation events as less than ten of these events constitute 50 of annual precipitation barlow et al 2005 bookhagen and burbank 2010 cannon et al 2017 it should be noted that winter season of southwest asia overlaps with postmonsoon winter and premonsoon season in the indian subcontinent studies suggest that the dynamics of wd is influenced by large scale climate systems and synoptic scale phenomena that subsequently control the variability in the precipitation over northwest himalayas at different temporal scales enso are found to have significant control over the interannual variability of winter precipitation in the region through strong in phase association with the wds dimri 2013c 2013b hoell et al 2015 yadav et al 2010 the warm phase of enso is observed to be associated with intensified wds through rossby wave like response in the upper level circulations causing above normal storm events in the western himalayas dimri 2013c hoell et al 2013 yadav et al 2010 contrary to the enso ism relationship severe droughts over southwest asia in the recent years were found associated with la niña conditions hoell et al 2014 besides direct influence through rossby wave like anomalies abid et al 2016 dimri et al 2015 enso also found to exert an indirect influence on winter precipitation through atmospheric diabatic heating anomalies over tropical indian ocean which modulates the enso precipitation relationship at intraseasonal time scale abid et al 2020 the diabatic heating anomalies in the tropical indian ocean also generate rossby wave like patterns that results in enhanced winter precipitation over southwest asia an in phase interaction between the direct and indirect influences of enso is reflected as a stronger positive relationship between enso and southwest asia precipitation whereas an out of phase interaction exhibit weaker relationship abid et al 2020 further the intraseasonal influence of mjo varies for extreme precipitation events in the region as mjo phases that favour enhancement of wds can simultaneously supress the available moisture cannon et al 2017 it opposes the favourable conditions for extreme precipitation thus subsides the influence of enhanced dynamic forcing of wds apparently the dynamics and thermodynamic response to the interplay between interannual enso and intraseasonal mjo phases is not clearly understood and needs further exploration the deep indian ocean convection over east indian ocean and maritime continent also show close association with winter precipitation over northwest himalayas exhibiting strong negative relationship at seasonal to interannual scale while weaker negative linkage at subseasonal scale hoell et al 2013 the circulation anomalies corresponding to tropical indian ocean convection closely resembles mjo and enso like patterns at intraseasonal and seasonal to interannual scale respectively previous works suggest an out of phase response of winter precipitation over southwest asia to mjo where negative mjo were associated with an increase in average as well as extreme daily precipitation in the region barlow et al 2005 hoell et al 2013 in addition pdo show a considerable influence on decadal variability of winter precipitation over southwest asia where cold phase of pdo is associated with precipitation reduction hoell et al 2015 the precipitation variability in the region is also forced by other modes of climate variability including north atlantic oscillations nao syed et al 2006 and amo sheffield and wood 2008 although the relative influence of these climate systems is not well defined in the existing literature in summary the rainfall occurrence in each season represents prominent variability at interannual and decadal time scale previous works show that interannual variability in rainfall over the indian subcontinent is largely modulated by enso and iod though the nature of their relationship with rainfall varies for different seasons the mjo driven intraseasonal variability in rainfall for each season also exhibit a prominent influence on the interannual variability the decadal variability in seasonal rainfall is mainly associated with the prominent decadal modes of climate variability such as pdo and amo the nature of influence of these decadal modes also varies for different seasons these decadal modes particularly pdo are also suggested to be responsible for the decadal fluctuations in enso rainfall relationship in addition to prominent variability at interannual to decadal time scale zonal average time series of rainy days also represent significant long term trends the long term trends show a considerable shift in rainfall occurrence after 1950 as the trends have either intensified or reversed in the latter half of 20th century it is also interesting to see that the long term as well as recent trends in rainfall occurrence have emerged beyond the reminiscence of its inherent natural variability it indicates that the observed trends in rainfall occurrence may be potentially associated with the climate warming or other anthropogenic factors nonetheless the presence of strong natural variability suggests better predictability of rainfall occurrence at interannual or decadal scale that can be used for long term planning in different sectors identification of the dominant climate systems associated with rainfall occurrence in a region would also facilitate its improved characterization in climate and weather forecast models 3 4 trends of rainy days in different seasons considering large spatial variations and seasonality temporal trends are estimated in the seasonal count of rainy days at individual grids over the entire country for the period 1951 2015 the field significance of trends observed at individual grid points is examined for different hmzs at 5 significance level fig 4 a d show gridwise distribution of trends in count of rainy days for four meteorological seasons in india the areal coverage of trends is also represented as the percent of grids in each hmz with significant negative red and positive blue trend through bar plots fig 4e h field significant trends are denoted by a double asterisk on the top of respective bars in the premonsoon season rainy days exhibit a significant increase over majority of northwest india and some parts of eastern jammu kashmir central northeast and peninsular region fig 4a the increasing trends of premonsoon rainy days are field significant for nw and hr zone covering 21 42 and 22 03 of grids in respective regions fig 4e a significant decline in premonsoon rainfall occurrence is observed over large parts of wc zone western coastal regions of peninsular india and parts of north himalayas covering western jammu kashmir and himachal pradesh the decline in wc zone is field significant which indicates the drying tendency of the region that already remains relatively dry in the premonsoon season in addition western parts of north himalayas in hr zone that receive considerable rainfall events in premonsoon season also exhibit a significant decline fig 4a e the observed patterns are in uniformity with the trends reported in premonsoon rainfall by past studies that suggested a decline over central and south india and increase over northwest india guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 pal and al tabbaa 2009 the summer monsoon rainfall over the indian subcontinent dominates the total annual rainfall in terms of both frequency and magnitude the variability and long term changes in the rainfall occurrence of monsoon season would have significant implications on agricultural production food security and overall socio economic well being of the country fishman 2016 ghosh et al 2009 sahany et al 2018 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the trend test results reveal a significant decline in monsoon rainy days over majority of the country including indo gangetic plains central india northeast india and parts of north himalayas during 1951 2015 cne 41 58 ne 37 5 and wc 38 89 zone in particular exhibit widespread decline in rainy days where trends are also field significant at regional scale fig 4b f interestingly the significant decline in rainy days is more widespread than the decline in rainfall magnitude during monsoon season suggested in past studies mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 these results are alarming because cne and wc zone encompasses major crop growing regions of the country and monsoon season overlaps with a major crop season kharif june to october in india a prolonged decline in monsoon rainfall occurrence may lead to persistent soil moisture deficit that can adversely impact the crop production in rainfed agriculture and can elevate groundwater pumping in groundwater irrigated agriculture accordingly the observed widespread decline in monsoon rainy days can be a prominent contributing factor to the exponential increase witnessed in groundwater pumping over the past few decades in india mishra et al 2018 shah 2009 further subseasonal variability in rainfall occurrence modulates short term weekly to monthly soil moisture storage while a long term decline in rainfall events can cause prolonged soil moisture deficit or soil moisture drought in the region apparently the lately observed soil moisture drought over the indo gangetic plains in india mishra et al 2019 2016 may be partially attributable to the widespread decline in monsoon rainfall occurrence these possible linkages of rainfall occurrence with soil moisture and groundwater variability show that intrinsic knowledge of space time changes in rainfall occurrence can help characterize several crucial water resources based issues and plan sustainable agriculture practices in the country contrary to most parts of the country monsoon rainfall events exhibit a significant increase over north himalayan region covering majority of jammu kashmir field significant for hr zone 34 37 at regional scale fig 4b f past study on rainy days of monsoon season reported fairly similar trend patterns reflecting a decline over central and north central india expect for few regions including haryana arunachal pradesh west rajasthan coastal karnataka and tamil nadu das et al 2014 the trends report at riven basin scale differs from present results for brahmaputra krishna and cauvery river basin kumar and jain 2011 the discrepancy in trend patterns from different studies can be due to the difference in few basic considerations i e data resolution spatial scale of analysis and time period of data analysis in the postmonsoon season a significant decline in rainy days is observed over a large part 39 1 of ne zone and parts of cne 13 and hr 25 47 zone covering western uttar pradesh uttarakhand himachal pradesh and western jammu kashmir fig 4c g the decreasing trends are field significant for ne and hr zone at 5 significance level fig 4g wide areas in nw zone also depict a decrease in rainy days but not statistically significant interestingly the peninsular india that receives considerable rainfall events during postmonsoon season does not represent any significant trend in rainfall occurrence fig 4c g a dipole of trends is also observed over northwest himalayas where trends along the west and southern edges are negative while northward region exhibit an increase in rainfall events the precipitation regime over northwest himalayas is primarily driven by wds although synoptic scale systems developing in bob dimri 2006 and moisture flux from arabian sea dimri 2013a also contribute to the seasonal precipitation by occasionally interacting with southern edge of north himalayas hunt et al 2018 studies have reported an intensification of wds in response to an increase in frequency of warm enso phases in the recent years resulting in an increase in precipitation events over northwest himalayas thus the decline observed along the southern face of northwest himalayas can be associated with long term change in the synoptic scale systems and their driving mechanisms contrary to the present results nageswararao et al 2019 observed an increase in wet 0 mm day days over eastern peninsular region and a significant reduction over western peninsular india during 1959 2016 in comparison to 1901 1958 in the recent decades 1970 2008 however majority of south peninsular india shows an increase in rainy days naidu et al 2012 note that the available works on postmonsoon rainfall occurrence have only focused on peninsular india that created a knowledge gap for rest of the country in the present results we found significant decline in postmonsoon rainfall events over large parts of north and northwest india the rainy days in winter season represent significant positive trend over a considerable area 18 46 in the peninsular region covering parts of karnataka and andhra pradesh fig 4d h a significant increase in winter rainfall events is also observed over eastern parts of jammu kashmir 20 47 in hr zone and northern parts of nw zone the increase observed in pr and hr zone are obtained to be field significant at the regional scale on the contrary some parts of tamil nadu state in pr zone himachal pradesh and uttarakhand in hr zone and eastern uttar pradesh in cne show significant decline in winter rainy days fig 4d h the remaining parts of the country do not show significant trend in rainy days during winter season fairly similar decreasing patterns in himachal pradesh uttarakhand and eastern uttara pradesh during 1901 2013 are also reported by nageswararao et al 2016 the study results contradict with the present work for parts of northwest india covering rajasthan punjab haryana western uttar pradesh and jammu kashmir state the present results reveal that the previously unexplored parts of the country particularly for non monsoon seasons have experienced a significant change in rainfall occurrence over the last six decades several rainfall scare regions in non monsoon seasons exhibit a significant decline in rainfall occurrence over 1951 2015 the decline over these regions would have a greater negative impact on agriculture as a significant length of annual cropping period coincides with non monsoon months the uncertainties associated with observational datasets characterized by varying rainfall stations data gaps post processing methods etc is a major concern in decision making process as it often leads to dry bias in monsoonal precipitation and incorrect representation of trends singh et al 2019 to ascertain the homogeneity of trend patterns across different observational dataset we also performed the analysis on 1 gridded dataset developed with fixed number of stations by rajeevan et al 2006 for the same period as shown in fig s2 results show that the trend patterns from both the datasets are fairly consistent over almost entire country except for jammu kashmir region north himalayas over northeast parts of jammu kashmir the rainy days from 0 25 dataset exhibit significant increase while rainy days from 1 dataset represent a significant decline for all the season in addition postmonsoon rainfall occurrence in nw zone shows a decrease from 0 25 dataset whereas an increase from 1 dataset although the trends are not statistically significant in both the cases the observed inconsistency in trends over north himalayas is attributable to the scarcity of rain gauge stations in the region the documentation of the datasets reveals that 0 25 dataset pai et al 2014 considered a fair number of stations over southwest parts of jammu kashmir that are apparently absent in 1 dataset rajeevan et al 2006 whereas there are no rainfall stations available over northeast parts of jammu kashmir in both the datasets the adequacy of 0 25 dataset also is reflected in the trend results as positive trends observed over northwest himalayas are consistent with the patterns suggested in several past studies kamil et al 2019 krishnan et al 2019 yadav et al 2010 therefore the results for northwest himalayas from 0 25 dataset are acceptable more so for the southwest region of jammu kashmir and along the foothills of north himalayas however care should be taken while adopting the results reported for north himalayas particularly over northeast parts of the region the trend patterns in rest of the country are fairly consistent in both datasets which indicates that varying stations have no apparent implication over the test results in addition 0 25 dataset have used considerably larger number of stations than 1 dataset rajeevan et al 2006 thus it is more appropriate dataset for different analyses on rainfall 3 5 trends in frequency of rainfall events from different intensity classes the seasonal count of rainy days in previous section encompasses the entire range of rainfall events with the intensity above and equal to 1 mm day 1 the rainy days of different intensity classes may have varying influence on different hydrologic components for example light rains modulate the surface soil moisture content and the surface runoff response whereas moderate and heavy rainfall events impact the regional water resources surface and groundwater reserves and agricultural production the extreme rainfall events on the other hand are primarily associated with flooding that causes huge social economic losses loss of human lives and extensive damage to crops every year in different parts of the world including india roxy et al 2017 hence it will be of paramount importance to know whether the trends observed in seasonal count of rainy days covers the entire range of rainfall intensities or confined to a given class here long term trends are also examined in rainfall events of different rainfall intensity classes the estimated threshold of rainfall intensity corresponding to selected percentiles 25th 50th 75th 95th and 99th for different seasons is shown in fig s3 also the fraction of total seasonal rainy days in different rainfall classes is presented in fig s4 fig 5 shows the trend in rainy days of six rainfall intensity classes for different seasons in india during 1951 2015 fig 6 shows the percent of grids with significant positive blue and negative red trends in rainy days for different rainfall classes in the premonsoon season the significant positive trends in nw zone are mainly observed in light moderate moderate heavy and heavy rainfall events covering 10 14 of the zone in each class fig 5a e i m the observed trends in either class are not field significant at regional scale fig 6a e i m the increasing trends in hr zone are evident in moderate moderate heavy heavy and very heavy rainfall events fig 5e i m q u among these classes trends in moderate heavy 24 heavy 26 and very heavy 24 rainy days are field significant fig 6e i m q u contrarily the occurrence of moderate moderate heavy and heavy rainfall events in premonsoon season has significantly declined over 14 16 and 12 grids in wc zone respectively it has collectively resulted in field significant decline in premonsoon rainy days over wc zone note that the threshold rainfall intensity for very heavy and extremely heavy events for premonsoon season lies in the range 0 75 mm day 1 and 0 150 mm day 1 respectively fig s3 consecutive events of such intensity hold the potential to cause large scale flooding or waterlogging in a region further the premonsoon season overlaps with the harvesting period of rabi october to april crops and sowing preparation period of kharif crops multiple consecutive extreme rainfall events can break wreaking havoc on standing crops in rabi season leading to a deficit in overall crop production and huge economic loss to the farmers as well as the country sinha et al 2019 such events may also adversely affect the nurseries of paddy crops prepared for the kharif season thus it is important to understand the long term tendency of extreme rainfall events in premonsoon season particularly in the context of its possible agricultural impact in the results the statistically significant trends in extreme very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall events in premonsoon season exhibit dispersed patterns over majority of the country excluding hilly regions fig 5q u a significant positive trend in very heavy and extremely heavy events can be seen dispersed over southern parts of cne and wc zone including orrisa telangana and northern karnataka state and northern parts of nw zone covering northern rajasthan an increase in extreme rainfall events is also observed at scattered grid points over the peninsular region the extremely heavy rainfall events are also found to be significantly increased over southern coastal parts of the kutch region in gujarat state fig 5u this rise in extreme events indicates an increased susceptibility of frequent extreme rainfall events in these regions during premonsoon season it also highlights the increasing risk of crop damage failure due to extreme rainfall resulting in severe crop production deficit particularly in agriculture dominant regions including south central southeastern and northwest parts of the country on the contrary a few locations in central wc and western cne zone depict significant reduction in extreme rainfall events very heavy and extremely heavy a significant decline in very heavy rainfall events is also observed at scattered grid points along western coastline of south india during the premonsoon months especially in april and may the northeast region of india experiences considerable thunderstorm activities that cause heavy rainfall events before the onset of monsoon goswami et al 2010 mahanta et al 2013 trends of extreme rainfall events in this region is of particular importance as these events are directly associated with flash floods that cause serious damage to crops livestock property and human lives mahanta et al 2013 in the study we found significant decline in very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall events over nagaland and eastern parts of assam state whereas significant increase over meghalaya and manipur state in the ne zone fig 5q u these results highlight a possible reduction increase in susceptibility of the region with a negative positive trend to devastating floods and associated damage the trend analysis results for monsoon season show a vast coverage of significant decline in total seasonal count of rainy days analysis of different rainfall intensity classes reveals that the widespread decline in monsoon rainy days is mainly experienced in light to heavy rainfall events 95th percentile with field significant trends over cne ne and wc zone in all four rainfall classes fig 5b f j n fig 6b f j n these events correspond to approximately 5 20 mm day 1 in light rainfall class to as high as 100 200 mm day 1 in heavy rainfall class fig s3 the rainfall events of such magnitude have substantial influence over key hydrologic parameters such as soil moisture evapotranspiration relative humidity and surface and groundwater reserves of a region a long term decline in moderate to heavy rainfall events at a large scale can cause a deficit in soil moisture and groundwater reserves at river basin to country scale meanwhile the results for hr zone differ from the other regions as significant increase in monsoon rainy days over eastern jammu kashmir is found confined to moderate heavy heavy and very heavy rainfall events with field significant trends in all three classes fig 5j n r though the fraction distribution of seasonal rainy days among different rainfall classes for this region is comparable to the rest of the country fig s4 the increase in moderate heavy to very heavy rainfall events is considerably large resulting in significant increasing trend in the overall count for the season the trends in extreme rainfall events of monsoon season are of particular importance for planners and policymakers in agriculture and flood management extreme rainfall events in monsoon season typically range between 100 and 200 mm day 1 and are directly associated with catastrophic floods in several parts of the country almost every year fig s3 following the threshold adopted in a large number of past studies and to enable comparison with their results we have selected 95th and 99th percentiles of long term term daily rainfall as thresholds for extreme rainfall in the results we found significant rise in the number of extremely heavy above 99th percentile rainfall events over central east india covering southern parts of orrisa and chhattisgarh state western regions of southern coastline in gujarat state kutch region northern parts of uttarakhand and eastern parts of jammu kashmir state in north india fig 5v staggered increasing patterns in extremely heavy events are also observed in wc zone and southern parts of rajasthan state in the nw zone fig 5v on the contrary extreme rainfall events have significantly declined over parts of western uttar pradesh and eastern arunachal pradesh in northeast india these regions also exhibit significant decline in very heavy rainfall events of monsoon season fig 5r a reduction in extremely heavy and heavy rainfall events in western uttar pradesh implies reduced risk of flooding and water logging particularly in urban landscapes of the region and reduced risk of damage to kharif crops a significant increase in very heavy rainy days is observed over eastern jammu kashmir and northern parts of uttarakhand fig 5r rainfall events in very heavy class lie between 50 and 100 mm day 1 that can damage crops or cause flooding if multiple such events occur in succession consistent with our results a significant decline in moderate to heavy rainfall events 95th percentile over central and north central india is reported in several past works dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2006 however majority of these studies dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 have considered spatially averaged rainfall over large spatial domains rectangular box or homogeneous rainfall zones and failed to capture the regional variations in trend patterns as observed in the present results the trends of extreme rainfall events in the present results are highly inconsistent with the patterns reported in past works our results show a considerable variation in spatial patterns of trends within the zones that are considered homogeneous in few previous studies dash et al 2009 moreover the trend patterns in early studies with spatially distributed analysis are also found incoherent with the present results ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 the difference in study period up to early 2000s and dataset 1 resolution can be the possible cause of discrepancy in trend from these studies the discrepancy in results also indicates that the trend patterns of extreme rainfall in monsoon season have undergone a significant change over the recent two decades in a recent study vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 employing 0 25 resolution gridded rainfall record until 2015 the spatial distribution of trend in frequency of extreme rainfall fairly agrees with the present results over several regions except for central northeast and eastern regions of the country the study suggests a decline over central northeast and an increase over eastern region while no significant trend is evident over these regions in the present work the deviation in the results is possibly because the study defined extreme rainfall events as exceedances of 90th percentile of long term daily rainfall the extreme rainfall events over northeast india during monsoon season are largely associated with flash floods and large scale flooding in the region thus pose a major threat to agriculture and human lives in the premonsoon months april and may extreme events occur as isolated thunderstorms whereas in monsoon season they occur in conjunction with the monsoon synoptic events goswami et al 2010 mahanta et al 2013 further extreme rainfall events experienced in the monsoon season are much higher than the premonsoon season goswami et al 2010 thus the understanding of their behaviour in monsoon season is more crucial here we found a significant decline in extreme rainfall events over eastern parts of north india whereas a few locations in southern parts represent an increase in extreme events fig 5r v these results are in uniformity with the trends reported in previous studies goswami et al 2010 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 even though different thresholds 90th 99th percentile or 150 mm day 1 were selected for defining the extremes the postmonsoon or northeast monsoon season serves as the primary rainfall season for south peninsular india constituting about 40 60 of total annual rainfall rajeevan et al 2012 a majority of rainfall in the season is contributed by moderate 25 50th percentile and moderate heavy 50 75th percentile rainfall events the rainfall in postmonsoon season influences both kharif and rabi crops as initial october november months of the season overlap with the harvesting period of kharif crops whereas sowing preparation of rabi crops begins in the later november december months of the season over large parts of the country in addition postmonsoon rainfall feeds the primary crop season rabi crops of the peninsular region thus holds considerable importance to its socio economic equilibrium results show that the significant decrease in the frequency of rainfall events over ne zone is confined to moderate and moderate heavy classes whereas the decline over northeast region of hr zone is evident in heavy rainfall events fig 5c g k o s the trends are found field significant in ne zone for both rainfall classes fig 6c g k o s the heavy and very heavy events represent significant decline over uttarakhand state in hr zone and northwest parts of uttar pradesh among which the decline in heavy rainfall events is field significant for hr zone fig 5o s fig 6o s the extremely heavy events of postmonsoon season with catastrophic potential experienced a significant decline over central and northern parts of nw zone and western parts of uttar pradesh fig 5w in addition southern parts of the peninsular region covering kerala state have experienced a significant increase in extremely heavy rainfall events overall most of the country except for northeast india and few areas in north india exhibit widely staggered trend patterns in light moderate and moderate heavy rainfall events with no definitive structure owing to its importance for the region the available studies nageswararao et al 2019 naidu et al 2012 had only considered south peninsular india pr zone to examine rainfall occurrence in the postmonsoon season naidu et al 2012 analyzed the difference in mean frequency of rainfall events between pre global warming 1951 1969 and the global warming 1970 2008 period from different rainfall classes the study suggested an increase in the frequency of 0 20 mm 60 100 mm and 100 mm rainy days whereas a decrease in 20 60 mm rainy days in the later period in different parts of peninsular region though no evidence of such change can be traced in the present work where apart from extremely heavy events no considerable trends are obtained in any other rainfall class nageswararao et al 2019 reported significant positive trend in extremely heavy 244 5 mm rainy days aggregated over pr zone and light 0 1 7 5 mm rainy days over southern interiors of karnataka state the trends are marginally similar to the patterns observed in the present study as the increase in extremely heavy events is only evident over some parts of peninsular india instead of the entire region also the increasing trends of light rainfall events are highly staggered to draw any affirmative conclusions unlike other seasons winter season shows few interesting results for trends in rainy days of different intensity classes while the total count of rainy days in winter season represents negligible coverage of negative trend in all the hmzs rainy days in light to heavy rainfall classes are found to exhibit significant decline over considerable fraction of cne ne and hr zone fig 5d h l p t fig 6d h l p t the decline for all these classes is most evident over eastern uttar pradesh and bihar in cne uttarakhand himachal pradesh and western regions of jammu and kashmir in hr zone and eastern parts of ne zone fig 5d h l p t moreover the declining trends in ne and hr zone are field significant for light to heavy rainfall events fig 6d h l p t with further exploration we found that the majority of grid points exhibiting a significant decrease in one rainfall class in an hmz are representing either the same but insignificant or opposite trend in other classes for example out of all grids with significant negative trends in light rainy days in hr zone only 30 45 represents a significant decline in other moderate to extremely heavy rainfall classes also 40 45 of these grid points show significant increase in heavy and very heavy class collectively these contrasting patterns get neutralized resulting in statistically insignificant trend in total count of rainy days for the season over most of the grid locations in hr zone similar behavior is also observed in other zones which explains the cause of the discrepancy in trend results for the collective count and count in different classes on the other hand the field significant increase observed in winter rainy days over hr zone is limited to heavy and very heavy rainfall classes fig 5p t fig 6p t also the increasing trends of winter rainy days in peninsular region pr zone are mainly evident in extremely heavy rainfall events fig 5x nageswararao et al 2016 examined the frequency of winter rainfall events only over northwest india in four rainfall classes light 1 5 mm moderate 5 10 mm heavy 10 15 mm and very heavy 15 mm at subdivisional scale and the region as a whole the study suggests a rise in frequency of all types of rainfall events over jammu kashmir region statistically significant for heavy and very heavy events in our results however the increase is evident over eastern parts of jammu kashmir for heavy and very heavy rainfall events whereas rainfall events in other classes show significant decline over western parts of the region the trend patterns reported in the remaining subdivisions of northwest india are also inconsistent with the present results even with the use of same dataset and similar study period the effect of aggregating rainfall over a large region on trend estimates is evident in the study result these results suggest that the trends observed in seasonal count of rainy days are not present in the entire range of rainfall events but are rather confined to specific class es of rainfall intensity on a broader perspective it can be stated that for premonsoon monsoon and postmonsoon season the significant trends rise or decline in rainy days are mainly evident in light to heavy rainfall events in all the hmzs except for hr zone in the hr zone the significant trends are found confined in moderate to very heavy rainfall events the results are remarkably different for winter season in which rainy days in different rainfall classes exhibit field significant negative trend over large parts of the country while no significant trend is evident in the total count for the season the positive trends in winter rainy days however are confined to high intensity classes in which trends in hr zone are observed in heavy and very heavy class and trends in pr zone are mainly evident in the extremely heavy class it should also be noted here that the rainfall occurrence over eastern parts of jammu and kashmir exhibits significant increase in all the seasons whereas the same region exhibits significant decline in rainfall occurrence when analysed with 1 dataset the lack of rainfall stations in the region can be a primary cause of the observed discrepancy in trend results multiple past works have reported an increase in precipitation events over northwest himalayas in the recent decades which supports the adequacy of trend patterns obtained from 0 25 dataset pai et al 2014 3 6 time propagation of trends in rainy days a long term analysis performed by considering the entire study period does not capture the temporal variation in trends over the years the above analyses represent the most recent coverage of trends in the count of rainy days the time propagation of fractional area exhibiting significant trend in each hmz is examined to check whether the current state persisted in the preceding years the analysis is performed by computing trends for an expanding time window starting from 1951 to 1980 30 years and adding a year in each succession till the year 2015 the fractional area as a percent of grids with significant trend negative or positive in rainy days is obtained in each succession for all hmzs in different seasons fig 7 shows an 11 year running mean of the fractional area with significant negative red and positive blue trend in each hmz from 1981 to 2015 in the premonsoon season the spatial extent of both positive and negative trends remained consistent in all the zones except for hr zone with slight variations over the years fig 7a e i m q u the hr zone shows large variations where the fractional area with positive trend increased from about 30 in 1981 to 50 in 1990 followed by a constant decline from 2000 until the latest year reaching about 25 fig 7q the extent of negative trend on the other hand shows a rapid increase post 2000 reaching about 18 in 2015 for monsoon season the extent of negative trend in nw zone increased from about 8 in 1981 to 22 in 2004 which later reduced to 10 in 2015 fig 7b negative trends in cne zone show a consistent spread over the entire period with 10 in 1981 to about 30 in 2015 fig 7f both nw and cne zones show marginal variation in area exhibiting an increase in rainy days during monsoon season fig 7b f in the ne zone the spatial coverage of significant trends changed rapidly post 2000 in which the extent of negative trends has increased whereas the extent of positive trends has reduced fig 7j a considerable increase in fractional area with negative trend in monsoon rainy days is also observed in wc zone from about 15 in 1981 to 35 in 2015 fig 7n with minor changes over the years the coverage of both negative and positive trend in hr zone remained more or less consistent during monsoon season fig 7r a considerable variation in the extent of significant trend in the postmonsoon season can be seen in ne and hr zone fig 7k s both the zones experienced a significant rise in area representing negative trend post 1990 in contrast area exhibiting positive trend has considerably reduced in hr zone post 1990 whereas no notable change can be seen in the ne zone the remaining zones show only a marginal variation during postmonsoon season in the winter season fractional coverage of positive trend has considerably reduced in hr zone from about 45 in 25 during 1981 2015 fig 7t conversely the coverage of increase in rainy days has increased in pr zone from 5 to about 20 fig 7x it is worthy to note that the rainfall occurrence over a large part of the country experienced a distinct transition after 2000 especially in the monsoon season in these regions either there is an increase in spatial coverage of negative trends or decrease in coverage of positive trends in rainy days in other words a deficit in rainy days has consistently spread over vast areas post 2000 more prominently in the monsoon season also the rapid increase in spatial coverage of decline in monsoon rainy days is mainly evident in the cne zone the region that has witnessed a severe soil moisture drought in recent years mishra 2020 mishra et al 2016 a progressive decline in monsoon rainfall events over the last one and half decades may have caused a deficit in soil moisture resulting in soil moisture drought in the region it indicates a potential linkage between soil moisture deficit and decline in rainfall occurrence over the indian subcontinent that needs further exploration 3 7 change in distribution of rainy days in addition to long term trends we also explored the change in the distribution of seasonal count of rainy days in each hmzs for different seasons the empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs of rainy days in each season are compared for two halves of the study period 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 ecdfs are estimated by combining seasonal count of rainy days at all grid points falling in a given hmz over a defined period 1951 1982 or 1983 2015 fig 8 represents a comparison of ecdf of rainy days between two halves of the study period in each hmz for different seasons results show a statistically significant change in ecdfs of rainy days over two periods in all hmzs for all the seasons however the nature of departure in distribution is inconsistent in different hmzs a notable change in distribution among all the cases can only be seen in wc zone for monsoon season fig 8n and hr zone for premonsoon and monsoon season fig 8q r the monsoon rainy days in wc zone show a decrease in seasonal count across the entire range of cumulative probabilities in the latter half 1983 2015 of the study period fig 8n in contrast the seasonal count of rainy days in hr zone has increased in the latter half for both premonsoon and monsoon season though not uniformly over different cumulative probabilities fig 8q r the increase in both the seasons is confined between 0 1 and 0 5 quantiles as shown by rightward bulging of ecfd in the latter period it implies an increase in concentration of seasonal count of rainy days between 10 and 30 in premonsoon season and 10 50 in monsoon season in other seasons change observed in ecdfs for different hmzs is marginal but statistically significant at 5 significance level the count of premonsoon rainy days has increased in nw cne and ne zone whereas decreased in wc and pr zone in monsoon season the entire range of quantiles exhibits a reduction in all the zones except for hr and pr a reduction in quantiles is also observed in all the zones for postmonsoon season lastly winter rainy days exhibit varying nature of change in quantiles with marginal increase in nw ne and pr zone and reduction in cne and wc zone in addition to the change in distribution we also examined the change in two key statistics i e mean and standard deviation of rainy days between two halves of the study period at individual grid points in each season fig 9 represents a summary of percent of grid points with significant change in mean and standard deviation in different hmzs evidently the largest coverage of significant change in mean rainy days is evident in hr zone for all the seasons fig 9a more than 50 of grids in monsoon and 40 in premonsoon season show significant change in the mean count of rainy days for hr zone though the nature of change is not consistent across different seasons in which premonsoon monsoon and winter season mainly show an increase while postmonsoon season shows a decrease in rainy days a significant change in mean rainy days over a considerable fraction of grids can also be seen in cne ne wc and pr zone particularly in the monsoon season a significant change is observed over about 30 40 of grids in these zones cne ne and wc zone in addition experienced a reduction in rainy days while grids in pr zone exhibit both increase and decrease in almost equal proportion the reduction in cne wc and pr zone may have substantial implications as these regions are characterized by extensive agricultural practices further the rainy days in pr zone have experienced a significant change in variance particularly in winter 25 30 season fig 9b monsoon rainy days show a substantial coverage of change in variance over ne 15 96 hr 24 06 and pr 15 73 zone in addition a significant change in variance is observed over hr zone in premonsoon 28 44 and winter 16 25 season a significant increase in variance indicates a flatter distribution of rainy days count whereas a decrease in variance denotes a more concentrated distribution in the latter half of the study period an increase in variance can have an adverse impact on agriculture as an increase in year to year variations in rainfall events would disturb the crop irrigation it would also add to the uncertainty in future predictions if not adequately incorporated in climate models 3 8 possible atmospheric forcing to observed trends several studies have documented a significant decline in summer monsoon rainfall over central and northcentral india in the latter half of 20th century mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 multiple factors are suggested to be responsible for the observed decline including increase in the frequency of el niño episodes under global sst warming roxy et al 2014 warming of western indian ocean causing a reduction in tropospheric thermal contrast roxy et al 2015 warming of southern indian ocean resulting in weakened meridional sst gradient rao et al 2010 land use land cover change paul et al 2016 irrigation shukla et al 2014 and increased aerosol content patil et al 2018 besides these external forcing the decadal scale phase transition of pdo and its association with ism is also suggested to be responsible for drying trend in rainfall over india krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 in addition the changes in internal forcing such as extended break spells during warm phase of enso result in decline of seasonal rainfall which in turn contributes to the overall decline in monsoon rainfall the observed declining trends in monsoon rainfall are not spatially and temporally consistent the decline in monsoon rainfall is mainly evident over central and northcentral region whereas peninsular india western himalayan region and parts of northeast india show an increase in rainfall in addition few recent studies have highlighted a revival in monsoon precipitation exhibiting positive trend after 2000 jin and wang 2017 this increase is attributed to the rapid land surface warming over south asia against the tropical indian ocean warming in the recent years it has enhanced the meridional tropospheric temperature gradient in the lower troposphere which in turn caused stronger hadley circulations jin and wang 2017 roxy 2017 observational evidences also suggest a prominent role of decadal evolution of pdo phases in successive decline negative pdo and increase positive pdo in monsoon rainfall over the last half century huang et al 2020 salzmann and cherian 2015 the trends in monsoon rainfall are also not consistent over the entire distribution of rainfall events in the present study we found a significant decline in the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall events 10 100 mm day or 75th 95th percentile over most parts of the country on the contrary both frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events 100 mm day or 95th percentile exhibits an increase across much of the indian subcontinent except for east central and north india that show a decline the observed inconsistency in trends of different rainfall events is also supported by the significant increase observed in the variability of monsoon rainfall ghosh et al 2012 the increase in rainfall variability is attributed to the enhanced moisture convergence over north indian ocean caused by increased relative humidity due to indian ocean warming and increased amplitude of poleward propagating intraseasonal oscillations originating in the equatorial indian ocean sabeerali et al 2014 singh et al 2014 several factors including weakening of large scale monsoon circulations accompanied by a decrease in frequency of low frequency components of synoptic scale disturbances e g monsoon depressions dash et al 2004 rajeevan et al 2000 and extended duration of monsoon break spells in the warmer climate after 1970s singh et al 2014 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 are found responsible for the decline in moderate to heavy rainfall events on the other hand the increase in extreme rainfall events is associated with increase in short duration active spells that are linked to an increase in high frequency components of low pressure systems lps e g monsoon lows against a corresponding decline in low frequency lps monsoon depressions in the bay of bengal ajayamohan et al 2010 pai et al 2016 roxy et al 2017 explained that the enhanced supply of moisture advection from arabian sea by monsoon westerlies are possibly associated with the observed increase in monsoon lows few studies also advocated for an association of increase in extreme events with the strengthening of iod ism relationship in the recent decades where an increase in positive iods were accompanied by frequent extreme events ajayamohan and rao 2008 krishnaswamy et al 2015 an enhanced moisture convergence from arabian sea driven by stronger southerly winds causing a transient westerly trough is linked to the increase in extreme precipitation over north india covering western himalayan region priya et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 suggested a partial influence of rise in dew point temperature in response to positive clausius clapeyron scaling in the increase in extreme rainfall over peninsular india the winter season in southwest asia november april overlaps with the postmonsoon winter and premonsoon seasons in the indian subcontinent the northwest himalayas share the climate regime of southwest asia and wds serves as the primary source of precipitation in the region during non monsoon seasons enso represents a strong influence on interannual variability in wds and the relationship has further intensified in the recent decades causing an increased interannual variability kamil et al 2019 yadav et al 2010 in the backdrop of increased frequency of warm enso phases in recent decades intensified wds can be associated with the increased in the occurrence of storms events in northwest himalayas yadav et al 2010 also the winter atmospheric circulations over the south and central india exhibit baroclinic response to western pacific cooling during positive enso phase with low level anticyclonic and upper level cyclonic circulations it indicates a possible association between observed increase in occurrence of extreme winter precipitation over south peninsular india and frequent warm enso episodes in the recent decades yadav et al 2010 the upper level cyclonic anomalies during warm enso phases can be responsible for the significant increasing trend observed in frequency of extreme rainfall events over south peninsular india in winter season sanap et al 2019 have demonstrated a strong association between extreme rainfall events in postmonsoon season and strong el niño events strong el niño supports an intensified easterly wave that enhances the transport of synoptic scale systems depressions and cyclonic activities from bob to south peninsular region during el niño years strong west east sst gradient persist between southwest bob and tropical western pacific ocean that favours an enhanced easterly wave it indicates a possible linkage between significant increase observed in extreme rainfall events in postmonsoon over peninsular india and frequent episodes of warm enso in the recent years although consistent efforts are being made by the researchers to identify the underlying mechanism for changes in rainfall over the indian subcontinent several facets of rainfall in different seasons still remain unexplained 3 9 possible response to future climate the future projections from coupled general circulation models gcms suggest an increase in global mean precipitation and a weakening of global scale circulations in the warmer climate allen and ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 however model outputs for south asian summer monsoon are characterized with large uncertainties owing to the poor representation of subseasonal variability its interaction with low frequency modes of variability and dynamic feedbacks within tropical indo pacific region turner and annamalai 2012 despite of the inherent uncertainties gcm projections from different generations of coupled model intercomparison project cmip i e cmip3 to cmip6 show a general agreement on an increase in future south asian monsoon rainfall aadhar and mishra 2020 almazroui et al 2020 lee and wang 2014 cmip6 models also project a widespread increase in winter precipitation over south asia during the 21st century almazroui et al 2020 contrary to the recent increase in drought frequency over the indian subcontinent mishra et al 2016 cmip6 model ensembles project a decrease in frequency of droughts over south asia aadhar and mishra 2020 whereas the gcms with less bias for south asian monsoon suggested an increase in drought frequency under the future climate aadhar and mishra 2020 chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the output from a majority of cmip5 models shows an increase in daily rainfall variability in monsoon season over the 21st century that result from an increase in intensity of heavy rainfall events and simultaneous decline in low rainfall events sharmila et al 2015 singh et al 2019 following the current patterns in rainfall occurrence cmip3 and cmip5 models suggest an increase in rainfall intensity and decrease in number of rainy days resulting in higher total precipitation over a reduced number of wet days sabeerali and ajayamohan 2018 turner and slingo 2009 at intraseasonal time scale patterns of wetter active spells and drier break spells could be seen in a few modelling studies mandke et al 2007 sharmila et al 2015 the projections for extreme rainfall events from different models exhibit large discrepancy few cmip5 models and variable resolution model outputs exhibit an increase in extreme rainfall intensity over central india in the 21st century mukherjee et al 2018 shashikanth et al 2017 whereas high resolution model simulations suggest a decrease in the frequency of heavy rainfall over central india and increase over central north and south india sandeep et al 2018 these differences in model projections are largely because of the inability of the gcms to capture the genesis and dynamics of monsoon depressions owing to coarse resolutions of state of the art global models stowasser et al 2009 turner and annamalai 2012 only a small number of gcms in improved cmip5 and cmip6 ensemble of models show the ability to simulate the synoptic scale features of south asian monsoon such as lps and the dynamics of subseasonal processes ashfaq et al 2017 the model limitations are attributed to their inability to represent monsoon interaction with regional topography biases due to intraseasonal variability and poor characterization of thermodynamic interaction in indo pacific region ashfaq et al 2017 jin and wang 2017 it suggests a large scope of investigations for improved understanding of subseasonal variability and regional scale lps associated with south asian monsoon and their improved characterization in gcms multiple past works utilizing high resolution regional climate models rcm show an agreement on projected increase in mean postmonsoon northeast monsoon rainfall over south peninsular india with observable differences for extreme rainfall characteristics under warming climate scenario jayasankar et al 2021 rao et al 2020 while some studies reported an increase in both intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall jayasankar et al 2021 lakshmi et al 2021 a few other suggested a decline in intensity of extreme events and more deficit rainfall years in near future rao et al 2020 sannan et al 2020 rcm projections of precipitation for the himalayas indicate an increase in summer monsoon rainfall over northwest and southeast himalayas and a decline over central himalayas in future climate warming sanjay et al 2017 the winter projections reflect an increase over northwest himalayas and a decline over central and southeast himalayan regions although the model simulations show relatively poor confidence for northwest and central himalayas during summer monsoon and northwest and southeast himalayas for winter season regional scale projections also show an increase in future precipitation over upper indus basin falling in the northwest himalayas dimri et al 2019 in addition the future projections of precipitation over northeast india show a considerable decline in winter season whereas minor changes for premonsoon increase and monsoon decrease season although these model simulations are characterized with large biases and uncertainties kumar and dimri 2017 note that the model simulations for himalayan region under future climate scenario are typically characterized with large biases mainly owing to the poor representation of large topographic variability in the region and partially to the limited understanding of the dynamic interaction of regional circulations with the high topography dimri 2009 dimri et al 2013 mishra 2015 4 summary and conclusions the variability in rainfall occurrence controls key hydrologic components soil moisture evapotranspiration relative humidity etc that can directly impact the rainfed agriculture and indirectly impact the groundwater consumption in groundwater fed agriculture yet it remains the least explored aspect among all the key characteristics intensity duration frequency and magnitude of rainfall in the existing literature over the indian subcontinent the available studies are further inconsistent with several fundamental assumptions such as the spatial scale of analysis dataset used definition of threshold for rainfall classes study period analysis technique etc in addition the past research on rainfall occurrence in india has largely focused on monsoon season with special consideration to the frequency of extreme rainfall events the studies on non monsoon seasons on the other hand have only considered the regions with considerable rainfall in the respective seasons here we attempt to bridge these gaps by adopting uniform criteria of analysis across all the seasons and a robust change detection method for assessing spatially distributed patterns in the frequency of rainfall events across the country in the results we find large spatial variations in the annual climatology of rainy days over entire india the monthly count of rainy days exhibit monsoon dominated seasonality similar to the well documented seasonality in rainfall magnitude the monthly distribution of rainy days further varies among different regions of the country where certain regions receive considerable rainfall in non monsoon months in addition to the monsoon season the seasonal count of rainy days also shows large spatial variations particularly in non monsoon seasons in which specific regions experience abundance of rainfall events while a majority of landmass remains considerably dry this spatial heterogeneity and seasonal scarcity in rainfall occurrence could be a major factor responsible for the mass shift from rainfed to groundwater fed agriculture especially in the backdrop of the green revolution and increased food demand over the last half century asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 further the long term time series of rainy days reveal prominent signal of inherent natural variability in rainfall occurrence monsoon rainy days predominantly exhibit interannual 5 10 years variability while non monsoon rainfall occurrence exhibit strong interdecadal 20 30 years to multidecadal 50 60 years over different hmzs however both long term 1901 2015 and recent 1951 2015 trends in rainfall occurrence over different zones have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability thus potentially attributable to warming climate or anthropogenic changes the primary focus of the present study is to examine spatially distributed trend in total count and count of rainy days in different rainfall classes for all the meteorological seasons in india during 1951 2015 our results show that the rainy days during monsoon season have significantly declined over major crop growing regions covering central northeast northeast and north central parts of the country these regions covering the indo gangetic plains have lately witnessed severe soil moisture drought during 2015 2018 which is the longest duration of all previous drought events over the last two centuries mishra 2020 mishra et al 2016 the decline in monsoon precipitation over gangetic plains and central northeast region since 1950 is suggested to be the primary cause of the recent droughts asoka et al 2017 mishra et al 2016 2012 roxy et al 2015 in the present results we found that the spatial coverage of the decline in rainfall occurrence is much wider than the decline in rainfall amount as reported in past studies mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 moreover the decline in monsoon rainy days is mainly observed in light to heavy rainfall 95th percentile events a recent study demonstrates that the lately observed decline in groundwater recharge in north india during monsoon season is primarily driven by moderate intensity 90th percentile precipitation asoka et al 2018 thus the combined influence of reduction in rainfall occurrence reflecting as enhanced abstraction and reduced groundwater recharge can be a potential factor responsible for groundwater depletion witnessed over north india in the last few decades asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 however the linkage of rainfall occurrence with soil moisture and groundwater variability in the indian subcontinent remains unexplored the decline in number of rainy days in conjunction with depleting groundwater reserves due to unsustainable groundwater pumping can pose a serious threat to the food security and economic well being of the country sahany et al 2018 therefore we emphasize the need to explore the linkage of rainfall occurrence with soil moisture and groundwater variability in future prospects to which the present findings would provide the necessary foundation furthermore the trend results for monsoon season in different rainfall classes reveal that the observed trends in the total count are rather present in specific class es of rainfall events this information is crucial as it suggests the nature of possible impact of the trend observed for different classes the light to moderate rainfall events can influence the soil moisture regional water resources and agriculture production whereas increase decrease in extreme rainfall events suggests a possible increase reduction in susceptibility to devastation floods and associated damage further it is intriguing to find that the trend patterns reported in majority of past studies substantially deviate from the present findings for all the seasons one of the major causes of discrepancy in the results in almost all the studies is the consideration of large scale averaged rainfall in the analysis that ignores the regional spatial variability in rainfall patterns in this study the observed trends in rainy days show substantial spatial heterogeneity for all the seasons the trends reported as field significant for an hmz do not cover the entire region and may even show contradictory patterns at few locations within the same zone this study provides substantial evidence in support of few past works ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 that advocated for the spatially distributed analysis of the rainfall characteristics the next crucial step in succession to present work would be to investigate the causal factors for observed trends in rainfall occurrence several factors influence the dynamics of rainfall characteristics in the india subcontinent such as large scale climate systems kripalani and kumar 2004 krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2016 nageswararao et al 2016 pal et al 2019 webster and yang 1992 warming sea surface temperatures ssts ashok et al 2001 roxy et al 2015 sahany et al 2018 land sea thermal gradient roxy et al 2015 and anthropogenic changes such as land cover change rapid urbanization irrigation increased aerosol concentration etc kedia et al 2016 paul et al 2018 exploring their role individual or combined in changing occurrence of rainfall over the country is an extensive task and falls beyond the scope of present work however the study provides an essential basis for examining the association between the aforementioned factors and the frequency of rainy days the present findings would also facilitate improved characterization and forecast of rainfall occurrence in the existing climate models carbone and tuttle 2008 pal et al 2019 we have also suggested the possible relationship of rainfall occurrence with major water related issues groundwater depletion and agricultural production responsible for extreme water stress in more than half of the country bhanja et al 2017 the study highlights a wide scope for investigating these relationships to improve our understanding of soil moisture and groundwater variability for sustainable water resources management and ensure food security in the country 5 data statement the data used in the study are publicly

4030,a deficit in rainy days can affect crop production and escalate groundwater abstraction leading to groundwater depletion thus may threaten food and water security in the indian subcontinent the available researches on rainfall occurrence in india represent inconsistency in several fundamental considerations spatial scale of analysis the definition of rainfall classes methods dataset study period etc and lack of studies for non monsoon seasons over large parts of the subcontinent here we attempt to deal with these inconsistencies by examining space time patterns in seasonal count of rainfall events and their count in different rainfall classes during 1951 2015 for all meteorological seasons of india using high resolution 0 25 gridded daily rainfall dataset the results show a widespread decline in monsoon rainy days over major crop growing regions including north central central and northeast india a reduction in rainy days is also observed over parts of central india in premonsoon over north central and northeast india in postmonsoon and over peninsular india in winter these trends are mainly observed in events with rainfall 95th percentile light to heavy rainfall events in all the seasons occurrence of extreme events above 95th and 99th percentile exhibits contrasting trends over different zones with mainly an increase over central and south central india and decline over central north india however trends in extremes are highly dispersed in space and are conclusive only over a few regions the observed trends substantially deviate from the patterns reported in past studies for different regions rainfall occurrence in different meteorological zones also represents strong interannual and decadal variability however the observed trends have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability the present findings provide an essential foundation for several future explorations with improved understanding of change in rainfall frequency and its possible impacts it would also assist in developing a comprehensive framework for year wide management of water resources and agriculture considering all crop seasons keywords rainfall occurrence rainy days trend analysis rainfall frequency rainfall variability india 1 introduction anthropogenic emissions in the post industrialization era are causing a rapid increase in global temperature 1 c above the pre industrial level until 2017 which is a well established global issue among the scientific community and political agendas in the recent times ipcc 2014 the warming of global temperatures is modulating the dynamics of atmosphere land ocean processes and their mutual interaction at the global and regional scale collins et al 2010 soden and held 2006 vecchi and soden 2007 wang et al 2004 an immediate effect of global warming is observed in the regional hydrologic cycle particularly as altered rainfall characteristics in different parts of the world allen and ingram 2002 chou and neelin 2004 the principal alterations appeared as a shift intensification or reduction in different rainfall attributes the changes in the intensity and frequency of rainfall are leading to frequent episodes of severe droughts in some parts while devastating floods in the others thus adversely affecting the water resources management and agriculture around the world including india arnell 1999

directly influences the soil moisture evapotranspiration relative humidity land surface temperature and other related variables gong et al 2019 kamara and jackson 1997 indirectly its impact can be seen on natural vegetation health groundwater abstraction regional farming practices and the overall water availability in the region asoka et al 2017 dey and mujumdar 2019 fishman 2018 sahany et al 2018 a frequent and prolonged deficit in rainy days can adversely affect crop production in rainfed agriculture to the extent that it may subjugate the benefits of an increase in total rainfall for crop yield fishman 2018 2016 also a decrease in number of rainfall events during the cultivation period may invoke a rise in groundwater pumping in groundwater fed agriculture asoka et al 2017 singh et al 2014 for an agrarian economy like india a long term deficit in the count of rainfall events in conjunction with rapid depletion of groundwater reserves can be a serious threat to the food security and socio economic well being of the country sahany et al 2018 yet the frequency of rainfall events remains the least studied rainfall attribute in the literature on india the available research on rainfall occurrence has primarily focused on the summer monsoon season owing to its dominance on annual rainfall and wider impacts das et al 2014 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2015 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 for the non monsoon seasons only the regions with substantial rainfall events in respective seasons were considered for example south peninsular india for postmonsoon nageswararao et al 2019 naidu et al 2012 and northwest india for winter nageswararao et al 2016 whereas no work is available on rainfall occurrence in the premonsoon it leaves a large void of information on rainfall occurrence over wide agriculturally active parts of the country for most of the cultivation period the available studies on long term trends in the frequency of rainfall events are highly inconsistent in terms of reported change patterns das et al 2014 dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2015 krishnamurthy et al 2009 kumar and jain 2011 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the key responsible factors for this inconsistency are spatial scale of analysis methods adopted study period and dataset used a majority of previous works have investigated the trends in rainfall aggregated over large regions such as wide rectangular box homogeneous monsoon zones meteorological subdivisions river basins etc few recent studies performed spatial distributed analysis and found contradictory patterns in the regions previously reported to be exhibiting homogenous trends ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the analysis with area averaged rainfall fails to capture the local variations in trend patterns which questions the suitability of their results for regional scale water resources management and policymaking therefore a robust understanding of change patterns requires spatially distributed analysis especially in the backdrop of large spatial variability in rainfall over the indian subcontinent ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 further the frequency of extreme rainfall events particularly in the monsoon season has received more attention in the recent literature due to their direct association with devastating floods and associated risks ghosh et al 2012 goswami et al 2010 2006 krishnamurthy et al 2009 mahanta et al 2013 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 meanwhile only a handful of studies have investigated the trends in the frequency of rainfall events in different rainfall classes besides extreme events ghosh et al 2009 guhathakurta et al 2015 nageswararao et al 2019 another major concern in these studies is the nonuniformity in the criteria for defining the rainfall classes the definition of rainfall classes can substantially deviate the results and their relevance to impacts and policies das et al 2014 ghosh et al 2012 due to inconsistency in the definition of rainfall classes in different studies it is difficult to combine the study outcomes and draw affirmative conclusions thus limiting their credibility in the decision making process the available literature is also inconsistent in terms of dataset used as majority of initial studies used 1 gridded dataset by rajeevan et al 2006 while recent studies used 0 25 gridded dataset by pai et al 2014 a fundamental difference in these datasets is that 1 dataset is developed with fixed number of stations whereas 0 25 dataset is developed with varying number of stations a varying number of stations may have implications over the study results which remains unaddressed in the past works past studies also provide evidences of prominent interannual variability in rainfall of summer monsoon krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 as well as non monsoon seasons such as winter dimri 2013 however no past study has examined the inherent natural variability in rainfall occurrence over the indian subcontinent the knowledge on natural variability of rainfall occurrence would help to understand whether the observed trends are attributable to the anthropogenic climate change or emerging as a part of inherent natural variability evidently the available research on the frequency of rainfall events in india is characterized by several limitations including lack of studies for non monsoon seasons inadequate considerations zonal average analysis and methods used and inconsistency in few fundamental assumptions definition of rainfall classes and study period in the backdrop of these inhomogeneities and lack of information an important question arises as if water resources or agriculture planners must frame a management policy today using the available knowledge on rainfall occurrence what results one should adopt we have attempted to address this question in the present study by performing gridwise analysis of trends in the seasonal count of rainfall events and the count in different rainfall classes for four meteorological seasons over entire india during 1951 2015 considering all four seasons for the entire country would fill the void of information for non monsoon seasons in summary the present study aims to address the following questions and gaps in the existing literature inconsistency in the literature in terms of spatial domain data used study period methods etc and lack of information for non monsoon seasons over large parts of the country whether rainfall events of entire magnitude range exhibit similar patterns if not what are the patterns in occurrence for different rainfall classes whether the observed trends are a component of inherent natural variability or emerged independent of it the remaining paper is organized as follows section 2 describes various data and methods used in the present study results and discussion on different analyses performed in present work as summarized in section 3 section 4 provides a summary of key findings and future prospects of the present work 2 dataset and methods 2 1 dataset in the present study we used gridded daily rainfall record at 0 25 pai et al 2014 and 1 rajeevan et al 2006 resolution from the india meteorological department imd for 1951 2015 a total of 4964 grid points are available in 0 25 dataset covering entire india the dataset is prepared using daily rainfall records from 6955 rain gauge stations with a varying period of data availability pai et al 2014 for the period considered in the present work i e 1951 2015 the data is available from 3100 stations per day which is fairly higher than the previous years pai et al 2014 the station data were transformed to 0 25 resolution grids using the inverse distance weighted scheme shepard 1968 that retained the vital climatological patterns in rainfall over the country it is the finest resolution dataset available on long term observed daily rainfall over india which is also superior to previous datasets the dataset accurately captures the mean climatology and seasonality in the rainfall and provides a more realistic representation of heavy rainfall over the regions with hilly topography and large spatial variabilities such as western ghats northeast india and the himalayan regions nageswararao et al 2019 pai et al 2014 further the dataset provides a continuous record of daily rainfall without any missing value with complete coverage over the country thus most suitable for spatial distributed analysis of rainfall occurrence in the region on the other hand 1 gridded dataset by imd is developed with fixed number of rainfall stations 2140 stations over the entire country using the same interpolation scheme as used in 0 25 data rajeevan et al 2006 the daily rainfall of each year during 1951 2015 was separated for four meteorological seasons in india premonsoon march may monsoon june september postmonsoon october december and winter january february all the analyses were performed at individual grid locations and the results are reported at each grid as well as for six homogeneous monsoon rainfall zones hmzs defined by imd northwest nw central northeast cne northeast ne west central wc hilly regions hr and south peninsular region pr fig 1 a 2 2 definition of rainy days and rainfall classes most studies for monsoon season have adopted the threshold of 2 5 mm day 1 for rainy days while 1 mm day 1 is used as a threshold for non monsoon seasons also the world meteorological organisation wmo suggests 1 mm day 1 as the threshold of rainy days for worldwide applications wmo 2017 consistent with the definition of wmo and to maintain homogeneity across all the seasons we define rainy day as the day with rainfall intensity 1 mm day 1 further two commonly adopted criteria for the definition of rainfall classes are fixed threshold goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 roxy et al 2017 and fixed percentile ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the fixed threshold approach uses a single value of rainfall across an entire region to demarcate rainfall classes thus inappropriate for heterogeneous rainfall regions the fixed percentile based threshold varies spatially corresponding to the rainfall distribution at different locations therefore most suitable for gridwise analysis subsequently six rainfall classes are defined in the present study light 25th percentile moderate 25th 50th percentile moderate heavy 50th 75th percentile heavy 75th 95th percentile very heavy 95th 99th percentile and extremely heavy 99th percentile the percentiles are computed separately for each season using daily rainfall series with intensity 1 mm day 1 over a base period of 1961 1990 dey and mujumdar 2019 karl et al 1999 at individual grid location note that only the rainfall events regarded as a rainy day rainfall 1 mm day 1 are considered to compute the percentiles and to obtain the count of rainy days for further analyses 2 3 analysis of trend and its field significance the time series of rainy days is essentially a sequence of observations of a count variable the application of conventional or modified version of mann kendall trend test to a series of counts is not amenable due to the presence of a large number of ties frei and schär 2001 proposed a binomial logistic regression based approach to assess trends in count variables such as rainy days and frequency of rainfall events in a given rainfall class in this approach a linear relationship is established between the expected value of counts and time as 1 l o g i t π α β t in which 2 l o g i t π l o g π 1 π where α and β are coefficients of regression t is time year and π is the probability of counts or event probability computed as the ratio of number of successes rainy days to number of trials total days in a period season or year the trend magnitude is obtained from an output of logistic regression namely the odds ratio which denotes the relative change in the ratio of occurrences vs non occurrences during a period frei and schär 2001 the odds ratio can be computed as 3 θ π t n 1 π t n π t 1 1 π t 1 where π t is the probability of an event at time t frei and schär 2001 the trend magnitude is estimated as θ 1 in which a positive value represents a larger number of occurrences at the end of the period compared to the beginning increasing trend and vice versa decreasing trend if the value is negative frei and schär 2001 schmidli and frei 2005 for the convenience of representation the relative change is computed over a period of 100 years to denote the magnitude of trend multiple studies have used this method for examining trends in the frequency of climate variables such as rainfall and runoff burn et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2016 in the study trends and their significance at 5 significance level were estimated over 1951 2015 using r package developed by frei and schär 2001 we also examined the field significance of gridwise estimated trends for different hmzs using the bootstrap procedure suggested by douglas et al 2000 the most common challenge in determining the regional consistency of trends is the spatial correlation or spatial dependence between data at different locations spatial correlation in the data can substantially deviate the test results leading to biased conclusions a high resolution gridded rainfall data may represent significant spatial dependence thus require an adequate consideration in the analysis douglas et al 2000 proposed a bootstrap based procedure to include the effect of spatial correlation in testing the field significance past studies have applied this approach in conjunction with the mann kendall test to examine different climate variables here we demonstrate its application with the trend analysis method suggested by frei and schär 2001 in the process the actual number of grids with significant trend is compared against the critical value of significant results nc corresponding to a set regional significance level α the simulated sample of significant results n m m 1 n is obtained from trend analysis of bootstrapped samples of original data over n simulations the empirical quantile of the simulated sample n m corresponding to 1 α is regarded as the critical value nc the result with the actual count of significant trends over a region higher than the critical value nc is adopted as field significant for the region the stepwise procedure of sample bootstrapping is described in burn and hag elnur 2002 and renard et al 2008 with the only difference in trend analysis method our analysis drew 1000 bootstrap samples of daily rainfall value of rainy days to simulate a sample of significant results the field significance of negative and positive trends is estimated separately for different hmzs in each season at 5 significance level during 1951 2015 2 4 significance of change in rainy days between two halves of the study period the frequency of rainfall events is a count variable and corresponds to a sample drawn from the population following discrete distribution the conventional anderson darling test anderson and darling 1954 assumes that the random samples to be tested belong to a continuous population thus inappropriate for the discretely distributed count of rainy days therefore the statistical significance of change in distribution empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of rainy days between two halves of the study period 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 is estimated using the modified anderson darling test namely k sample anderson darling test proposed by scholz and stephens 1987 the k sample anderson darling test is a rank based test that establishes the difference between two samples without making any prior parametric assumptions scholz and stephens 1987 in the study the test is applied using the r package ksamples https cran r project org package ksamples the significance of departure in ecdf of rainy days is analyzed separately for different hmzs in each season we obtained the samples of rainy days for two periods 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 by combining the seasonal count of rainy days at all grids falling within an hmz during the respective periods the significance of the difference in the mean and standard deviation of rainy days between two periods 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 is tested using non parametric bootstrap approach the confidence interval on sampled mean and standard deviation is estimated at 5 significance level using a total of 1000 bootstrap samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution of rainy days in india the spatial distribution of mean annual count of rainy days at each grid location during 1951 2015 is shown in fig 1c evidently the spatial patterns in the annual climatology of rainy days are fairly congruent to that in the rainfall amount as documented in numerous past studies pai et al 2015 large variations can be seen in the spatial distribution of annual rainfall occurrence throughout the country the northeast india and the western ghats along the west coastline of india received largest number 140 200 of daily rainfall events owing to their hilly topography that provides an orographic barrier to the moisture laden winds especially during the summer monsoon season june september there exists a southeast to northwest falling gradient in rainfall occurrence over the flatter landmass of the indian subcontinent with a fairly high number 80 120 of rainy days over eastern and east central regions and scarcity 5 40 of rainfall occurrence over northwest india in north india the great himalayan ranges 6000 to 7500 m above sea level traverse along the southeast northwest direction that applies a topographic barrier to moist winds from south southwest monsoon winds and west northwest westerlies during winter fig 1b it causes heavy downpour along the windward face of the himalayan ranges during summer monsoon months and substantial rainfall during himalayan winters november april bookhagen and burbank 2010 2006 the orography induced precipitation over the himalayan region soaks most of the moisture from winds entering from different directions leaving relatively drier winds for higher elevations in the north bookhagen and burbank 2010 as a result eastern parts of north himalayas remain precipitation scarce for most part of the year similar patterns are also reflected in the spatial distribution of annual rainfall occurrence as the southern and western parts of north india covering uttarakhand himachal pradesh and western jammu kashmir experience considerable 80 120 annual rainfall events while eastern parts ladakh region remain relatively dry 20 60 rainy days throughout the year these results provide observable evidence of vast spatial heterogeneity in rainfall occurrence over india that demands spatially distributed analysis ideally at the finest resolution available for the rainfall dataset besides spatial variations rainfall occurrence over india also represents large intra annual variability characterized by the concentration of a large fraction of annual rainfall events to a few months of monsoon season the dominance of the summer monsoon season on annual rainfall over india is well documented in the existing literature gadgil and gadgil 2006 similar monsoon dominated seasonality can also be seen in the mean annual monthly distribution of rainy days as shown in fig 1d the average number of rainfall events in the summer monsoon months is substantially higher than the remaining months of the year for a large part of the country however the monthly distribution of rainy days further varies for different regions of the country fig 1d nw cne and wc zone receive most 60 80 of annual rainfall events during monsoon months among which the monthly count of rainy days for cne and wc region is remarkably similar throughout the year the nw zone is found to be the driest of all hmzs with the least number of rainfall events in almost all the months in the remaining zones i e ne hr and pr a considerable rainfall occurrence is observed during non monsoon months in addition to the dominant monsoon season the monsoon rainy days in the ne zone are highest of all hmzs where a considerable fraction of annual rainfall events 25 is also obtained during premonsoon season march may the hr zone covering the himalayan region in north india receives a fair count of rainfall events during winter and premonsoon months constituting a significant fraction 14 30 of the annual count in the pr zone the rainfall occurrence in postmonsoon season makes a large contribution 40 60 to the annual count even higher than monsoon season in some parts over tamil nadu state of south peninsular india the peninsular region also experiences reasonable rainfall events during premonsoon season particularly in april and may months overall these results reveal large seasonality in rainfall occurrence over india that varies among different regions of the country therefore various analyses in the present study are performed separately for four meteorological seasons experienced over the indian subcontinent in addition the regional scale significance of different results from gridwise analysis is also examined for six hmzs defined by imd 3 2 mean climatology of rainy days for different seasons fig 2 a d show the spatial distribution of the count of rainy days for four meteorological seasons over india the variation of seasonal rainy days is also examined among six hmzs of india as shown in fig 2e h evidently the number of rainfall events experienced in monsoon season is higher than all other seasons over the entire country the monsoon rainy days further exhibit large spatial variability with considerably higher 100 120 rainfall events over northeast india and western ghats and fewer 10 20 rainfall events over northwest india fig 2b which is fairly consistent with the familiar climatological patterns in rainfall magnitude over india pai et al 2015 sahany et al 2018 for the monsoon season the largest count of rainy days among all hmzs is experienced over the ne zone falling in the range 50 120 days fig 2f the number of monsoon rainfall events in hr zone varies over a wider range as indicated by an interquartile range of 30 80 days it is mainly because the parts of hr zone falling in northeast india experience 90 120 days of rainfall whereas the parts covering northern india receive 20 70 days of rainfall the cne and wc zone exhibit similar distribution of rainfall events ranging between 20 and 110 days with the interquartile range concentrated to 50 80 days the pr zone experience relatively fewer rainfall events 0 100 days than the other zones except for nw zone nw zone is driest among all hmzs of india during monsoon season where the count of rainy days lies between 0 and 80 days with an interquartile range of 20 50 days fig 2f apparently the spatial distribution of rainfall occurrence in monsoon season is fairly congruent to the spatial patterns in annual rainfall occurrence fig 1c reflecting the dominance of monsoon season on annual count for the premonsoon season the count of rainy days in ne and hr zone is higher than the other zones typically ranging between 0 and 80 days fig 2a e few traces of rainfall events 10 30 days in premonsoon season are also found over peninsular india and eastern parts of cne zone while the rest of the country seldom 0 5 days receives rainfall unlike other seasons the postmonsoon season brings substantial rainfall events 0 50 days over pr zone covering peninsular region of south india fig 2c g the northeast monsoon also known as retreating indian summer monsoon serves as the primary rainfall season for peninsular india constituting 40 60 of annual rainfall rajeevan et al 2012 sanap et al 2019 northeast monsoon is highly crucial for agricultural production in peninsular india as it coincides with the primary crop rabi season of the region nageswararao et al 2019 the other parts of the country on the other hand remain relatively dry during postmonsoon months receiving merely 5 10 days of rainfall the winter season is found to be the driest among all seasons in which majority of the country receives rainfall for 5 10 days except for hr zone fig 2d h the mean count of rainy days in hr zone during winter season is between 0 and 40 days that are mainly observed over the north himalayan region the eastward propagating synoptic weather systems called western disturbances are the primary source of winter precipitation over north india dimri and mohanty 2009 the western disturbances mid latitude westerlies interact with the heterogenous topography of the western himalayas resulting in considerable precipitation events over the region during winter months bookhagen and burbank 2010 dimri 2009 winter precipitation in the himalayan region is closely associated with the regional climate hydrology cryosphere and agriculture thus highly important for overall sustainability in the region dimri 2013a precipitation at sub freezing altitudes of the himalayas occurs as snow that controls the inter annual dynamics of glacial and snow mass balance kumar et al 2019 these glaciers and snow masses supply a considerable amount of freshwater to some large river networks of india in different seasons which explains the importance of winter precipitation to socio economic well being of the country yadav et al 2009 the seasonal climatology of rainy days is also examined with 1 gridded dataset by rajeevan et al 2006 for the same period fig s1 evidently the climatology of seasonal rainy days shows similar patterns as obtained from 0 25 gridded data over all the hmzs except for the hr zone in the monsoon season the interquartile range of rainy days for hr zone is wider and median value is lower in 0 25 dataset than the 1 dataset it indicates that 1 gridded dataset gives higher seasonal count of rainy days than 0 25 dataset over majority of the region on the other hand the interquartile range and the median value of rainy days in the premonsoon season is comparatively higher in 0 25 dataset the lack of rainfall stations over jammu kashmir region in both the datasets can be a primary cause of the observed inconsistency apart from these differences the seasonal count of rainy days obtained from both the datasets are highly consistent in all the zones for all the seasons broadly the comparison of rainy days across different seasons shows that considerable rainfall events in premonsoon season are experienced in ne and hr zone while monsoon season supplies significant rainfall events over the entire country in the postmonsoon and winter season rainfall events are mainly observed in pr and hr zone respectively these results reveal that wide areas of the country remain rainfall deprived for a large part of the year one of the large scale impacts of this seasonal scarcity in rainfall occurrence can be explained on agricultural practices and groundwater consumption especially after the green revolution the green revolution in india essentially aimed at an increase in agricultural production by enabling agricultural practices throughout the year however it required a reliable and consistent source of fresh water supply for crop growth which has been later served by a groundwater based irrigation system rodell et al 2009 therefore in regards to increased food demand and green revolution in india over the last half century the heterogeneity and scarcity in rainfall occurrence could be a primary driver of the mass shift from rainfed to groundwater fed agriculture particularly in semi arid and arid regions of india asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 further rainfed agriculture would reflect strong sensitivity to variability in rainfall occurrence as it significantly modulates the regional soil moisture at daily to weekly time scale therefore a robust understanding of space time variability in rainfall occurrence becomes crucial for adequate management of agricultural practices and sustainable water resources management in the country 3 3 natural variability of rainfall occurrence the natural variability of rainfall occurrence is examined by constructing long term time series of area averaged rainy days over different hmzs for the years 1901 2015 fig 3 the 7 year running mean of long term time series denotes the decadal component to identify the presence of interdecadal variability as evident in fig 3 the regionally averaged time series of rainy days for all the seasons exhibit large interannual variability in each zone besides significant interannual variability these time series also exhibit strong signals of decadal to multidecadal variability although the dominant mode of the observed decadal variability in rainfall occurrence is not consistent across different rainfall zones in the premonsoon season a clear signal of strong interdecadal 20 25 years variability in rainy days is evident over cne ne nw and hr zone fig 3a b c e the rainy days in cne ne and nw zone also show an insignificant decline over the last 114 years whereas an increase over the period 1951 2015 on the other hand a decline in wc zone and an increase in hr zone is evident in both the time periods the rainy days over pr zone represent a strong multidecadal variability 50 60 years with no significant trend in the long term or in the recent decades fig 3f the variability in premonsoon rainfall at different time scales and their associated climate drivers is a relatively lesser explored topic in the existing literature premonsoon rainfall over northwest himalayas and northern india is caused by east propagating synoptic scale systems called western disturbances wd dimri 2013b while thunderstorms and cyclonic systems emerging in the bay of bengal bob are the primary source of premonsoon rainfall over south peninsular india sinha et al 2019 the interannual variability in wd represents a strong response to el niño southern oscillations enso dimri 2013c 2013b yadav et al 2010 and deep convection anomalies over east indian ocean and maritime continent hoell et al 2013 the thunderstorm activities in bob and their propagation are largely influenced by the sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the north tropical indian ocean and western indian ocean yadav 2013 considering these underlying forcing to premonsoon rainfall the dominant modes of variability in the equatorial pacific and indian ocean i e enso and indian ocean dipole iod respectively can be associated with the interannual variability in premonsoon rainfall although a thorough investigation is necessary to ascertain their influence and mutual interaction a correlation based analysis also suggested significant positive correlations between atlantic multidecadal oscillations amo and premonsoon rainfall over peninsular and northeast india and significant negative correlation over northwest india kumar and naidu 2020 amo is a multidecadal 50 70 years mode of variability in north atlantic ocean delworth and mann 2000 that can be associated with the prominent multidecadal variability observed for pr zone in the present results the rainfall occurrence in monsoon season represents large interannual 5 10 years variability over all the zones fig 3g i 7 year running mean series further reveals the presence of multidecadal variability with varying dominant modes in different zones nw wc and pr zone exhibit 10 20 years mode of decadal variability whereas ne and hr zone show a low frequency decadal variability with an average cycle of 30 40 years indian summer monsoon ism is the main source of monsoon rainfall over south asia during boreal summers jjas ism exhibits pronounced variability on intraseasonal interannual and decadal time scales goswami 2006 goswami and mohan 2001 krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 enso serves as the dominant forcing for interannual variability in ism through the interaction between equatorial walker circulations and regional meridional hadley circulations webster and yang 1992 enso exhibits strong out of phase relationship with ism manifested as supressed monsoon circulation rainfall deficit during warm or el niño phase and an enhanced circulation above normal rainfall during cold or la niña phase pant and parthasarathy 1981 sikka 1980 it induces changes to the indo western pacific circulations that directly influence the ism whereas indirectly it influences the ism rainfall by modulating the north indian ocean sst kawamura et al 2001 wu and kirtman 2003 and atmospheric moisture content over the tropical indian ocean ashok et al 2004 wu and kirtman 2003 iod is another prominent forcing that alters the enso ism relationship at interannual scale ashok et al 2004 2001 the positive phase of iod characterized with enhanced supressed convention over western eastern equatorial indian ocean is found favourable for monsoon circulations over the indian subcontinent both observational and model analysis provide evidences for an inverse iod impact on enso ism relationship where the presence of positive dipole anomalous warm western indian ocean is accompanied with a suppressed influence of el niño on monsoon rainfall ashok et al 2001 in addition to the aforementioned external forcing the interannual variability of summer monsoon rainfall is partially forced by internal forcing that persist as intraseasonal oscillations in the monsoon circulations the intraseasonal variability in summer monsoon is typically associated with north south fluctuations in the intertropical convergence zone itcz and manifest in the form of spells of dry and wet conditions widely referred to as active and break spells gadgil and joseph 2003 sikka and gadgil 1980 several factors including synoptic scale systems e g low pressure systems and madden julian oscillations mjo driven poleward propagating convection anomalies in the equatorial indian ocean contribute to the intraseasonal variability in monsoon rainfall gadgil and asha 1992 joseph et al 2009 krishnamurthy and shukla 2007 krishnamurti and ardanuy 1980 the circulation patterns of intraseasonal oscillations closely resembles with the mean monsoon circulation where a positive active phase interaction results in enhanced seasonal rainfall and a negative break phase interaction causes reduced rainfall it should be noted here that past studies on climatic drivers of variability in monsoon rainfall have mainly considered all india monsoon rainfall or the monsoon core region covering central east central and southeast india thus the relative influence of different identified modes of climate variability on monsoon rainfall may vary for different parts of the indian subcontinent it is also reflected in the present results as the modes of decadal variability are not consistent across different zones also regional factors such as topography dominate the rainfall patterns over certain regions including northwest himalayas northeast india and along the western ghats unlike rest of the country the monsoon rainfall over northeast india in particular has shown limited response to the large scale climate systems enso and iod a recent study choudhury et al 2019 suggested a stronger influence of the decadal mode in north pacific ocean i e pacific decadal oscillations pdo on the variability of monsoon rainfall over northeast india and attributed the recent decline in rainfall over the region to the phase shift in decadal mode of pdo ism rainfall also exhibits prominent decadal variability that are found to be associated with amo and pdo at distinct modes of variability past studies suggest a strong positive linkage between monsoon rainfall and amo while a negative linkage with pdo these decadal modes of variability can be directly associated with monsoon rainfall or indirectly modulates the relationship between interannual e g enso and iod and intraseasonal e g mjo modes of variability and monsoon rainfall depending on the relative phase of the decadal mode the influence of high frequency modes of variability on monsoon rainfall may enhance or dampen krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 pdo shows an out of phase linkage with the summer monsoon rainfall i e positive negative phase of pdo is associated with a deficit increase in monsoon rainfall over the indian subcontinent its direct influence on monsoon circulations is hypothesised through a seasonal footprint mechanism that affect equatorial trade winds indirectly pdo alters the enso monsoon relation where an in phase out of phase interaction between enso and pdo causes enhanced suppressed influence of enso on monsoon circulations the positive association between amo and ism rainfall is because of amo driven shifts in itcz causing increased moisture convergence in the monsoon trough region the influence of amo on ism is also explained through tropospheric temperature anomalies over eurasia although it stands in debate in the literature krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 li et al 2008 lu et al 2006 the decadal variability observed in the present results indicates a possible linkage between monsoon rainfall occurrence and pdo on decadal time scale besides the natural variability rainy days over cne ne and wc zone experienced a statistically significant decline in the long term that further intensified during 1951 2015 the monsoon rainy days in hr zone shows a significant increase in both the time periods while no observable trends can be seen for nw and pr zone the 7 year running mean of rainy days for postmonsoon season reveals the presence of strong interdecadal variability in all the zones with a mean cycle of 15 20 years fig 3m r along with the interdecadal variability rainfall occurrence in postmonsoon season experienced a steep decline in the recent decades 1951 2015 while no significant change can be observed in the long term 1901 2015 over all the zones except for hr zone rainfall occurrence in the hr zone show significant increase in the long term whereas significant decline over the last six decades the interannual variability in postmonsoon or northeast monsoon nem rainfall is also driven by enso and iod however unlike ism both enso and iod exhibit a positive linkage with postmonsoon rainfall as positive phase of enso iod and equinoo atmospheric component of iod favours above normal rainfall kripalani and kumar 2004 sreekala et al 2012 zubair and ropelewski 2006 in addition intraseasonal oscillations in postmonsoon rainfall modulate the influence of enso and iod at interannual time scale past studies suggest a close relationship between intraseasonal oscillations in postmonsoon rainfall and various phases of mjo the occurrence of phase 2 3 and 4 of mjo has an overall enhancing influence on the positive impact of el niño and positive iod on nem rainfall and it results in an increase in number of rainfall events and mean rainfall conversely phase 5 6 7 8 and 1 of mjo has a suppressing influence on postmonsoon rainfall during el niño and positive iod years sreekala et al 2018 few earlier studies have suggested a strengthening of nem enso relationship after 1980 kumar et al 2007 zubair and ropelewski 2006 however a recent study elaborated that the nem enso relationship represents significant decadal fluctuations rajeevan et al 2012 the decades of 1940 1950 and 1980 1990 were perhaps the phases of stronger relationship along with intermittent phases of weaker association including the recent decade 2001 2010 of sharp weakening the driving climatic modes for these decadal variations are still unknown although they may possibly be associated with the decadal scale mode of variability in north pacific and north atlantic such as pdo and amo the strong signal of decadal scale variability in postmonsoon rainfall occurrence observed in the present results also indicates a possible linkage with these decadal scale modes the rainfall occurrence in winter season exhibits a significant decline in the long term over cne ne wc and pr zone and significant increase over hr zone fig 3s x although the decline has weakened in the recent decades the 7 year running mean reveal the presence of interdecadal variability along with significant signals of interannual variability over all the zones note that the rainfall occurrence over hr zone shows significant increase in the long term for all the seasons with an abrupt increase after 1960 winter precipitation over the indian subcontinent is mainly received over northwest himalayas and parts of northwest india the northwest himalayas share the climate system of southwest asia that receive major fraction 70 80 of precipitation during winter of southwest asia november april from wds guided by upper tropospheric westerlies barlow et al 2016 dimri et al 2015 the wds cause sparse but heavy precipitation events as less than ten of these events constitute 50 of annual precipitation barlow et al 2005 bookhagen and burbank 2010 cannon et al 2017 it should be noted that winter season of southwest asia overlaps with postmonsoon winter and premonsoon season in the indian subcontinent studies suggest that the dynamics of wd is influenced by large scale climate systems and synoptic scale phenomena that subsequently control the variability in the precipitation over northwest himalayas at different temporal scales enso are found to have significant control over the interannual variability of winter precipitation in the region through strong in phase association with the wds dimri 2013c 2013b hoell et al 2015 yadav et al 2010 the warm phase of enso is observed to be associated with intensified wds through rossby wave like response in the upper level circulations causing above normal storm events in the western himalayas dimri 2013c hoell et al 2013 yadav et al 2010 contrary to the enso ism relationship severe droughts over southwest asia in the recent years were found associated with la niña conditions hoell et al 2014 besides direct influence through rossby wave like anomalies abid et al 2016 dimri et al 2015 enso also found to exert an indirect influence on winter precipitation through atmospheric diabatic heating anomalies over tropical indian ocean which modulates the enso precipitation relationship at intraseasonal time scale abid et al 2020 the diabatic heating anomalies in the tropical indian ocean also generate rossby wave like patterns that results in enhanced winter precipitation over southwest asia an in phase interaction between the direct and indirect influences of enso is reflected as a stronger positive relationship between enso and southwest asia precipitation whereas an out of phase interaction exhibit weaker relationship abid et al 2020 further the intraseasonal influence of mjo varies for extreme precipitation events in the region as mjo phases that favour enhancement of wds can simultaneously supress the available moisture cannon et al 2017 it opposes the favourable conditions for extreme precipitation thus subsides the influence of enhanced dynamic forcing of wds apparently the dynamics and thermodynamic response to the interplay between interannual enso and intraseasonal mjo phases is not clearly understood and needs further exploration the deep indian ocean convection over east indian ocean and maritime continent also show close association with winter precipitation over northwest himalayas exhibiting strong negative relationship at seasonal to interannual scale while weaker negative linkage at subseasonal scale hoell et al 2013 the circulation anomalies corresponding to tropical indian ocean convection closely resembles mjo and enso like patterns at intraseasonal and seasonal to interannual scale respectively previous works suggest an out of phase response of winter precipitation over southwest asia to mjo where negative mjo were associated with an increase in average as well as extreme daily precipitation in the region barlow et al 2005 hoell et al 2013 in addition pdo show a considerable influence on decadal variability of winter precipitation over southwest asia where cold phase of pdo is associated with precipitation reduction hoell et al 2015 the precipitation variability in the region is also forced by other modes of climate variability including north atlantic oscillations nao syed et al 2006 and amo sheffield and wood 2008 although the relative influence of these climate systems is not well defined in the existing literature in summary the rainfall occurrence in each season represents prominent variability at interannual and decadal time scale previous works show that interannual variability in rainfall over the indian subcontinent is largely modulated by enso and iod though the nature of their relationship with rainfall varies for different seasons the mjo driven intraseasonal variability in rainfall for each season also exhibit a prominent influence on the interannual variability the decadal variability in seasonal rainfall is mainly associated with the prominent decadal modes of climate variability such as pdo and amo the nature of influence of these decadal modes also varies for different seasons these decadal modes particularly pdo are also suggested to be responsible for the decadal fluctuations in enso rainfall relationship in addition to prominent variability at interannual to decadal time scale zonal average time series of rainy days also represent significant long term trends the long term trends show a considerable shift in rainfall occurrence after 1950 as the trends have either intensified or reversed in the latter half of 20th century it is also interesting to see that the long term as well as recent trends in rainfall occurrence have emerged beyond the reminiscence of its inherent natural variability it indicates that the observed trends in rainfall occurrence may be potentially associated with the climate warming or other anthropogenic factors nonetheless the presence of strong natural variability suggests better predictability of rainfall occurrence at interannual or decadal scale that can be used for long term planning in different sectors identification of the dominant climate systems associated with rainfall occurrence in a region would also facilitate its improved characterization in climate and weather forecast models 3 4 trends of rainy days in different seasons considering large spatial variations and seasonality temporal trends are estimated in the seasonal count of rainy days at individual grids over the entire country for the period 1951 2015 the field significance of trends observed at individual grid points is examined for different hmzs at 5 significance level fig 4 a d show gridwise distribution of trends in count of rainy days for four meteorological seasons in india the areal coverage of trends is also represented as the percent of grids in each hmz with significant negative red and positive blue trend through bar plots fig 4e h field significant trends are denoted by a double asterisk on the top of respective bars in the premonsoon season rainy days exhibit a significant increase over majority of northwest india and some parts of eastern jammu kashmir central northeast and peninsular region fig 4a the increasing trends of premonsoon rainy days are field significant for nw and hr zone covering 21 42 and 22 03 of grids in respective regions fig 4e a significant decline in premonsoon rainfall occurrence is observed over large parts of wc zone western coastal regions of peninsular india and parts of north himalayas covering western jammu kashmir and himachal pradesh the decline in wc zone is field significant which indicates the drying tendency of the region that already remains relatively dry in the premonsoon season in addition western parts of north himalayas in hr zone that receive considerable rainfall events in premonsoon season also exhibit a significant decline fig 4a e the observed patterns are in uniformity with the trends reported in premonsoon rainfall by past studies that suggested a decline over central and south india and increase over northwest india guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 pal and al tabbaa 2009 the summer monsoon rainfall over the indian subcontinent dominates the total annual rainfall in terms of both frequency and magnitude the variability and long term changes in the rainfall occurrence of monsoon season would have significant implications on agricultural production food security and overall socio economic well being of the country fishman 2016 ghosh et al 2009 sahany et al 2018 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the trend test results reveal a significant decline in monsoon rainy days over majority of the country including indo gangetic plains central india northeast india and parts of north himalayas during 1951 2015 cne 41 58 ne 37 5 and wc 38 89 zone in particular exhibit widespread decline in rainy days where trends are also field significant at regional scale fig 4b f interestingly the significant decline in rainy days is more widespread than the decline in rainfall magnitude during monsoon season suggested in past studies mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 these results are alarming because cne and wc zone encompasses major crop growing regions of the country and monsoon season overlaps with a major crop season kharif june to october in india a prolonged decline in monsoon rainfall occurrence may lead to persistent soil moisture deficit that can adversely impact the crop production in rainfed agriculture and can elevate groundwater pumping in groundwater irrigated agriculture accordingly the observed widespread decline in monsoon rainy days can be a prominent contributing factor to the exponential increase witnessed in groundwater pumping over the past few decades in india mishra et al 2018 shah 2009 further subseasonal variability in rainfall occurrence modulates short term weekly to monthly soil moisture storage while a long term decline in rainfall events can cause prolonged soil moisture deficit or soil moisture drought in the region apparently the lately observed soil moisture drought over the indo gangetic plains in india mishra et al 2019 2016 may be partially attributable to the widespread decline in monsoon rainfall occurrence these possible linkages of rainfall occurrence with soil moisture and groundwater variability show that intrinsic knowledge of space time changes in rainfall occurrence can help characterize several crucial water resources based issues and plan sustainable agriculture practices in the country contrary to most parts of the country monsoon rainfall events exhibit a significant increase over north himalayan region covering majority of jammu kashmir field significant for hr zone 34 37 at regional scale fig 4b f past study on rainy days of monsoon season reported fairly similar trend patterns reflecting a decline over central and north central india expect for few regions including haryana arunachal pradesh west rajasthan coastal karnataka and tamil nadu das et al 2014 the trends report at riven basin scale differs from present results for brahmaputra krishna and cauvery river basin kumar and jain 2011 the discrepancy in trend patterns from different studies can be due to the difference in few basic considerations i e data resolution spatial scale of analysis and time period of data analysis in the postmonsoon season a significant decline in rainy days is observed over a large part 39 1 of ne zone and parts of cne 13 and hr 25 47 zone covering western uttar pradesh uttarakhand himachal pradesh and western jammu kashmir fig 4c g the decreasing trends are field significant for ne and hr zone at 5 significance level fig 4g wide areas in nw zone also depict a decrease in rainy days but not statistically significant interestingly the peninsular india that receives considerable rainfall events during postmonsoon season does not represent any significant trend in rainfall occurrence fig 4c g a dipole of trends is also observed over northwest himalayas where trends along the west and southern edges are negative while northward region exhibit an increase in rainfall events the precipitation regime over northwest himalayas is primarily driven by wds although synoptic scale systems developing in bob dimri 2006 and moisture flux from arabian sea dimri 2013a also contribute to the seasonal precipitation by occasionally interacting with southern edge of north himalayas hunt et al 2018 studies have reported an intensification of wds in response to an increase in frequency of warm enso phases in the recent years resulting in an increase in precipitation events over northwest himalayas thus the decline observed along the southern face of northwest himalayas can be associated with long term change in the synoptic scale systems and their driving mechanisms contrary to the present results nageswararao et al 2019 observed an increase in wet 0 mm day days over eastern peninsular region and a significant reduction over western peninsular india during 1959 2016 in comparison to 1901 1958 in the recent decades 1970 2008 however majority of south peninsular india shows an increase in rainy days naidu et al 2012 note that the available works on postmonsoon rainfall occurrence have only focused on peninsular india that created a knowledge gap for rest of the country in the present results we found significant decline in postmonsoon rainfall events over large parts of north and northwest india the rainy days in winter season represent significant positive trend over a considerable area 18 46 in the peninsular region covering parts of karnataka and andhra pradesh fig 4d h a significant increase in winter rainfall events is also observed over eastern parts of jammu kashmir 20 47 in hr zone and northern parts of nw zone the increase observed in pr and hr zone are obtained to be field significant at the regional scale on the contrary some parts of tamil nadu state in pr zone himachal pradesh and uttarakhand in hr zone and eastern uttar pradesh in cne show significant decline in winter rainy days fig 4d h the remaining parts of the country do not show significant trend in rainy days during winter season fairly similar decreasing patterns in himachal pradesh uttarakhand and eastern uttara pradesh during 1901 2013 are also reported by nageswararao et al 2016 the study results contradict with the present work for parts of northwest india covering rajasthan punjab haryana western uttar pradesh and jammu kashmir state the present results reveal that the previously unexplored parts of the country particularly for non monsoon seasons have experienced a significant change in rainfall occurrence over the last six decades several rainfall scare regions in non monsoon seasons exhibit a significant decline in rainfall occurrence over 1951 2015 the decline over these regions would have a greater negative impact on agriculture as a significant length of annual cropping period coincides with non monsoon months the uncertainties associated with observational datasets characterized by varying rainfall stations data gaps post processing methods etc is a major concern in decision making process as it often leads to dry bias in monsoonal precipitation and incorrect representation of trends singh et al 2019 to ascertain the homogeneity of trend patterns across different observational dataset we also performed the analysis on 1 gridded dataset developed with fixed number of stations by rajeevan et al 2006 for the same period as shown in fig s2 results show that the trend patterns from both the datasets are fairly consistent over almost entire country except for jammu kashmir region north himalayas over northeast parts of jammu kashmir the rainy days from 0 25 dataset exhibit significant increase while rainy days from 1 dataset represent a significant decline for all the season in addition postmonsoon rainfall occurrence in nw zone shows a decrease from 0 25 dataset whereas an increase from 1 dataset although the trends are not statistically significant in both the cases the observed inconsistency in trends over north himalayas is attributable to the scarcity of rain gauge stations in the region the documentation of the datasets reveals that 0 25 dataset pai et al 2014 considered a fair number of stations over southwest parts of jammu kashmir that are apparently absent in 1 dataset rajeevan et al 2006 whereas there are no rainfall stations available over northeast parts of jammu kashmir in both the datasets the adequacy of 0 25 dataset also is reflected in the trend results as positive trends observed over northwest himalayas are consistent with the patterns suggested in several past studies kamil et al 2019 krishnan et al 2019 yadav et al 2010 therefore the results for northwest himalayas from 0 25 dataset are acceptable more so for the southwest region of jammu kashmir and along the foothills of north himalayas however care should be taken while adopting the results reported for north himalayas particularly over northeast parts of the region the trend patterns in rest of the country are fairly consistent in both datasets which indicates that varying stations have no apparent implication over the test results in addition 0 25 dataset have used considerably larger number of stations than 1 dataset rajeevan et al 2006 thus it is more appropriate dataset for different analyses on rainfall 3 5 trends in frequency of rainfall events from different intensity classes the seasonal count of rainy days in previous section encompasses the entire range of rainfall events with the intensity above and equal to 1 mm day 1 the rainy days of different intensity classes may have varying influence on different hydrologic components for example light rains modulate the surface soil moisture content and the surface runoff response whereas moderate and heavy rainfall events impact the regional water resources surface and groundwater reserves and agricultural production the extreme rainfall events on the other hand are primarily associated with flooding that causes huge social economic losses loss of human lives and extensive damage to crops every year in different parts of the world including india roxy et al 2017 hence it will be of paramount importance to know whether the trends observed in seasonal count of rainy days covers the entire range of rainfall intensities or confined to a given class here long term trends are also examined in rainfall events of different rainfall intensity classes the estimated threshold of rainfall intensity corresponding to selected percentiles 25th 50th 75th 95th and 99th for different seasons is shown in fig s3 also the fraction of total seasonal rainy days in different rainfall classes is presented in fig s4 fig 5 shows the trend in rainy days of six rainfall intensity classes for different seasons in india during 1951 2015 fig 6 shows the percent of grids with significant positive blue and negative red trends in rainy days for different rainfall classes in the premonsoon season the significant positive trends in nw zone are mainly observed in light moderate moderate heavy and heavy rainfall events covering 10 14 of the zone in each class fig 5a e i m the observed trends in either class are not field significant at regional scale fig 6a e i m the increasing trends in hr zone are evident in moderate moderate heavy heavy and very heavy rainfall events fig 5e i m q u among these classes trends in moderate heavy 24 heavy 26 and very heavy 24 rainy days are field significant fig 6e i m q u contrarily the occurrence of moderate moderate heavy and heavy rainfall events in premonsoon season has significantly declined over 14 16 and 12 grids in wc zone respectively it has collectively resulted in field significant decline in premonsoon rainy days over wc zone note that the threshold rainfall intensity for very heavy and extremely heavy events for premonsoon season lies in the range 0 75 mm day 1 and 0 150 mm day 1 respectively fig s3 consecutive events of such intensity hold the potential to cause large scale flooding or waterlogging in a region further the premonsoon season overlaps with the harvesting period of rabi october to april crops and sowing preparation period of kharif crops multiple consecutive extreme rainfall events can break wreaking havoc on standing crops in rabi season leading to a deficit in overall crop production and huge economic loss to the farmers as well as the country sinha et al 2019 such events may also adversely affect the nurseries of paddy crops prepared for the kharif season thus it is important to understand the long term tendency of extreme rainfall events in premonsoon season particularly in the context of its possible agricultural impact in the results the statistically significant trends in extreme very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall events in premonsoon season exhibit dispersed patterns over majority of the country excluding hilly regions fig 5q u a significant positive trend in very heavy and extremely heavy events can be seen dispersed over southern parts of cne and wc zone including orrisa telangana and northern karnataka state and northern parts of nw zone covering northern rajasthan an increase in extreme rainfall events is also observed at scattered grid points over the peninsular region the extremely heavy rainfall events are also found to be significantly increased over southern coastal parts of the kutch region in gujarat state fig 5u this rise in extreme events indicates an increased susceptibility of frequent extreme rainfall events in these regions during premonsoon season it also highlights the increasing risk of crop damage failure due to extreme rainfall resulting in severe crop production deficit particularly in agriculture dominant regions including south central southeastern and northwest parts of the country on the contrary a few locations in central wc and western cne zone depict significant reduction in extreme rainfall events very heavy and extremely heavy a significant decline in very heavy rainfall events is also observed at scattered grid points along western coastline of south india during the premonsoon months especially in april and may the northeast region of india experiences considerable thunderstorm activities that cause heavy rainfall events before the onset of monsoon goswami et al 2010 mahanta et al 2013 trends of extreme rainfall events in this region is of particular importance as these events are directly associated with flash floods that cause serious damage to crops livestock property and human lives mahanta et al 2013 in the study we found significant decline in very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall events over nagaland and eastern parts of assam state whereas significant increase over meghalaya and manipur state in the ne zone fig 5q u these results highlight a possible reduction increase in susceptibility of the region with a negative positive trend to devastating floods and associated damage the trend analysis results for monsoon season show a vast coverage of significant decline in total seasonal count of rainy days analysis of different rainfall intensity classes reveals that the widespread decline in monsoon rainy days is mainly experienced in light to heavy rainfall events 95th percentile with field significant trends over cne ne and wc zone in all four rainfall classes fig 5b f j n fig 6b f j n these events correspond to approximately 5 20 mm day 1 in light rainfall class to as high as 100 200 mm day 1 in heavy rainfall class fig s3 the rainfall events of such magnitude have substantial influence over key hydrologic parameters such as soil moisture evapotranspiration relative humidity and surface and groundwater reserves of a region a long term decline in moderate to heavy rainfall events at a large scale can cause a deficit in soil moisture and groundwater reserves at river basin to country scale meanwhile the results for hr zone differ from the other regions as significant increase in monsoon rainy days over eastern jammu kashmir is found confined to moderate heavy heavy and very heavy rainfall events with field significant trends in all three classes fig 5j n r though the fraction distribution of seasonal rainy days among different rainfall classes for this region is comparable to the rest of the country fig s4 the increase in moderate heavy to very heavy rainfall events is considerably large resulting in significant increasing trend in the overall count for the season the trends in extreme rainfall events of monsoon season are of particular importance for planners and policymakers in agriculture and flood management extreme rainfall events in monsoon season typically range between 100 and 200 mm day 1 and are directly associated with catastrophic floods in several parts of the country almost every year fig s3 following the threshold adopted in a large number of past studies and to enable comparison with their results we have selected 95th and 99th percentiles of long term term daily rainfall as thresholds for extreme rainfall in the results we found significant rise in the number of extremely heavy above 99th percentile rainfall events over central east india covering southern parts of orrisa and chhattisgarh state western regions of southern coastline in gujarat state kutch region northern parts of uttarakhand and eastern parts of jammu kashmir state in north india fig 5v staggered increasing patterns in extremely heavy events are also observed in wc zone and southern parts of rajasthan state in the nw zone fig 5v on the contrary extreme rainfall events have significantly declined over parts of western uttar pradesh and eastern arunachal pradesh in northeast india these regions also exhibit significant decline in very heavy rainfall events of monsoon season fig 5r a reduction in extremely heavy and heavy rainfall events in western uttar pradesh implies reduced risk of flooding and water logging particularly in urban landscapes of the region and reduced risk of damage to kharif crops a significant increase in very heavy rainy days is observed over eastern jammu kashmir and northern parts of uttarakhand fig 5r rainfall events in very heavy class lie between 50 and 100 mm day 1 that can damage crops or cause flooding if multiple such events occur in succession consistent with our results a significant decline in moderate to heavy rainfall events 95th percentile over central and north central india is reported in several past works dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2006 however majority of these studies dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 goswami et al 2006 have considered spatially averaged rainfall over large spatial domains rectangular box or homogeneous rainfall zones and failed to capture the regional variations in trend patterns as observed in the present results the trends of extreme rainfall events in the present results are highly inconsistent with the patterns reported in past works our results show a considerable variation in spatial patterns of trends within the zones that are considered homogeneous in few previous studies dash et al 2009 moreover the trend patterns in early studies with spatially distributed analysis are also found incoherent with the present results ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 the difference in study period up to early 2000s and dataset 1 resolution can be the possible cause of discrepancy in trend from these studies the discrepancy in results also indicates that the trend patterns of extreme rainfall in monsoon season have undergone a significant change over the recent two decades in a recent study vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 employing 0 25 resolution gridded rainfall record until 2015 the spatial distribution of trend in frequency of extreme rainfall fairly agrees with the present results over several regions except for central northeast and eastern regions of the country the study suggests a decline over central northeast and an increase over eastern region while no significant trend is evident over these regions in the present work the deviation in the results is possibly because the study defined extreme rainfall events as exceedances of 90th percentile of long term daily rainfall the extreme rainfall events over northeast india during monsoon season are largely associated with flash floods and large scale flooding in the region thus pose a major threat to agriculture and human lives in the premonsoon months april and may extreme events occur as isolated thunderstorms whereas in monsoon season they occur in conjunction with the monsoon synoptic events goswami et al 2010 mahanta et al 2013 further extreme rainfall events experienced in the monsoon season are much higher than the premonsoon season goswami et al 2010 thus the understanding of their behaviour in monsoon season is more crucial here we found a significant decline in extreme rainfall events over eastern parts of north india whereas a few locations in southern parts represent an increase in extreme events fig 5r v these results are in uniformity with the trends reported in previous studies goswami et al 2010 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 even though different thresholds 90th 99th percentile or 150 mm day 1 were selected for defining the extremes the postmonsoon or northeast monsoon season serves as the primary rainfall season for south peninsular india constituting about 40 60 of total annual rainfall rajeevan et al 2012 a majority of rainfall in the season is contributed by moderate 25 50th percentile and moderate heavy 50 75th percentile rainfall events the rainfall in postmonsoon season influences both kharif and rabi crops as initial october november months of the season overlap with the harvesting period of kharif crops whereas sowing preparation of rabi crops begins in the later november december months of the season over large parts of the country in addition postmonsoon rainfall feeds the primary crop season rabi crops of the peninsular region thus holds considerable importance to its socio economic equilibrium results show that the significant decrease in the frequency of rainfall events over ne zone is confined to moderate and moderate heavy classes whereas the decline over northeast region of hr zone is evident in heavy rainfall events fig 5c g k o s the trends are found field significant in ne zone for both rainfall classes fig 6c g k o s the heavy and very heavy events represent significant decline over uttarakhand state in hr zone and northwest parts of uttar pradesh among which the decline in heavy rainfall events is field significant for hr zone fig 5o s fig 6o s the extremely heavy events of postmonsoon season with catastrophic potential experienced a significant decline over central and northern parts of nw zone and western parts of uttar pradesh fig 5w in addition southern parts of the peninsular region covering kerala state have experienced a significant increase in extremely heavy rainfall events overall most of the country except for northeast india and few areas in north india exhibit widely staggered trend patterns in light moderate and moderate heavy rainfall events with no definitive structure owing to its importance for the region the available studies nageswararao et al 2019 naidu et al 2012 had only considered south peninsular india pr zone to examine rainfall occurrence in the postmonsoon season naidu et al 2012 analyzed the difference in mean frequency of rainfall events between pre global warming 1951 1969 and the global warming 1970 2008 period from different rainfall classes the study suggested an increase in the frequency of 0 20 mm 60 100 mm and 100 mm rainy days whereas a decrease in 20 60 mm rainy days in the later period in different parts of peninsular region though no evidence of such change can be traced in the present work where apart from extremely heavy events no considerable trends are obtained in any other rainfall class nageswararao et al 2019 reported significant positive trend in extremely heavy 244 5 mm rainy days aggregated over pr zone and light 0 1 7 5 mm rainy days over southern interiors of karnataka state the trends are marginally similar to the patterns observed in the present study as the increase in extremely heavy events is only evident over some parts of peninsular india instead of the entire region also the increasing trends of light rainfall events are highly staggered to draw any affirmative conclusions unlike other seasons winter season shows few interesting results for trends in rainy days of different intensity classes while the total count of rainy days in winter season represents negligible coverage of negative trend in all the hmzs rainy days in light to heavy rainfall classes are found to exhibit significant decline over considerable fraction of cne ne and hr zone fig 5d h l p t fig 6d h l p t the decline for all these classes is most evident over eastern uttar pradesh and bihar in cne uttarakhand himachal pradesh and western regions of jammu and kashmir in hr zone and eastern parts of ne zone fig 5d h l p t moreover the declining trends in ne and hr zone are field significant for light to heavy rainfall events fig 6d h l p t with further exploration we found that the majority of grid points exhibiting a significant decrease in one rainfall class in an hmz are representing either the same but insignificant or opposite trend in other classes for example out of all grids with significant negative trends in light rainy days in hr zone only 30 45 represents a significant decline in other moderate to extremely heavy rainfall classes also 40 45 of these grid points show significant increase in heavy and very heavy class collectively these contrasting patterns get neutralized resulting in statistically insignificant trend in total count of rainy days for the season over most of the grid locations in hr zone similar behavior is also observed in other zones which explains the cause of the discrepancy in trend results for the collective count and count in different classes on the other hand the field significant increase observed in winter rainy days over hr zone is limited to heavy and very heavy rainfall classes fig 5p t fig 6p t also the increasing trends of winter rainy days in peninsular region pr zone are mainly evident in extremely heavy rainfall events fig 5x nageswararao et al 2016 examined the frequency of winter rainfall events only over northwest india in four rainfall classes light 1 5 mm moderate 5 10 mm heavy 10 15 mm and very heavy 15 mm at subdivisional scale and the region as a whole the study suggests a rise in frequency of all types of rainfall events over jammu kashmir region statistically significant for heavy and very heavy events in our results however the increase is evident over eastern parts of jammu kashmir for heavy and very heavy rainfall events whereas rainfall events in other classes show significant decline over western parts of the region the trend patterns reported in the remaining subdivisions of northwest india are also inconsistent with the present results even with the use of same dataset and similar study period the effect of aggregating rainfall over a large region on trend estimates is evident in the study result these results suggest that the trends observed in seasonal count of rainy days are not present in the entire range of rainfall events but are rather confined to specific class es of rainfall intensity on a broader perspective it can be stated that for premonsoon monsoon and postmonsoon season the significant trends rise or decline in rainy days are mainly evident in light to heavy rainfall events in all the hmzs except for hr zone in the hr zone the significant trends are found confined in moderate to very heavy rainfall events the results are remarkably different for winter season in which rainy days in different rainfall classes exhibit field significant negative trend over large parts of the country while no significant trend is evident in the total count for the season the positive trends in winter rainy days however are confined to high intensity classes in which trends in hr zone are observed in heavy and very heavy class and trends in pr zone are mainly evident in the extremely heavy class it should also be noted here that the rainfall occurrence over eastern parts of jammu and kashmir exhibits significant increase in all the seasons whereas the same region exhibits significant decline in rainfall occurrence when analysed with 1 dataset the lack of rainfall stations in the region can be a primary cause of the observed discrepancy in trend results multiple past works have reported an increase in precipitation events over northwest himalayas in the recent decades which supports the adequacy of trend patterns obtained from 0 25 dataset pai et al 2014 3 6 time propagation of trends in rainy days a long term analysis performed by considering the entire study period does not capture the temporal variation in trends over the years the above analyses represent the most recent coverage of trends in the count of rainy days the time propagation of fractional area exhibiting significant trend in each hmz is examined to check whether the current state persisted in the preceding years the analysis is performed by computing trends for an expanding time window starting from 1951 to 1980 30 years and adding a year in each succession till the year 2015 the fractional area as a percent of grids with significant trend negative or positive in rainy days is obtained in each succession for all hmzs in different seasons fig 7 shows an 11 year running mean of the fractional area with significant negative red and positive blue trend in each hmz from 1981 to 2015 in the premonsoon season the spatial extent of both positive and negative trends remained consistent in all the zones except for hr zone with slight variations over the years fig 7a e i m q u the hr zone shows large variations where the fractional area with positive trend increased from about 30 in 1981 to 50 in 1990 followed by a constant decline from 2000 until the latest year reaching about 25 fig 7q the extent of negative trend on the other hand shows a rapid increase post 2000 reaching about 18 in 2015 for monsoon season the extent of negative trend in nw zone increased from about 8 in 1981 to 22 in 2004 which later reduced to 10 in 2015 fig 7b negative trends in cne zone show a consistent spread over the entire period with 10 in 1981 to about 30 in 2015 fig 7f both nw and cne zones show marginal variation in area exhibiting an increase in rainy days during monsoon season fig 7b f in the ne zone the spatial coverage of significant trends changed rapidly post 2000 in which the extent of negative trends has increased whereas the extent of positive trends has reduced fig 7j a considerable increase in fractional area with negative trend in monsoon rainy days is also observed in wc zone from about 15 in 1981 to 35 in 2015 fig 7n with minor changes over the years the coverage of both negative and positive trend in hr zone remained more or less consistent during monsoon season fig 7r a considerable variation in the extent of significant trend in the postmonsoon season can be seen in ne and hr zone fig 7k s both the zones experienced a significant rise in area representing negative trend post 1990 in contrast area exhibiting positive trend has considerably reduced in hr zone post 1990 whereas no notable change can be seen in the ne zone the remaining zones show only a marginal variation during postmonsoon season in the winter season fractional coverage of positive trend has considerably reduced in hr zone from about 45 in 25 during 1981 2015 fig 7t conversely the coverage of increase in rainy days has increased in pr zone from 5 to about 20 fig 7x it is worthy to note that the rainfall occurrence over a large part of the country experienced a distinct transition after 2000 especially in the monsoon season in these regions either there is an increase in spatial coverage of negative trends or decrease in coverage of positive trends in rainy days in other words a deficit in rainy days has consistently spread over vast areas post 2000 more prominently in the monsoon season also the rapid increase in spatial coverage of decline in monsoon rainy days is mainly evident in the cne zone the region that has witnessed a severe soil moisture drought in recent years mishra 2020 mishra et al 2016 a progressive decline in monsoon rainfall events over the last one and half decades may have caused a deficit in soil moisture resulting in soil moisture drought in the region it indicates a potential linkage between soil moisture deficit and decline in rainfall occurrence over the indian subcontinent that needs further exploration 3 7 change in distribution of rainy days in addition to long term trends we also explored the change in the distribution of seasonal count of rainy days in each hmzs for different seasons the empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs of rainy days in each season are compared for two halves of the study period 1951 1982 and 1983 2015 ecdfs are estimated by combining seasonal count of rainy days at all grid points falling in a given hmz over a defined period 1951 1982 or 1983 2015 fig 8 represents a comparison of ecdf of rainy days between two halves of the study period in each hmz for different seasons results show a statistically significant change in ecdfs of rainy days over two periods in all hmzs for all the seasons however the nature of departure in distribution is inconsistent in different hmzs a notable change in distribution among all the cases can only be seen in wc zone for monsoon season fig 8n and hr zone for premonsoon and monsoon season fig 8q r the monsoon rainy days in wc zone show a decrease in seasonal count across the entire range of cumulative probabilities in the latter half 1983 2015 of the study period fig 8n in contrast the seasonal count of rainy days in hr zone has increased in the latter half for both premonsoon and monsoon season though not uniformly over different cumulative probabilities fig 8q r the increase in both the seasons is confined between 0 1 and 0 5 quantiles as shown by rightward bulging of ecfd in the latter period it implies an increase in concentration of seasonal count of rainy days between 10 and 30 in premonsoon season and 10 50 in monsoon season in other seasons change observed in ecdfs for different hmzs is marginal but statistically significant at 5 significance level the count of premonsoon rainy days has increased in nw cne and ne zone whereas decreased in wc and pr zone in monsoon season the entire range of quantiles exhibits a reduction in all the zones except for hr and pr a reduction in quantiles is also observed in all the zones for postmonsoon season lastly winter rainy days exhibit varying nature of change in quantiles with marginal increase in nw ne and pr zone and reduction in cne and wc zone in addition to the change in distribution we also examined the change in two key statistics i e mean and standard deviation of rainy days between two halves of the study period at individual grid points in each season fig 9 represents a summary of percent of grid points with significant change in mean and standard deviation in different hmzs evidently the largest coverage of significant change in mean rainy days is evident in hr zone for all the seasons fig 9a more than 50 of grids in monsoon and 40 in premonsoon season show significant change in the mean count of rainy days for hr zone though the nature of change is not consistent across different seasons in which premonsoon monsoon and winter season mainly show an increase while postmonsoon season shows a decrease in rainy days a significant change in mean rainy days over a considerable fraction of grids can also be seen in cne ne wc and pr zone particularly in the monsoon season a significant change is observed over about 30 40 of grids in these zones cne ne and wc zone in addition experienced a reduction in rainy days while grids in pr zone exhibit both increase and decrease in almost equal proportion the reduction in cne wc and pr zone may have substantial implications as these regions are characterized by extensive agricultural practices further the rainy days in pr zone have experienced a significant change in variance particularly in winter 25 30 season fig 9b monsoon rainy days show a substantial coverage of change in variance over ne 15 96 hr 24 06 and pr 15 73 zone in addition a significant change in variance is observed over hr zone in premonsoon 28 44 and winter 16 25 season a significant increase in variance indicates a flatter distribution of rainy days count whereas a decrease in variance denotes a more concentrated distribution in the latter half of the study period an increase in variance can have an adverse impact on agriculture as an increase in year to year variations in rainfall events would disturb the crop irrigation it would also add to the uncertainty in future predictions if not adequately incorporated in climate models 3 8 possible atmospheric forcing to observed trends several studies have documented a significant decline in summer monsoon rainfall over central and northcentral india in the latter half of 20th century mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 multiple factors are suggested to be responsible for the observed decline including increase in the frequency of el niño episodes under global sst warming roxy et al 2014 warming of western indian ocean causing a reduction in tropospheric thermal contrast roxy et al 2015 warming of southern indian ocean resulting in weakened meridional sst gradient rao et al 2010 land use land cover change paul et al 2016 irrigation shukla et al 2014 and increased aerosol content patil et al 2018 besides these external forcing the decadal scale phase transition of pdo and its association with ism is also suggested to be responsible for drying trend in rainfall over india krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 in addition the changes in internal forcing such as extended break spells during warm phase of enso result in decline of seasonal rainfall which in turn contributes to the overall decline in monsoon rainfall the observed declining trends in monsoon rainfall are not spatially and temporally consistent the decline in monsoon rainfall is mainly evident over central and northcentral region whereas peninsular india western himalayan region and parts of northeast india show an increase in rainfall in addition few recent studies have highlighted a revival in monsoon precipitation exhibiting positive trend after 2000 jin and wang 2017 this increase is attributed to the rapid land surface warming over south asia against the tropical indian ocean warming in the recent years it has enhanced the meridional tropospheric temperature gradient in the lower troposphere which in turn caused stronger hadley circulations jin and wang 2017 roxy 2017 observational evidences also suggest a prominent role of decadal evolution of pdo phases in successive decline negative pdo and increase positive pdo in monsoon rainfall over the last half century huang et al 2020 salzmann and cherian 2015 the trends in monsoon rainfall are also not consistent over the entire distribution of rainfall events in the present study we found a significant decline in the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall events 10 100 mm day or 75th 95th percentile over most parts of the country on the contrary both frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events 100 mm day or 95th percentile exhibits an increase across much of the indian subcontinent except for east central and north india that show a decline the observed inconsistency in trends of different rainfall events is also supported by the significant increase observed in the variability of monsoon rainfall ghosh et al 2012 the increase in rainfall variability is attributed to the enhanced moisture convergence over north indian ocean caused by increased relative humidity due to indian ocean warming and increased amplitude of poleward propagating intraseasonal oscillations originating in the equatorial indian ocean sabeerali et al 2014 singh et al 2014 several factors including weakening of large scale monsoon circulations accompanied by a decrease in frequency of low frequency components of synoptic scale disturbances e g monsoon depressions dash et al 2004 rajeevan et al 2000 and extended duration of monsoon break spells in the warmer climate after 1970s singh et al 2014 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 are found responsible for the decline in moderate to heavy rainfall events on the other hand the increase in extreme rainfall events is associated with increase in short duration active spells that are linked to an increase in high frequency components of low pressure systems lps e g monsoon lows against a corresponding decline in low frequency lps monsoon depressions in the bay of bengal ajayamohan et al 2010 pai et al 2016 roxy et al 2017 explained that the enhanced supply of moisture advection from arabian sea by monsoon westerlies are possibly associated with the observed increase in monsoon lows few studies also advocated for an association of increase in extreme events with the strengthening of iod ism relationship in the recent decades where an increase in positive iods were accompanied by frequent extreme events ajayamohan and rao 2008 krishnaswamy et al 2015 an enhanced moisture convergence from arabian sea driven by stronger southerly winds causing a transient westerly trough is linked to the increase in extreme precipitation over north india covering western himalayan region priya et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 suggested a partial influence of rise in dew point temperature in response to positive clausius clapeyron scaling in the increase in extreme rainfall over peninsular india the winter season in southwest asia november april overlaps with the postmonsoon winter and premonsoon seasons in the indian subcontinent the northwest himalayas share the climate regime of southwest asia and wds serves as the primary source of precipitation in the region during non monsoon seasons enso represents a strong influence on interannual variability in wds and the relationship has further intensified in the recent decades causing an increased interannual variability kamil et al 2019 yadav et al 2010 in the backdrop of increased frequency of warm enso phases in recent decades intensified wds can be associated with the increased in the occurrence of storms events in northwest himalayas yadav et al 2010 also the winter atmospheric circulations over the south and central india exhibit baroclinic response to western pacific cooling during positive enso phase with low level anticyclonic and upper level cyclonic circulations it indicates a possible association between observed increase in occurrence of extreme winter precipitation over south peninsular india and frequent warm enso episodes in the recent decades yadav et al 2010 the upper level cyclonic anomalies during warm enso phases can be responsible for the significant increasing trend observed in frequency of extreme rainfall events over south peninsular india in winter season sanap et al 2019 have demonstrated a strong association between extreme rainfall events in postmonsoon season and strong el niño events strong el niño supports an intensified easterly wave that enhances the transport of synoptic scale systems depressions and cyclonic activities from bob to south peninsular region during el niño years strong west east sst gradient persist between southwest bob and tropical western pacific ocean that favours an enhanced easterly wave it indicates a possible linkage between significant increase observed in extreme rainfall events in postmonsoon over peninsular india and frequent episodes of warm enso in the recent years although consistent efforts are being made by the researchers to identify the underlying mechanism for changes in rainfall over the indian subcontinent several facets of rainfall in different seasons still remain unexplained 3 9 possible response to future climate the future projections from coupled general circulation models gcms suggest an increase in global mean precipitation and a weakening of global scale circulations in the warmer climate allen and ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 however model outputs for south asian summer monsoon are characterized with large uncertainties owing to the poor representation of subseasonal variability its interaction with low frequency modes of variability and dynamic feedbacks within tropical indo pacific region turner and annamalai 2012 despite of the inherent uncertainties gcm projections from different generations of coupled model intercomparison project cmip i e cmip3 to cmip6 show a general agreement on an increase in future south asian monsoon rainfall aadhar and mishra 2020 almazroui et al 2020 lee and wang 2014 cmip6 models also project a widespread increase in winter precipitation over south asia during the 21st century almazroui et al 2020 contrary to the recent increase in drought frequency over the indian subcontinent mishra et al 2016 cmip6 model ensembles project a decrease in frequency of droughts over south asia aadhar and mishra 2020 whereas the gcms with less bias for south asian monsoon suggested an increase in drought frequency under the future climate aadhar and mishra 2020 chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the output from a majority of cmip5 models shows an increase in daily rainfall variability in monsoon season over the 21st century that result from an increase in intensity of heavy rainfall events and simultaneous decline in low rainfall events sharmila et al 2015 singh et al 2019 following the current patterns in rainfall occurrence cmip3 and cmip5 models suggest an increase in rainfall intensity and decrease in number of rainy days resulting in higher total precipitation over a reduced number of wet days sabeerali and ajayamohan 2018 turner and slingo 2009 at intraseasonal time scale patterns of wetter active spells and drier break spells could be seen in a few modelling studies mandke et al 2007 sharmila et al 2015 the projections for extreme rainfall events from different models exhibit large discrepancy few cmip5 models and variable resolution model outputs exhibit an increase in extreme rainfall intensity over central india in the 21st century mukherjee et al 2018 shashikanth et al 2017 whereas high resolution model simulations suggest a decrease in the frequency of heavy rainfall over central india and increase over central north and south india sandeep et al 2018 these differences in model projections are largely because of the inability of the gcms to capture the genesis and dynamics of monsoon depressions owing to coarse resolutions of state of the art global models stowasser et al 2009 turner and annamalai 2012 only a small number of gcms in improved cmip5 and cmip6 ensemble of models show the ability to simulate the synoptic scale features of south asian monsoon such as lps and the dynamics of subseasonal processes ashfaq et al 2017 the model limitations are attributed to their inability to represent monsoon interaction with regional topography biases due to intraseasonal variability and poor characterization of thermodynamic interaction in indo pacific region ashfaq et al 2017 jin and wang 2017 it suggests a large scope of investigations for improved understanding of subseasonal variability and regional scale lps associated with south asian monsoon and their improved characterization in gcms multiple past works utilizing high resolution regional climate models rcm show an agreement on projected increase in mean postmonsoon northeast monsoon rainfall over south peninsular india with observable differences for extreme rainfall characteristics under warming climate scenario jayasankar et al 2021 rao et al 2020 while some studies reported an increase in both intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall jayasankar et al 2021 lakshmi et al 2021 a few other suggested a decline in intensity of extreme events and more deficit rainfall years in near future rao et al 2020 sannan et al 2020 rcm projections of precipitation for the himalayas indicate an increase in summer monsoon rainfall over northwest and southeast himalayas and a decline over central himalayas in future climate warming sanjay et al 2017 the winter projections reflect an increase over northwest himalayas and a decline over central and southeast himalayan regions although the model simulations show relatively poor confidence for northwest and central himalayas during summer monsoon and northwest and southeast himalayas for winter season regional scale projections also show an increase in future precipitation over upper indus basin falling in the northwest himalayas dimri et al 2019 in addition the future projections of precipitation over northeast india show a considerable decline in winter season whereas minor changes for premonsoon increase and monsoon decrease season although these model simulations are characterized with large biases and uncertainties kumar and dimri 2017 note that the model simulations for himalayan region under future climate scenario are typically characterized with large biases mainly owing to the poor representation of large topographic variability in the region and partially to the limited understanding of the dynamic interaction of regional circulations with the high topography dimri 2009 dimri et al 2013 mishra 2015 4 summary and conclusions the variability in rainfall occurrence controls key hydrologic components soil moisture evapotranspiration relative humidity etc that can directly impact the rainfed agriculture and indirectly impact the groundwater consumption in groundwater fed agriculture yet it remains the least explored aspect among all the key characteristics intensity duration frequency and magnitude of rainfall in the existing literature over the indian subcontinent the available studies are further inconsistent with several fundamental assumptions such as the spatial scale of analysis dataset used definition of threshold for rainfall classes study period analysis technique etc in addition the past research on rainfall occurrence in india has largely focused on monsoon season with special consideration to the frequency of extreme rainfall events the studies on non monsoon seasons on the other hand have only considered the regions with considerable rainfall in the respective seasons here we attempt to bridge these gaps by adopting uniform criteria of analysis across all the seasons and a robust change detection method for assessing spatially distributed patterns in the frequency of rainfall events across the country in the results we find large spatial variations in the annual climatology of rainy days over entire india the monthly count of rainy days exhibit monsoon dominated seasonality similar to the well documented seasonality in rainfall magnitude the monthly distribution of rainy days further varies among different regions of the country where certain regions receive considerable rainfall in non monsoon months in addition to the monsoon season the seasonal count of rainy days also shows large spatial variations particularly in non monsoon seasons in which specific regions experience abundance of rainfall events while a majority of landmass remains considerably dry this spatial heterogeneity and seasonal scarcity in rainfall occurrence could be a major factor responsible for the mass shift from rainfed to groundwater fed agriculture especially in the backdrop of the green revolution and increased food demand over the last half century asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 further the long term time series of rainy days reveal prominent signal of inherent natural variability in rainfall occurrence monsoon rainy days predominantly exhibit interannual 5 10 years variability while non monsoon rainfall occurrence exhibit strong interdecadal 20 30 years to multidecadal 50 60 years over different hmzs however both long term 1901 2015 and recent 1951 2015 trends in rainfall occurrence over different zones have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability thus potentially attributable to warming climate or anthropogenic changes the primary focus of the present study is to examine spatially distributed trend in total count and count of rainy days in different rainfall classes for all the meteorological seasons in india during 1951 2015 our results show that the rainy days during monsoon season have significantly declined over major crop growing regions covering central northeast northeast and north central parts of the country these regions covering the indo gangetic plains have lately witnessed severe soil moisture drought during 2015 2018 which is the longest duration of all previous drought events over the last two centuries mishra 2020 mishra et al 2016 the decline in monsoon precipitation over gangetic plains and central northeast region since 1950 is suggested to be the primary cause of the recent droughts asoka et al 2017 mishra et al 2016 2012 roxy et al 2015 in the present results we found that the spatial coverage of the decline in rainfall occurrence is much wider than the decline in rainfall amount as reported in past studies mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 moreover the decline in monsoon rainy days is mainly observed in light to heavy rainfall 95th percentile events a recent study demonstrates that the lately observed decline in groundwater recharge in north india during monsoon season is primarily driven by moderate intensity 90th percentile precipitation asoka et al 2018 thus the combined influence of reduction in rainfall occurrence reflecting as enhanced abstraction and reduced groundwater recharge can be a potential factor responsible for groundwater depletion witnessed over north india in the last few decades asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 however the linkage of rainfall occurrence with soil moisture and groundwater variability in the indian subcontinent remains unexplored the decline in number of rainy days in conjunction with depleting groundwater reserves due to unsustainable groundwater pumping can pose a serious threat to the food security and economic well being of the country sahany et al 2018 therefore we emphasize the need to explore the linkage of rainfall occurrence with soil moisture and groundwater variability in future prospects to which the present findings would provide the necessary foundation furthermore the trend results for monsoon season in different rainfall classes reveal that the observed trends in the total count are rather present in specific class es of rainfall events this information is crucial as it suggests the nature of possible impact of the trend observed for different classes the light to moderate rainfall events can influence the soil moisture regional water resources and agriculture production whereas increase decrease in extreme rainfall events suggests a possible increase reduction in susceptibility to devastation floods and associated damage further it is intriguing to find that the trend patterns reported in majority of past studies substantially deviate from the present findings for all the seasons one of the major causes of discrepancy in the results in almost all the studies is the consideration of large scale averaged rainfall in the analysis that ignores the regional spatial variability in rainfall patterns in this study the observed trends in rainy days show substantial spatial heterogeneity for all the seasons the trends reported as field significant for an hmz do not cover the entire region and may even show contradictory patterns at few locations within the same zone this study provides substantial evidence in support of few past works ghosh et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2009 that advocated for the spatially distributed analysis of the rainfall characteristics the next crucial step in succession to present work would be to investigate the causal factors for observed trends in rainfall occurrence several factors influence the dynamics of rainfall characteristics in the india subcontinent such as large scale climate systems kripalani and kumar 2004 krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2016 nageswararao et al 2016 pal et al 2019 webster and yang 1992 warming sea surface temperatures ssts ashok et al 2001 roxy et al 2015 sahany et al 2018 land sea thermal gradient roxy et al 2015 and anthropogenic changes such as land cover change rapid urbanization irrigation increased aerosol concentration etc kedia et al 2016 paul et al 2018 exploring their role individual or combined in changing occurrence of rainfall over the country is an extensive task and falls beyond the scope of present work however the study provides an essential basis for examining the association between the aforementioned factors and the frequency of rainy days the present findings would also facilitate improved characterization and forecast of rainfall occurrence in the existing climate models carbone and tuttle 2008 pal et al 2019 we have also suggested the possible relationship of rainfall occurrence with major water related issues groundwater depletion and agricultural production responsible for extreme water stress in more than half of the country bhanja et al 2017 the study highlights a wide scope for investigating these relationships to improve our understanding of soil moisture and groundwater variability for sustainable water resources management and ensure food security in the country 5 data statement the data used in the study are publicly

4031,the time scales of a catchment hydrologic response in a human impacted intra apennine basin was assessed by a power spectral analysis turbidity and streamflow data at high resolution 10 min have been considered during four years the turbidity and streamflow have heavy tails that follow approximately pareto distributions both also display scaling fourier power spectra of the form f b over different scaling ranges from 10 min to one day for the turbidity and from 1 h to 20 days for the streamflow data for both locations the slope for the streamflow is close to b 1 7 whereas for turbidity the values b 1 68 and 2 25 are found for the upstream and downstream locations respectively the turbidity dataset at the downstream station has a steeper slope than the upstream station implying a higher persistence of the turbidity fluctuations this change of slope shows that the effect of the river channel and catchment is similar to a fractional integration from the upstream to the downstream data furthermore the delay times of the turbidity dataset and hence of suspended sediment were calculated using a co spectrum between the series and indicating characteristic transit times of 25 days and 145 days keywords suspended sediment transport spectral analysis scaling fractional integration delay time bilancino watershed italy 1 introduction suspended sediment transport is usually nonlinear complex and dynamic due to the influence of physical and chemical processes involved and the variability in space and time e g sivakumar 2002 however adequate knowledge of the sediment transport phenomenon in rivers is needed for studies of reservoir sedimentation and water erosion modeling as in the case of the bilancino reservoir our study catchment in europe the fine sediment production is estimated to be 1 800 106 t yr 1 with 540 106 t yr 1 stored in rivers floodplains 346 106 t yr 1 stored in reservoir 200 106 t yr 1 mined from fluvial active areas and 714 106 t yr 1 is deposited in lowland area and discharged into seas and oceans owens 2007 it is well known that more than 90 of fine sediment flux is carried out in less than 10 of time furthermore fine sediment is a major player in the transport of nutrients and contaminants with fluvial systems hence there is a need to understand sediment transport under unsteady conditions naden 2010 this paper studies measurements of suspended sediments in a small mountain torrents of an intra apennine forested catchment draining into bilancino reservoir florence italy pelacani 2016 has shown that highway construction has caused an 8 fold increase in fine suspended sediment load in an intra apennine watershed relative to a watershed only affected by natural landslides and agricultural activities these fine sediments might pollute the river or the lake it is important to define particle transit distances and times because they determine where the impact of pollutants will be concentrated however despite the importance of catchment travel time distributions for watershed hydrology and geochemistry they have rarely been quantified generally natural fluctuations of chloride concentrations or isotopes in rainfall and streamflow has been used to estimate travel times e g burns et al 1998 bonniwell et al 1999 nyberg et al 1999 kirchner et al 2001 furthermore many researchers have addressed the problem of selection of an appropriate delay time and proposed various methods such as the autocorrelation function method e g holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 the mutual information method fraser and swinney 1986 and the correlation integral method liebert and schuster 1989 one of the aims of this investigation is to characterize turbidity fluctuations at many different time scales for this the concentration of suspended solids were monitored at inlets and outlets of the watershed time series analysis box and jenkins 1974 has been largely applied in hydrology especially for forecasting and modelling e g bras and rodriguez iturbe 1993 spectral analyses are used in the present study to give a detailed interpretation of the scale dependent properties of the datasets in earth sciences

records schmitt et al 1995 wunsch 2003 the power spectrum was used by shang and kamae 2005 to investigate the presence of scaling or fractal nature in the sediment transport phenomenon results of this study indicate the existence of scaling behavior in the measured suspended sediment data collected over a period of 31 years at tongguan shanxi china furthermore sivakumar 2006 using five different methods ranging from mono fractal to multifractal analysis has investigated the presence of scaling behavior in the daily suspended sediment load data observed in the mississippi river basin at st louis missouri for a more recent work on the crossovers in the scaling behavior of turbidity we refer to schmitt et al 2008 using spectral analysis they found a stochastic small scale dynamics whereas for larger scales deterministic forcing are visible associated to the monthly and semi monthly lunar tides and to the inertia of the estuarine turbidity maximum etm moreover in the power spectra of the turbidity data they determined a scaling regime with a slope of 1 5 a water quality monitoring program has been initiated since 2006 in the bilancino watershed to evaluate any effect of land management changes due to a new road construction a total of seven continuously monitoring stations were established along the three impacted streams and its tributaries of bilancino watershed visible in fig 1 this paper examines how the statistics and dynamics of suspended sediment change between two sampling stations of the stura river belonging to the bilancino watershed the paper is organized as follows section 2 is dedicated to the material and methods first presentation of the study area second description of the power spectral and the cross spectral analyses used to calculate the delay time then the results of the analyses of the turbidity and streamflow for the impacted basin are reported in section 3 a discussion section contains interpretation of the results and their possible implications in sediment load dynamic models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bilancino watershed fig 1 30 km northwest of florence covers an area of about 150 km2 in the northern apennine of italy the altitude ranges from 225 to 1 094 m a s l the bilancino reservoir with a capacity of 84 106 m3 of water is the principal water supply for the city of florence the bilancino sub basin cover the north western pattern of the fluvio lacustrine mugello basin a 25 km long wnw ese trending depression that extends along the sieve river located in the northern tuscany the mugello basin evolution can be described as a two phase history with extensional tectonics superposed onto compressional structures numerous authors consider the mugello basins as grabens or half grabens developed in an extensional regime since the neogene coli 1990 martini and sagri 1993 martini et al 2001 balestrieri et al 2003 the mugello is representative of numerous other intra apennine basins developed during tectonic activity that affected the western part of the northern apennines between the upper miocene and the pleistocene sani et al 2009 the northeast margin of the bilancino watershed is underlain by palaeocene eocene calcareous turbidites and claystones with limestone and serpentinite blocks tectonically overlying early middle miocene sandstone and siltstone turbidites cipriani and malesani 1964 bruni and pandelli 1980 van de kamp and leake 1995 dinelli et al 1999 on the southwest margin of the basin oligocene early miocene calcareous and terrigenous coarse grained turbidite deposits are exposed the infilling of the basin occurred during the villafranchian period and the recent alluvial phase benvenuti 2003 the bilancino watershed is covered by 63 forest 16 is arable land and the remainder is under pasture in 2003 land use in parts of the basin changed due to the construction of a highway which involved major phases of earth moving the construction of tunnels overpasses and the build up of spoil heaps directly connected to the drainage network the sources of sediments are both diffusive sources and point sources the suspended load in the stura streams could be derived from bank erosion landslides or human activities however field observations and catchment monitoring programs suggest that the main source of sediments is the highway construction activities rather than bank erosion pelacani 2016 the landslides are principally located in the upper part of the basin actually more than 50 of these landslides are directly connected with the drainage network however it has been found that less suspended sediments derives from the headwater streams which is due to the presence of check dams furthermore the high surface roughness associated with wood coarse debris supplied by riparian vegetation and the stepped longitudinal profiles favors the deposition of clay sized sediments in the stura stream suspended sediment transport occurs under average rainfall conditions due to the remobilization of fine grained sediments that are stored in the stream bed pelacani 2016 for the investigated stream baseflow stages typically vary between 150 and 200 mm water depth whereas peak flow stages reach about 1000 1500 mm maximum flow velocities of 1 3 m s 1 have been recorded with a flow meter the mean annual discharge is about 3 2 m3 s 1 pelacani et al 2010 a general downstream coarsening of gravel bar material is evident along the middle and lower stura stream the sorting from very poorly sorted becomes moderately well sorted the median size d 50 of the bed material appears to depend on the presence of check dams it varies between 2 3 and 8 cm in gravel bars not affected by the check dams conversely the d 50 ranges between 3 5 and 6 6 cm in the portion of stream regulated by check dams furthermore the shape of the grain size distribution from negative skewed becomes symmetrical pelacani 2016 specifically the effect of the check dams imposes a symmetrical grain size distribution upon the bed materials 2 1 1 presentation of the data data used for this research were obtained from three monitoring stations located along the stura stream fig 1 table 1 the stura stream drains an area of 44 8 km2 underlain by claystones and sandstones and it is the principal tributary of the bilancino reservoir since 2006 a water quality monitoring program has been initiated in the bilancino watershed to evaluate any effect of land management changes due to a new road construction continuous monitoring of stream water depth turbidity ph dissolved oxygen conductivity and temperature was required to detect evolutions of the water quality criteria because of land use activities occurring over protracted periods a total of three continuously monitoring stations were established along the stura impacted stream by local and national agencies i in the upper part of the watershed casaglia station ii in the middle la ruzza station and iii in the lower part barberino station fig 1 stream water depth and turbidity were taken at 10 min resolution for the casaglia and barberino stations and 1 min resolution for la ruzza station fig 1 table 1 the turbidity sensor measures values between 0 and 3 000 ntu the time series used in this work are related to a construction period of the third line of a1 highway and covers a span of over three years portions of the turbidity time series for two monitoring stations are shown in figs 2 3 2 2 fourier power spectrum the internal dynamics of many complex natural systems are often investigated through the scaling properties of their time series behavior one of the classical ways to do this is to consider fourier power spectral analysis spectral density e f is a decomposition of the random signal into its various component frequencies per unit frequency it is estimated as the square modulus of the fourier transform x f computed assuming stationary fluctuations for the series x t bracewell 2000 bendat and piersol 2000 1 e f x f 2 the power spectrum can also be defined and estimated using the wiener khinchine theorem stating that it is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function within this approach noisy signals without any correlations for successive values have a flat horizontal spectrum e f is constant period forcing are visible with corresponding spikes in the spectrum and scaling regimes are associated with a power law behavior 2 e f c f b where means proportional to and b 0 is the spectral exponent correctly interpreting 1 f b random series requires determining their scaling exponents b which are generally estimated from the log log slopes of their fourier power spectra a value of b close to 5 3 is obtained for turbulent processes schmitt and huang 2016 let us note that certain deterministic iterated maps may produce also scaling power spectra of the form of equation 2 procaccia and schuster 1983 vyushin et al 2009 the presence of missing values in the underlying time series is a recurrent problem when dealing with observation databases since classical fourier numerical methods such as fast fourier transform fft need consecutive values some studies solve this problem by performing interpolation of missing values other methods involve using the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function here since we have rather long sequences without missing values there is no interpolation and the spectra are computed using the fft on consecutive portions of the series 2 3 cross spectral analysis the cross correlation function measures the dependence of the values of one signal on another signal bracewell 2000 bendat and piersol 2000 it is defined as follows let us consider two time series x t and y t for a time interval t the cross correlation function r xy t is 3 r xy t 1 σ x σ y x t x y t t y where is the averaging operator σ x and σy are the standard deviations of the time series x t and y t this approach represents the impulse response of the system and can be used to estimate some characteristic time delays between x and y as spikes in r xy t for example the sediment input at the headwater station and at the output station fourier cross spectral analysis corresponds to using the cross correlation in fourier space and is applied here to estimate transit times the cross spectrum sxy is the fourier transform of the cross correlation its real value the co spectrum can be estimated directly as 4 c xy f r e a l x f y f where means complex conjugate spikes in the co spectrum correspond to frequencies associated with the principal time delays between x and y for positive frequency it corresponds to a delay of y t with respect to x t series the coherency spectrum is the ratio of the modulus of the cross spectrum to the square root of the product of both spectra 5 r x y f s x y f e x f e y f for uncorrelated series the coherency spectrum goes to zero if x is proportional to y the coherency spectrum is 1 when the coherency spectrum is flat this may indicate that the covariation of both quantities is independent of scale and when it decreases it indicates that the relation between the two variables is less and less strong 2 4 probability density functions and exceedance probability function since the database considered contains more than 104 datapoints the probability density function of the fields studied can be estimated with good accuracy even for moderate extremes one way to perform this is to bin average and normalize the histogram of the values of the process studied it can be also done by considering the exceedance probability or peak over threshold f x prob x x which is written as follows in the framework of generalized pareto distributions pickands 1975 6 f x 1 kx σ 1 k where k 0 is the tail index and σ is the scale parameter to emphasize the probability of extremes log log plots are considered in case of linear behavior of the log log plot of the f x function for large values of x a power law tail is found this corresponds to fat tails and is a signature of intermittency corresponding to a field that can show quite large values even with relatively small sample size albeverio et al 2006 3 results 3 1 probability distributions the exceedance probability function has been estimated for the turbidity data for both barberino and casaglia stations they are shown in fig 4 with the superposition of a generalized pareto distribution fit highlights the tail of the distributions the part of the distribution representing large but rare events the tail index and scale parameter used for the fits are k 1 σ 8 for barberino station and k 0 92 σ 23 5 for casaglia station there are approximate power law tails more visible for casaglia station and a cutoff for the largest values in each case this is indicating a very intermittent process with heavy tails since the tail indices 1 k are small the exceedance probability function of the streamflow data at both locations has also been estimated fig 5 shows that the tails are also close to a power law with different exponents 4 2 for barberino and 9 2 for casaglia the range of measured turbidity values spans between 0 and 3000 turbidity units the median values have been estimated on a yearly basis they range from 19 3 to 57 10 for casaglia station and from 7 4 to 24 0 for barberino station they indicate a decrease in ntu values from those measured at the casaglia station which represents sediment input to the system to the values measured at the barberino station representing sediment output fig 6 moreover the spread around the average of turbidity values described by the standard deviation grows with time at the barberino lowland station table 2 conversely during the same interval the ntu values slightly decrease for the casaglia upstream station 3 2 power spectra and scaling ranges the timescales of catchment hydrologic response were evaluated using spectral methods that decompose the time series of streamflow and turbidity signals into their component wavelengths by comparing the spectral power density of the input of sediment at casaglia and output at barberino stations at each wavelength it is possible to determine how strongly the catchment attenuates hydrologic signals for each timescale the dynamics of dataset are illustrated in the figs 7 8 showing the power spectra in log log plots the scaling behavior of the turbidity at casaglia upstream monitoring station and barberino the downstream station are reported in fig 7 the two spectra are similar at low frequencies until a period of about one day for scales from 10 min and one day the power spectra at the two locations are both scaling with two different slopes 1 68 for casaglia and a steeper slope of 2 25 for barberino table 1 the daily cycle is visible as a spike for the casaglia station the streamflow data possess also scaling properties both series at casaglia and barberino stations display a scaling regime from about one hour to 20 days with the same slope close to 1 7 the daily cycle is visible as a spike in both spectra 3 3 delay times the delay time of the turbidity and hence of fine sediment transport were considered using the co spectrum it was calculated considering two monitoring stations along the stura stream casaglia station for the input of sediment and barberino station for the output fig 1 results from turbidity dataset of 2006 2008 82 914 data values show that there are three principal spikes fig 9 which represent the transit travel time from upstream to downstream 25 days 33 days and 145 days the inset of this figure shows the coherence spectrum between both locations upstream and downstream showing that for scales from 10 days to one day there is a global transition from perfect coherence to partial coherence and for scales smaller than one day the coherence is constant and does not seem to depend on scale 4 discussion river flows and associated sediment transport are intermittent processes possessing fluctuations over a large range of time scales we have considered in this study the statistics and the dynamics of streamflow and turbidity data by considering respectively the probability distribution function and the fourier power spectra and cross spectra the results obtained indicate large fluctuations with heavy tails and long range properties we discuss below both aspects figs 4 and 5 display the exceedance probability function or peak over threshold in log log plot the approximately linear shapes of the tails of these functions indicate that both series possess heavy tails albeverio et al 2006 characterized by extreme events much more frequent than what is found for a gaussian process the linear or quasi linear shape of these distribution functions in log log plot correspond to pareto distributions or general pareto distributions keylock 2005 it has been shown in previous studies that rainfall data have power law tails for extremes ladoy et al 1993 tessier et al 1996 schmitt et al 1998 pandey et al 1998 and the results found here for streamflow may be linked with this rainfall property the lower the value of the exponent p in equation 6 the more intermittent the process and the heavier the tail this indicates that the upstream station at casaglia is less intermittent than the downstream barberino station it seems that the effect of river channel between the two stations is the increase of the intermittency and the change of the power law exponent however turbidity data show that the effect is the opposite the exponent p is consistently slightly larger for the casaglia station compared to the barberino station it is also visible by comparing the values of this exponent that turbidity data are much more intermittent than streamflow data with a very low value of p varying between 1 68 and 3 86 analysis of the statistics including the distribution functions are done by neglecting time assuming stationarity and considering altogether all data in the time series the fourier spectral analysis is complementary to this analysis and provides information about the dynamics over many different time scales power law slopes in the fourier power spectrum indicate a lack of characteristic scale over the considered range of frequency and time scales mandelbrot 1967 mandelbrot and van ness 1968 the results obtained here and shown in figs 7 and 8 indicate that the turbidity data are scaling over a range of scales from 10 min to about one day whereas streamflow data have scaling over a larger range of scales from 1 h to 20 days a scale ratio of about 500 the streamflow large scaling range may be related to the general property of scaling in geosciences turcotte 1997 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 as well as scaling in the forcing from rainfall and climate lovejoy and schertzer 2017 lovejoy 2019 the value of the scaling exponent b 1 7 is not linked with a river flow turbulence which is at much smaller scales the runoff scaling properties associated with long memory in the underlying process could also result from the scaling properties of the river network mudelsee 2007 it is interesting to note that the scaling range of the sediment fluctuations is different from the streamflow series and of smaller largest scale one day versus 20 days on the one hand the fact that it is scaling indicates that the catchment and the river channel properties have not characteristic scale in the range going from small scales 10 min to the scale of one day on the other hand the smaller largest scale could be related to catchment properties it is visible in fig 7 that both power spectra in the upstream and downstream locations are similar with some random fluctuations at large scales from the yearly scale until the daily scale the spectra are clearly different at smaller scales from the daily scale to the smallest scales 10 min how such difference in turbidity spectral slopes can be interpreted since the streamflow spectral slopes are similar see fig 8 the change of slope from around 1 68 upstream to 2 25 downstream indicates that the effect of the stream development is like a fractional integration of the order of 2 25 1 68 2 0 28 fractional integration is nonlocal and corresponds to a convolution with a power law kernel such property is in global agreement with different studies proposing a theory of nonlocal sediment transport modelling benson et al 2000 schumer et al 2003 schumer et al 2009 schumer et al 2017 stark et al 2009 in these works heavy tail in the streamflow velocity is needed to justify the nonlocal transport modeling it mainly corresponds to the fact that solute transport has power law waiting times due to the heterogeneities in the channel bed the scaling irregularities in topography and the variations in velocity schumer et al 2009 aubenau et al 2015 the heavy tails that are visible in fig 5 here for the exceedance probability of the streamflow data at two different locations support this interpretation which of course needs to be further validated with more systematic measurements these finding are supported by the results obtained applying co spectral analysis showing that the time travel transit of the suspended sediment from upstream to downstream have several characteristic scales there are three principal spikes fig 9 that represents the time travel transit from upstream to downstream 25 days 1 33 days 2 and the last at 154 days these findings give the opportunity to determine the rate of migration of fine sediments through the stream channel stura is a high gradient stream and suspended fine particles travel downstream a distance of about 8 5 km at estimated velocities between 3 0 10 3 and 3 9 10 3 m s 1 to reach the bilancino output considering a mean flow velocity of 1 m s 1 fine particles move through the stura watershed in a series of steps of deposition and resuspension hence a particle may require many hydrographs to move down a river system in the time of 1 year on the one hand in the study area most of the sediment source are the spoil heaps directly connected to the drainage network the dissolution of low albite a sodium rich plagioclase feldspar mineral content in the olistostrome geology which is now exposed in places plays a dominant role to control the long term persistent fluctuations of hydrological data pelacani et al 2010 the impact on the water and sediment maintenance due to the different source of sediment diffusive source and point sources is visible in the two peaks 25 days and 33 days of the co spectrum whereas the peak in the co spectrum at 154 days is presumably related to seasonal flushing of fine sediment after convective storms the coherence spectrum inset of fig 9 shows that for scales from 10 days to one day there is a global transition from perfect coherence to partial coherence and that below the scale of one day there is no more scale dependence on the coherence of the fluctuations from upstream to downstream data the scaling properties in power spectra and the fractional integration from upstream to downstream are compatible with the idea of having long range memories in turbidity data the long memory property is important for modelling purposes involving linear autoregressive models fleming 2008 or nonlinear transfer models tessier et al 1996 pandey et al 1998 these results are in general agreement with the results of szolgayova et al 2014 who analyze the correlations of long range components of 39 mean daily river flow in europe showing that different catchment properties are correlated with the scaling exponent hence the results found in the present paper may depend on the geometry of the stream and their possible generalization will need comparisons with other similar datasets 5 conclusions in this paper spectral time series analysis techniques have been applied to suspended sediment data collected to the stura stream florence italy using fourier analysis we have seen that the turbidity dataset and streamflow display wide range scaling in time from 10 min to one day for the turbidity and from 1 h to 20 days for the streamflow data a co spectral analysis was performed to determine the times and distances of particle transits the main conclusions derived from this study are summarized below 1 turbidity and streamflow have heavy tails that follow pareto distributions or generalized pareto distributions with different exponents 2 turbidity and streamflow display scaling fourier power spectral over different scaling ranges from 10 min to one day for the turbidity and from 1 h to 20 days for the streamflow the large scaling range for the streamflow may be due to climate influence of rainfall and no characteristic scale in the catchment the smaller scaling range of the turbidity may be due to the river channel properties 3 the turbidity at the downstream station has a steeper slope b 2 25 than at the upstream station b 1 68 this may be the effect of non local properties of sediment transport and river channel heterogeneities leading to a fractional integration of order 0 3 4 the cross correlation analysis shows a delay time distribution of the turbidity and hence of sediments and it points out that sediments starting from casaglia input will travels to barberino output in circa 25 days and 154 days as a maximum future research will be concentrated on the scaling intermittency of the different series their multifractal properties using a moment based approach schmitt et al 1998 pandey et al 1998 zang and shang 2007 and hilbert spectral analysis method huang et

4031,the time scales of a catchment hydrologic response in a human impacted intra apennine basin was assessed by a power spectral analysis turbidity and streamflow data at high resolution 10 min have been considered during four years the turbidity and streamflow have heavy tails that follow approximately pareto distributions both also display scaling fourier power spectra of the form f b over different scaling ranges from 10 min to one day for the turbidity and from 1 h to 20 days for the streamflow data for both locations the slope for the streamflow is close to b 1 7 whereas for turbidity the values b 1 68 and 2 25 are found for the upstream and downstream locations respectively the turbidity dataset at the downstream station has a steeper slope than the upstream station implying a higher persistence of the turbidity fluctuations this change of slope shows that the effect of the river channel and catchment is similar to a fractional integration from the upstream to the downstream data furthermore the delay times of the turbidity dataset and hence of suspended sediment were calculated using a co spectrum between the series and indicating characteristic transit times of 25 days and 145 days keywords suspended sediment transport spectral analysis scaling fractional integration delay time bilancino watershed italy 1 introduction suspended sediment transport is usually nonlinear complex and dynamic due to the influence of physical and chemical processes involved and the variability in space and time e g sivakumar 2002 however adequate knowledge of the sediment transport phenomenon in rivers is needed for studies of reservoir sedimentation and water erosion modeling as in the case of the bilancino reservoir our study catchment in europe the fine sediment production is estimated to be 1 800 106 t yr 1 with 540 106 t yr 1 stored in rivers floodplains 346 106 t yr 1 stored in reservoir 200 106 t yr 1 mined from fluvial active areas and 714 106 t yr 1 is deposited in lowland area and discharged into seas and oceans owens 2007 it is well known that more than 90 of fine sediment flux is carried out in less than 10 of time furthermore fine sediment is a major player in the transport of nutrients and contaminants with fluvial systems hence there is a need to understand sediment transport under unsteady conditions naden 2010 this paper studies measurements of suspended sediments in a small mountain torrents of an intra apennine forested catchment draining into bilancino reservoir florence italy pelacani 2016 has shown that highway construction has caused an 8 fold increase in fine suspended sediment load in an intra apennine watershed relative to a watershed only affected by natural landslides and agricultural activities these fine sediments might pollute the river or the lake it is important to define particle transit distances and times because they determine where the impact of pollutants will be concentrated however despite the importance of catchment travel time distributions for watershed hydrology and geochemistry they have rarely been quantified generally natural fluctuations of chloride concentrations or isotopes in rainfall and streamflow has been used to estimate travel times e g burns et al 1998 bonniwell et al 1999 nyberg et al 1999 kirchner et al 2001 furthermore many researchers have addressed the problem of selection of an appropriate delay time and proposed various methods such as the autocorrelation function method e g holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 the mutual information method fraser and swinney 1986 and the correlation integral method liebert and schuster 1989 one of the aims of this investigation is to characterize turbidity fluctuations at many different time scales for this the concentration of suspended solids were monitored at inlets and outlets of the watershed time series analysis box and jenkins 1974 has been largely applied in hydrology especially for forecasting and modelling e g bras and rodriguez iturbe 1993 spectral analyses are used in the present study to give a detailed interpretation of the scale dependent properties of the datasets in earth sciences

records schmitt et al 1995 wunsch 2003 the power spectrum was used by shang and kamae 2005 to investigate the presence of scaling or fractal nature in the sediment transport phenomenon results of this study indicate the existence of scaling behavior in the measured suspended sediment data collected over a period of 31 years at tongguan shanxi china furthermore sivakumar 2006 using five different methods ranging from mono fractal to multifractal analysis has investigated the presence of scaling behavior in the daily suspended sediment load data observed in the mississippi river basin at st louis missouri for a more recent work on the crossovers in the scaling behavior of turbidity we refer to schmitt et al 2008 using spectral analysis they found a stochastic small scale dynamics whereas for larger scales deterministic forcing are visible associated to the monthly and semi monthly lunar tides and to the inertia of the estuarine turbidity maximum etm moreover in the power spectra of the turbidity data they determined a scaling regime with a slope of 1 5 a water quality monitoring program has been initiated since 2006 in the bilancino watershed to evaluate any effect of land management changes due to a new road construction a total of seven continuously monitoring stations were established along the three impacted streams and its tributaries of bilancino watershed visible in fig 1 this paper examines how the statistics and dynamics of suspended sediment change between two sampling stations of the stura river belonging to the bilancino watershed the paper is organized as follows section 2 is dedicated to the material and methods first presentation of the study area second description of the power spectral and the cross spectral analyses used to calculate the delay time then the results of the analyses of the turbidity and streamflow for the impacted basin are reported in section 3 a discussion section contains interpretation of the results and their possible implications in sediment load dynamic models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bilancino watershed fig 1 30 km northwest of florence covers an area of about 150 km2 in the northern apennine of italy the altitude ranges from 225 to 1 094 m a s l the bilancino reservoir with a capacity of 84 106 m3 of water is the principal water supply for the city of florence the bilancino sub basin cover the north western pattern of the fluvio lacustrine mugello basin a 25 km long wnw ese trending depression that extends along the sieve river located in the northern tuscany the mugello basin evolution can be described as a two phase history with extensional tectonics superposed onto compressional structures numerous authors consider the mugello basins as grabens or half grabens developed in an extensional regime since the neogene coli 1990 martini and sagri 1993 martini et al 2001 balestrieri et al 2003 the mugello is representative of numerous other intra apennine basins developed during tectonic activity that affected the western part of the northern apennines between the upper miocene and the pleistocene sani et al 2009 the northeast margin of the bilancino watershed is underlain by palaeocene eocene calcareous turbidites and claystones with limestone and serpentinite blocks tectonically overlying early middle miocene sandstone and siltstone turbidites cipriani and

and the remainder is under pasture in 2003 land use in parts of the basin changed due to the construction of a highway which involved major phases of earth moving the construction of tunnels overpasses and the build up of spoil heaps directly connected to the drainage network the sources of sediments are both diffusive sources and point sources the suspended load in the stura streams could be derived from bank erosion landslides or human activities however field observations and catchment monitoring programs suggest that the main source of sediments is the highway construction activities rather than bank erosion pelacani 2016 the landslides are principally located in the upper part of the basin actually more than 50 of these landslides are directly connected with the drainage network however it has been found that less suspended sediments derives from the headwater streams which is due to the presence of check dams furthermore the high surface roughness associated with wood coarse debris supplied by riparian vegetation and the stepped longitudinal profiles favors the deposition of clay sized sediments in the stura stream suspended sediment transport occurs under average rainfall conditions due to the remobilization of fine grained sediments that are stored in the stream bed pelacani 2016 for the investigated stream baseflow stages typically vary between 150 and 200 mm water depth whereas peak flow stages reach about 1000 1500 mm maximum flow velocities of 1 3 m s 1 have been recorded with a flow meter the mean annual discharge is about 3 2 m3 s 1 pelacani et al 2010 a general downstream coarsening of gravel bar material is evident along the middle and lower stura stream the sorting from very poorly sorted becomes moderately well sorted the median size d 50 of the bed material appears to depend on the presence of check dams it varies between 2 3 and 8 cm in gravel bars not affected by the check dams conversely the d 50 ranges between 3 5 and 6 6 cm in the portion of stream regulated by check dams furthermore the shape of the grain size distribution from negative skewed becomes symmetrical pelacani 2016 specifically the effect of the check dams imposes a symmetrical grain size distribution upon the bed materials 2 1 1 presentation of the data data used for this research were obtained from three monitoring stations located along the stura stream fig 1 table 1 the stura stream drains an area of 44 8 km2 underlain by claystones and sandstones and it is the principal tributary of the bilancino reservoir since 2006 a water quality monitoring program has been initiated in the bilancino watershed to evaluate any effect of land management changes due to a new road construction continuous monitoring of stream water depth turbidity ph dissolved oxygen conductivity and temperature was required to detect evolutions of the water quality criteria because of land use activities occurring over protracted periods a total of

station and iii in the lower part barberino station fig 1 stream water depth and turbidity were taken at 10 min resolution for the casaglia and barberino stations and 1 min resolution for la ruzza station fig 1 table 1 the turbidity sensor measures values between 0 and 3 000 ntu the time series used in this work are related to a construction period of the third line of a1 highway and covers a span of over three years portions of the turbidity time series for two monitoring stations are shown in figs 2 3 2 2 fourier power spectrum the internal dynamics of many complex natural systems are

interpreting 1 f b random series requires determining their scaling exponents b which are generally estimated from the log log slopes of their fourier power spectra a value of b close to 5 3 is obtained for turbulent processes schmitt and huang 2016 let us note that certain deterministic iterated maps may produce also scaling power spectra of the form of equation 2 procaccia and schuster

deviations of the time series x t and y t this approach represents the impulse response of the system and can be used to estimate some characteristic time delays between x and y as spikes in r xy t for example the sediment input at the headwater station and at the output station fourier cross spectral analysis corresponds to using the cross correlation in fourier space and is applied here to estimate transit times the cross spectrum sxy is the fourier transform of the cross correlation its real value the co spectrum can be estimated directly as 4 c xy f r e a l x f y f where means complex conjugate spikes in the co spectrum correspond to frequencies associated with the principal time delays between x and y for positive frequency it corresponds to a delay of y t with respect to x t series the coherency spectrum is the ratio of the modulus of the cross spectrum to the square root of the product of both spectra 5 r x y f s x y f e x f e y f for uncorrelated series the coherency spectrum goes to zero if x is proportional to y the coherency spectrum is 1 when the coherency spectrum is flat this may indicate that the covariation of both quantities is independent of scale and when it decreases it indicates that the relation between the two variables is less and less strong 2 4 probability density functions and exceedance probability function since the database considered contains more than 104 datapoints the probability density function of the fields studied can be estimated with good accuracy even for moderate extremes one way to perform this is to bin average and normalize the histogram of the values of the process studied it can be also done by considering the exceedance probability or peak over threshold f x prob x x which is written as follows in the framework of generalized pareto distributions pickands 1975 6 f x 1 kx σ 1 k where k 0 is the tail index and σ is the scale parameter to emphasize the probability of extremes log log plots are considered in case of linear behavior of the log log plot of the f x function for large values of x a power law tail is found this corresponds to fat tails and is a signature of intermittency corresponding to a field that can show quite large values even with relatively small sample size albeverio et al 2006 3 results 3 1 probability distributions the exceedance probability function has been estimated for the turbidity data for both barberino and casaglia stations they are shown in fig 4 with the superposition of a generalized pareto distribution fit highlights the tail of the distributions the part of the distribution representing large but rare events the tail index and scale parameter used for the fits are k 1 σ 8 for barberino station and k 0 92 σ 23 5 for casaglia station there are approximate power law tails more visible for casaglia station and a cutoff for the largest values in each case this is indicating a very intermittent process with heavy tails since the tail indices 1 k are small the exceedance probability function of the streamflow data at both locations has also been estimated fig 5 shows that the tails are also close to a power law with different exponents 4 2 for barberino and 9 2 for casaglia the range of measured turbidity values spans between 0 and 3000 turbidity units the median values have been estimated on a yearly basis they range from 19 3 to 57 10 for casaglia station and from 7 4 to 24 0 for barberino station they indicate a decrease in ntu values from those measured at the casaglia station which represents sediment input to the system to the values measured at the barberino station representing sediment output fig 6 moreover the spread around the average of turbidity values described by the standard deviation grows with time at the barberino lowland station table 2 conversely during the same interval the ntu values slightly decrease for the casaglia upstream station 3 2 power spectra and scaling ranges the timescales of catchment hydrologic response were evaluated using spectral methods that decompose the time series of streamflow and turbidity signals into their component wavelengths by comparing the spectral power density of the input of sediment at casaglia and output at barberino stations at each wavelength it is possible to determine how strongly the catchment attenuates hydrologic signals for each timescale the dynamics of dataset are illustrated in the figs 7 8 showing the power spectra in log log plots the scaling behavior of the turbidity at casaglia upstream monitoring station and barberino the downstream station are reported in fig 7 the two spectra are similar at low frequencies until a period of about one day for scales from 10 min and one day the power spectra at the two locations are both scaling with two different slopes 1 68 for casaglia and a steeper slope of 2 25 for barberino table 1 the daily cycle is visible as a spike for the casaglia station the streamflow data possess also scaling properties both series at casaglia and barberino stations display a scaling regime from about one hour to 20 days with the same slope close to 1 7 the daily cycle is visible as a spike in both spectra 3 3 delay times the delay time of the turbidity and hence of fine sediment transport were considered using the co spectrum it was calculated considering two monitoring stations along the stura stream casaglia station for the input of sediment and barberino station for the output fig 1 results from turbidity dataset of 2006 2008 82 914 data values show that there are three principal spikes fig 9 which represent the transit travel time from upstream to downstream 25 days 33 days and 145 days the inset of this figure shows the coherence spectrum between both locations upstream and downstream showing that for scales from 10 days to one day there is a global transition from perfect coherence to partial coherence and for scales smaller than one day the coherence is constant and does not seem to depend on scale 4 discussion river flows and associated sediment transport are intermittent processes possessing fluctuations over a large range of time scales we have considered in this study the statistics and the dynamics of streamflow and turbidity data by considering respectively the probability distribution function and the fourier power spectra and cross spectra the results obtained indicate large fluctuations with heavy tails and long range properties we discuss below both aspects figs 4 and 5 display the exceedance probability function or peak over threshold in log log plot the approximately linear shapes of the tails of these functions indicate that both series possess heavy tails albeverio et al 2006 characterized by extreme events much more frequent than what is found for a gaussian process the linear or quasi linear shape of these distribution functions in log log plot correspond to pareto distributions or general pareto distributions keylock 2005 it has been shown in previous studies that rainfall data have power law tails for extremes ladoy et al 1993 tessier et al 1996 schmitt et al 1998 pandey et al 1998 and the results found here for streamflow may be linked with this rainfall property the lower the value of the exponent p in equation 6 the more intermittent the process and the heavier the tail this indicates that the upstream station at casaglia is less intermittent than the downstream barberino station it seems that the effect of river channel between the two stations is the increase of the intermittency and the change of the power law exponent however turbidity data show that the effect is the opposite the exponent p is consistently slightly larger for the casaglia station compared to the barberino station it is also visible by comparing the values of this exponent that turbidity data are much more intermittent than streamflow data with a very low value of p varying between 1 68 and 3 86 analysis of the statistics including the distribution functions are done by neglecting time assuming stationarity and considering altogether all data in the time series the fourier spectral analysis is complementary to this analysis and provides information about the dynamics over many different time scales power law slopes in the fourier power spectrum indicate a lack of characteristic scale over the considered range of frequency and time scales mandelbrot 1967 mandelbrot and van ness 1968 the results obtained here and shown in figs 7 and 8 indicate that the turbidity data are scaling over a range of scales from 10 min to about one day whereas streamflow data have scaling over a larger range of scales from 1 h to 20 days a scale ratio of about 500 the streamflow large scaling range may be related to the general property of scaling in geosciences turcotte 1997 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 as well as scaling in the forcing from rainfall and climate lovejoy and schertzer 2017 lovejoy 2019 the value of the scaling exponent b 1 7 is not linked with a river flow turbulence which is at much smaller scales the runoff scaling properties associated with long memory in the underlying process could also result from the scaling properties of the river network mudelsee 2007 it is interesting to note that the scaling range of the sediment fluctuations is different from the streamflow series and of smaller largest scale one day versus 20 days on the one hand the fact that it is scaling indicates that the catchment and the river channel properties have not characteristic scale in the range going from small scales 10 min to the scale of one day on the other hand the smaller largest scale could be related to catchment properties it is visible in fig 7 that both power spectra in the upstream and downstream locations are similar with some random fluctuations at large scales from the yearly scale until the daily scale the spectra are clearly different at smaller scales from the daily scale to the smallest scales 10 min how such difference in turbidity spectral slopes can be interpreted since the streamflow spectral slopes are similar see fig 8 the change of slope from around 1 68 upstream to 2 25 downstream indicates that the effect of the stream development is like a fractional integration of the order of 2 25 1 68 2 0 28 fractional integration is nonlocal and corresponds to a convolution with a power law kernel such property is in global agreement with different studies proposing a theory of nonlocal sediment transport modelling benson et al 2000 schumer et al 2003 schumer et al 2009 schumer et al 2017 stark et al 2009 in these works heavy tail in the streamflow velocity is needed to justify the nonlocal transport modeling it mainly corresponds to the fact that solute transport has power law waiting times due to the heterogeneities in the channel bed the scaling irregularities in topography and the variations in velocity schumer et al 2009 aubenau et al 2015 the heavy tails that are visible in fig 5 here for the exceedance probability of the streamflow data at two different locations support this interpretation which of course needs to be further validated with more systematic measurements these finding are supported by the results obtained applying co spectral analysis showing that the time travel transit of the suspended sediment from upstream to downstream have several characteristic scales there are three principal spikes fig 9 that represents the time travel transit from upstream to downstream 25 days 1 33 days 2 and the last at 154 days these findings give the opportunity to determine the rate of migration of fine sediments through the stream channel stura is a high gradient stream and suspended fine particles travel downstream a distance of about 8 5 km at estimated velocities between 3 0 10 3 and 3 9 10 3 m s 1 to reach the bilancino output considering a mean flow velocity of 1 m s 1 fine particles move through the stura watershed in a series of steps of deposition and resuspension hence a particle may require many hydrographs to move down a river system in the time of 1 year on the one hand in the study area most of the sediment source are the spoil heaps directly connected to the drainage network the dissolution of low albite a sodium rich plagioclase feldspar mineral content in the olistostrome geology which is now exposed in places plays a dominant role to control the long term persistent fluctuations of hydrological data pelacani et al 2010 the impact on the water and sediment maintenance due to the different source of sediment diffusive source and point sources is visible in the two peaks 25 days and 33 days of the co spectrum whereas the peak in the co spectrum at 154 days is presumably related to seasonal flushing of fine sediment after convective storms the coherence spectrum inset of fig 9 shows that for scales from 10 days to one day there is a global transition from perfect coherence to partial coherence and that below the scale of one day there is no more scale dependence on the coherence of the fluctuations from upstream to downstream data the scaling properties in power spectra and the fractional integration from upstream to downstream are compatible with the idea of having long range memories in turbidity data the long memory property is important for modelling purposes involving linear autoregressive models fleming 2008 or nonlinear transfer models tessier et al 1996 pandey et al 1998 these results are in general agreement with the results of szolgayova et al 2014 who analyze the correlations of long range components of 39 mean daily river flow in europe showing that different catchment properties are correlated with the scaling exponent hence the results found in the present paper may depend on the geometry of the stream and their possible generalization will need comparisons with other similar datasets 5 conclusions in this paper spectral time series analysis techniques have been applied to suspended sediment data collected to the stura stream florence italy using fourier analysis we have seen that the turbidity dataset and streamflow display wide range scaling in time from 10 min to one day for the turbidity and from 1 h to 20 days for the streamflow data a co spectral analysis was performed to determine the times and distances of particle transits the main conclusions derived from this study are summarized below 1 turbidity and streamflow have heavy tails that follow pareto distributions or generalized pareto distributions with different exponents 2 turbidity and streamflow display scaling fourier power spectral over different scaling ranges from 10 min to one day for the turbidity and from 1 h to 20 days for the streamflow the large scaling range for the streamflow may be due to climate influence of rainfall and no characteristic scale in the catchment the smaller scaling range of the turbidity may be due to the river channel properties 3 the turbidity at the downstream station has a steeper slope b 2 25 than at the upstream station b 1 68 this may be the effect of non local properties of sediment transport and river channel heterogeneities leading to a fractional integration of order 0 3 4 the cross correlation analysis shows a delay time distribution of the turbidity and hence of sediments and it points out that sediments starting from casaglia input will travels to barberino output in circa 25 days and 154 days as a maximum future research will be concentrated on the scaling intermittency of the different series their multifractal properties using a moment based approach schmitt et al 1998 pandey et al 1998 zang and shang 2007 and hilbert spectral analysis method huang et

4032,in many cold climates rain on snow ros events are associated with severe snowmelt and flooding ros events also rapidly deplete snowpacks reducing the potential for subsurface water storage later in the year we incorporated a simple easily transferable energy balance ros model into the soil and water assessment tool swat to assess how ros melt affects winter floods and summer hydrological drought over a large area such as the north american great lakes basin where ros is associated with severe snowmelt events using 504 random parameter sets the modification consistently improved simulations and led to higher winter flows and lower summer flows compared with the unmodified swat the swat ros model also had improved performance for simulating daily streamflow in 501 99 4 of the 504 random parameter sets and improved performance for simulating daily snowpack in 504 100 of the sets compared to the unmodified swat we then used streamflow and snow water equivalent as the objectives in a multivariable multi site calibration to compare swat ros with the unmodified swat the swat ros model simulated 51 larger peak 0 95 quantile daily flows during winter and spring and 58 lower daily summer low 0 05 quantile flows across the great lakes basin compared to the unmodified swat we also used observed snowpack data to demonstrate how the unmodified swat can miss daily ros melt events delaying snowmelt to later in the season thus the unmodified swat model appears to be misrepresenting the streamflow distribution in areas where ros events occur which is particularly important for modeling extreme events when simulating conditions in cold climates at diverse scales up to large basins or continents hydrological models such as swat must incorporate ros as many other models already do this has implications for water resources management confronted with hydrological extremes in ros prone areas around the world especially where climate change is altering ros melt

drought 1 introduction rain on snow ros events occur when rain falls on an existing snowpack causing rapid snowmelt that can lead to flooding conditions downstream li et al 2019 they occur in nearly all areas that develop a seasonal snowpack or in mountainous regions at elevations where both snow and rain can occur although ros events can happen in any season with snowpack in eastern and central north america they typically occur over the winter but in the mountainous west often occur later in the spring li et al 2019 their magnitude and timing also are sensitive to ongoing climate change with warmer air temperatures increasing the frequency of ros events in areas and seasons that have reliable snowpacks but decreasing ros events if snowpack is more scarce jeong and sushama 2018 musselman et al 2018 historically 70 of extreme floods in the contiguous united states had some contribution of runoff from ros including floods in the west upper midwest northeast and appalachian regions li et al 2019 for instance january 1996 floods in many watersheds of northern pennsylvania usa were exacerbated by ros when unseasonably warm temperatures and heavy rains melted deep snowpack causing 1 5 billion in damage and numerous fatalities leathers et al 1998 ros events and their contributions to flooding are notable in canada europe and asia as well pomeroy et al 2016 rennert et al 2009 rössler et al 2014 sui and koehler 2001 ye et al 2008 winter and spring snow conditions can also strongly influence summer hydrological droughts as a decrease in snow storage and change in snowmelt timing affect groundwater and streamflow in later seasons blahušiaková et al 2020 godsey et al 2014 jenicek et al 2016 safeeq et al 2014 this is because thermodynamically driven snowmelt is typically a low intensity prolonged process that contributes proportionally more to groundwater recharge compared with a short duration rain event that produces a higher ratio of runoff to infiltration earman et al 2006 wilson et al 1980 baseflow can be lowered by this decrease in groundwater recharge godsey et al 2014 safeeq et al 2014 for these reasons ros events can have important implications for hydrology and water resource management even well past the snowmelt season harpold et al 2017 there are many factors that can affect ros melt processes in watersheds including snow water equivalent swe snow depth intensity of rainfall net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes li et al 2019 mazurkiewicz et al 2008 würzer et al 2016 thus hydrological models that simulate ros melt do so using an energy budget approach that estimates heat transfer van tiel et al 2020 walter et al 2005 these models include the variable infiltration capacity vic model andreadis et al 2009 noah multiparameterization noah mp model niu et al 2011 and distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 however unlike the above models popular models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 generalized watershed loading functions model gwlf haith and shoemaker 1987 and the topographic hydrologic model topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 use temperature index snowmelt algorithms that do not incorporate ros melt processes this could have implications for the simulation of winter floods and summer hydrological droughts when these models are used in ros prone regions which include much of north america and eurasia cohen et al 2015 thus models that do not simulate ros melt are either incorrectly simulating snowmelt or relying on misspecification of other parameters to account for the errors this could cause problems for model performance and hydrological outputs particularly as a warming climate could alter snowmelt processes in watersheds wu and johnston 2007 previous studies that modified swat to simulate ros melt have set a solid foundation using energy balance equations of varying complexity with diverse approaches for optimization and evaluation these modifications typically relied on additional processing of gridded aspect slope and or elevation data debele et al 2010 qi et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 although a relatively simpler modification to swat to simulate snow processes has been developed fuka et al 2012 the modified snowmelt algorithms were integrated into hydrological studies by using either uncalibrated models e g fuka et al 2012 or models calibrated to streamflow only e g qi et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 but have not been calibrated to other components of the water balance such as observed snowpack data the evaluations of these modifications have been performed against observed streamflow e g zhang et al 2008 or using a combination of streamflow and snow cover depth data e g fuka et al 2012 qi et al 2017 these typically occurred in small watersheds of approximately 101 to 104 km2 e g fuka et al 2012 qi et al 2017 but as large as the yellow river headwaters at 114 000 km2 zhang et al 2008 also all previous studies used basins with single parameter sets to evaluate the swat snowmelt energy balance modifications no study has yet developed a relatively simple and easily transferable modification calibrated it using an advanced multivariable and multi site calibration of streamflow and snowpack and then evaluated it over a large basin and large number of potential parameter sets and therefore potential hydrological characteristics this approach would facilitate the use of the ros modification for future hydrological studies particularly for large or ungaged basins and for integration into future swat revisions here we modify the swat model s snowmelt routine to include ros melt using an energy balance equation we demonstrate this new swat ros model in the north american great lakes basin where ros events are a major cause of snowmelt suriano 2019 suriano and leathers 2018 and contribute to flooding we compared the swat ros model with the unmodified swat model to answer two research questions 1 does incorporation of simple ros melt equations in swat improve hydrological and snow simulations over a large area such as the great lakes basin and over a large sample of potential parameter sets and 2 to what extent do ros melt events by increasing winter runoff and decreasing subsurface water storage intensify winter spring flooding and summer hydrological drought in a hydrological model demonstrated by a multivariable and multi site calibration of streamflow and snowpack in the great lakes basin the impact of this research is an improved understanding of how ros melt events affect winter floods and summer hydrological drought in hydrological systems in general and the great lakes basin in particular we also demonstrate the necessity for incorporating ros melt events in hydrological models such as swat that do not already include them our research advances the science of ros modeling in swat by 1 using a relatively simple and easily transferable modification with no additional data or setup requirements 2 evaluating it over a very large area 3 evaluating performance across models with a large sample of parameter sets and 4 using an advanced multi objective and multi site optimization of streamflow and snowpack simultaneously this is useful for studies at diverse scales including large basins and continents with cold regions it also improves our ability to use swat and other popular models in ros prone regions around the world 2 methods 2 1 study area located in eastern and central north america the laurentian great lakes basin comprises the earth s largest system of fresh surface water spanning 750 000 km2 environment canada and usepa 1995 it encompasses parts of eight u s states and one canadian province fig 1 and is a major agricultural area and economic powerhouse for both countries campbell et al 2015 environment canada and usepa 1995 within the basin are 105 000 km of rivers and streams lehner et al 2006 that contribute 46 of the lakes water source environment canada and usepa 1995 hodgkins et al 2007 these rivers and streams are vital for rearing and reproduction of the basin s fish landsman et al 2011 but also are an important pathway for pollution into the great lakes environment canada and usepa 1995 snow processes are important to the basin s hydrology near lake superior the number of snow covered days averages 180 days but is two months shorter around lake erie suriano et al 2019 rainfall and snowmelt dominate peak spring flows xu et al 2021 ros melt is associated with 25 of the most severe snowmelt events suriano 2020 and often occurs when warm moist air is advected from the south suriano 2019 2 2 soil and water assessment tool the swat model was used to simulate the hydrology of the basin s watersheds swat delineates subbasins based on elevation and then further separates them into hydrologic response units hrus hrus are distinct combinations of soils land cover and slope classes arnold et al 1998 begou et al 2016 streamflow was simulated in swat using a water balance approach that includes surface runoff lateral subsurface flow through soil groundwater flow and snowmelt arnold et al 1998 the runoff curve number method was used to simulate surface runoff nrcs 1986 while a water balance for shallow aquifer storage was used to simulate groundwater flow arnold et al 1998 evapotranspiration was simulated with the penman monteith method monteith 1965 ritchie 1972 there were 2 029 subbasins delineated in total with an average area of 229 2 180 0 km2 three soils data sources table 1 were combined to cover the entire united states and canadian sides of the basin historical climate data maurer et al 2002 us bureau of reclamation 2013 used the same 1 latitude longitude spatial grid resolution as the gridded north american snow depth dataset mote et al 2018 described in section 2 4 swat models snow processes based on estimated snowfall amounts and simulated changes in snowpack storage snowfall is calculated using the snowfall temperature threshold sftmp which partitions precipitation into rain or snow the swe of the snowpack is calculated based on a mass balance of the previous day s snowpack plus the daily snowfall minus snow sublimation and snow melt tuo et al 2018 sublimation is calculated based upon swat s estimate of potential evapotranspiration fontaine et al 2002 the snowmelt threshold temperature smtmp parameter determines when the snowpack is undergoing melt snowpack temperature is calculated using a function of the previous day s snowpack temperature maximum daily air temperature and a lag factor timp parameter snowmelt is calculated using a function of areal snow coverage maximum daily air temperature and estimated solar radiation fontaine et al 2002 2 3 rain on snow modification we modified the snowmelt source code for swat revision 681 to incorporate ros melt with an energy budget equation used in the snow 17 model anderson 1968 anderson 1973 anderson 1976 anderson 2006 the energy budget equation used in this study states that for snowmelt during an ros time interval m r mm 1 m r σ δ t p t a

algorithms the modified swat source code snom f file can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 snow water equivalent calculation snowpack swe used for our swe calibration section 2 6 was calculated from the existing north american gridded snow depth dataset mote et al 2018 table 1 we calculated swe from the snow depth dataset using climatological variables following the methods of hill et al 2019 this approach has been validated using snow depth data from western and eastern north america and is an effective method to convert snow depth to swe hill et al 2019 to estimate snow water equivalent swe from the gridded north american snow depth dataset we first calculated the swe of snow accumulation swe acc using the equation 4 swe acc a h a 1 pptwt a 2 td a 3 doy a 4 w h e n d o y doy where doy is day of year doy is 180 days h is snow depth mm pptwt is the sum of december january february precipitation mm td is the difference between the mean temperature of the warmest and coldest months of the year c and the rest are coefficients that had previously been fitted to western and eastern north america with satisfactory results a 0 0533 a 1 0 9480 a 2 0 1701 a 3 0 1314 a 4

again fitted coefficients b 0 0481 b 1 1 0395 b 2 0 1699 b 3 0 0461 b 4 0 1804 hill et al 2019 finally we calculate swe using an equation suggested by hill et al 2019 to smooth the swe time series

abl 1 2 1 tanh 0 01 d o y doy 2 5 comparisons of ros and unmodified swat models our analysis of the swat ros and unmodified swat models had two steps to analyze the sensitivity of monthly outputs and model performance to different parameterizations we first generated 504 random parameter sets within our designated parameter ranges table s1 using latin hypercube sampling we assessed snowmelt water yield the average amount of surface water leaving a basin through the stream outlet in a time step and groundwater simulations from the ensemble of parameter sets this resulted in an analysis that did not rely on a single parameter set developed through calibration but allowed us directly and quantitatively to compare the swat ros and unmodified swat models using the same 504 parameter sets second we used the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model from a multivariable calibration of streamflow and snowpack swe section 2 6 applied to both the swat ros model and the unmodified swat to investigate how ros melt affects winter floods and summer hydrological droughts in the basin with both swat models using the same parameter set the only difference between them was that one had the ros melt addition and the other did not so any differences in model performance or outputs would be due solely to the ros modification also the use of the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model allows us to investigate hydrological impacts to the basin using a realistic high quality simulation rather than only demonstrating uncalibrated models the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model is beneficial to use because the parameters would be calibrated to the model that by incorporating ros melt is able to simulate snow processes more correctly analyzing with another parameter set such as one calibrated for the unmodified swat would have led to incorrect or inaccurate simulations because the parameters would not account for ros and thus would need to compensate with some other error such as an adjustment to snowmelt temperature we were able to test these assumptions using our evaluations of daily model performance in our analysis of the sensitivity of the hydrology outputs to parameter sets also our multivariable calibration and evaluation constrained streamflow and snowmelt parameters and allowed us to verify the reliability of this parameter set for simulating streamflow and snowpack in the great lakes basin previous studies have used similar approaches to compare modified and unmodified hydrological models luo et al 2013 wang et al 2019 we also assessed how models compared for simulating estimates of observed snowmelt during observed ros and non ros melt events at the daily time step for this analysis observed snowmelt was estimated from the gridded swe data for each day for each snow grid point by taking the average change in swe between the previous day and next day and removing instances of snow accumulation ros melt events for this analysis were defined as days with positive melt accompanied by at least 10 mm of precipitation on at least 10 mm of observed snowpack swe at a snow grid point to ensure the events would be hydrologically relevant a similar 10 mm snowpack swe threshold has previously been used for this purpose musselman et al 2018 non ros melt events were defined as days with zero precipitation greater than 50 mm of observed snowpack swe so that melt would not be limited by snowpack swe and positive melt at a grid point for the calibrated analysis of daily winter spring floods and summer low flows we analyzed results with quantile quantile q q plots and scatterplots then used 0 95 quantile daily winter spring flows and 0 05 quantile daily summer flows over the 1960 1999 time period to represent daily streamflow extremes the seasons were defined as winter december january february djf spring march april may mam summer june july august jja and fall september october november son 2 6 calibration and validation to improve the efficiency of our calibration and remove inconsequential parameters a parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using the pawn method pianosi and wagener 2015 in the sensitivity analysis for everybody safe toolbox pianosi et al 2015 pawn is a density based index that uses the kolmogorov smirnov ks statistic to measure the distance between cumulative distribution functions it has been effectively used with swat hydrology outputs khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 myers et al 2021 pianosi and wagener 2018 our analysis had 10 000 samples of swat parameter sets n and their associated daily streamflow nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 outputs we chose parameters to use in our study if their median ks was greater than that of the dummy parameter fig s1 this parameter is made after the fact does not have meaningful relationships with swat outputs or evaluations and can be used as a threshold khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 twenty four parameters were retained for calibration including seven snow parameters out of the 35 prior to the sensitivity analysis table s1 the swat ros model was calibrated and validated with observed streamflow and snowpack swe data at the daily time step for the years 1960 1999 table 1 a ten year 1950 1959 warm up period was used to reduce the influence of initial states for swe calibration only summer was removed from the data a complete list of streamflow stations is in table s2 the calibration period was the earliest 50 of data at each site and the validation period was the latest 50 previous research has shown that splitting data between calibration and validation time periods could affect model performance myers et al 2021 so we further examined the observed data for nonstationarities as an average of all 99 stations mean daily streamflow was 10 7 13 8 standard deviation higher in the validation period than the calibration period while median streamflow was 16 7 28 5 higher fig s2 however 25 of stations had a mean daily streamflow that was higher in the calibration period than the validation period reflecting the variability in hydrological trends in the basin despite this variability 34 of stations had mean daily streamflow that was less than 10 different between the calibration and validation time periods suggesting that nonstationarities were not a major factor in the observed data for those stations nearly all streamflow stations and all swe grid points had no missing daily data for the entire 1960 1999 time period multivariable calibration was performed with the a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam algorithm on indiana university s high performance supercomputers stewart et al 2018 vrugt and robinson 2007 zhang et al 2010 three objective functions were used 1 streamflow nse 2 streamflow refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 and 3 snowpack swe mean absolute error mae streamflow objective functions maximized the average nse or dr of gages while the snowpack objective function minimized the average mae of grid locations mae was used as the objective function for the snowpack data because we were interested in evaluations that would preserve the magnitude of the observations and simulations willmott and matsuura 2005 for the calibration a total of 7 520 model evaluations were performed at the daily time step the model that achieved a balance of optimized streamflow nse streamflow dr and snowpack mae was considered the best simulation the strength of calibrations and validations was also evaluated using kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 3 results 3 1 sensitivity to parameter sets to examine how the ros modification affected model performance and the temporal dynamics of snowmelt water yield and groundwater flow compared with the unmodified swat we used an ensemble of 504 random parameter sets the unmodified swat model simulated almost no snowmelt in december through february ensemble average of 1 3 mm per djf season while the swat ros model simulated an ensemble average of 20 4 mm fig 2 the reason for this is that the modification was able to account for winter ros melt events when they do occur because of its energy budget framework to simulate ros melt mean monthly snowmelt for the swat ros model typically peaked in march 51 5 mm or april 79 3 mm fig 3 a in comparison the unmodified swat model tended to have later peak mean monthly snowmelt timing in april 81 8 mm or may 71 1 mm by april and may the swat ros model was typically simulating less snowmelt than the unmodified swat since its snowpack has already been melted as a result of the modified snowmelt routine water yield simulations could differ seasonally between the two models there was greater water yield with the swat ros model in the winter and spring but less in the summer and fall than with the unmodified swat fig 2 for instance the swat ros model simulated an ensemble average seasonal water yield december february of 75 9 mm while the unmodified swat had an ensemble average of 69 7 mm during june august the swat ros model had an average seasonal water yield of 131 9 mm while the unmodified swat had a greater average of 181 0 mm across the ensemble of 504 randomly generated parameter sets this was because more water had been exported from the basin during intense winter spring melt events using the swat ros model resulting in less infiltration and groundwater recharge these differences in water yield were influenced by the models simulations of groundwater flow inputs to streams which could vary quite substantially throughout the summer depending on the randomly generated parameter set the june august ensemble average seasonal groundwater flow was 136 9 mm with the unmodified model but only 94 2 mm with the swat ros model fig 2 this supports that ros events can decrease summer groundwater inputs to streams and has implications for seasonally stressed water resources these results also demonstrate that the influence of ros melt events on hydrology were not the result of a single parameter set in the models rather they occur generally across parameter sets in the ensemble fig 2 fig 3 3 2 evaluations of model performance across parameter sets the goal of this analysis was to compare the swat ros and unmodified swat models in terms of their performance for simulating daily streamflow and snowmelt across parameter sets based on outputs from the ensemble of 504 randomly generated parameter sets the ros modification can improve swat s ability to simulate daily streamflow and snowpacks compared with the unmodified swat model streamflow nse for the swat ros model was better compared to the unmodified swat at the daily time step in 501 99 4 of the random parameter sets fig 4 a c the average improvement to streamflow nse using the swat ros model over the unmodified swat was 0 45 meanwhile the swat ros model had a lower snowpack mae than the unmodified swat in 504 100 of the 504 randomly generated parameter sets fig 4b d the average reduction in snowpack swe mae using the swat ros model over the unmodified swat was 24 8 mm 39 6 this increase in streamflow and snowpack performance demonstrates the benefits of including ros in the swat model particularly when working with ungaged basins and uncalibrated models the improvement in performance was very consistent across the 504 random parameter sets 3 3 daily evaluation of calibrated model we next compared the performance for simulating daily observed data between the swat ros model and the unmodified swat using the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model streamflow nse for the swat ros model was greater than 0 40 in 48 of stations with a maximum nse of 0 71 and average of 0 38 fig 5 a evaluations with dr for the swat ros model ranged from 0 46 to 0 74 with an average of 0 62 fig 5b evaluations with kge for the swat ros model ranged from 0 10 to 0 85 with an average of 0 48 the average snowpack mae for the swat ros model was 26 mm while the maximum was 68 mm fig 5c the swat ros model performed better than the unmodified swat model which had lower streamflow nse average 0 05 maximum 0 46 lower streamflow dr average 0 41 maximum 0 61 and higher snowpack mae average 48 mm maximum 108 mm for using the same set of parameters at the daily time step fig 5d e f also the swat ros model was more accurate than the unmodified swat model for simulating daily snowpack swe at all sites compared with observed data although we expected the swat ros model to perform better these evaluations help show that the improvement in model performance for daily data was substantial our daily analysis of ros and non ros melts demonstrated how each model represents the estimated snowmelt rate from observed snowpack data on days with ros melt swat ros performed better than the unmodified swat for simulating the observed daily melt rate during winter spring and fall maes for these seasons were 8 6 mm 9 4 mm and 5 8 mm respectively with swat ros but larger in the unmodified swat with 10 4 mm 10 2 mm and 6 4 mm on ros melt days fig 6 during non ros melt days with ample snowpack both models performed similarly for representing daily melt rates maes for winter spring and fall were 3 8 mm 6 7 mm and 5 7 mm for both swat ros and the unmodified swat this similar performance is expected since in the absence of rainfall both models use swat s traditional temperature index approach for snowmelt nevertheless if the unmodified swat misses ros melt events at the daily time step it will have larger errors and the overestimated snowpack would then incorrectly melt later in the season i e when temperatures are more appropriate for temperature based melt 3 4 winter flows and summer hydrological droughts using the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model and hydrological averages over the 1960 1999 time period we found that the swat ros modification increased the intensity of winter flows and summer hydrological droughts in the basin we also found that our calibrated parameter set used in these analyses was representative of the general patterns in seasonal snowmelt water yield and groundwater flow across the 504 randomly generated parameter sets section 3 1 as both analyses resulted in similar seasonal hydrological trends compared with the unmodified swat model the swat ros model simulated a larger amount of mean monthly snowmelt during the winter because of the ros melt e g 9 2 mm 1 968 in february but less by may 60 1 mm 74 because the snowpack had already been exhausted using the calibrated parameter set fig 7 a the change in winter snowmelt simulation led the swat ros model to simulate higher water yield during the winter and march 18 2 mm 77 but less in the summer and fall compared with the unmodified model fig 7b this shows concretely with the calibrated parameter set rather than only with the random uncalibrated sets how ros can increase the size of winter flows using a parameter set that results in realistic streamflow and snowpack conditions the swat ros model then simulated a lower water yield throughout the summer than the unmodified swat e g 23 3 mm 44 in july as more water had been exported from the basin during the winter this demonstrates with the calibrated parameter set that ros further reduces the availability of seasonally stressed water resources the export of water from the basin during ros events led the swat ros model to simulate lower groundwater flow to streams throughout the summer and fall e g 20 2 mm 48 in july compared with the unmodified model fig 7c due to reduced storage from snowpack and groundwater recharge 3 5 daily extreme events additionally the ros modification often led to an increase in the daily water yield of extreme winter and spring hydrological events and a decrease in the size of daily extreme summer low water yields compared with the unmodified swat fig 8 a b c quantile quantile q q plots for daily water yield averaged across the great lakes basin show this as well fig 8d e f basin average 0 95 quantile daily peak winter water yields over the 1960 1999 time period increased from 1 40 mm with the unmodified swat to 1 59 mm with the swat ros model which is an increase of 14 similarly basin average 0 95 quantile daily spring water yield increased from 2 33 mm to 3 83 mm 64 when ros were included in the model basin average 0 05 quantile daily summer water yields decreased from 1 12 mm with the unmodified swat to 0 60 mm with the swat ros model a decrease of 46 this demonstrates that with the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model daily extreme winter spring high and summer low water yields are more severe when ros melt is included in the model fig 8g h i these patterns of daily extremes were found at the stations with observed streamflow data as well the ability of the swat model to simulate peak daily winter and spring floods was improved with the ros modification compared with observed streamflow data at these stations the swat ros model simulated an average 51 increase in 0 95 quantile peak daily winter floods compared with the unmodified swat using the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model the increase occurred regardless to the size of the stream this was common throughout the basin where the swat ros model better represented winter and spring peak daily observed flows than the unmodified swat fig 9 the swat ros model had less daily error than the unmodified swat at 89 of these stations compared with observed streamflow data the ability for the swat ros model to simulate summer hydrological droughts was also better than the unmodified swat model which tended to overestimate observed daily low flows of the 0 05 quantile over the 1960 1999 time period the swat ros model simulated an average 58 decrease in 0 05 quantile daily summer low flows compared with the unmodified swat model using the ros calibrated parameter set over the 99 streamflow stations throughout the basin the swat ros model better represented observed daily summer low flows at stations than the unmodified swat fig 10 the swat ros model had less error than the unmodified swat model for simulating 0 05 quantile daily summer streamflow at all stations compared with observed data 4 discussion it is imperative that ros events are included in frameworks of hydrological models that do not already include them such as swat for models that do not include ros the parameters need to compensate for the melt in some other way and are therefore not correctly representing the physical processes for instance the unmodified swat model could compensate by having a higher calibrated runoff curve number parameter zhang et al 2008 a decrease in the snowmelt temperature parameter to increase winter melt or a decrease in the snowfall temperature parameter to compensate for the exaggerated snowpack following unmodeled ros events our analysis using 504 random parameter sets demonstrated that the conclusions we reached were not due to a single parameter set but rather generally occur across parameter sets thus our choice to use the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model led to an analysis of winter floods and summer hydrological droughts that used the most physically correct parameter set for the basin while also being representative of the improvement in model performance of the ros modification throughout the ensemble of parameter sets our evaluation of daily streamflow and snowpack performance after our multivariable calibration also supports the reliability of this parameter set for simulating the great lakes basin s hydrology as the calibration was able to constrain parameters to optimize model performance 4 1 methodological advancements our modification and approach advance the science of modeling ros impacts to hydrology particularly for using models such as swat that do not already include energy balance snowmelt equations this is especially important for studies involving large basins with heterogenous hydrological characteristics we used an advanced calibration approach that incorporated streamflow and snowpack objectives and multiple calibration sites across the basin simultaneously we also used relatively simple equations with no additional input data or setup requirements previous studies have found that energy balance modifications in swat can improve model performance or have comparable mixed results over traditional temperature index approaches however they often rely on a single sometimes uncalibrated parameter set for a basin to evaluate the model our study goes beyond this by using an advanced evaluation approach that investigated the performance of the models with 504 randomly generated parameter sets so results would not be dependent on one parameter set alone previous studies using single parameter sets for basins have had mixed results using energy balance snowmelt modifications to swat for instance previous research has found that without calibration models simulating snowmelt energy balances may perform as well as temperature index models walter et al 2005 zeinivand and smedt 2009 also zhang et al 2008 found that the energy balance snowmelt modification in swat can work better than the temperature index model for ungauged basins but comparable in performance to a temperature index model with elevation bands for gaged basins while debele et al 2010 found the modification to be comparable or less effective than the simpler temperature index model in swat being able to evaluate a large sample of possible parameter sets as we did advances the modeling approach by investigating the broader implications of the swat energy budget snowmelt modifications our advanced calibration technique allowing for multiple sites across the great lakes basin and optimization of streamflow and snowpack simultaneously likely contributed to the improved performance we witnessed for our swat ros model over the unmodified swat hydrologic models are traditionally calibrated to represent only historical streamflow shafii et al 2017 ignoring other hydrological states and water balance components as well as their spatial variability in a catchment stisen et al 2018 classically the approaches for using multiple calibration objectives have been to subjectively combine them into a single index then weigh the residuals gupta et al 1998 or in a stepwise manner calibrating for one variable at a time in sequence hay et al 2006 lu et al 2015 white and chaubey 2005 however our multicriteria optimization approach using nondominated efficient pareto solutions based on tradeoffs amongst objectives can improve upon this by having minimum parameter uncertainty while not subjectively choosing which objectives are more important than others vrugt et al 2003 also although our study was over a much larger area than previous snowmelt energy balance studies using swat our climate data was at a 1 latitude longitude resolution that also matched the gridded snow data so we had 112 climate data grid points over the great lakes basin for our hydrological model with 2 029 hrus as each subbasin included one dominant hru this ratio of 18 1 hrus per climate data grid point provided us with satisfactory evaluations for our ros modification particularly as our streamflow stations were often at the outlet of major river basins composed of several hrus it also accounted for the heterogenous hydrological characteristics in the great lakes basin notably between northern and southern subbasins and differences related to the lakes previous studies modifying swat with snowmelt energy balances have had ratios as high as 409 hrus per climate station fuka et al 2012 larger numbers of hrus have also been used for swat modeling at the continental scale such as 60 000 hrus for the continent of europe with climate data ranging in resolution from 0 25 to 1 grids abbaspour et al 2015 our findings suggest that modifications to swat to simulate an energy balance for snowmelt do not need to involve additional data or modeling steps to achieve substantial improvement in model performance the simplicity of this approach being contained within the snom f file of the swat source code in the supplementary material facilitates its distribution to other studies without any additional software or data processing needs this simplicity would allow it to be integrated into future swat revisions and studies with little difficulty by swapping snom f files in the source code also the improvement of model performance at the scale of subbasins and the larger great lakes basin suggests that the modification can be applied to a broad range of scales and hydrological conditions this is important because hydrological modeling in ros prone regions can range in scale from small experimental watersheds to entire continents our conversion of data from the gridded north american snow depth dataset mote et al 2018 to swe using climatological variables hill et al 2019 produced the daily gridded swe data for this study s calibrations and evaluations we evaluated the effectiveness of this gridded product to reproduce daily observed snowpack swe measurements from cooperative observer network coop station data in the great lakes basin the gridded snow depth and climatological data used to produce this product were originally interpolated and validated with the coop station data prior to our use dyer and mote 2006 kluver et al 2016 suriano and leathers 2017 the interpolation was performed using a spherical version of shepard s inverse distance algorithm i e spheremap software willmott et al 1985 with many cells in the great lakes basin containing over 15 stations dyer and mote 2006 kluver et al 2016 in an evaluation of data from the winter of 1978 a year that was associated with heavy january snowfall followed by intense march melting with several 10 mm rainfall events we found that the daily gridded snowpack swe product developed in this study reproduced the variability in coop station data both the gridded product and coop station data captured the increase in daily snowpack swe in january and subsequent melting in march across the us side of the basin during this notable year fig s3 swe maes averaged among great lakes basin stations for the four dates in 1978 that we evaluated between our gridded product and coop stations were a 12 66 mm for january 1 b 45 14 mm for february 1 c 26 75 mm for march 1 and d 9 63 mm for april 1 while the mae for january 1 through april 30 1978 was 27 7 mm the gridded swe product used in our model calibrations and evaluations however is likely more appropriate than station based data for hydrological modeling as it produces an area averaged spatial field with no missing values ensor and robeson 2008 errors could arise from processes related to snowpack accumulation and ablation as represented by fitted thermodynamic coefficients hill et al 2019 the root mean square error rmse of this approach for calculating swe has been found to average 15 of winter precipitation typically 5 to 30 hill et al 2019 and we expect errors in estimating these processes for the great lakes basin to be of a similar percent 4 2 implications beyond hydrology we found that the incorporation of ros melt simulation into the swat model led to improved simulations of streamflow and snowpack as well as seasonal differences in snowmelt and groundwater flow estimates compared with the unmodified swat model given that alterations to the occurrence of ros events are being projected around the world these differences have implications for studies of climate change impacts in ros prone regions e g jeong and sushama 2018 pall et al 2019 ye et al 2008 thus a hydrological model not including ros would incorrectly simulate the impacts that warming air temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have on snowmelt processes and hydrology as it would not correctly represent the processes even if a model is calibrated and performs well it could experience problems when applied to future conditions with climate induced changes to ros events because it would have mis specified parameters to compensate for the ros melt for instance the swat parameters for snowfall and snowmelt temperature thresholds sftmp and smtmp have been shown to be influenced by calibration time periods leading to dissimilar simulations of snowmelt and streamflow myers et al 2021 we also found that the ros modification to swat led to a decrease in snowpack swe and earlier snowmelt timing in the great lakes basin affecting water storage in snowpack which aligns with previous findings that ros events can cause snow droughts that impact water resources and supplies hatchett and mcevoy 2018 the seasonal differences we found due to the ros modification could also influence estimates of water quality pollutant loading and stream temperature which are often based on the hydrological outputs arnold et al 1998 for instance nitrate simulations in swat depend on the amount of water reaching a stream through different pathways such as surface runoff or groundwater flow lam et al 2010 which we have shown to be influenced by ros melt ros events have also been found to influence the seasonality of stream temperatures such as having a cooling effect on winter stream temperatures compared with rain on bare ground events leach and moore 2014 stream temperature is strongly influenced seasonally by inflows of groundwater runoff and snowmelt all of which can have different temperatures knouft and ficklin 2017 ward 1985 it is thus important for models such as swat to include ros melt otherwise they could be incorrectly simulating climate change snow water storage water quality and stream temperature in regions where ros occurs future research should involve model comparison studies between swat ros and the numerous hydrological models that also simulate ros melt perhaps using a similar approach as tijerina et al 2021 as well as an investigation of how vegetation phenology changes due to the shorter time of snow cover influences the model 5 conclusion we incorporated a simple easily transferable ros routine into the swat model and demonstrated its applicability over the large area of the north american great lakes basin this study advanced the science of swat energy balance snowmelt modeling by using relatively simple equations that can be integrated into swat models with no additional processing steps evaluating the equations over a large area and a large sample of parameter sets and using an advanced multi objective and multi site calibration of streamflow and snowpack simultaneously across the basin the swat ros model simulated greater winter snowmelt lower summer groundwater flows and lower summer water yields than the unmodified swat across a large sample of parameter sets the ros modification also improved swat daily streamflow performance in 99 4 of simulations and improved daily snowpack performance in 100 of the simulations with random parameter sets compared to the unmodified swat using a calibrated parameter set we found that for streamflow stations in the great lakes basin extreme daily winter and spring floods were being underestimated in the unmodified swat model by 51 while extreme daily summer low flows were being overestimated by 58 compared with the swat ros model which better represented observed data we also demonstrated how the unmodified swat model can miss ros melt events occurring at the daily time step inflating snowpack estimates and leading to more melt later in the year thus the addition of ros melt processes in hydrological models such as swat is essential for these models to understand and forecast the magnitude of extreme destructive winter spring hydrologic events in ros prone areas as well as the severity of summer hydrological droughts a better understanding and ability to model ros impacts to hydrology stream temperature snow droughts and other water quality quantity variables is crucial to advance environmental modeling and water resources management in ros prone regions using models such as swat that do not already include ros processes this is particularly important for uncalibrated models or ungaged basins where an optimized parameter set is not known but where studies using the unmodified swat model instead of the swat ros model could be suffering decreased performance for simulating streamflow and snowpacks finally incorporating ros melt into hydrological models such as swat is important for protecting ecosystems and communities from extreme hydrological events in ros prone areas around the world this modification can be easily integrated into the swat source code

4032,in many cold climates rain on snow ros events are associated with severe snowmelt and flooding ros events also rapidly deplete snowpacks reducing the potential for subsurface water storage later in the year we incorporated a simple easily transferable energy balance ros model into the soil and water assessment tool swat to assess how ros melt affects winter floods and summer hydrological drought over a large area such as the north american great lakes basin where ros is associated with severe snowmelt events using 504 random parameter sets the modification consistently improved simulations and led to higher winter flows and lower summer flows compared with the unmodified swat the swat ros model also had improved performance for simulating daily streamflow in 501 99 4 of the 504 random parameter sets and improved performance for simulating daily snowpack in 504 100 of the sets compared to the unmodified swat we then used streamflow and snow water equivalent as the objectives in a multivariable multi site calibration to compare swat ros with the unmodified swat the swat ros model simulated 51 larger peak 0 95 quantile daily flows during winter and spring and 58 lower daily summer low 0 05 quantile flows across the great lakes basin compared to the unmodified swat we also used observed snowpack data to demonstrate how the unmodified swat can miss daily ros melt events delaying snowmelt to later in the season thus the unmodified swat model appears to be misrepresenting the streamflow distribution in areas where ros events occur which is particularly important for modeling extreme events when simulating conditions in cold climates at diverse scales up to large basins or continents hydrological models such as swat must incorporate ros as many other models already do this has implications for water resources management confronted with hydrological extremes in ros prone areas around the world especially where climate change is altering ros melt

drought 1 introduction rain on snow ros events occur when rain falls on an existing snowpack causing rapid snowmelt that can lead to flooding conditions downstream li et al 2019 they occur in nearly all areas that develop a seasonal snowpack or in mountainous regions at elevations where both snow and rain can occur although ros events can happen in any season with snowpack in eastern and central north america they typically occur over the winter but in the mountainous west often occur later in the spring li et al 2019 their magnitude and timing also are sensitive to ongoing climate change with warmer air temperatures increasing the frequency of ros events in areas and seasons that have reliable snowpacks but decreasing ros events if snowpack is more scarce jeong and sushama 2018 musselman et al 2018 historically 70 of extreme floods in the contiguous united states had some contribution of runoff from ros including floods in the west upper midwest northeast and appalachian regions li et al 2019 for instance january 1996 floods in many watersheds of northern pennsylvania usa were exacerbated by ros when unseasonably warm temperatures and heavy rains melted deep snowpack causing 1 5 billion in damage and numerous fatalities leathers et al 1998 ros events and their contributions to flooding are notable in canada europe and asia as well pomeroy et al 2016 rennert et al 2009 rössler et al 2014 sui and koehler 2001 ye et al 2008 winter and spring snow conditions can also strongly influence summer hydrological droughts as a decrease in snow storage and change in snowmelt timing affect groundwater and streamflow in later seasons blahušiaková et al 2020 godsey et al 2014 jenicek et al 2016 safeeq et al 2014 this is because thermodynamically driven snowmelt is typically a low intensity prolonged process that contributes proportionally more to groundwater recharge compared with a short duration rain event that produces a higher ratio of runoff to infiltration earman et al 2006 wilson et al 1980 baseflow can be lowered by this decrease in groundwater recharge godsey et al 2014 safeeq et al 2014 for these reasons ros events can have important implications for hydrology and water resource management even well past the snowmelt season harpold et al 2017 there are many factors that can affect ros melt processes in watersheds including snow water equivalent swe snow depth intensity of rainfall net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes li et al 2019 mazurkiewicz et al 2008 würzer et al 2016 thus hydrological models that simulate ros melt do so using an energy budget approach that estimates heat transfer van tiel et al 2020 walter et al 2005 these models include the variable infiltration capacity vic model andreadis et al 2009 noah multiparameterization noah mp model niu et al 2011 and distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 however unlike the above models popular models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 generalized watershed loading functions model gwlf haith and shoemaker 1987 and the topographic hydrologic model topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 use temperature index snowmelt algorithms that do not incorporate ros melt processes this could have implications for the simulation of winter floods and summer hydrological droughts when these models are used in ros prone regions which include much of north america and eurasia cohen et al 2015 thus models that do not simulate ros melt are either incorrectly simulating snowmelt or relying on misspecification of other parameters to account for the errors this could cause problems for model performance and hydrological outputs particularly as a warming climate could alter snowmelt processes in watersheds wu and johnston 2007 previous studies that modified swat to simulate ros melt have set a solid foundation using energy balance equations of varying complexity with diverse approaches for optimization and evaluation these modifications typically relied on additional processing of gridded aspect slope and or elevation data debele et al 2010 qi et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 although a relatively simpler modification to swat to simulate snow processes has been developed fuka et al 2012 the modified snowmelt algorithms were integrated into hydrological studies by using either uncalibrated models e g fuka et al 2012 or models calibrated to streamflow only e g qi et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 but have not been calibrated to other components of the water balance such as observed snowpack data the evaluations of these modifications have been performed against observed streamflow e g zhang et al 2008 or using a combination of streamflow and snow cover depth data e g fuka et al 2012 qi et al 2017 these typically occurred in small watersheds of approximately 101 to 104 km2 e g fuka et al 2012 qi et al 2017 but as large as the yellow river headwaters at 114 000 km2 zhang et al 2008 also all previous studies used basins with single parameter sets to evaluate the swat snowmelt energy balance modifications no study has yet developed a relatively simple and easily transferable modification calibrated it using an advanced multivariable and multi site calibration of streamflow and snowpack and then evaluated it over a large basin and large number of potential parameter sets and therefore potential hydrological characteristics this approach would facilitate the use of the ros modification for future hydrological studies particularly for large or ungaged basins and for integration into future swat revisions here we modify the swat model s snowmelt routine to include ros melt using an energy balance equation we demonstrate this new swat ros model in the north american great lakes basin where ros events are a major cause of snowmelt suriano 2019 suriano and leathers 2018 and contribute to flooding we compared the swat ros model with the unmodified swat model to answer two research questions 1 does incorporation of simple ros melt equations in swat improve hydrological and snow simulations over a large area such as the great lakes basin and over a large sample of potential parameter sets and 2 to what extent do ros melt events by increasing winter runoff and decreasing subsurface water storage intensify winter spring flooding and summer hydrological drought in a hydrological model demonstrated by a multivariable and multi site calibration of streamflow and snowpack in the great lakes basin the impact of this research is an improved understanding of how ros melt events affect winter floods and summer hydrological drought in hydrological systems in general and the great lakes basin in particular we also demonstrate the necessity for incorporating ros melt events in hydrological models such as swat that do not already include them our research advances the science of ros modeling in swat by 1 using a relatively simple and easily transferable modification with no additional data or setup requirements 2 evaluating it over a very large area 3 evaluating performance across models with a large sample of parameter sets and 4 using an advanced multi objective and multi site optimization of streamflow and snowpack simultaneously this is useful for studies at diverse scales including large basins and continents with cold regions it also improves our ability to use swat and other popular models in ros prone regions around the world 2 methods 2 1 study area located in eastern and central north america the laurentian great lakes basin comprises the earth s largest system of fresh surface water spanning 750 000 km2 environment canada and usepa 1995 it encompasses parts of eight u s states and one canadian province fig 1 and is a major agricultural area and economic powerhouse for both countries campbell et al 2015 environment canada and usepa 1995 within the basin are 105 000 km of rivers and streams lehner et al 2006 that contribute 46 of the lakes water source environment canada and usepa 1995 hodgkins et al 2007 these rivers and streams are vital for rearing and reproduction of the basin s fish landsman et al 2011 but also are an important pathway for pollution into the great lakes environment canada and usepa 1995 snow processes are important to the basin s hydrology near lake superior the number of snow covered days averages 180 days but is two months shorter around lake erie suriano et al 2019 rainfall and snowmelt dominate peak spring flows xu et al 2021 ros melt is associated with 25 of the most severe snowmelt events suriano 2020 and often occurs when warm moist air is advected from the south suriano 2019 2 2 soil and water assessment tool the swat model was used to simulate the hydrology of the basin s watersheds swat delineates subbasins based on elevation and then further separates them into hydrologic response units hrus hrus are distinct combinations of soils land cover and slope classes arnold et al 1998 begou et al 2016 streamflow was simulated in swat using a water balance approach that includes surface runoff lateral subsurface flow through soil groundwater flow and snowmelt arnold et al 1998 the runoff curve number method was used to simulate surface runoff nrcs 1986 while a water balance for shallow aquifer storage was used to simulate groundwater flow arnold et al 1998 evapotranspiration was simulated with the penman monteith method monteith 1965 ritchie 1972 there were 2 029 subbasins delineated in total with an average area of 229 2 180 0 km2 three soils data sources table 1 were combined to cover the entire united states and canadian sides of the basin historical climate data maurer et al 2002 us bureau of reclamation 2013 used the same 1 latitude longitude spatial grid resolution as the gridded north american snow depth dataset mote et al 2018 described in section 2 4 swat models snow processes based on estimated snowfall amounts and simulated changes in snowpack storage snowfall is calculated using the snowfall temperature threshold sftmp which partitions precipitation into rain or snow the swe of the snowpack is calculated based on a mass balance of the previous day s snowpack plus the daily snowfall minus snow sublimation and snow melt tuo et al 2018 sublimation is calculated based upon swat s estimate of potential

algorithms the modified swat source code snom f file can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 snow water equivalent calculation snowpack swe used for our swe calibration section 2 6 was calculated from the existing north american gridded snow depth dataset mote et al 2018 table 1 we calculated swe from the snow depth dataset using climatological variables following the methods of hill et al 2019 this approach has been validated using snow depth data from western and eastern north america and is an effective method to convert snow depth to swe hill et al 2019 to estimate snow water equivalent swe from the gridded north american snow depth dataset we first calculated the swe of snow accumulation swe acc using the equation 4 swe acc a h a 1 pptwt a 2 td a 3 doy a 4 w h e n d

abl 1 2 1 tanh 0 01 d o y doy 2 5 comparisons of ros and unmodified swat models our analysis of the swat ros and unmodified swat models had two steps to analyze the sensitivity of monthly outputs and model performance to different parameterizations we first generated 504 random parameter sets within our designated parameter ranges table s1 using latin hypercube sampling we assessed snowmelt water yield the average amount of surface water leaving a basin through the stream outlet in a time step and groundwater simulations from the ensemble of parameter sets this resulted in an analysis that did not rely on a single parameter set developed through calibration but allowed us directly and quantitatively to compare the swat ros and unmodified swat models using the same 504 parameter sets second we used the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model from a multivariable calibration of streamflow and snowpack swe section 2 6 applied to both the swat ros model and the unmodified swat to investigate how ros melt affects winter floods and summer hydrological droughts in the basin with both swat models using the same parameter set the only difference between them was that one had the ros melt addition and the other did not so any differences in model performance or outputs would be due solely to the ros modification also the use of the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model allows us to investigate hydrological impacts to the basin using a realistic high quality simulation rather than only demonstrating uncalibrated models the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model is beneficial to use because the parameters would be calibrated to the model that by incorporating ros melt is able to simulate snow processes more correctly analyzing with another parameter set such as one calibrated for the unmodified swat would have led to incorrect or inaccurate simulations because the parameters would not account for ros and thus would need to compensate with some other error such as an adjustment to snowmelt temperature we were able to test these assumptions using our evaluations of daily model performance in our analysis of the sensitivity of the hydrology outputs to parameter sets also our multivariable calibration and evaluation constrained streamflow and snowmelt parameters and allowed us to verify the reliability of this parameter set for simulating streamflow and snowpack in the great lakes basin previous studies have used similar approaches to compare modified and unmodified hydrological models luo et al 2013 wang et al 2019 we also assessed how models compared for simulating estimates of observed snowmelt during observed ros and non ros melt events at the daily time step for this analysis observed snowmelt was estimated from the gridded swe data for each day for each snow grid point by taking the average change in swe between the previous day and next day and removing instances of snow accumulation ros melt events for this analysis were defined as days with positive melt accompanied by at least 10 mm of precipitation on at least 10 mm of observed snowpack swe at a snow grid point to ensure the events would be hydrologically relevant a similar 10 mm snowpack swe threshold has previously been used for this purpose musselman et al 2018 non ros melt events were defined as days with zero precipitation greater than 50 mm of observed snowpack swe so that melt would not be limited by snowpack swe and positive melt at a grid point for the calibrated analysis of daily winter spring floods and summer low flows we analyzed results with quantile quantile q q plots and scatterplots then used 0 95 quantile daily winter spring flows and 0 05 quantile daily summer flows over the 1960 1999 time period to represent daily streamflow extremes the seasons were defined as winter december january february djf spring march april may mam summer june july august jja and fall september october november son 2 6 calibration and validation to improve the efficiency of our calibration and remove inconsequential parameters a parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using the pawn method pianosi and wagener 2015 in the sensitivity analysis for everybody safe toolbox pianosi et al 2015 pawn is a density based index that uses the kolmogorov smirnov ks statistic to measure the distance between cumulative distribution functions it has been effectively used with swat hydrology outputs khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 myers et al 2021 pianosi and wagener 2018 our analysis had 10 000 samples of swat parameter sets n and their associated daily streamflow nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 outputs we chose parameters to use in our study if their median ks was greater than that of the dummy parameter fig s1 this parameter is made after the fact does not have meaningful relationships with swat outputs or evaluations and can be used as a threshold khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 twenty four parameters were retained for calibration including seven snow parameters out of the 35 prior to the sensitivity analysis table s1 the swat ros model was calibrated and validated with observed streamflow and snowpack swe data at the daily time step for the years 1960 1999 table 1 a ten year 1950 1959 warm up period was used to reduce the influence of initial states for swe calibration only summer was removed from the data a complete list of streamflow stations is in table s2 the calibration period was the earliest 50 of data at each site and the validation period was the latest 50 previous research has shown that splitting data between calibration and validation time periods could affect model performance myers et al 2021 so we further examined the observed data for nonstationarities as an average of all 99 stations mean daily streamflow was 10 7 13 8 standard deviation higher in the validation period than the calibration period while median streamflow was 16 7 28 5 higher fig s2 however 25 of stations had a mean daily streamflow that was higher in the calibration period than the validation period reflecting the variability in hydrological trends in the basin despite this variability 34 of stations had mean daily streamflow that was less than 10 different between the calibration and validation time periods suggesting that nonstationarities were not a major factor in the observed data for those stations nearly all streamflow stations and all swe grid points had no missing daily data for the entire 1960 1999 time period multivariable calibration was performed with the a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam algorithm on indiana university s high performance supercomputers stewart et al 2018 vrugt and robinson 2007 zhang et al 2010 three objective functions were used 1 streamflow nse 2 streamflow refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 and 3 snowpack swe mean absolute error mae streamflow objective functions maximized the average nse or dr of gages while the snowpack objective function minimized the average mae of grid locations mae was used as the objective function for the snowpack data because we were interested in evaluations that would preserve the magnitude of the observations and simulations willmott and matsuura 2005 for the calibration a total of 7 520 model evaluations were performed at the daily time step the model that achieved a balance of optimized streamflow nse streamflow dr and snowpack mae was considered the best simulation the strength of calibrations and validations was also evaluated using kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 3 results 3 1 sensitivity to parameter sets to examine how the ros modification affected model performance and the temporal dynamics of snowmelt water yield and groundwater flow compared with the unmodified swat we used an ensemble of 504 random parameter sets the unmodified swat model simulated almost no snowmelt in december through february ensemble average of 1 3 mm per djf season while the swat ros model simulated an ensemble average of 20 4 mm fig 2 the reason for this is that the modification was able to account for winter ros melt events when they do occur because of its energy budget framework to simulate ros melt mean monthly snowmelt for the swat ros model typically peaked in march 51 5 mm or april 79 3 mm fig 3 a in comparison the unmodified swat model tended to have later peak mean monthly snowmelt timing in april 81 8 mm or may 71 1 mm by april and may the swat ros model was typically simulating less snowmelt than the unmodified swat since its snowpack has already been melted as a result of the modified snowmelt routine water yield simulations could differ seasonally between the two models there was greater water yield with the swat ros model in the winter and spring but less in the summer and fall than with the unmodified swat fig 2 for instance the swat ros model simulated an ensemble average seasonal water yield december february of 75 9 mm while the unmodified swat had an ensemble average of 69 7 mm during june august the swat ros model had an average seasonal water yield of 131 9 mm while the unmodified swat had a greater average of 181 0 mm across the ensemble of 504 randomly generated parameter sets this was because more water had been exported from the basin during intense winter spring melt events using the swat ros model resulting in less infiltration and groundwater recharge these differences in water yield were influenced by the models simulations of groundwater flow inputs to streams which could vary quite substantially throughout the summer depending on the randomly generated parameter set the june august ensemble average seasonal groundwater flow was 136 9 mm with the unmodified model but only 94 2 mm with the swat ros model fig 2 this supports that ros events can decrease summer groundwater inputs to streams and has implications for seasonally stressed water resources these results also demonstrate that the influence of ros melt events on hydrology were not the result of a single parameter set in the models rather they occur generally across parameter sets in the ensemble fig 2 fig 3 3 2 evaluations of model performance across parameter sets the goal of this analysis was to compare the swat ros and unmodified swat models in terms of their performance for simulating daily streamflow and snowmelt across parameter sets based on outputs from the ensemble of 504 randomly generated parameter sets the ros modification can improve swat s ability to simulate daily streamflow and snowpacks compared with the unmodified swat model streamflow nse for the swat ros model was better compared to the unmodified swat at the daily time step in 501 99 4 of the random parameter sets fig 4 a c the average improvement to streamflow nse using the swat ros model over the unmodified swat was 0 45 meanwhile the swat ros model had a lower snowpack mae than the unmodified swat in 504 100 of the 504 randomly generated parameter sets fig 4b d the average reduction in snowpack swe mae using the swat ros model over the unmodified swat was 24 8 mm 39 6 this increase in streamflow and snowpack performance demonstrates the benefits of including ros in the swat model particularly when working with ungaged basins and uncalibrated models the improvement in performance was very consistent across the 504 random parameter sets 3 3 daily evaluation of calibrated model we next compared the performance for simulating daily observed data between the swat ros model and the unmodified swat using the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model streamflow nse for the swat ros model was greater than 0 40 in 48 of stations with a maximum nse of 0 71 and average of 0 38 fig 5 a evaluations with dr for the swat ros model ranged from 0 46 to 0 74 with an average of 0 62 fig 5b evaluations with kge for the swat ros model ranged from 0 10 to 0 85 with an average of 0 48 the average snowpack mae for the swat ros model was 26 mm while the maximum was 68 mm fig 5c the swat ros model performed better than the unmodified swat model which had lower streamflow nse average 0 05 maximum 0 46 lower streamflow dr average 0 41 maximum 0 61 and higher snowpack mae average 48 mm maximum 108 mm for using the same set of parameters at the daily time step fig 5d e f also the swat ros model was more accurate than the unmodified swat model for simulating daily snowpack swe at all sites compared with observed data although we expected the swat ros model to perform better these evaluations help show that the improvement in model performance for daily data was substantial our daily analysis of ros and non ros melts demonstrated how each model represents the estimated snowmelt rate from observed snowpack data on days with ros melt swat ros performed better than the unmodified swat for simulating the observed daily melt rate during winter spring and fall maes for these seasons were 8 6 mm 9 4 mm and 5 8 mm respectively with swat ros but larger in the unmodified swat with 10 4 mm 10 2 mm and 6 4 mm on ros melt days fig 6 during non ros melt days with ample snowpack both models performed similarly for representing daily melt rates maes for winter spring and fall were 3 8 mm 6 7 mm and 5 7 mm for both swat ros and the unmodified swat this similar performance is expected since in the absence of rainfall both models use swat s traditional temperature index approach for snowmelt nevertheless if the unmodified swat misses ros melt events at the daily time step it will have larger errors and the overestimated snowpack would then incorrectly melt later in the season i e when temperatures are more appropriate for temperature based melt 3 4 winter flows and summer hydrological droughts using the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model and hydrological averages over the 1960 1999 time period we found that the swat ros modification increased the intensity of winter flows and summer hydrological droughts in the basin we also found that our calibrated parameter set used in these analyses was representative of the general patterns in seasonal snowmelt water yield and groundwater flow across the 504 randomly generated parameter sets section 3 1 as both analyses resulted in similar seasonal hydrological trends compared with the unmodified swat model the swat ros model simulated a larger amount of mean monthly snowmelt during the winter because of the ros melt e g 9 2 mm 1 968 in february but less by may 60 1 mm 74 because the snowpack had already been exhausted using the calibrated parameter set fig 7 a the change in winter snowmelt simulation led the swat ros model to simulate higher water yield during the winter and march 18 2 mm 77 but less in the summer and fall compared with the unmodified model fig 7b this shows concretely with the calibrated parameter set rather than only with the random uncalibrated sets how ros can increase the size of winter flows using a parameter set that results in realistic streamflow and snowpack conditions the swat ros model then simulated a lower water yield throughout the summer than the unmodified swat e g 23 3 mm 44 in july as more water had been exported from the basin during the winter this demonstrates with the calibrated parameter set that ros further reduces the availability of seasonally stressed water resources the export of water from the basin during ros events led the swat ros model to simulate lower groundwater flow to streams throughout the summer and fall e g 20 2 mm 48 in july compared with the unmodified model fig 7c due to reduced storage from snowpack and groundwater recharge 3 5 daily extreme events additionally the ros modification often led to an increase in the daily water yield of extreme winter and spring hydrological events and a decrease in the size of daily extreme summer low water yields compared with the unmodified swat fig 8 a b c quantile quantile q q plots for daily water yield averaged across the great lakes basin show this as well fig 8d e f basin average 0 95 quantile daily peak winter water yields over the 1960 1999 time period increased from 1 40 mm with the unmodified swat to 1 59 mm with the swat ros model which is an increase of 14 similarly basin average 0 95 quantile daily spring water yield increased from 2 33 mm to 3 83 mm 64 when ros were included in the model basin average 0 05 quantile daily summer water yields decreased from 1 12 mm with the unmodified swat to 0 60 mm with the swat ros model a decrease of 46 this demonstrates that with the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model daily extreme winter spring high and summer low water yields are more severe when ros melt is included in the model fig 8g h i these patterns of daily extremes were found at the stations with observed streamflow data as well the ability of the swat model to simulate peak daily winter and spring floods was improved with the ros modification compared with observed streamflow data at these stations the swat ros model simulated an average 51 increase in 0 95 quantile peak daily winter floods compared with the unmodified swat using the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model the increase occurred regardless to the size of the stream this was common throughout the basin where the swat ros model better represented winter and spring peak daily observed flows than the unmodified swat fig 9 the swat ros model had less daily error than the unmodified swat at 89 of these stations compared with observed streamflow data the ability for the swat ros model to simulate summer hydrological droughts was also better than the unmodified swat model which tended to overestimate observed daily low flows of the 0 05 quantile over the 1960 1999 time period the swat ros model simulated an average 58 decrease in 0 05 quantile daily summer low flows compared with the unmodified swat model using the ros calibrated parameter set over the 99 streamflow stations throughout the basin the swat ros model better represented observed daily summer low flows at stations than the unmodified swat fig 10 the swat ros model had less error than the unmodified swat model for simulating 0 05 quantile daily summer streamflow at all stations compared with observed data 4 discussion it is imperative that ros events are included in frameworks of hydrological models that do not already include them such as swat for models that do not include ros the parameters need to compensate for the melt in some other way and are therefore not correctly representing the physical processes for instance the unmodified swat model could compensate by having a higher calibrated runoff curve number parameter zhang et al 2008 a decrease in the snowmelt temperature parameter to increase winter melt or a decrease in the snowfall temperature parameter to compensate for the exaggerated snowpack following unmodeled ros events our analysis using 504 random parameter sets demonstrated that the conclusions we reached were not due to a single parameter set but rather generally occur across parameter sets thus our choice to use the parameter set calibrated to the swat ros model led to an analysis of winter floods and summer hydrological droughts that used the most physically correct parameter set for the basin while also being representative of the improvement in model performance of the ros modification throughout the ensemble of parameter sets our evaluation of daily streamflow and snowpack performance after our multivariable calibration also supports the reliability of this parameter set for simulating the great lakes basin s hydrology as the calibration was able to constrain parameters to optimize model performance 4 1 methodological advancements our modification and approach advance the science of modeling ros impacts to hydrology particularly for using models such as swat that do not already include energy balance snowmelt equations this is especially important for studies involving large basins with heterogenous hydrological characteristics we used an advanced calibration approach that incorporated streamflow and snowpack objectives and multiple calibration sites across the basin simultaneously we also used relatively simple equations with no additional input data or setup requirements previous studies have found that energy balance modifications in swat can improve model performance or have comparable mixed results over traditional temperature index approaches however they often rely on a single sometimes uncalibrated parameter set for a basin to evaluate the model our study goes beyond this by using an advanced evaluation approach that investigated the performance of the models with 504 randomly generated parameter sets so results would not be dependent on one parameter set alone previous studies using single parameter sets for basins have had mixed results using energy balance snowmelt modifications to swat for instance previous research has found that without calibration models simulating snowmelt energy balances may perform as well as temperature index models walter et al 2005 zeinivand and smedt 2009 also zhang et al 2008 found that the energy balance snowmelt modification in swat can work better than the temperature index model for ungauged basins but comparable in performance to a temperature index model with elevation bands for gaged basins while debele et al 2010 found the modification to be comparable or less effective than the simpler temperature index model in swat being able to evaluate a large sample of possible parameter sets as we did advances the modeling approach by investigating the broader implications of the swat energy budget snowmelt modifications our advanced calibration technique allowing for multiple sites across the great lakes basin and optimization of streamflow and snowpack simultaneously likely contributed to the improved performance we witnessed for our swat ros model over the unmodified swat hydrologic models are traditionally calibrated to represent only historical streamflow shafii et al 2017 ignoring other hydrological states and water balance components as well as their spatial variability in a catchment stisen et al 2018 classically the approaches for using multiple calibration objectives have been to subjectively combine them into a single index then weigh the residuals gupta et al 1998 or in a stepwise manner calibrating for one variable at a time in sequence hay et al 2006 lu et al 2015 white and chaubey 2005 however our multicriteria optimization approach using nondominated efficient pareto solutions based on tradeoffs amongst objectives can improve upon this by having minimum parameter uncertainty while not subjectively choosing which objectives are more important than others vrugt et al 2003 also although our study was over a much larger area than previous snowmelt energy balance studies using swat our climate data was at a 1 latitude longitude resolution that also matched the gridded snow data so we had 112 climate data grid points over the great lakes basin for our hydrological model with 2 029 hrus as each subbasin included one dominant hru this ratio of 18 1 hrus per climate data grid point provided us with satisfactory evaluations for our ros modification particularly as our streamflow stations were often at the outlet of major river basins composed of several hrus it also accounted for the heterogenous hydrological characteristics in the great lakes basin notably between northern and southern subbasins and differences related to the lakes previous studies modifying swat with snowmelt energy balances have had ratios as high as 409 hrus per climate station fuka et al 2012 larger numbers of hrus have also been used for swat modeling at the continental scale such as 60 000 hrus for the continent of europe with climate data ranging in resolution from 0 25 to 1 grids abbaspour et al 2015 our findings suggest that modifications to swat to simulate an energy balance for snowmelt do not need to involve additional data or modeling steps to achieve substantial improvement in model performance the simplicity of this approach being contained within the snom f file of the swat source code in the supplementary material facilitates its distribution to other studies without any additional software or data processing needs this simplicity would allow it to be integrated into future swat revisions and studies with little difficulty by swapping snom f files in the source code also the improvement of model performance at the scale of subbasins and the larger great lakes basin suggests that the modification can be applied to a broad range of scales and hydrological conditions this is important because hydrological modeling in ros prone regions can range in scale from small experimental watersheds to entire continents our conversion of data from the gridded north american snow depth dataset mote et al 2018 to swe using climatological variables hill et al 2019 produced the daily gridded swe data for this study s calibrations and evaluations we evaluated the effectiveness of this gridded product to reproduce daily observed snowpack swe measurements from cooperative observer network coop station data in the great lakes basin the gridded snow depth and climatological data used to produce this product were originally interpolated and validated with the coop station data prior to our use dyer and mote 2006 kluver et al 2016 suriano and leathers 2017 the interpolation was performed using a spherical version of shepard s inverse distance algorithm i e spheremap software willmott et al 1985 with many cells in the great lakes basin containing over 15 stations dyer and mote 2006 kluver et al 2016 in an evaluation of data from the winter of 1978 a year that was associated with heavy january snowfall followed by intense march melting with several 10 mm rainfall events we found that the daily gridded snowpack swe product developed in this study reproduced the variability in coop station data both the gridded product and coop station data captured the increase in daily snowpack swe in january and subsequent melting in march across the us side of the basin during this notable year fig s3 swe maes averaged among great lakes basin stations for the four dates in 1978 that we evaluated between our gridded product and coop stations were a 12 66 mm for january 1 b 45 14 mm for february 1 c 26 75 mm for march 1 and d 9 63 mm for april 1 while the mae for january 1 through april 30 1978 was 27 7 mm the gridded swe product used in our model calibrations and evaluations however is likely more appropriate than station based data for hydrological modeling as it produces an area averaged spatial field with no missing values ensor and robeson 2008 errors could arise from processes related to snowpack accumulation and ablation as represented by fitted thermodynamic coefficients hill et al 2019 the root mean square error rmse of this approach for calculating swe has been found to average 15 of winter precipitation typically 5 to 30 hill et al 2019 and we expect errors in estimating these processes for the great lakes basin to be of a similar percent 4 2 implications beyond hydrology we found that the incorporation of ros melt simulation into the swat model led to improved simulations of streamflow and snowpack as well as seasonal differences in snowmelt and groundwater flow estimates compared with the unmodified swat model given that alterations to the occurrence of ros events are being projected around the world these differences have implications for studies of climate change impacts in ros prone regions e g jeong and sushama 2018 pall et al 2019 ye et al 2008 thus a hydrological model not including ros would incorrectly simulate the impacts that warming air temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have on snowmelt processes and hydrology as it would not correctly represent the processes even if a model is calibrated and performs well it could experience problems when applied to future conditions with climate induced changes to ros events because it would have mis specified parameters to compensate for the ros melt for instance the swat parameters for snowfall and snowmelt temperature thresholds sftmp and smtmp have been shown to be influenced by calibration time periods leading to dissimilar simulations of snowmelt and streamflow myers et al 2021 we also found that the ros modification to swat led to a decrease in snowpack swe and earlier snowmelt timing in the great lakes basin affecting water storage in snowpack which aligns with previous findings that ros events can cause snow droughts that impact water resources and supplies hatchett and mcevoy 2018 the seasonal differences we found due to the ros modification could also influence estimates of water quality pollutant loading and stream temperature which are often based on the hydrological outputs arnold et al 1998 for instance nitrate simulations in swat depend on the amount of water reaching a stream through different pathways such as surface runoff or groundwater flow lam et al 2010 which we have shown to be influenced by ros melt ros events have also been found to influence the seasonality of stream temperatures such as having a cooling effect on winter stream temperatures compared with rain on bare ground events leach and moore 2014 stream temperature is strongly influenced seasonally by inflows of groundwater runoff and snowmelt all of which can have different temperatures knouft and ficklin 2017 ward 1985 it is thus important for models such as swat to include ros melt otherwise they could be incorrectly simulating climate change snow water storage water quality and stream temperature in regions where ros occurs future research should involve model comparison studies between swat ros and the numerous hydrological models that also simulate ros melt perhaps using a similar approach as tijerina et al 2021 as well as an investigation of how vegetation phenology changes due to the shorter time of snow cover influences the model 5 conclusion we incorporated a simple easily transferable ros routine into the swat model and demonstrated its applicability over the large area of the north american great lakes basin this study advanced the science of swat energy balance snowmelt modeling by using relatively simple equations that can be integrated into swat models with no additional processing steps evaluating the equations over a large area and a large sample of parameter sets and using an advanced multi objective and multi site calibration of streamflow and snowpack simultaneously across the basin the swat ros model simulated greater winter snowmelt lower summer groundwater flows and lower summer water yields than the unmodified swat across a large sample of parameter sets the ros modification also improved swat daily streamflow performance in 99 4 of simulations and improved daily snowpack performance in 100 of the simulations with random parameter sets compared to the unmodified swat using a calibrated parameter set we found that for streamflow stations in the great lakes basin extreme daily winter and spring floods were being underestimated in the unmodified swat model by 51 while extreme daily summer low flows were being overestimated by 58 compared with the swat ros model which better represented observed data we also demonstrated how the unmodified swat model can miss ros melt events occurring at the daily time step inflating snowpack estimates and leading to more melt later in the year thus the addition of ros melt processes in hydrological models such as swat is essential for these models to understand and forecast the magnitude of extreme destructive winter spring hydrologic events in ros prone areas as well as the severity of summer hydrological droughts a better understanding and ability to model ros impacts to hydrology stream temperature snow droughts and other water quality quantity variables is crucial to advance environmental modeling and water resources management in ros prone regions using models such as swat that do not already include ros processes this is particularly important for uncalibrated models or ungaged basins where an optimized parameter set is not known but where studies using the unmodified swat model instead of the swat ros model could be suffering decreased performance for simulating streamflow and snowpacks finally incorporating ros melt into hydrological models such as swat is important for protecting ecosystems and communities from extreme hydrological events in ros prone areas around the world this modification can be easily integrated into the swat source code

while recent studies indicated the presence of warming and greening trends in the region the effects of these changes on wy are not yet understood here on the basis of the budyko framework and a random forest model we assess the relative importance of climate and vegetation on wy changes in the ubr basin we find that precipitation contributes to over 90 of the increase in annual wy and is also the most important factor for wy during the wet season during the dry season however vegetation rather than precipitation predicts the variability in wy we suggest that vegetation may have changed the seasonality of water by storing water in the wet periods and releasing it in dry periods which explains why wy increases significantly during the dry season our findings imply that vegetation greening in the ubr basin has the potential to increase drought resilience downstream and protect food security from drought highlighting the value of ecological restoration for water resource management keywords vegetation greening water yield dry season upper brahmaputra river basin climate change 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp also known as the earth s third pole is one of the most sensitive regions to global climate change this high altitude region provides a vast heat source that fuels the indian monsoon enhances the atmospheric circulation in east asia and significantly influences water and energy fluxes globally wu et al 2012 in the past several decades the qtp has experienced pronounced warming almost twice the global average rate chen et al 2015 which has resulted in remarkable changes to its environment including the shrinking of glaciers thawing of permafrost and increased desertification bibi et al 2018 further rapid warming and associated environmental changes cause profound impacts on the hydrological cycle of the qtp threatening the water resources of the region tang et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand the physical mechanisms which drive changes in water yield wy of the qtp region as the water tower of asia the region holds the headwaters of several major rivers in the central southern and eastern asia such as brahmaputra salween mekong yangtze indus and yellow river fig 1 and sustains large and growing populations in the downstream regions pritchard 2019 improved understanding of wy changes is thus crucial for optimal water resources management and especially in views of the vulnerability of the headwater ecosystems to climatic changes panwar 2020 therefore research on wy changes in the qtp has attracted increased attention in recent years several studies have shown diverging trends in the wy of different watersheds for example the source region of the yellow river has experienced significant decreases in wy since the 1960s due to declines in precipitation and frozen ground degradation wang et al 2018 on the other hand observed wy in the zhimenda hydrological station of the yangtze river shows a weakly increasing trend which can be primarily attributed to increased precipitation li et al 2013 nonetheless a more recent study finds that wy decreases due to increased evapotranspiration in the yangtze river basin mostly as a result of grassland restoration li et al 2017 compared to other source regions of large rivers in the qtp relatively little is known about wy in the ubr basin which is critical for sustaining its vulnerable alpine ecosystems and supplying valuable freshwater resources to a large population gain et al 2011 although warming trends you et al 2007 and vegetation greening li et al 2019a have been detected in the ubr basin there is a lack of detailed research on the effects of these changes on wy in this region specifically the complex

flowing from the west to east through the southern edge of the qtp and finally into the indian ocean it sustains the ecological environment in the watershed and supplies valuable freshwater resources to south asia gain et al 2011 therefore changes in its discharge and water quality directly affect drinking supply irrigation and other living requirements in the downstream regions the ubr basin situated upstream from the nuxia hydrological station fig 1 is particularly sensitive to climate change immerzeel 2008 in the basin precipitation decreases from east to west because of the blocking effects of the mountains on water vapor transport sang et al 2016 the annual precipitation in the ubr basin ranges on average between 300 and 500 mm 60 70 of which falls in the wet season june september the basin has experienced a remarkable warming tendency over the past decades you et al 2007 and an obvious climate shift from wet to dry in the late 20th century li et al 2019b additionally vegetation greening over nearly 60 region has been reported in recent decades li et al 2019a 2 2 datasets monthly wy data were collected from the nuxia hydrological station spanning from 1979 to 2015 37 years provided by the hydrology and water resources survey bureau of the tibet autonomous region china according to historical runoff records we calculated time series of wet season june september and dry season november march water yield hereafter termed wswy and dswy respectively see supplementary fig s1 monthly precipitation and near surface air temperature from 1979 to 2015 were retrieved

applied in this study to estimate potential evapotranspiration due to its good performance under data limited conditions compared to other methods dinpashoh 2006 wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2012 finally the global land surface satellite glass leaf area index lai dataset acquired from the national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china was used to analyze vegetation changes this dataset is produced by the inversion of canopy radiative transfer models using general regression neural networks grnns and has a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 over eight day intervals since 1981 xiao et al 2016 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 trend analysis and abrupt detection of hydroclimatic variables the non parametric mann kendall test commonly used in hydroclimatic studies buendia et al 2016 guntu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 was applied to identify trends in precipitation potential evapotranspiration aridity vegetation and wy in this study a 5 level of significance p 0 05 is considered to discriminate significant trends the non parametric pettitt abrupt detection method pettitt 1979 a widely used rank based and distribution free test for detecting breakpoints was used to identify the turning point tp in time series of awy with a statistical significance level of 5 note that the period before the tp is viewed as the baseline period for the subsequent attribution analysis of awy changes 2 3 2 identifying climate effects on annual water yield changes the budyko framework considers that the long term average actual evapotranspiration ratio aet pre is primarily controlled by the long term average dryness index pet pre of a watershed and has been widely used to quantify the relative contribution of climate and vegetation to changes in water balance liang et al 2015 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the choudhury yang equation was used here 1 aet pre pet pre 1 pet pre n 1 n where the integrated parameter n reflects the integral effect of land characteristics such as vegetation soil properties and topography as soil and topographical changes at the annual timescale are minimal changes in the integrated parameter n can be attributed primarily to vegetation changes zhang et al 2016 hence the difference in water yield δawy before and after the tp can be regarded as the sum of the climate induced changes δawyc and vegetation induced changes δawyv as follows 2 δ awy δ awy c δ awy v 3 δ awy c ε pre δ pre pre awy ε pet δ pet pet awy 4 δ awy v ε n δ n n awy where pre pet and awy are respectively long term mean pre pet and awy ε pre ε pet and ε n are respectively the elasticity coefficients of pre pet and vegetation related equations in supplementary text s1 additionally we support the budyko based analysis using a double mass curve approach related descriptions in supplementary text s2 2 3 3 identifying dominant factors influencing seasonal water yield changes to identify the dominant factors controlling swy changes we used pearson correlation coefficient r to quantify the bivariate relationships between climate variables and wswy and dswy the explanatory variables were precipitation wpre potential evapotranspiration in the wet season wpet and precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the dry season dpre and dpet respectively note that we use the student t test to detect the significance 5 level of r further a random forest model breiman 2001 was used to overcome the nonlinearity and collinearity among the explanatory variables and also to quantify the relative influences of climate and vegetation on swy changes the random forest model is an ensemble of many tree predictors whose samples come from bootstraping the results of the entire forest are the aggregation of estimated output from each tree model in this model the main paraments are the number of trees n trees in the forests and the number of randomly selected predictor variables m at each internal node for each tree predictor the internal nodes split selected samples into two subsets and the terminal nodes represent the best estimated values of the target variable these tree predictors are independently trained based on m training sets that are sampled from the entire dataset using bootstraping for the development of the random forest model wswy and dswy were used as target variables and input variables include seasonal climate wpre wpet dpre dpet and lai values in the wet wlai and dry season dlai here we set the parameters n trees and m to 1000 and 3 respectively and the number of model iterations to 50 the model was evaluated and showed a high explained variance regression score 0 88 supplementary fig s3 for model interpretation we used the feature importance fi and the partial dependence plot pdp which reveal the relative importance of climate and vegetation on swy changes fi reflects the relative contributions of variables to the prediction model by assessing the reductions in weighted impurity caused by each variable at all tree nodes and pdp describes the relationships between wy and predictor variables here the top 3 predictor variables were selected when keeping all other predictors as their mean values the entire random forest model was implemented using the scikit learn package in python v3 7 4 and executed at the high performance computing hpc infrastructure at the flemish supercomputer center vlaams supercomputer centrum vsc 3 results 3 1 climate change and vegetation greening detection the signals of climate change and vegetation greening in the ubr basin from 1979 to 2015 can be seen in fig 2 the precipitation pre in this region shows a significant p 0 05 positive trend with a rate of 2 73 mm yr 1 fig 2a however the aridity trend indicated by the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration pre pet is not significant fig 2c this is due to the fact that pet also shows a significant positive trend of 1 22 mm yr 1 fig 2b likely as a response to climate warming which offsets the role of increasing pre in terms of water availability during the past several decades we also find an increase in lai at a rate of 0 002 m2 m 2 yr 1 fig 2d indicating that the ubr basin has witnessed significant vegetation greening 3 2 annual water yield changes and attribution analysis time series of awy in the ubr basin are shown in fig 3 a from 1979 to 2015 awy shows a nonsignificant increase of 1 05 mm yr 1 which is consistent with the trend of pre pet fig 2c it is noteworthy that awy peaked at 465 mm in 1998 and 2000 more than twice the minimum value 204 mm in 1983 further the change point detection analyse for awy reveals a significant tp in 1998 p 0 05 fig 3b which is consistent with the report of a climate regime shift in the late 20th century in the region li et al 2019b compared with pre and pet the average awy after the tp exhibits the most significant increase from 282 mm to 334 mm 18 4 while the increasing rate of the average pre after the tp is 13 6 and that of the average pet is 4 the results from the budyko framework analysis indicate that changes in pre explain over 90 of the increased average awy in the period 1998 2015 on the other hand the contribution from changes in pet is rather small with a negative effect approximately 5 and only mildly buffers the increase in the average awy driven by pre the remaining increase 15 in the average awy after the tp is attributable to vegetation greening indicating the relative importance of vegetation greening in awy changes the analysis from the double mass curve also shows similar results further strengthening the credibility of our results supplementary fig s2 3 3 seasonal water yield changes and attribution analysis despite positive awy changes in the ubr there are significant differences in swy changes from 1979 to 2015 similar to awy changes wswy shows a nonsignificant increase fig 4 while dswy shows a significant trend of 0 27 mm yr 1 fig 4 which highlights that wy trends in the ubr basin are not constant across seasons nevertheless wswy still dominates the changes in awy as it accounts for over 70 of the total awy on average fig 4c although its contribution shows a steady decline over the study period fig 4b moreover as shown in fig 4d wswy exhibits a high correlation with awy r 0 99 further indicating its critical role in awy changes relationships between swy and climate variables associated with the water cycle are shown in fig 5 climate change in the wet season dominates wswy changes wherein wpre plays a more important role r 0 83 p 0 05 fig 5a compared wpet r 0 59 p 0 05 fig 5c however contrary to what occurs during the wet season dpre does not exert a strong control over dswy changes r 0 02 p 0 05 fig 5f interestingly wpre still influences the changes in dswy r 0 45 p 0 05 fig 5e meanwhile pet also plays a contrasting role in swy changes while wpet exerts a negative influence on wswy as mentioned above dpet shows a positive effect on dswy r 0 57 p 0 05 fig 5h the random forest analysis can be used to further investigate the relationships between swy and climate fig 6 for the wet season wpre is the most important factor showing a fi of 0 70 fig 6a followed by wpet fi 0 09 we also find that wswy shows an almost linear increase with wpre fig 6b which emphasizes the dominant role of wpre in wswy changes the effects of vegetation wlai and dlai on wswy changes are negligible compared to climate variables fig 6a however vegetation plays a more important role than climate in predicting changes in dswy the fi of wlai and dlai are 0 45 and 0 25 respectively fig 6e fig 6f and g indicate that dswy increases when wlai increases from 0 4 to 0 5 and dlai increases from 0 16 to 0 19 this supports the hypothesis that vegetation greening increases dry season water availability in the ubr basin 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of vegetation greening for seasonal water yield changes there are seasonal differences in the wy changes experienced in the ubr basin over the past few decades first the long term trends are different while wswy changes nonsignificantly dswy experiences significant increases fig 4 second the dependence of wy on precipitation also varies per season wpre controls the changes in wswy but the influence of dpre for dswy is weaker than the influence of other factors such as vegetation and dpet figs 5 and 6 finally the role of vegetation also differs seasonally it is the most important factor predicting dwsy changes but unimportant for wswy changes compared to precipitation fig 6 this suggests that vegetation greening affects water availability in the region during dry periods there are a plethora of mechanisms by which vegetation may affect wy across seasons appart from the impacts of vegetation on regional climate and precipitation bonan 2008 plants can also improve the capacity of soil infiltration and moisture retention enhance the proportion of water stored underground and impede the formation of surface runoff bruijnzeel 2004 these processes may be responsible for the increment in wswy fig 4a counterbalancing the increased losses via transpiration and interception that can be expected from vegetation greening forzieri et al 2020 the effects of vegetation on improving the infiltration ability of the basin are more apparent in the monsoon period when the intensity of precipitation tends to surpass the infiltration rate ghimire et al 2013 thus an increasing part of monsoon precipitation may be stored in soil with the gradual improvement of vegetation in the ubr basin meanwhile vegetation greening is known to have lagged effects on water yield by slowing stream recession peña arancibia et al 2019 which may extend the water residence time in the basin and improve its water retention capacity yang et al 2018 as a result soil moisture from wet season precipitation is likely to be transferred to the dry season cheng et al 2017 van dijk and keenan 2007 similarly zhou et al 2010 pointed that vegetation recovery mainly through afforestation may play a positive role in redistributing seasonal precipitation in southern china this supports our interpretation that vegetation greening shifts wy across seasons and increases water availability in the dry season overall we infer that vegetation greening in the ubr basin may enhance the infiltration of precipitation and extend the resistance time of water resulting in a seasonal shift of water and increasing the dry season water yield 4 2 the role of meltwater in water yield changes climate warming in high altitude regions tends to shrink the water reserves in the high mountain areas and enhance river runoff and change its seasonality thus meltwater is expected to be increasingly crucial for the wy changes in qinghai tibet plateau bibi et al 2018 while meltwater is not explicitly accounted for in this study the influence of pet on wy changes may in part reveal the contribution of meltwater from glacier retreating and snow cover changes based on this assumption the contribution of meltwater from climatic warming on wy increases is weak in the wet season as suggested by the relatively low fi of pet 0 09 fig 6a this can be partly because the increase in southwest monsoon precipitation in the ubr basin exceeds the influence of meltwater contributions immerzeel et al 2013 further indicating the dominant role of precipitation in modulating wet season wy assuming that pet encapsulates the influence of melting climate warming and associated cryospheric responses play a more important role in wy during the dry season dpet exhibits a high and positive correlation with dswy r 0 57 p 0 05 fig 5h which was confirmed by the high fi value 0 14 fig 6e fig 6h also shows that dswy shows a nonlinearly increasing relationship with dpet this suggests that the meltwater under climate warming may have been an important water source for the dry season in the ubr basin which also has been hinted by recent studies kraaijenbrink et al 2021 yi et al 2020 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the effects of climate change and vegetation greening on water yield in the upper brahmaputra river basin we concluded that precipitation explained most of the increase in annual water yield and is also the most important factor for water yield during the wet season in contrast vegetation was more decisive at predicting water yield during the dry season in particular we attribute a large part of the increase in dry season water yield in this region to vegetation greening that has been witnessed in recent decades we infer that the effect is owed to the enhanced infiltration ability of precipitation and extended resistance time of water from significant vegetation greening which is important for managing water resources for agricultural systems and protecting food security from drought in the downstream regions credit

aet pre is primarily controlled by the long term average dryness index pet pre of a watershed and has been widely used to quantify the relative contribution of climate and vegetation to changes in water balance liang et al 2015 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the choudhury yang equation was used here 1 aet pre pet pre 1 pet pre n 1 n where the integrated parameter n reflects the integral effect of land characteristics such as vegetation soil properties and topography as soil and topographical changes at the annual timescale are minimal changes in the integrated parameter n can be attributed primarily to vegetation changes zhang et al 2016 hence the difference in water yield δawy before and after the tp can be regarded as the sum of the climate induced changes δawyc and vegetation induced changes δawyv as follows 2 δ awy δ awy c δ awy v 3 δ awy c ε pre δ pre pre awy ε pet δ pet pet awy 4 δ awy v ε n δ n n awy where pre pet and awy are respectively long term mean pre pet and awy ε pre ε pet and ε n are respectively the elasticity coefficients of pre pet and vegetation related equations in supplementary text s1 additionally we support the budyko based analysis using a double mass curve approach related descriptions in supplementary text s2 2 3 3 identifying dominant factors influencing seasonal water yield changes to identify the dominant factors controlling swy changes we used pearson correlation coefficient r to quantify the bivariate relationships between climate variables and wswy and dswy the explanatory variables were precipitation wpre potential evapotranspiration in the wet season wpet and precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the dry season dpre and dpet respectively note that we use the student t test to detect the significance 5 level of r further a random forest model breiman 2001 was used to overcome the nonlinearity and collinearity among the explanatory variables and also to quantify the relative influences of climate and vegetation on swy changes the random forest model is an ensemble of many tree predictors whose samples come from bootstraping the results of the entire forest are the aggregation of estimated output from each tree model in this model the main paraments are the number of trees n trees in the forests and the number of randomly selected predictor variables m at each internal node for each tree predictor the internal nodes split selected samples into two subsets and the terminal nodes represent the best estimated values of the target variable these tree predictors are independently trained based on m training sets that are sampled from the entire dataset using bootstraping for the development of the random forest model wswy and dswy were used as target variables and input variables include seasonal climate wpre wpet dpre dpet and lai values in the wet wlai and dry season dlai here we set the parameters n trees and m to 1000 and 3 respectively and the number of model iterations to 50 the model was evaluated and showed a high explained variance regression score 0 88 supplementary fig s3 for model interpretation we used the feature importance fi and the partial dependence plot pdp which reveal the relative importance of climate and vegetation on swy changes fi reflects the relative contributions of variables to the prediction model by assessing the reductions in weighted impurity caused by each variable at all tree nodes and pdp describes the relationships between wy and predictor variables here the top 3 predictor variables were selected when keeping all other predictors as their mean values the entire random forest model was implemented using the scikit learn package in python v3 7 4 and executed at the high performance computing hpc infrastructure at the flemish supercomputer center vlaams supercomputer centrum vsc 3 results 3 1 climate change and vegetation greening detection the signals of climate change and vegetation greening in the ubr basin from 1979 to 2015 can be seen in fig 2 the precipitation pre in this region shows a significant p 0 05 positive trend with a rate of 2 73 mm yr 1 fig 2a however the aridity trend indicated by the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration pre pet is not significant fig 2c this is due to the fact that pet also shows a significant positive trend of 1 22 mm yr 1 fig 2b likely as a response to climate warming which offsets the role of increasing pre in terms of water availability during the past several decades we also find an increase in lai at a rate of 0 002 m2 m 2 yr 1 fig 2d indicating that the ubr basin has witnessed significant vegetation greening 3 2 annual water yield changes and attribution analysis time series of awy in the ubr basin are shown in fig 3 a from 1979 to 2015 awy shows a nonsignificant increase of 1 05 mm yr 1 which is consistent with the trend of pre pet fig 2c it is noteworthy that awy peaked at 465 mm in 1998 and 2000 more than twice the minimum value 204 mm in 1983 further the change point detection analyse for awy reveals a significant tp in 1998 p 0 05 fig 3b which is consistent with the report of a climate regime shift in the late 20th century in the region li et al 2019b compared with pre and pet the average awy after the tp exhibits the most significant increase from 282 mm to 334 mm 18 4 while the increasing rate of the average pre after the tp is 13 6 and that of the average pet is 4 the results from the budyko framework analysis indicate that changes in pre explain over 90 of the increased average awy in the period 1998 2015 on the other hand the contribution from changes in pet is rather small with a negative effect approximately 5 and only mildly buffers the increase in the average awy driven by pre the remaining increase 15 in the average awy after the tp is attributable to vegetation greening indicating the relative importance of vegetation greening in awy changes the analysis from the double mass curve also shows similar results further strengthening the credibility of our results supplementary fig s2 3 3 seasonal water yield changes and attribution analysis despite positive awy changes in the ubr there are significant differences in swy changes from 1979 to 2015 similar to awy changes wswy shows a nonsignificant increase fig 4 while dswy shows a significant trend of 0 27 mm yr 1 fig 4 which highlights that wy trends in the ubr basin are not constant across seasons nevertheless wswy still dominates the changes in awy as it accounts for over 70 of the total awy on average fig 4c although its contribution shows a steady decline over the study period fig 4b moreover as shown in fig 4d wswy exhibits a high correlation with awy r 0 99 further indicating its critical role in awy changes relationships between swy and climate variables associated with the water cycle are shown in fig 5 climate change in the wet season dominates wswy changes wherein wpre plays a more important role r 0 83 p 0 05 fig 5a compared wpet r 0 59 p 0 05 fig 5c however contrary to what occurs during the wet season dpre does not exert a strong control over dswy changes r 0 02 p 0 05 fig 5f interestingly wpre still influences the changes in dswy r 0 45 p 0 05 fig 5e meanwhile pet also plays a contrasting role in swy changes while wpet exerts a negative influence on wswy as mentioned above dpet shows a positive effect on dswy r 0 57 p 0 05 fig 5h the random forest analysis can be used to further investigate the relationships between swy and climate fig 6 for the wet season wpre is the most important factor showing a fi of 0 70 fig 6a followed by wpet fi 0 09 we also find that wswy shows an almost linear increase with wpre fig 6b which emphasizes the dominant role of wpre in wswy changes the effects of vegetation wlai and dlai on wswy changes are negligible compared to climate variables fig 6a however vegetation plays a more important role than climate in predicting changes in dswy the fi of wlai and dlai are 0 45 and 0 25 respectively fig 6e fig 6f and g indicate that dswy increases when wlai increases from 0 4 to 0 5 and dlai increases from 0 16 to 0 19 this supports the hypothesis that vegetation greening increases dry season water availability in the ubr basin 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of vegetation greening for seasonal water yield changes there are seasonal differences in the wy changes experienced in the ubr basin over the past few decades first the long term trends are different while wswy changes nonsignificantly dswy experiences significant increases fig 4 second the dependence of wy on precipitation also varies per season wpre controls the changes in wswy but the influence of dpre for dswy is weaker than the influence of other factors such as vegetation and dpet figs 5 and 6 finally the role of vegetation also differs seasonally it is the most important factor predicting dwsy changes but unimportant for wswy changes compared to precipitation fig 6 this suggests that vegetation greening affects water availability in the region during dry periods there are a plethora of mechanisms by which vegetation may affect wy across seasons appart from the impacts of vegetation on regional climate and precipitation bonan 2008 plants can also improve the capacity of soil infiltration and moisture retention enhance the proportion of water stored underground and impede the formation of surface runoff bruijnzeel 2004 these processes may be responsible for the increment in wswy fig 4a counterbalancing the increased losses via transpiration and interception that can be expected from vegetation greening forzieri et al 2020 the effects of vegetation on improving the infiltration ability of the basin are more apparent in the monsoon period when the intensity of precipitation tends to surpass the infiltration rate ghimire et al 2013 thus an increasing part of monsoon precipitation may be stored in soil with the gradual improvement of vegetation in the ubr basin meanwhile vegetation greening is known to have lagged effects on water yield by slowing stream recession peña arancibia et al 2019 which may extend the water residence time in the basin and improve its water retention capacity yang et al 2018 as a result soil moisture from wet season precipitation is likely to be transferred to the dry season cheng et al 2017 van dijk and keenan 2007 similarly zhou et al 2010 pointed that vegetation recovery mainly through afforestation may play a positive role in redistributing seasonal precipitation in southern china this supports our interpretation that vegetation greening shifts wy across seasons and increases water availability in the dry season overall we infer that vegetation greening in the ubr basin may enhance the infiltration of precipitation and extend the resistance time of water resulting in a seasonal shift of water and increasing the dry season water yield 4 2 the role of meltwater in water yield changes climate warming in high altitude regions tends to shrink the water reserves in the high mountain areas and enhance river runoff and change its seasonality thus meltwater is expected to be increasingly crucial for the wy changes in qinghai tibet plateau bibi et al 2018 while meltwater is not explicitly accounted for in this study the influence of pet on wy changes may in part reveal the contribution of meltwater from glacier retreating and snow cover changes based on this assumption the contribution of meltwater from climatic warming on wy increases is weak in the wet season as suggested by the relatively low fi of pet 0 09 fig 6a this can be partly because the increase in southwest monsoon precipitation in the ubr basin exceeds the influence of meltwater contributions immerzeel et al 2013 further indicating the dominant role of precipitation in modulating wet season wy assuming that pet encapsulates the influence of melting climate warming and associated cryospheric responses play a more important role in wy during the dry season dpet exhibits a high and positive correlation with dswy r 0 57 p 0 05 fig 5h which was confirmed by the high fi value 0 14 fig 6e fig 6h also shows that dswy shows a nonlinearly increasing relationship with dpet this suggests that the meltwater under climate warming may have been an important water source for the dry season in the ubr basin which also has been hinted by recent studies kraaijenbrink et al 2021 yi et al 2020 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the effects of climate change and vegetation greening on water yield in the upper brahmaputra river basin we concluded that precipitation explained most of the increase in annual water yield and is also the most important factor for water yield during the wet season in contrast vegetation was more decisive at predicting water yield during the dry season in particular we attribute a large part of the increase in dry season water yield in this region to vegetation greening that has been witnessed in recent decades we infer that the effect is owed to the enhanced infiltration ability of precipitation and extended resistance time of water from significant vegetation greening which is important for managing water resources for agricultural systems and protecting food security from drought in the downstream regions credit

4034,this paper reviews the current status of flow duration curve fdc studies that attempt to relate climate and catchment attributes to reproduce or explain the process controls on its shape toward improving global scale applicability and transferability of fdc studies a collection of fdc literature from the past two decades is presented 2000 2020 they are grouped as exemplifying either 1 studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate and 2 studies that improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains we show some of the general characteristics for each group highlighting some major limitations and advantages then we discuss potential future research directions in the context of improving the global scale applicability transferability of fdc studies group 1 dominates fdc literature since the inception of fdc although some studies have been successfully applied at large spatio temporal scales such approaches are often empirical thus they are usually applicable only in the regions of model development often in hydrologically resourceful countries with densely gaged networks that make it easier to transfer information between catchments a major impediment to progress is the lack of process input in empirical models resulting in an inability to generate flexible functions applicable across larger scales it is from this perspective that process based approaches are becoming popular among studies in group 2 process based approaches explicitly attempt to identify and understand the process controls on fdc thus they appear more advantageous although they have yet to be tested at global scales furthermore there are still some contrasting issues regarding the processes that govern fdc shapes there is a need to develop a general framework for process based modeling of fdc finally even though much has already been achieved at regional scales through both approaches the new challenge is to consistently replicate the successes on a global scale keywords flow duration curve empirical process based spatio temporal scales model structures flexible modeling frameworks 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is arguably one of the most commonly used tools in modern hydrology it embodies the chinese proverb that a picture is worth a thousand words vogel and fennessey 1995 zhang 2017 it is a simple graphical image that contains considerable amounts of valuable hydrological information thus enabling it to illustrate precipitation cascading through the dynamic system and present it in the frequency domain ghotbi et al 2020a for example the degree of steepness of an fdc slope represents a catchment s ability to store or dispel precipitation yilmaz et al 2008 enabling educated assumptions about the underlying geological features of the catchment fdc represents the frequency distribution of streamflow for a specific period smakhtin 2001 vogel and fennessey 1994 it is essentially an effective and alternative representation of the cumulative distribution function of streamflow yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the fdc shape is unique to a catchment it is determined by the hydrologic heterogeneity in the catchments this includes climate soil vegetation elevation topography physiography geomorphology and land use interacting at different time and spatial scales to output unique streamflow responses castellarin et al 2013 the resultant shape exhibits distinct information of these interacting processes it has been employed over generations ever since its first recorded use in 1889 by clemens and herschel foster 1934 however its productibility peaked at the time of the computer age fienberg 1979 because of improvement in precision and its ability to be effectively implemented and yield good results across various fields encompassing hydrology kim and kaluarachchi 2014 mohamoud 2008 requena et al 2018 shu and ouarda 2012 therefore even though considered traditional its usage strongly persists in modern hydrology however a persistent major weakness is the failure to capture timing information on streamflow synchronically the wide range of fdc literature includes studies related to water quality e g babbar sebens and karthikeyan 2009 johnson et al 2009 letcher et al 2002 morrison and bonta 2008 sediment studies e g powell et al

diaz nieto and wilby 2005 pumo et al 2016 although advancements in computer technology have improved the precision there is still a demand for more improvement and informed scientific research from policy makers on water related issues ever since water specialists have become concerned with the potential impacts of climate change coopersmith et al 2014 singh 2018 and human impacts on the water cycle in this anthropocene era hrachowitz et al 2013 for example the water resources commission project in south africa hughes 2005 and european union s water framework directive and floods directive coxon et al 2019 additionally the prediction in ungaged basins pub sivapalan et al 2003 initiative an international collaborative effort that sought to improve reliable pub remains a core part of fdc studies as it is impossible to gage remote river network systems completely due to restricted site accessibility and prohibitive economic costs the pub challenge is crucial to global water resources management because the greatest human impacts on water systems occur in these ungaged areas sivapalan 2003 there are a few extant comprehensive reviews of fdc literature searcy 1959 provided the earliest followed by vogel and fennessey 1994 1995 smakhtin 2001 reviewed its contributions to low flow hydrology while castellarin et al 2013 compiled and synthesized efforts developed during the decade long international association of hydrological sciences iahs pub initiative 2003 2013 established by the global hydrology community to solve recurring water challenges at the turn of the century blöschl et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 few other summary style reviews exist beyond for example castellarin et al 2004b there are two types of fdc curves period of record fdc por fdc and annual fdc afdc leboutillier and waylen 1993 vogel and fennessey 1994 por fdc is constructed from the entire length period of observation whereas afdc is constructed annually for both constructions see castellarin et al 2004b smakhtin 2001 the choice between por fdc and afdc is often debated however it should be determined primarily by the water problem at hand instead of ideas of superiority since both representations should be used complementarily castellarin et al 2004b for instance afdc is useful for capturing annual streamflow regime variations within a year variations or during changeovers in a particularly wet or dry hydrological year vogel and fennessey 1994 on the other hand por fdc is a steady state representation of the long term streamflow regime and can be effectively used in patching and extending streamflow data hughes and smakhtin 1996 the accurate streamflow estimation is a key component to solving most water related issues e g proper water resource management or the planning and development of hydropower infrastructures these demands can be met with fdcs which can further provide important information on the variation in availability and reliability of surface water to meet societal needs while maintaining a balanced distribution of water in nature müller et al 2014 although newer developments have focused on interpreting the process controls on fdcs its reproduction remains the main interest thus current levels of fdc application have generally remained the same as those previously mentioned in the review of vogel and fennessey 1994 1995 empirical reproduction of fdcs at local spatio temporal scales has been the dominant interest to hydrologists because of fdc s ability to be properly estimated and help solve water problems at such scales consequently considerable empirical knowledge has been gained with regard to investigating controls that impact its shape however the literature suggests or emphasizes a critical limitation of local scaled empirical developments i e the successful application transferability of the developed models across larger spatial scales e g continental or global scale exhibiting many different catchment behaviors are typically lacking in hydrology blöschl et al 2013 castellarin et al 2013 cheng et al 2012 chouaib et al 2018 2019 fennessey and vogel 1990 ghotbi et al 2020a müller and thompson 2016 sadegh et al 2016 yaeger et al 2012 ye et al 2012 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 therefore the developed models are often confined to the regions from which the functions were empirically derived potentially explaining the success of these empirical approaches in regionalization methods as a precursor to estimation in ungaged catchments yokoo and sivapalan 2011 in this context longstanding limitations force us to question whether traditional empirical approaches are successfully looping i e even though empirical methods continue to evolve and make progress in their developmental regions the problems associated with global scale application remain however most current hydrologic models remain empirical they will continue to be empirical due to their simplicity and suitability in providing water managers and decision makers with accurate fdc predictions tools and uncertainties compatible with operational purposes and practical applications in operational hydrology castellarin et al 2013 given that the shape of fdc is determined by precipitation variability and a cascading dynamic system where water transports laterally and vertically through the catchment deciphering the processes interacting between climate and catchment characteristics over large spatio temporal scales and domains has lately become an integral part of fdc studies in this context process based approaches have become popular and preferred over empirical approaches because they can explicitly relate climate and catchment characteristics over larger spatial scales blum et al 2017 this is important for addressing future global hydrological challenges since the difficulty for water specialists to successfully apply region specific methods on larger scales delays progress in achieving safer global water security especially in underdeveloped countries the objective of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the current status of studies that attempt to relate climate and catchment attributes to reproduce fdcs or explain the process controls on its shape due to the enormous literature available this paper considers fdc studies in the past two decades 2000 2020 we categorize the literature according to the spatio temporal contexts of studies 1 those studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climatic and 2 those studies that improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains for each category we show some general trends point out major limitations and advantages and discuss potential future research directions in the context of improving the global scale applicability transferability of fdc studies 2 outline of the review fig 1 shows a brief outline of the two categories of fdc literature in terms of the progression of fdc model developments at different spatio temporal scales group 1 studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climatic usually have operational objectives they are generally empirical and applicable at smaller scales i e local regional these areas are usually well gaged at specific scales thus they can be approached with empirically derived fdcs that require no model structure e g vogel and fennessey 1994 as the transfer of models between hydrologically similar catchments become important for solving water issues at local regional scales the models can either be empirical castellarin et al 2004b or process based botter et al 2007c with fixed structures group 2 studies seek to improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains due to the transferable limitations of small scale operational objectified studies to larger scales thus these studies are often process based they either have fixed model or flexible model structures however recent studies have focused more on improving the flexibility of model structures e g leong and yokoo 2019b ye et al 2012 the literature suggested that the combination of empirical and process based approaches significantly improves fdc performances in different areas therefore the approach for transferring applying fdc models across larger spatio temporal scales e g global scales is potentially a robust flexible structural framework that includes empirical and process based approaches 3 developing accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate the traditional methods for deriving fdcs or exploring process controls targeting specific regions and hydro climate are empirically based due to their usability for operational purposes these methods can be broadly classified into non parametric graphical and parametric statistical methods the non parametric graphical methods explore climate and physiographic characteristics on the fdc shape with a graphical representation however the parametric statistical method uses a statistical distribution to fit fdcs and relate the obtained parameters to the catchment s physical characteristics cheng et al 2012 non parametric graphical methods focus on deriving relationships between fdc signatures e g quantiles or slope and climate catchment characteristics ghotbi et al 2020b for example mohamoud 2008 used the sequential generation scheme identified dominant climate and soil descriptors and developed a step wise multiple regression equations for selected percentiles similarly leong and yokoo 2019a used quantile regression equations to estimate low flows in ephemeral catchments castellarin et al 2004a proposed a non parametric approach that predicts dimensionless fdcs in ungaged catchments through statistical interpolation of empirical dimensionless fdcs constructed from hydrologically similar gaged basins for which hydrological similarity can be interpreted as the inverse of the distance between any pair of basins in a space whose coordinates are functions of morphological and climate descriptors see e g castellarin 2014 zhang 2017 proposed an index gage method to assess the suitable minimum length of streamflow data for estimating representative fdcs the united states geological survey usgs continues to use the approach for pub in us catchments studley 2001 in contrast parametric statistical methods focus on fitting suitable distribution functions to empirically derive fdcs estimate the distribution parameters and develop equations from the relationship between the parameter distribution and climate catchment characteristics ghotbi et al 2020b the graphical and statistical methods are often based on the theory of hydrological similarity extrapolating or transferring information from gaged to ungaged catchments usually within a homogenous region 3 1 paired catchment systems several experimental studies employing paired catchment systems have been used to analyze the impact of vegetation changes on fdc to assess environmental changes based on hydrological similarity in comparative hydrology for example best et al 2003 used three levels of model complexities to identify parameter changes under altered land use conditions the most complex model five parameter achieved the best performance and showed that most parameter changes were related to median flows and proportion of no flow days indicating climate and vegetation controls on the fdc shape the study also noted that it is essential to have a comparative assessment of meteorological years when assessing land use changes due to vegetation a major limitation of assessing fdcs under such changes is that the relative distribution of extreme flows depends on climate variability there are few other similar studies e g zhao et al 2012 and brown et al 2013 the latter also identified the timeframe for catchment recovery to reach equilibrium after changes in forest cover became permanent sikka et al 2003 showed the impacts of changing vegetation type cover and the same crop rotation on low flow regimes apart from paired catchments lane et al 2005 also showed how regime flow changed with afforestation and quantified this impact on the fdc many studies have investigated the impacts of conservation practices on flow regimes over long periods using the rank based non parametric mann kendall test they include vegetation e g huang and zhang 2004 zhang et al 2011 soil e g li et al 2007 mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008b and land use e g zheng et al 2007 practices which have generated insightful views on the importance of connecting theoretical work to fieldwork other notable studies include chappell and tych 2012 and a review by brown et al 2005 these long term experimental studies are essential in recognizing the controls that impact fdc especially when environmental changes are significantly influenced by climate and human activities these studies were generated by different levels of complexities although more complex models delivered better performances e g best et al 2003 it is often argued that higher levels of uncertainty are inherent in such complexities blöschl et al 2013 however quantifying uncertainty is still challenging thus presenting an opportunity for paired catchment systems to better understand uncertainty quantification with theoretical and field work potentially mending the disconnection between theoretical and field hydrology 3 2 regionalization of fdc empirical approaches often require extensive observed data but the earth s surface remains largely ungaged thus fdcs must be estimated rather than measured in such areas müller and thompson 2016 for this reason a highly active area in hydrological research is the development of regionalization methods castellarin et al 2013 müller et al 2014 pumo et al 2014 these are statistical approaches that transfer hydrometric information to ungaged catchments based on climate or catchment similarity of gaged catchments usually within the same region a common practice quantifies the relationships between climate catchment characteristics by stochastically fitting appropriate statistical distributions and estimating its associated parameters to capture the fdc shape yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the expansive requirements in water resources management have led to a global influx of hydrologic literature on regionalization procedures regardless of whether it is related to fdc or not regionalization of fdcs can be categorized as follows group 1 those that are derived from probability distribution statistical approaches and group 2 those that consider a non existent relationship between fdc and probability theory castellarin et al 2004a group 1 approaches first selects a suitable distribution type then the parameters are estimated from the gaged catchment and regression equations are developed for predicting parameters in an ungaged catchment based on the catchment s climate and landscape characteristics yokoo and sivapalan 2011 reportedly some of the commonly used distributions are log normal distribution e g boscarello et al 2016 li et al 2010 beta distribution e g iacobellis 2008 complex kappa distribution e g castellarin et al 2007 and gamma distribution e g botter et al 2007a b c cheng et al 2012 muneepeerakul et al 2010 blum et al 2017 outlined some functioning probability distributions in the us catchments while sadegh et al 2016 summarized some commonly used distributions in hydrology the choice of distributions depends on the location of the undertaken study e g li et al 2010 given that the suitability of distribution functions depends on the local hydrological conditions therefore universal distribution functions may never be discovered at least in the current hydrological modeling environment group 2 contains two sub categories group 2a those that use analytical equations to derive fdcs parametric approaches and 2b those that use standardized graphical representations of fdc with regional validity graphical approaches castellarin et al 2004a which are rarely found within the past two decades a few other conditions for categorizing regionalization methods are described in shu and ouarda 2012 pugliese et al 2014 and zhang 2017 the vast amount of hydrologic literature available to regionalization studies points to the global hydrologic problem of hydrometric data scarcity this is displayed in the global distribution of regionalization studies for example in italy castellarin et al 2004a ganora et al 2009 mendicino and senatore 2013 pumo et al 2014 rianna et al 2011 viola et al 2011 canada shu and ourda 2012 requena et al 2018 iran masih et al 2010 portugal croker et al 2009 uk holmes et al 2002 mcintyre et al 2005 yadav et al 2007 young et al 2000 australia post 2004 taiwan yu et al 2002 zimbabwe mazvimavi et al 2005 malaysia mamun et al 2010 us homa et al 2013 over et al 2018 pool et al 2017 zhang 2017 turkey isik and singh 2008 brazil silva et al 2019 greece niadas 2005 central america westerberg et al 2016 and himalayas singh et al 2001 however since the success of regionalization methods depends on transfer extrapolation of data and knowledge from gaged to ungaged catchments within hydrologically similar catchments such studies are often performed in areas with densely gaged network systems usually in high income developed or developing countries that have rich data and resources hydrologically resourceful countries in this context lack of representation is obvious in low income developing countries especially in small island clusters of the tropical regions e g pacific islands the socio economic problems associated with successful development in such areas are a risk to the fragile nature of island water resources additionally climate change poses an immediate threat to these islands due to rising tides caused by global warming immediate work in such areas could reveal alerting hydrological changes if more immediate attention is directed toward island hydrological studies e g the recent tropical island hydrology training project by the national center for atmospheric research https ral ucar edu projects wrf hydro training materials tropicalislandtraining 3 3 estimating fdcs in ungaged basins parametric statistical the dominant empirical approach for estimating fdcs in ungaged basins are parametric statistical methods compared to non parametric graphical methods or even process based methods for example sadegh et al 2016 proposed a new set of closed form parametric functions derived from soil water characteristics to estimate the fdc shape in catchments with varying hydrologic behaviors see also vrugt and sadegh 2013 costa and fernandes 2020 managed to transfer regional information using the evolutionary polynomial regression technique in australian catchments li et al 2010 proposed a novel semi parametric index model by merging three models partial components linear regression nearest neighbor and hydrological similarity the final compounded index model performed better than the individual models from which it was developed castellarin et al 2013 showing combinations of older models or lesser performing models and approaches strategies or exploratory models e g booker and snelder 2012 fouad and loáiciga 2020 can be a way of improving future model development or performances performance evaluation of statistical and parametric approaches is further discussed in mendicino and senatore 2013 furthermore shao et al 2009 proposed a four parameter double powered function to assess the impact of using the same fdc expressions before and after land use or land cover change the first two hydrological parameters represent mean annual flow and cease to flow point the other two statistical parameters represent the physiographic characteristics they are calibrated from observed data and remain relatively unchanged indicating the dominance of climate variables e g precipitation and temperature change controlling fdc homa et al 2013 developed regression equations to evaluate catchment modification impacts on the hydrologic regime this was analyzed by the difference in natural regime against the altered regime eco change metric it is often considered that dominant controls on fdcs are naturally occurring phenomena e g climate soil and vegetation however studies showed that the anthropogenic impacts characterized by human influence on the hydrological regime are a dominant factor in the hydrological system sivapalan and blöschl 2015 for example in the us catchments cheng et al 2012 and ye et al 2012 found that more complex modeling systems that included such anthropogenic impacts were needed in major agricultural areas of the midwest indicating that human impacts on the hydrological modeling system need to be better quantified and potentially introduced as newer data types hrachowitz et al 2013 although most empirical fdc studies remain statistical and have been successful some underlying issues impact practical runoff estimations in ungaged basins shu and ouarda 2012 sadegh et al 2016 these are due to the distributive assumptions not fully representing the entire shape of fdc fennessey and vogel 1990 over simplifying assumptions müller and thompson 2016 unaccountable anthropogenic impacts and disconnection between hydrology science and hydrology engineering communities hrachowitz et al 2013 requena et al 2018 proposed the functional data analysis fda method that considers the full functional shape of fdc instead of prior assumptive analytical equations that affect its shape to address the issue of not fully representing fdc the study integrated the fda method with multiple regression to develop a functional multiple regression framework that estimates all fdc quantiles in a single regression equation thus it can capture the full fdc shape as opposed to developing regression equations for individual quantiles which is common in traditional regression approaches it is worth nothing that studies that compared impacts of parameterization and generalization of empirical fdc methods e g booker and snelder 2012 found different methods varied performance impacts across the exceedance probability once again drawing attention to the consideration of fdc as a fully functional shape or a proportionate quantile version the index flow method has shown promising efforts regarding this issue by integrating por fdc and afdc in a single functional structure and separating inter annual and intra annual effects on the fdc shape karst et al 2018 for example castellarin et al 2004b proposed a stochastic representation of daily streamflow that could derive fdcs and afdcs therefore it can reproduce the por fdc regardless of the persistence and seasonality of the series rianna et al 2011 the index flow model assumes that daily streamflow is the product of two independent random variables dimensionless daily streamflow and annual flow the dimensionless daily streamflow represents the hydrologic response of the catchment its probability distribution functions are governed by the catchments geomorphologic and climatic characteristics the annual flow represents the index flow which describes the catchments long term climate response castellarin et al 2007 therefore the interpretation of fdc is not impacted by the assumptions of independent and identically distributed dimensionless daily streamflow something previously lacking in statistical methods mendicino and senatore 2013 the index model is a theoretical improvement of leboutillier and waylen 1993 consequently the distributions are complex as demonstrated by castellarin et al 2007 the four parameter kappa distribution required a more intense computation and optimization iacobellis 2008 thus reducing functional flexibility across a wider spatial scale furthermore the notion that more parameters in mathematical expressions output more accurate daily fdc are met with high amounts of uncertainty especially for parameters representing climate and physiographic conditions pugliese et al 2014 this is exacerbated by the fact that apart from the scaling factor all index flow approaches are based on the assumption on a non variable fdc in homogenous regions without introducing process involvement müller and thompson 2016 nevertheless these methods e g castellarin et al 2004b 2007 sauquet and catalogne 2011 have opened pathways for stochastic frameworks in process based modeling of fdc pumo et al 2014 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 other relatable studies include serinaldi s 2011 proposal of analytical confidence intervals for fdcs which was not included in the castellarin et al 2004b framework iacobellis 2008 introduced a six parameter etabeta model to improve the representation of low flows which are scarce in hydrologic literature viola et al 2011 rianna et al 2011 proposed a model to calculate how often a river is dry by combining the stochastic index flow model and the total probability theory in intermittent italian catchments other unrelated stochastic approaches were developed for catchments in japan and thailand by sugiyama et al 2003 they showed that the shape of the lower part of fdc depends on the strength of low flow persistence in turkey cigizoglu and bayazit 2000 estimated fdc as a product of periodic and stochastic streamflow components using the convolution theory in a five parameter harmonic model that can perform parameter reductions post 2004 viola et al 2011 3 4 ephemeral catchments based on a review of low flow hydrology smakhtin 2001 critically mentioned the lack of hydrological studies toward low flows and the need to better understand low flow generating mechanisms in the past two decades there have been developments on ephemeral flows but not significant enough most fdc studies focused on perennial flows viola et al 2011 kirkby et al 2011 or reproduction of perennial low flows and less on explaining the processes that control the low flow sections of fdc especially in ephemeral catchments this is further complicated by the characteristic of ephemeral catchments having discontinuous streamflow pumo et al 2014 and the critical relationship between catchment and climate characteristics at different spatio temporal scales as catchments becomes drier viola et al 2011 proposed a regional model based on two simple parameter functions a parameter for estimating the percentage of time a river is wet or dry and another parameter to estimate fdcs for non zero periods resulting in satisfactory fdc estimations croker et al 2003 proposed two separately modeled components one of the models estimates zero flows as a function of mean annual precipitation and the other estimates non zero flows based on climate and hydrogeology characteristics in semiarid catchments then the components were combined with the total probability theory see rianna et al 2011 to estimate fdcs in ungaged ephemeral catchments leong and yokoo 2019a estimated low flows from global regression equations developed at each quantile of fdc however laaha and blöschl 2006 used seasonality indices to interpret low flow processes at a regional scale they recommended using regional regression instead of global regression approaches e g viola et al 2011 there are some concerns regarding empirical models addressing low flows particularly the treatment of homogenous catchments with normal regional regression approaches see laaha et al 2014 over a large spatial scale e g chalise et al 2003 especially in arid regions therefore from an alternative perspective the inclusion of more process based theory is potentially needed to intensely re examine and better understand how low flow driving mechanisms impact the shape of ephemeral fdcs instead of simply based on empirical reforms e g tallaksen and van lanen 2004 given the importance in the level of intricate detail between climate and catchment characteristics as catchments become drier and the need for more complex modeling systems in arid areas cheng et al 2012 the recent popular approach of separating high and low flow components e g ghotbi et al 2020a is an effective way of expressing low flow generating mechanisms such approaches may be more dominantly applied when addressing fdc low or ephemeral flows 3 5 a major limitation of empirical studies in the past two decades considerable amounts of empirical knowledge have contributed enormously to investigating the controls that shape the fdc of studied catchments especially at local spatio temporal scales however even at such scales some urgent issues that need attention extend and hinder consistent performances over larger scales empirical approaches graphical non parametric and statistical parametric only implicitly capture the net effects of hydrologic processes that contribute to streamflow variability therefore it is challenging to generalize empirical findings from such approaches without explicitly including dominant hydrologic processes and controls ghotbi et al 2020b in other words if one were to think of the several empirical studies reviewed above as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle we have not yet acquired the understanding and methodology to complete that puzzle yokoo and sivapalan 2011 although some studies have successfully transferred models to predict fdcs in ungaged catchments e g castellarin et al 2004a most of the success is due to well gaged catchments within the tested regions blöschl et al 2013 even though much progress has been made in developing mathematical expressions for characterizing streamflow with contrasting hydrologic behaviors to improve the performance of estimating empirical fdcs within these tested regions functions can still be ineffective even at such scales e g sadegh et al 2016 this is due to the inability of the derived functions to cover large scale non stationary conditions milly et al 2008 because of the lack of process knowledge and understanding between climatic and catchment characteristics in the functions under different environments castellarin et al 2013 cheng et al 2012 müller and thompson 2016 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 therefore these approaches are generally successful for operational objectives at local spatio temporal scales but still lacks the ability to transfer models from other regions of development and estimate fdcs at larger scales e g global scale especially in truly ungaged catchments smakhtin et al 2006 reviewed and tested the applicability of some hydrological methods in nepal to show the transfer of models to predict fdcs required further development modification and testing at the study site this highlights the importance for validating the work especially when targeting truly ungaged catchments regardless of the undertaken approach predicting fdcs in truly ungaged catchments will be challenging since there is evidently no way to assess the accuracy of predictions in truly ungaged catchments thus a conjoint effort between prediction and its validation in ungaged catchments needs significant breakthroughs fdc studies are plagued with proposals and model recommendations at ungaged sites without properly validating the estimated fdcs castellarin et al 2004a few recent studies have investigated past theories and identified minor but significant contributions relevant to these much needed breakthroughs for example ridolfi et al 2020 cautioned against the basic assumption of catchments in close proximity hydrologic similarity have the same characteristic fdc hughes and smakhtin 1996 the study mentioned the transfer of information between gaged and ungaged sites in the same time frame can at times be impossible and suggested those ungaged catchments should at least have some data partially gaged to allow a transfer window for information exchange müller and thompson 2019 discussed the goodness of fit metric for performance evaluation and model selection they introduced a new approach of the conditional value of sample information cvsi primarily used for sampling design optimization cvsi is based on the bayesian framework that uses finite sample sized observed data to measure the value of the information and explicitly incorporate the sampling uncertainty of validation data into model validation other related studies for probabilistic forecasting include predictive quantile quantile q q reliability plots e g laio and tamea 2007 and information theory e g weijs et al 2002 additionally few other significant cross validation schemes have been introduced in fdc literature for example bootstrap resampling yu et al 2002 and jack knife cross validation castellarin et al 2004a castellarin et al 2007 considering the challenge in predicting streamflow and validating estimated fdcs in ungaged catchments newer approaches that are not within the scope of this review may have a better advantage for example geostatistical approaches e g castellarin 2014 castiglioni et al 2009 or neural networking e g worland et al 2019 3 6 expanding the areal distribution of studies studies that have used large datasets e g camels addor et al 2017 mopex duan et al 2006 can generate new empirical knowledge and recognize emerging patterns when exploring large scale climate and catchment characteristics controls on the fdc shape e g cheng et al 2012 ghotbi et al 2020a ghotbi et al 2020b this emphasizes the benefit and the need for more global datasets made accessible with whatever is available and wherever possible in different regions of the world especially from low income or developing countries that lack data and resources non resourceful hydrological countries if future studies are to be frequently pursued in these areas or to include these areas moreover if fdc studies decipher global scale processes a larger catchment pool and its areal distribution are necessary this can be approached through innovative and alternative data sources such as surface water and ocean topography swot mission e g biancamaria et al 2016 huang et al 2020 citizen data and crowdsourcing e g candhy nardi et al 2021 or artificial intelligence and machine deep learning methods see shen et al 2021 which have already begun conditioning future hydrological agenda the inclusion and global expansion of such methods will be important to boost global scale hydrological research thus alleviating data scarcity issues in low income regions of the world and offering fruitful opportunities for integrating and supporting process oriented research with rich and extensive datasets therefore more collaborative effort is required between resourceful and non resourceful countries to implement these approaches and have the resulting datasets widely available few other notable achievements in large scale studies have investigated large scale distributive patterns of fdc characteristics for example cheng et al 2012 and sawicz et al 2011 revealed interesting parameter and fdc slope distribution patterns respectively across the continental us however such studies could not explain the anomalies within the successful identification of these distributive patterns therefore there is still difficulty in empirically finding or explaining the regional process functioning patterns across large areas chouaib et al 2018 yaeger et al 2012 furthermore these studies demonstrate the need and advantage of using a larger catchment pool hrachowitz et al 2013 knoben et al 2020 that can generate a larger distribution of process knowledge especially identifying anomalies that could be looked at in future studies a drawback of only working with catchments within the same region is the expected results likely to occur within a status quo because of a priori assumptions of hydrologic similarity within a homogenous region as a way of expanding the coverage of studies reducing biases and presenting results out of the ordinary small scale regional studies could intentionally include an anomaly a catchment disconnected from the region the goal of the anomaly could be similar to cross validation while identifying what works and does not work on a larger scale with the currently used local regional models an anomaly identified as part of the original study should not be considered because of the potential errors and uncertainties with data or study the intentional inclusion of anomalies intentionally incites constructive arguments within the study based on the argumentative theory predictions and empirical evidence mercier 2016 the fundamental asymmetry between production and evaluation explains the effects of reasoning in different contexts the more debate and conflict between opinions there is the more the argument evaluation prevails over argument production resulting in better outcomes mercier 2016 this approach argumentative hydrology should supplement the importance of having blind tests in studies and rub against the grain of the presented study to potentially present better comparative and contrastive analysis such initiative would generate future questions and ideas to be explored it would also expand the coverage of studies to potentially include non resourceful countries especially nurture interest in such areas however a clearly defined approach is required and will need a deeper discussion on the way forward exploring these anomalies of what goes against normality can be one way of accepting studies that are unordinary hrachowitz et al 2013 3 7 overview studies that focus on developing accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate are dominated by empiricism they are highly effective for water resources management wrm at such scales a prominent advantage of the empirical approach is its versatility especially in operational hydrology unfortunately the versatility causes the approach to be rigid especially when addressing global scale pub which usually requires the spatial interpolation of observed statistics or model parameters blöschl et al 2013 this is further complicated when natural phenomena encounter unexpected changes or non stationary conditions therefore the extrapolation transfer of known results becomes difficult in time and space blöschl et al 2013 müller and thompson 2016 however such studies will remain highly influential in fdc literature due to their effectiveness in addressing wrm needs at local scales the extrapolation transfer of fdc information between catchments based on the theory of hydrologic similarity needs a timing window where gaged and partially gaged sites can transfer information ridolfi et al 2020 this emphasizes the need for timing information to be more incorporated into fdc studies even though the timing is non existent in fdcs for example such approaches could explore better information extraction techniques from the hydrograph and its recessional analysis e g tashie et al 2020 additionally it could explore the dominant processes thoroughly and improve uncertainty with time based model constructions before probability and cumulative distributions can be used to derive empirical fdcs recent studies on identifying fdc controls have increasingly become more process intuitive often stochastically and may have an advantage over purely empirical approaches however studies have shown that combining the two approaches empirical and process based improves performances e g booker and woods 2014 müller and thompson 2016 müller et al 2014 thus implying that a conjoint effort between both approaches will be more beneficial in future studies than as an individual unit there have been many successful attempts made at local and regional scales to reproduce and express empirical fdcs however much of these regional successes are due to the homogenous treatment of catchments in densely gaged countries or hydrologically resourceful regions blöschl et al 2013 therefore the new challenge is replicating these successes e g costa and fernandes 2021 on larger spatial scales especially in non resourceful developing countries 4 improving our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains 4 1 the need for a general conceptual framework in the past two decades several attempts have been made from different perspectives to increase the process knowledge that impacts hydrological behaviors in catchments for example from a chemical analysis perspective shope 2016 investigated the partitioning of hydrologic flow at different elevations and events in south korea for a mountainous mesoscale catchment in scotland soulsby et al 2003 soulsby et al 2004 used the hydrograph separation method informed by tracer behaviors to investigate the interaction between runoff processes and landscape characteristics furthermore sueker et al 2000 explored streamflow generation and acidic decomposition mechanisms during snowmelt for six alpine and subalpine catchments in the us from other viewpoints burlando and rosso 2002 downscaled the general circulation model to investigate the effect of transient climate change on the hydrologic processes norbiato et al 2009 used runoff coefficients as an indicator to assess catchment response in the italian alps jencso et al 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 investigated the hydrologic connectivity from streamflow response to hillslope inputs and landscape properties and bouaziz et al 2020 used satellite analysis for root zone storage estimation performance analyses have been conducted to evaluate the process consistency in hydrological models e g fovet et al 2015 metrics of low flows e g pfannerstill et al 2014 controls on parameter transfer from gaged to ungaged catchments e g singh et al 2014 and hydrologic functioning gallart et al 2008 these studies represent significant improvements in understanding hydrological processes however the successes have not been translated into a collective and fundamental understanding of process controls on fdcs this indicates the existing fragmentation within fdc studies for empirical and process based approaches at any spatio temporal scale ever since the fdc development despite the fragmentation issue in hydrological studies being a core component in establishing the pub initiative in 2003 therefore there is a need for more collaborative effort to chart a common goal in fdc studies to share and develop new ideas and data that are globally tested hrachowitz et al 2013 in developed and developing countries especially in developing island countries which seem to be invisible in process based hydrologic literature process based models are becoming popular among studies that attempt to estimate streamflow in ungaged catchments because they explicitly relate climate and catchment characteristics blum et al 2017 especially when water specialist depends on knowledge to quantify unobservable underground processes sivakumar 2008 however the challenge in process based modeling is to quantify many processes occurring at different spatial and timescales within a catchment beven 2000 sivapalan 2003 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 this is even more challenging when fdc has no timing information embedded in it and the existence of more complexity and heterogeneity than earlier assumed blöschl et al 2013 yaeger et al 2012 therefore following similar calls for a unified hydrologic theory in process based modeling e g harman and troch 2014 harte 2002 hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan 2003 2005 sivapalan et al 2003 wagener et al 2013 there is a need to develop a general conceptual framework for process based modeling of fdc cheng et al 2012 ghotbi et al 2020a b yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the current approaches that improve our process understanding use the stochastic characterization of streamflow time series or physically based process based models to interpret processes and reconstruct fdc across large spatio temporal scales and domains there are two approaches probabilistic approaches and data based models the probabilistic approaches extend existing analytical solutions for probability density functions of streamflow müller et al 2014 however the data based models use conceptual modeling frameworks this approach can be subdivided into two approaches deductive top down approach and inductive bottom up approach deductive approaches rely heavily on a priori assumptions as the basis of the model the findings on the relationship between fdc and the modeled processes are interpreted within the model s assumptions however inductive approaches have considerably less reliance on a priori assumptions this approach has the advantage of being adjustable and flexible to hydrological processes unique to the catchments 4 2 probabilistic approaches 4 2 1 stochastic modeling frameworks the recent introduction of ecohydrological principles in probabilistic modeling of fdc has made more effort to mechanistically connect drivers state and dynamic response of the system by analytically deriving probability functions from basic assumptions of the stochastic structure of rainfall and system response müller and thompson 2016 although these approaches existed in few past literature e g rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 they have been reintroduced and made popular after several studies by botter et al 2007a b c and subsequent related studies the pioneering theoretical framework by botter et al 2007c based on the probabilistic modeling of baseflow resulted in developing an analytical probabilistic model for characterizing streamflow response the model focused on the frequency distribution gamma distribution of slow leaching prone components of the hydrologic response or baseflow the model s functions were derived from three key assumptions based on the dominant process controls in the subsurface drainage system poisson rainfall stochastic rainfall linear evapotranspiration losses and linear baseflow recession the study showed few simple but important parameters related to soil moisture dynamics characteristic residence time or recession time constants and stationary rainfall events could be used to reproduce the base flow component of fdc controlled by the ratio of the runoff frequency and recession time constant of baseflow botter et al 2007b transformed the original framework from spatially lumped to a distributed model to identify the effects of spatial variability of catchment properties e g vegetation soils and complex geomorphology they obtained that wet climate had a significant impact on the heterogeneity of the underlying properties especially at lower runoff affecting the distribution function of the baseflow therefore the subsurface probabilistic structure of baseflow was mainly controlled by climate geomorphology and the distribution of soil and vegetation features the impacts on the probabilistic structure were further analyzed by botter et al 2007a they compared gaged catchment distributions with the original gamma distribution at daily and annual timescales across a wider spatial scale in the continental us botter et al 2008 following the progression of studies noting improvements in model performances surrounding nonlinear storage discharge relationships e g kirchner 2009 instead of linear relationships botter et al 2009 explored these nonlinear relationships in its pioneering theoretical framework the performance improvement in the nonlinear approach was later confirmed by ceola et al 2010 especially for high flows regardless of the hydro climate basso et al 2015 this shows that future process based modeling frameworks will strongly consider nonlinear approaches as opposed to linear storage discharge relationships furthermore given the need for more investigations on how humans impact the water cycle in this generation hrachowitz et al 2013 future studies that can quantify the human and anthropogenic influence on the system will be crucial for fdc modeling frameworks therefore such impacts may need to be considered part of its natural regime and potentially included as a dominant process depending on the catchment if considered the variability in human behavior affecting or altering land use will be challenging for empirical models to quantify such changes at large scales thus stochastic approaches e g botter 2014 botter et al 2010 are suitable for such conditions the approach should investigate the variability of seasonal flow regimes caused by climate and natural catchment characteristics as well as climate and complex landscape changes caused by human activity thus providing insights into probabilistically quantifying unnatural land use changes human induced impacting streamflow regimes 4 2 2 extended developments in the absence of streamflow data in ungaged catchments the framework s ability to extend and develop methods with fewer parameters and low calibration is essential to wrm for example doulatyari et al 2015 derived model parameters from only climate and geomorphologic data and successfully applied them in 38 catchments across the continental us although successful in deriving analytical frameworks that independently model the effects of climate and landscape the original framework botter et al 2007c and its subsequent studies in some way can be highly assumptive about the spatial homogeneity of catchments müller and thompson 2016 for instance the rainfall application as the poisson process or specific assumptions made to predict runoff coefficients and recession time constants are still open to further discussion and interpretation doulatyari et al 2015 the successes of these studies are correlated with empirical limitations in that the analytical framework is applicable only within the regions of development or densely gaged regions nevertheless further investigation of the framework continues to improve the fdc processes knowledge for example muneepeerakul et al 2010 included the fast flow component and interestingly addressed the time scale differences in processes contributing to streamflow pumo et al 2013 2014 addressed the application in ephemeral catchments in 2013 they investigated the impact of vegetation interception in reducing rainfall by introducing a temperature based parameter however they developed an afdc assessment model modaba in their later study to characterize the high and low flows see also croker et al 2003 viola et al 2011 for water resource management botter et al 2010 assessed the impacts of damming rivers they strongly suggested the inclusion of anthropogenic e g agriculture regulation effect on the full hydrologic regime of the river indicating the need to include and quantify such impacts even in process based approaches other related works with more practical relevance include the production optimization and profitability of run of river hydropower plants while considering downstream minimum environmental flow requirements basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 addressed the original framework s assumption of using the poisson process and intra annual variation afdc they developed a five parameter model with minimum calibration that captured the inter annual variation of por fdc in seasonally dry climates the new framework developed for seasonally dry climates was successfully analyzed in run of river power plants in nepal such approaches highlight a promising future for developing more versatile process based models with minimum calibration and parameterization furthermore these address the need for fdc studies to connect the developed science to engineering hydrology which is typically lacking in practical hydrology studies castellarin et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 4 2 3 common limitations the collective studies related to the probabilistic dynamic framework botter et al 2007c have made incredible improvements to process based modeling of fdc especially for pub e g doulatyari et al 2015 such probabilistic approaches have significantly improved the process knowledge and understanding between climate and catchment relationships however a significant limitation of the framework and common to similar process based modeling approaches is the dependence on the assumptions of integrated processes blum et al 2017 i e simplifying assumptions about spatial homogeneity of catchments müller and thompson 2016 such assumptions cause models to be less versatile than empirical approaches for instance the poisson rainfall had constant parameters that were only applicable to the season it was assigned to and the carryover of seasonal soil moisture was ignored thus restricting the framework s applicability to seasons different from wet ones cheng et al 2012 ghotbi et al 2020a b this generally resulted in the limited ability to address seasonal changes yaeger et al 2012 therefore affecting the derivation of afdc for catchments with strong seasonality nevertheless with a small number of parameters and calibration of climate and catchment characteristics the framework has the advantage of independently modeling the impacts of climate and landscape müller and thompson 2016 however given that probabilistic approaches are reliant or based on streamflow data and can interpret the probabilistic characteristics it cannot be used to predict fdcs in truly ungaged basins without the empirical relationship between the probabilistic model parameters and fdc shape therefore in the context of deriving model parameters in the absence of streamflow data doulatyari et al 2015 which successfully predicted streamflow with only climate and geomorphologic data which is increasingly available in ungaged basins due to better remote sensing technologies müller and thompson 2016 is a feature example of progressing the stochastic dynamic framework in regions that lack gaged densities e g non resourceful developing countries and streamflow data thus the probabilistic approaches show promising potential for future studies to expand globally and outside the homogenous treatment of catchments 4 3 data based approaches 4 3 1 fdc disaggregation framework a significant study extending the probabilistic dynamic framework botter et al 2007c to substantially improve the understanding of controls of climate and catchment attributes on fdc is the yokoo and sivapalan 2011 fdc framework they conducted numerical analysis deductive approach in hypothetical catchments using a physically based water balance model and varying combinations of climate input e g potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and landscape properties e g soil type and depth they obtained that fdc can predominantly be disaggregated into two components an fdc for fast flows governed by precipitation and an fdc for slow flows governed by catchment seasonality and can be modeled as a function of mean monthly flows mmf furthermore in the context of pub a conceptual framework was proposed by disaggregating fdc into 1 a fast flow component governed by a filtered version of precipitation duration curve 2 a slow flow component governed by the mmf and 3 a correction to slow fdc to capture the effects of high evapotranspiration at low flows yokoo and sivapalan 2011 although the disaggregation framework yokoo and sivapalan 2011 was hypothetically conducted the study has been confirmed in actually gaged catchments e g cheng et al 2012 chouaib et al 2018 2019 leong and yokoo 2017 however it is yet to be tested in ungaged catchments given the framework s ability to determine climate and landscape controls on fdc under hypothetical conditions and the significant progress made by doulatyari et al 2015 in its stochastic dynamic approach in ungaged catchments while using only climate and geomorphologic data combinations of such similar frameworks could potentially reveal interesting developments in pub from process based approaches furthermore the underrepresentation of subsurface processes in hydrologic models could be improved by introducing studies that better connect the underground flow mechanisms e g beckers and alila s 2004 study of preferential flow paths in hillslope hydrology 4 3 2 deductive approaches a four part study cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 yaeger et al 2012 ye et al 2012 extended the work of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 to investigate the regional patterns of process controls in us catchments the empirical approach by cheng et al 2012 could characterize the separated flow components of fdc with a small number of parameters three parameter gamma distribution a few interesting points from the study are the recognition of parameter distribution patterns for the separated components across the large study area of continental us useful for regionalization efforts additionally the parameter changes revealed when climate input transitioned from one component to another questioning the impact of climate and catchment characteristics on the dynamic system where precipitation cascades ye et al 2012 explored the process controls impacting the variation in regional patterns of mmf which represents the seasonal variability of runoff an important finding was identifying distributive patterns of different dominant processes across the us therefore the study could assign different models with different levels of complexity for different regions depending on the dominant process in the region for example snowmelt was the dominant process in snowy regions from northeast to northwest thus the assigned models were snow based generally from east to west process controls were due to seasonality and north to south due to aridity and temperature more complex models were needed as catchments became too dry in the south and southwest or had major human influences e g agriculture in the midwest higher levels of model complexity identified in areas dominated by human activity will be important to future models incorporating such impacts on their structures coopersmith et al 2012 empirically developed a catchment classification system based on the similarity of daily mmf and identified six dominant classifications which were primarily influenced by climate seasonality thus indicating that catchment similarity is still dominantly determined by climate instead of any other hydrological property yaeger et al 2012 analyzed and synthesized the empirical approach process based approach and classification system of the three preceding studies the importance of the four pronged study is its ability to show regional patterns of large scale distribution of dominant controls on fdc from empirical and process based approaches this strongly suggests that larger distribution patterns exist e g global scale and presents a pioneering opportunity to investigate the process controls and flow characteristics on a global scale from a unified empirical and process based approaches however these studies could not conclusively justify anomalies with different catchments having the same dominant processes yaeger et al 2012 chouaib et al 2018 investigated these limitations in terms of flow variability they obtained that in regions with high precipitation variability catchments displayed flatter fdcs this was mainly influenced by low elevation high storage capacity and well drained soils that caused high infiltration to the lower layers thus enhancing the base flow while bypassing the interflow layer the catchments with low precipitation variability displayed steep fdcs influenced by steep elevation low storage capacity and low infiltration rates causing dominant subsurface stormflow and surface flow chouaib et al 2019 further investigated the conditions under which mmf could be used to estimate the fdc shape in perennial eastern us catchments fdcs were divided into three sections high middle and low at 33 and 66 exceedance probability intervals see sawicz et al 2011 the catchments were classified as high or low flow variability depending on the slope of the fdc sfdc the study found that estimating fdc with mmf was only possible for the middle section of catchments with low flow variability flatter sfdc see also leong and yokoo 2017 but not in high and low flow sections where there were varying degrees of climate and landscape process interactions furthermore mmf could not be used to estimate any of the three sections in catchments with high flow variability steep sfdc indicating that the seasonality alone is not enough to explain the controls in such catchments due to the level of complex processes existing within it therefore there is a need to have a collective and updated literature on the boundaries and conditions of the levels of complexity in terms of model development especially with model complexity expected to be higher in drier or human impacted areas cheng et al 2012 ye et al 2012 and the need to introduce new data types hrachowitz et al 2013 forecasting even more complex modeling systems few studies have investigated the relationship between model complexity and fdc process controls for example farmer et al 2003 investigated the cause of water balance differences in temperate and semiarid catchments in australia a simple water balance model based on the top down modeling approach klemeš 1983 was gradually increased in complexity to recognize the water balance signatures over different spatial and time scales supported by related studies e g atkinson et al 2002 zhang et al 2008a the study found that the complexity of model structures depends on the climate and changing timescales it means a combination of high aridity and shorter timescales would expect a more complex model than reversing the conditions this finding is essential because a required model structure could explain the relationship between catchment s adaptation to climate and geology sivapalan 2018 it could also provide a better interpretation of this relationship model structural improvements can be a pathway to improve performance the current hydrological environment dominated by fixed model structure results in high inaccuracies and uncertainties in streamflow predictions blöschl et al 2013 for example son and sivapalan 2007 introduced an extra auxiliary input to represent the unsaturated zone time delay the model performance improved and demonstrated the importance of using timing information and new data types to develop model structures earlier atkinson et al 2002 farmer et al 2003 and jothityangkoon et al 2001 examined minimum levels of model complexities by estimating its parameters using only rainfall and runoff data however using only these datasets has been proven to output unrealistic model structures uhlenbrook et al 1999 as earlier mentioned for the need to introduce more timing information in fdcs to improve performance these studies showed that fdc timing information could be indirectly introduced in model structures studies have stressed the importance of applying efficient and effective modes that better capture natural catchment behavior when implementing strategies regarding timing information for instance choosing exponential or power functions in hydrograph recessional analysis matters tashie et al 2020 additionally identifying recession patterns for individual events instead of merged recessions before fitting the recession exponent is essential müller et al 2014 4 3 3 inductive approaches the patterns of how the fdc shape changes between different components of a disaggregated fdc which is precipitation cascading through the dynamic system as high middle and low flows e g cheng et al 2012 emphasize the importance of understanding the connectivity or reliance between these components on a larger scale ghotbi et al 2020a b proposed a framework that measured the dependency between empirically derived fast and slow flows in humid and arid catchments they obtained in both types of catchments the dependency quantified by kendall s τ was dominantly controlled by precipitation and increased as aridity intensified therefore a higher dependency existed in drier catchments than in humid ones explaining the higher level of model complexities needed in such drier areas e g cheng et al 2012 ye et al 2012 although the framework required statistically fitting empirically derived fast and slow flows the study can significantly improve the future of process based studies from its originality in capturing the dependence between flows further investigation is needed to explore the dependencies not only between high and low flows but also as precipitation cascades in different components of a flexible model structure that better represents the full dynamic system process interactions within the hydrologic system are better interpreted in the form of flexible model structures for example an interpretation of the dominant processes that shaped fdc leong and yokoo 2019b found that wet catchments under humid climate conditions had more dominant processes occurring toward deeper underground layers at slower rates illustrating perennial shapes however dry catchments under arid conditions had ephemeral shaped fdcs because they had fewer dominant processes that occurred faster near the surface similar to ye et al 2012 the study also found that catchments with significant differences in climate do not necessarily have the same model structures thus questioning the approach of using fixed model structures in different environments especially in a global context the model structure leong and yokoo 2019b interpreted the processes within the underground layer it was developed from recession analysis of multiple hydrograph separations e g yokoo et al 2017 characterized by unique characteristic time constants per separation similar approaches on the importance of timescales in developing process based models e g carrillo et al 2011 kavetski et al 2011 muneepeerakul et al 2010 son and sivapalan 2007 have contributed to structural improvements and fdc performances the differences are the level of complexities in the representative equations and theoretical assumptions studies have shown a correlation between aridity and model complexity e g cheng et al 2012 farmer et al 2003 ye et al 2012 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 therefore exploring the dependency measure ghotbi et al 2020a b between the flow components of a model structure could be treated to quantify complexities between flow components thus leading to an overall quantification of model structural complexity and potentially measure uncertainty regardless of the spatio temporal scales or specific goals for reproduction or interpretation of fdc these studies have made significant contributions in expanding the knowledge of process controls impacting the fdc shape from the current literature it is quite certain that the high and middle flow parts of fdc are strongly connected to precipitation and seasonality respectively thus both are impacted dominantly by climate however there are still contrasting arguments regarding the middle especially the low flow part i e fdc tails the literature indicates two arguments studies that argue landscape properties are the dominant factor e g geology and soils whereas others still recognize the climate as the dominant control these contrasting studies highlight fragmentation or disconnection in hydrologic literature related to understanding fdc process controls especially for low flows a quantitative measure of how much control a dominant process has in the middle and low flows is yet to be determined thus such a clearer understanding or an affirmative distinction is needed this may require a small scale collaborative effort that specifically works on developing a generalized process based modeling framework for fdcs 4 3 4 flexible modeling frameworks process based model structural improvements have been shown to improve performance and the interpretation of dominant processes impacting fdc e g chouaib et al 2018 2019 farmer et al 2003 son and sivapalan 2007 leong and yokoo 2019b in the context of global scale applicability future improvements to fdc studies potentially lie in the development of robust flexible modeling frameworks that originate from data based modeling concepts with the least uncertainties however developing such robust frameworks will prove challenging as model uncertainty evaluation and realism studies still need significant breakthroughs in hydrologic literature even though quantifying these has been of interest in these past two decades e g butts et al 2004 euser et al 2013 knoben et al 2020 müller and thompson 2016 2019 van emmerick et al 2015 the need for flexible modeling systems is well documented in hydrologic literature beven 2000 blöschl et al 2013 clark et al 2011 2015 coxon et al 2019 mendoza et al 2015 several flexible modeling frameworks have been presented for example decipher coxon et al 2019 which simulates streamflow across a large spatial scale or fuse clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 summa clark et al 2015 marrmot knoben et al 2019 and raven craig 2020 which allows the manipulation of the structure together with parameters and inputs mai et al 2020 however there is still a need for systems that are adjustable or adaptable to changes within the catchments and can also be applied across larger spatial scales beven and alcock 2012 blair et al 2019 blöschl et al 2013 yet few such models exist coxon et al 2019 the hydrological processes that drive transport processes are non stationary and not that well understood beven and alcock 2012 thus it is essential to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions müller and thompson 2016 compared the performance of statistical models against process based models in nepal for stationary and non stationary situations the uncertainties were caused by parameter interpolation and process assumptions for statistical and process based models respectively however the process based models performed better than statistical models especially for non stationary climate situations which are more naturally occurring and important to pub and global scale applicability therefore the challenge of developing flexible process based model structures is to improve the ability to capture the realism of the natural or human impacted environment in catchments for example how to clearly define dominant processes instead of assuming the processes or using non stationary events and nonlinear relationships in place of conventional stationary and linear relationships respectively the introduction of timing information from hydrograph recessional behaviors e g botter 2010 muneepeerakul et al 2010 yilmaz et al 2008 have added more insights into the development and evaluation of flexible modeling frameworks e g fenicia et al 2011 kavetski et al 2011 catchment processes are unique resulting in a unique illustration of the streamflow time series active at different timescales therefore a catchment requires a unique model representing its processes often referred to as the uniqueness of place approach beven 2000 this presents a model choice dilemma with the one model fits all approach knoben et al 2020 which views hydrological processes as the same everywhere regardless of choice often these have a fixed representation of spatial variability e g a single spatial structure or single model structure mai et al 2020 this partly affects model transfer and applications when dealing with water challenges over wide spatial scales coxon et al 2019 for this reason improvements to large scale transferability and applicability of fdc studies require the development of robust flexible modeling frameworks more importantly it also requires developing those that simultaneously satisfy the uniqueness of place and one model fits all approaches a recent study comparing models 36 lumped conceptual model structures across 559 catchments in the us knoben et al 2020 showed that model suitability was less related to catchment descriptors e g geology soil and vegetation and more determined by streamflow regime generated by the catchment such large scale investigations are necessary if the integration of model structural approaches are to determine a common or transferable indicator across a global scale 5 conclusions and future outlook in this paper we presented a collection of fdc literature 2000 2020 highlighting current studies that attempted to relate climate and catchment attributes to reproduce fdc or explain the process controls on the fdc shape we categorized the studies into two groups 1 studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate and 2 studies that improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains we intended to show the current trends in each group point out some advantages and major limitations and identify potential future research directions that will contribute to the global scale application of fdc studies due to the enormous volume of literature available on fdc studies within this time frame we acknowledge that some important aspects of the intended review may have been omitted or only briefly discussed additionally others whose contents are dense and are only generally referred to will warrant a more thorough review the following points present a few highlights taken from this review paper studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate continue to dominate fdc studies due to their versatility in directly addressing immediate local needs thus making such approaches popular among water specialists although few studies have successfully attempted to transfer apply developed models to different areas the success of these studies are generally at smaller or regional scales the developed models are often confined to the regions where they were developed since such approaches have already been deemed successful in those areas the new challenge is developing and improving empirical models that can be successfully transferred and consistently applied on large scales this is important for countries that rely on the expertise and professionalism of hydrologically resourceful nations to improve water resource management and policymaking a small group of studies attempted to investigate the fdc process controls on a larger scale empirically they have suggested emerging patterns which are promising and require more attention thus it may be more worthwhile for large scale applications to develop an empirical understanding of large scale process distribution instead of repeating the general trend of simply developing empirical functions at smaller scales the benefit of using a large pool of catchments is evident if we explore process heterogeneity as a major challenge to fdc studies however only few studies have used large e g continental datasets more effort is required to apply a larger pool of catchments and a larger distribution of catchments the latter may be more important furthermore the current success of small scale or regional studies is often due to the homogenous treatment of catchments producing results that range within a status quo as a small step toward expanding areal coverage better evaluating homogenous results and reducing biases research may need to intentionally introduce anomalies that are disconnected from the study to incite constructive arguments this will expand the study coverage and provide better comparative and contrastive analysis within the study group such initiative would raise new questions test large scale applicability and draw interest to lesser studied areas especially in non resourceful developing countries despite the hydrological community s advocating of readily available and accessible data non resourceful countries still lag in providing such a service if significant progress is to be made these areas require better administrative policies on having their data freely available and accessible online this is clear in the lack of representation in fdc literature for developing island countries where data are usually not freely accessible with further administrative requirements and procedures potentially deflecting interest furthermore innovative and alternative data sources e g citizen data and crowdsourcing which will improve the hydrological agenda in such countries require development and suitable implementation techniques lastly scarce literature exists on islands and there is a need to pay the same level of attention to island hydrology as is given to continental hydrology within the past two decades much has been understood about processes controlling different fdc sections however there are still contrasting arguments on whether fdc low flows i e fdc tail are controlled by climate or landscape properties despite the amount of process knowledge gained on the generating mechanisms of low flows this shows the fragmentation of fdc studies that may require a small collaborative effort by concerned researchers to develop a general framework for process based modeling of fdcs past reviews e g hrachowitz et al 2013 smakhtin 2001 highlighted the need for anthropogenic inclusivity in hydrological modeling however there have been few advancements in fdc studies when quantifying human impact on water resources especially from a process based perspective such impacts are increasingly becoming part of the internal hydrological system if necessary in the future human activities may need to be potentially considered as an artificial dominant surface process and introduced with new data types as part of the hydrological modeling system the development of better flexible modeling frameworks could contribute to the successful transfer and application of fdc studies globally several studies have recently evaluated the performances of empirical and process based approaches and collectively suggested that combining these two approaches improves performances therefore further exploration and strategies of model combinations between the two approaches and the development of new robust flexible modeling frameworks could significantly help progress fdc studies in larger spatial scales especially in non stationary environments the major weakness of fdc is its failure to synchronically capture the timing information of streamflow however recent improvements in indirectly introducing timing information in empirical and process based approaches increase performance for reproduction or interpretation for example process based approaches have used better timing detail as part of the model structural development therefore new innovative approaches are required to include timing information while understanding the intricacies of the choices in the timing details e g timescales

4034,this paper reviews the current status of flow duration curve fdc studies that attempt to relate climate and catchment attributes to reproduce or explain the process controls on its shape toward improving global scale applicability and transferability of fdc studies a collection of fdc literature from the past two decades is presented 2000 2020 they are grouped as exemplifying either 1 studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate and 2 studies that improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains we show some of the general characteristics for each group highlighting some major limitations and advantages then we discuss potential future research directions in the context of improving the global scale applicability transferability of fdc studies group 1 dominates fdc literature since the inception of fdc although some studies have been successfully applied at large spatio temporal scales such approaches are often empirical thus they are usually applicable only in the regions of model development often in hydrologically resourceful countries with densely gaged networks that make it easier to transfer information between catchments a major impediment to progress is the lack of process input in empirical models resulting in an inability to generate flexible functions applicable across larger scales it is from this perspective that process based approaches are becoming popular among studies in group 2 process based approaches explicitly attempt to identify and understand the process controls on fdc thus they appear more advantageous although they have yet to be tested at global scales furthermore there are still some contrasting issues regarding the processes that govern fdc shapes there is a need to develop a general framework for process based modeling of fdc finally even though much has already been achieved at regional scales through both approaches the new challenge is to consistently replicate the successes on a global scale keywords flow duration curve empirical process based spatio temporal scales model structures flexible modeling frameworks 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is arguably one of the most commonly used tools in modern hydrology it embodies the chinese proverb that a picture is worth a thousand words vogel and fennessey 1995 zhang 2017 it is a simple graphical image that contains considerable amounts of valuable hydrological information thus enabling it to illustrate precipitation cascading through the dynamic system and present it in the frequency domain ghotbi et al 2020a for example the degree of steepness of an fdc slope represents a catchment s ability to store or dispel precipitation yilmaz et al 2008 enabling educated assumptions about the underlying geological features of the catchment fdc represents the frequency distribution of streamflow for a specific period smakhtin 2001 vogel and fennessey 1994 it is essentially an effective and alternative representation of the cumulative distribution function of streamflow yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the fdc shape is unique to a catchment it is determined by the hydrologic heterogeneity in the catchments this includes climate soil vegetation elevation topography physiography geomorphology and land use interacting at different time and spatial scales to output unique streamflow responses castellarin et al 2013 the resultant shape exhibits distinct information of these interacting processes it has been employed over generations ever since its first recorded use in 1889 by clemens and herschel foster 1934 however its productibility peaked at the time of the computer age fienberg 1979 because of improvement in precision and its ability to be effectively implemented and yield good results across various fields encompassing hydrology kim and kaluarachchi 2014 mohamoud 2008 requena et al 2018 shu and ouarda 2012 therefore even though considered traditional its usage strongly persists in modern hydrology however a persistent major weakness is the failure to capture timing information on streamflow synchronically the wide range of fdc literature includes studies related to water quality e g babbar sebens and karthikeyan 2009 johnson et al 2009 letcher et al 2002 morrison and bonta 2008 sediment studies e g powell et al

policy makers on water related issues ever since water specialists have become concerned with the potential impacts of climate change coopersmith et al 2014 singh 2018 and human impacts on the water cycle in this anthropocene era hrachowitz et al 2013 for example the water resources commission project in south africa hughes 2005 and european union s water framework directive and floods directive coxon et al 2019 additionally the prediction in ungaged basins pub sivapalan et al 2003 initiative an international collaborative effort that sought to improve reliable pub remains a core part of fdc studies as it is impossible to gage remote river network systems completely due to restricted site accessibility and prohibitive economic costs the pub challenge is crucial to global water resources management because the greatest human impacts on water systems occur in these ungaged areas sivapalan 2003 there are a few extant comprehensive reviews of fdc literature searcy 1959 provided the earliest followed by vogel and fennessey 1994 1995 smakhtin 2001 reviewed its contributions to low flow hydrology while castellarin et al 2013 compiled and synthesized efforts developed during the decade long international association of hydrological sciences iahs pub initiative 2003 2013 established by the global hydrology community to solve recurring water challenges at the turn of the century blöschl et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 few other summary style reviews exist beyond for example castellarin et al 2004b there are two types of fdc curves period of record fdc por fdc and annual fdc afdc leboutillier and waylen 1993 vogel and fennessey 1994 por fdc is constructed from the entire length period of observation whereas afdc is constructed annually for both constructions see castellarin et al 2004b smakhtin 2001 the choice between por fdc and afdc is often debated however it should be determined primarily by the water problem at hand instead of ideas of superiority since both representations should be used complementarily castellarin et al 2004b for instance afdc is useful for capturing annual streamflow regime variations within a year variations or during changeovers in a particularly wet or dry hydrological year vogel and fennessey 1994 on the other hand por fdc is a steady state representation of the long term streamflow regime and can be effectively used in patching and extending streamflow data hughes and smakhtin 1996 the accurate streamflow estimation is a key component to solving most water related issues e g proper water resource management or the planning and development of hydropower infrastructures these demands can be met with fdcs which can further provide important information on the variation in availability and reliability of surface water to meet societal needs while maintaining a balanced distribution of water in nature müller et al 2014 although newer developments have focused on interpreting the process controls on fdcs its reproduction remains the main interest thus current levels of fdc application have generally remained the same as those previously mentioned in the review of vogel and fennessey 1994 1995 empirical reproduction of fdcs at local spatio temporal scales has been the dominant interest to hydrologists because of fdc s ability to be properly estimated and help solve water problems at such scales consequently considerable empirical knowledge has been gained with regard to investigating controls that impact its shape however the literature suggests or emphasizes a critical limitation of local scaled empirical developments i e the successful application transferability of the developed models across larger spatial scales e g continental or global scale exhibiting many different catchment behaviors are typically lacking in hydrology blöschl et al 2013 castellarin et al 2013 cheng et al 2012 chouaib et al 2018 2019 fennessey and vogel 1990 ghotbi et al 2020a müller and thompson 2016 sadegh et al 2016 yaeger et al 2012 ye et al 2012 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 therefore the developed models are often confined to the regions from which the functions were empirically derived potentially explaining the success of these empirical approaches in regionalization methods as a precursor to estimation in ungaged catchments yokoo and sivapalan 2011 in this context longstanding limitations force us to question whether traditional empirical approaches are successfully looping i e even though empirical methods continue to evolve and make progress in their developmental regions the problems associated with global scale application remain however most current hydrologic models remain empirical they will continue to be empirical due to their simplicity and suitability in providing water managers and decision makers with accurate fdc predictions tools and uncertainties compatible with operational purposes and practical applications in operational hydrology castellarin et al 2013 given that the shape of fdc is determined by precipitation variability and a cascading dynamic system where water transports laterally and vertically through the catchment deciphering the processes interacting between climate and catchment characteristics over large spatio temporal scales and domains has lately become an integral part of fdc studies in this context process based approaches have become popular and preferred over empirical approaches because they can explicitly relate climate and catchment characteristics over larger spatial scales blum et al 2017 this is important for addressing future global hydrological challenges since the difficulty for water specialists to successfully apply region specific methods on larger scales delays progress in achieving safer global water security especially in underdeveloped countries the objective of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the current status of studies that attempt to relate climate and catchment attributes to reproduce fdcs or explain the process controls on its shape due to the enormous literature available this paper considers fdc studies in the past two decades 2000 2020 we categorize the literature according to the spatio temporal contexts of studies 1 those studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climatic and 2 those studies that improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains for each category we show some general trends point out major limitations and advantages and discuss potential future research directions in the context of improving the global scale applicability transferability of fdc studies 2 outline of the review fig 1 shows a brief outline of the two categories of fdc literature in terms of the progression of fdc model developments at different spatio temporal scales group 1 studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climatic usually have operational objectives they are generally empirical and applicable at smaller scales i e local regional these areas are usually well gaged at specific scales thus they can be approached with empirically derived fdcs that require no model structure e g vogel and fennessey 1994 as the transfer of models between hydrologically similar catchments become important for solving water issues at local regional scales the models can either be empirical castellarin et al 2004b or process based botter et al 2007c with fixed structures group 2 studies seek to improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains due to the transferable limitations of small scale operational objectified studies to larger scales thus these studies are often process based they either have fixed model or flexible model structures however recent studies have focused more on improving the flexibility of model structures e g leong and yokoo 2019b ye et al 2012 the literature suggested that the combination of empirical and process based approaches significantly improves fdc performances in different areas therefore the approach for transferring applying fdc models across larger spatio temporal scales e g global scales is potentially a robust flexible structural framework that includes empirical and process based approaches 3 developing accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate the traditional methods for deriving fdcs or exploring process controls targeting specific regions and hydro climate are empirically based due to their usability for operational purposes these methods can be broadly classified into non parametric graphical and parametric statistical methods the non parametric graphical methods explore climate and physiographic characteristics on the fdc shape with a graphical representation however the parametric statistical method uses a statistical distribution to fit fdcs and relate the obtained parameters to the catchment s physical characteristics cheng et al 2012 non parametric graphical methods focus on deriving relationships between fdc signatures e g quantiles or slope and climate catchment characteristics ghotbi et al 2020b for example mohamoud 2008 used the sequential generation scheme identified dominant climate and soil descriptors and developed a step wise multiple regression equations for selected percentiles similarly leong and yokoo 2019a used quantile regression equations to estimate low flows in ephemeral catchments castellarin et al 2004a proposed a non parametric approach that predicts dimensionless fdcs in ungaged catchments through statistical interpolation of empirical dimensionless fdcs constructed from hydrologically similar gaged basins for which hydrological similarity can be interpreted as the inverse of the distance between any pair of basins in a space whose coordinates are functions of morphological and climate descriptors see e g castellarin 2014 zhang 2017 proposed an index gage method to assess the suitable minimum length of streamflow data for estimating representative fdcs the united states geological survey usgs continues to use the approach for pub in us catchments studley 2001 in contrast parametric statistical methods focus on fitting suitable distribution functions to empirically derive fdcs estimate the distribution parameters and develop equations from the relationship between the parameter distribution and climate catchment characteristics ghotbi et al 2020b the graphical and statistical methods are often based on the theory of hydrological similarity extrapolating or transferring information from gaged to ungaged catchments usually within a homogenous region 3 1 paired catchment systems several experimental studies employing paired catchment systems have been used to analyze the impact of vegetation changes on fdc to assess environmental changes based on hydrological similarity in comparative hydrology for example best et al 2003 used three levels of model complexities to identify parameter changes under altered land use conditions the most complex model five parameter achieved the best performance and showed that most parameter changes were related to median flows and proportion of no flow days indicating climate and vegetation controls on the fdc shape the study also noted that it is essential to have a comparative assessment of meteorological years when assessing land use changes due to vegetation a major limitation of assessing fdcs under such changes is that the relative distribution of extreme flows depends on climate variability there are few other similar studies e g zhao et al 2012 and brown et al 2013 the latter also identified the timeframe for catchment recovery to reach equilibrium after changes in forest cover became permanent sikka et al 2003 showed the impacts of changing vegetation type cover and the same crop rotation on low flow regimes apart from paired catchments lane et al 2005 also showed how regime flow changed with afforestation and quantified this impact on the fdc many studies have investigated the impacts of conservation practices on flow regimes over long periods using the rank based non parametric mann kendall test they include vegetation e g huang and zhang 2004 zhang et al 2011 soil e g li et al 2007 mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008b and land use e g zheng et al 2007 practices which have generated insightful views on the importance of connecting theoretical work to fieldwork other notable studies include chappell and tych 2012 and a review by brown et al 2005 these long term experimental studies are essential in recognizing the controls that impact fdc especially when environmental changes are significantly influenced by climate and human activities these studies were generated by different levels of complexities although more complex models delivered better performances e g best et al 2003 it is often argued that higher levels of uncertainty are inherent in such complexities blöschl et al 2013 however quantifying uncertainty is still challenging thus presenting an opportunity for paired catchment systems to better understand uncertainty quantification with theoretical and field work potentially mending the disconnection between theoretical and field hydrology 3 2 regionalization of fdc empirical approaches often require extensive observed data but the earth s surface remains largely ungaged thus fdcs must be estimated rather than measured in such areas müller and thompson 2016 for this reason a highly active area in hydrological research is the development of regionalization methods castellarin et al 2013 müller et al 2014 pumo et al 2014 these are statistical approaches that transfer hydrometric information to ungaged catchments based on climate or catchment similarity of gaged catchments usually within the same region a common practice quantifies the relationships between climate catchment characteristics by stochastically fitting appropriate statistical distributions and estimating its associated parameters to capture the fdc shape yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the expansive requirements in water resources management have led to a global influx of hydrologic literature on regionalization procedures regardless of whether it is related to fdc or not regionalization of fdcs can be categorized as follows group 1 those that are derived from probability distribution statistical approaches and group 2 those that consider a non existent relationship between fdc and probability theory castellarin et al 2004a group 1 approaches first selects a suitable distribution type then the parameters are estimated from the gaged catchment and regression equations are developed for predicting parameters in an ungaged catchment based on the catchment s climate and landscape characteristics yokoo and sivapalan 2011 reportedly some of the commonly used distributions are log normal distribution e g boscarello et al 2016 li et al 2010 beta distribution e g iacobellis 2008 complex kappa distribution e g castellarin et al 2007 and gamma distribution e g botter et al 2007a b c cheng et al 2012 muneepeerakul et al 2010 blum et al 2017 outlined some functioning probability distributions in the us catchments while sadegh et al 2016 summarized some commonly used distributions in hydrology the choice of distributions depends on the location of the undertaken study e g li et al 2010 given that the suitability of distribution functions depends on the local hydrological conditions therefore universal distribution functions may never be discovered at least in the current hydrological modeling environment group 2 contains two sub categories group 2a those that use analytical equations to derive fdcs parametric approaches and 2b those that use standardized graphical representations of fdc with regional validity graphical approaches castellarin et al 2004a which are rarely found within the past two decades a few other conditions for categorizing regionalization methods are described in shu and ouarda 2012 pugliese et al 2014 and zhang 2017 the vast amount of hydrologic literature available to regionalization studies points to the global hydrologic problem of hydrometric data scarcity this is displayed in the global distribution of regionalization studies for example in italy castellarin et al 2004a ganora et al 2009 mendicino and senatore 2013 pumo et al 2014 rianna et al 2011 viola et al 2011 canada shu and ourda 2012 requena et al 2018 iran masih et al 2010 portugal croker et al 2009 uk holmes et al 2002 mcintyre et al 2005 yadav et al 2007 young et al 2000 australia post 2004 taiwan yu et al 2002 zimbabwe mazvimavi et al 2005 malaysia mamun et al 2010 us homa et al 2013 over et al 2018 pool et al 2017 zhang 2017 turkey isik and singh 2008 brazil silva et al 2019 greece niadas 2005 central america westerberg et al 2016 and himalayas singh et al 2001 however since the success of regionalization methods depends on transfer extrapolation of data and knowledge from gaged to ungaged catchments within hydrologically similar catchments such studies are often performed in areas with densely gaged network systems usually in high income developed or developing countries that have rich data and resources hydrologically resourceful countries in this context lack of representation is obvious in low income developing countries especially in small island clusters of the tropical regions e g pacific islands the socio economic problems associated with successful development in such areas are a risk to the fragile nature of island water resources additionally climate change poses an immediate threat to these islands due to rising tides caused by global warming immediate work in such areas could reveal alerting hydrological changes if more immediate attention is directed toward island hydrological studies e g the recent tropical island hydrology training project by the national center for atmospheric research https ral ucar edu projects wrf hydro training materials tropicalislandtraining 3 3 estimating fdcs in ungaged basins parametric statistical the dominant empirical approach for estimating fdcs in ungaged basins are parametric statistical methods compared to non parametric graphical methods or even process based methods for example sadegh et al 2016 proposed a new set of closed form parametric functions derived from soil water characteristics to estimate the fdc shape in catchments with varying hydrologic behaviors see also vrugt and sadegh 2013 costa and fernandes 2020 managed to transfer regional information using the evolutionary polynomial regression technique in australian catchments li et al 2010 proposed a novel semi parametric index model by merging three models partial components linear regression nearest neighbor and hydrological similarity the final compounded index model performed better than the individual models from which it was developed castellarin et al 2013 showing combinations of older models or lesser performing models and approaches strategies or exploratory models e g booker and snelder 2012 fouad and loáiciga 2020 can be a way of improving future model development or performances performance evaluation of statistical and parametric approaches is further discussed in mendicino and senatore 2013 furthermore shao et al 2009 proposed a four parameter double powered function to assess the impact of using the same fdc expressions before and after land use or land cover change the first two hydrological parameters represent mean annual flow and cease to flow point the other two statistical parameters represent the physiographic characteristics they are calibrated from observed data and remain relatively unchanged indicating the dominance of climate variables e g precipitation and temperature change controlling fdc homa et al 2013 developed regression equations to evaluate catchment modification impacts on the hydrologic regime this was analyzed by the difference in natural regime against the altered regime eco change metric it is often considered that dominant controls on fdcs are naturally occurring phenomena e g climate soil and vegetation however studies showed that the anthropogenic impacts characterized by human influence on the hydrological regime are a dominant factor in the hydrological system sivapalan and blöschl 2015 for example in the us catchments cheng et al 2012 and ye et al 2012 found that more complex modeling systems that included such anthropogenic impacts were needed in major agricultural areas of the midwest indicating that human impacts on the hydrological modeling system need to be better quantified and potentially introduced as newer data types hrachowitz et al 2013 although most empirical fdc studies remain statistical and have been successful some underlying issues impact practical runoff estimations in ungaged basins shu and ouarda 2012 sadegh et al 2016 these are due to the distributive assumptions not fully representing the entire shape of fdc fennessey and vogel 1990 over simplifying assumptions müller and thompson 2016 unaccountable anthropogenic impacts and disconnection between hydrology science and hydrology engineering communities hrachowitz et al 2013 requena et al 2018 proposed the functional data analysis fda method that considers the full functional shape of fdc instead of prior assumptive analytical equations that affect its shape to address the issue of not fully representing fdc the study integrated the fda method with multiple regression to develop a functional multiple regression framework that estimates all fdc quantiles in a single regression equation thus it can capture the full fdc shape as opposed to developing regression equations for individual quantiles which is common in traditional regression approaches it is worth nothing that studies that compared impacts of parameterization and generalization of empirical fdc methods e g booker and snelder 2012 found different methods varied performance impacts across the exceedance probability once again drawing attention to the consideration of fdc as a fully functional shape or a proportionate quantile version the index flow method has shown promising efforts regarding this issue by integrating por fdc and afdc in a single functional structure and separating inter annual and intra annual effects on the fdc shape karst et al 2018 for example castellarin et al 2004b proposed a stochastic representation of daily streamflow that could derive fdcs and afdcs therefore it can reproduce the por fdc regardless of the persistence and seasonality of the series rianna et al 2011 the index flow model assumes that daily streamflow is the product of two independent random variables dimensionless daily streamflow and annual flow the dimensionless daily streamflow represents the hydrologic response of the catchment its probability distribution functions are governed by the catchments geomorphologic and climatic characteristics the annual flow represents the index flow which describes the catchments long term climate response castellarin et al 2007 therefore the interpretation of fdc is not impacted by the assumptions of independent and identically distributed dimensionless daily streamflow something previously lacking in statistical methods mendicino and senatore 2013 the index model is a theoretical improvement of leboutillier and waylen 1993 consequently the distributions are complex as demonstrated by castellarin et al 2007 the four parameter kappa distribution required a more intense computation and optimization iacobellis 2008 thus reducing functional flexibility across a wider spatial scale furthermore the notion that more parameters in mathematical expressions output more accurate daily fdc are met with high amounts of uncertainty especially for parameters representing climate and physiographic conditions pugliese et al 2014 this is exacerbated by the fact that apart from the scaling factor all index flow approaches are based on the assumption on a non variable fdc in homogenous regions without introducing process involvement müller and thompson 2016 nevertheless these methods e g castellarin et al 2004b 2007 sauquet and catalogne 2011 have opened pathways for stochastic frameworks in process based modeling of fdc pumo et al 2014 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 other relatable studies include serinaldi s 2011 proposal of analytical confidence intervals for fdcs which was not included in the castellarin et al 2004b framework iacobellis 2008 introduced a six parameter etabeta model to improve the representation of low flows which are scarce in hydrologic literature viola et al 2011 rianna et al 2011 proposed a model to calculate how often a river is dry by combining the stochastic index flow model and the total probability theory in intermittent italian catchments other unrelated stochastic approaches were developed for catchments in japan and thailand by sugiyama et al 2003 they showed that the shape of the lower part of fdc depends on the strength of low flow persistence in turkey cigizoglu and bayazit 2000 estimated fdc as a product of periodic and stochastic streamflow components using the convolution theory in a five parameter harmonic model that can perform parameter reductions post 2004 viola et al 2011 3 4 ephemeral catchments based on a review of low flow hydrology smakhtin 2001 critically mentioned the lack of hydrological studies toward low flows and the need to better understand low flow generating mechanisms in the past two decades there have been developments on ephemeral flows but not significant enough most fdc studies focused on perennial flows viola et al 2011 kirkby et al 2011 or reproduction of perennial low flows and less on explaining the processes that control the low flow sections of fdc especially in ephemeral catchments this is further complicated by the characteristic of ephemeral catchments having discontinuous streamflow pumo et al 2014 and the critical relationship between catchment and climate characteristics at different spatio temporal scales as catchments becomes drier viola et al 2011 proposed a regional model based on two simple parameter functions a parameter for estimating the percentage of time a river is wet or dry and another parameter to estimate fdcs for non zero periods resulting in satisfactory fdc estimations croker et al 2003 proposed two separately modeled components one of the models estimates zero flows as a function of mean annual precipitation and the other estimates non zero flows based on climate and hydrogeology characteristics in semiarid catchments then the components were combined with the total probability theory see rianna et al 2011 to estimate fdcs in ungaged ephemeral catchments leong and yokoo 2019a estimated low flows from global regression equations developed at each quantile of fdc however laaha and blöschl 2006 used seasonality indices to interpret low flow processes at a regional scale they recommended using regional regression instead of global regression approaches e g viola et al 2011 there are some concerns regarding empirical models addressing low flows particularly the treatment of homogenous catchments with normal regional regression approaches see laaha et al 2014 over a large spatial scale e g chalise et al 2003 especially in arid regions therefore from an alternative perspective the inclusion of more process based theory is potentially needed to intensely re examine and better understand how low flow driving mechanisms impact the shape of ephemeral fdcs instead of simply based on empirical reforms e g tallaksen and van lanen 2004 given the importance in the level of intricate detail between climate and catchment characteristics as catchments become drier and the need for more complex modeling systems in arid areas cheng et al 2012 the recent popular approach of separating high and low flow components e g ghotbi et al 2020a is an effective way of expressing low flow generating mechanisms such approaches may be more dominantly applied when addressing fdc low or ephemeral flows 3 5 a major limitation of empirical studies in the past two decades considerable amounts of empirical knowledge have contributed enormously to investigating the controls that shape the fdc of studied catchments especially at local spatio temporal scales however even at such scales some urgent issues that need attention extend and hinder consistent performances over larger scales empirical approaches graphical non parametric and statistical parametric only implicitly capture the net effects of hydrologic processes that contribute to streamflow variability therefore it is challenging to generalize empirical findings from such approaches without explicitly including dominant hydrologic processes and controls ghotbi et al 2020b in other words if one were to think of the several empirical studies reviewed above as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle we have not yet acquired the understanding and methodology to complete that puzzle yokoo and sivapalan 2011 although some studies have successfully transferred models to predict fdcs in ungaged catchments e g castellarin et al 2004a most of the success is due to well gaged catchments within the tested regions blöschl et al 2013 even though much progress has been made in developing mathematical expressions for characterizing streamflow with contrasting hydrologic behaviors to improve the performance of estimating empirical fdcs within these tested regions functions can still be ineffective even at such scales e g sadegh et al 2016 this is due to the inability of the derived functions to cover large scale non stationary conditions milly et al 2008 because of the lack of process knowledge and understanding between climatic and catchment characteristics in the functions under different environments castellarin et al 2013 cheng et al 2012 müller and thompson 2016 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 therefore these approaches are generally successful for operational objectives at local spatio temporal scales but still lacks the ability to transfer models from other regions of development and estimate fdcs at larger scales e g global scale especially in truly ungaged catchments smakhtin et al 2006 reviewed and tested the applicability of some hydrological methods in nepal to show the transfer of models to predict fdcs required further development modification and testing at the study site this highlights the importance for validating the work especially when targeting truly ungaged catchments regardless of the undertaken approach predicting fdcs in truly ungaged catchments will be challenging since there is evidently no way to assess the accuracy of predictions in truly ungaged catchments thus a conjoint effort between prediction and its validation in ungaged catchments needs significant breakthroughs fdc studies are plagued with proposals and model recommendations at ungaged sites without properly validating the estimated fdcs castellarin et al 2004a few recent studies have investigated past theories and identified minor but significant contributions relevant to these much needed breakthroughs for example ridolfi et al 2020 cautioned against the basic assumption of catchments in close proximity hydrologic similarity have the same characteristic fdc hughes and smakhtin 1996 the study mentioned the transfer of information between gaged and ungaged sites in the same time frame can at times be impossible and suggested those ungaged catchments should at least have some data partially gaged to allow a transfer window for information exchange müller and thompson 2019 discussed the goodness of fit metric for performance evaluation and model selection they introduced a new approach of the conditional value of sample information cvsi primarily used for sampling design optimization cvsi is based on the bayesian framework that uses finite sample sized observed data to measure the value of the information and explicitly incorporate the sampling uncertainty of validation data into model validation other related studies for probabilistic forecasting include predictive quantile quantile q q reliability plots e g laio and tamea 2007 and information theory e g weijs et al 2002 additionally few other significant cross validation schemes have been introduced in fdc literature for example bootstrap resampling yu et al 2002 and jack knife cross validation castellarin et al 2004a castellarin et al 2007 considering the challenge in predicting streamflow and validating estimated fdcs in ungaged catchments newer approaches that are not within the scope of this review may have a better advantage for example geostatistical approaches e g castellarin 2014 castiglioni et al 2009 or neural networking e g worland et al 2019 3 6 expanding the areal distribution of studies studies that have used large datasets e g camels addor et al 2017 mopex duan et al 2006 can generate new empirical knowledge and recognize emerging patterns when exploring large scale climate and catchment characteristics controls on the fdc shape e g cheng et al 2012 ghotbi et al 2020a ghotbi et al 2020b this emphasizes the benefit and the need for more global datasets made accessible with whatever is available and wherever possible in different regions of the world especially from low income or developing countries that lack data and resources non resourceful hydrological countries if future studies are to be frequently pursued in these areas or to include these areas moreover if fdc studies decipher global scale processes a larger catchment pool and its areal distribution are necessary this can be approached through innovative and alternative data sources such as surface water and ocean topography swot mission e g biancamaria et al 2016 huang et al 2020 citizen data and crowdsourcing e g candhy nardi et al 2021 or artificial intelligence and machine deep learning methods see shen et al 2021 which have already begun conditioning future hydrological agenda the inclusion and global expansion of such methods will be important to boost global scale hydrological research thus alleviating data scarcity issues in low income regions of the world and offering fruitful opportunities for integrating and supporting process oriented research with rich and extensive datasets therefore more collaborative effort is required between resourceful and non resourceful countries to implement these approaches and have the resulting datasets widely available few other notable achievements in large scale studies have investigated large scale distributive patterns of fdc characteristics for example cheng et al 2012 and sawicz et al 2011 revealed interesting parameter and fdc slope distribution patterns respectively across the continental us however such studies could not explain the anomalies within the successful identification of these distributive patterns therefore there is still difficulty in empirically finding or explaining the regional process functioning patterns across large areas chouaib et al 2018 yaeger et al 2012 furthermore these studies demonstrate the need and advantage of using a larger catchment pool hrachowitz et al 2013 knoben et al 2020 that can generate a larger distribution of process knowledge especially identifying anomalies that could be looked at in future studies a drawback of only working with catchments within the same region is the expected results likely to occur within a status quo because of a priori assumptions of hydrologic similarity within a homogenous region as a way of expanding the coverage of studies reducing biases and presenting results out of the ordinary small scale regional studies could intentionally include an anomaly a catchment disconnected from the region the goal of the anomaly could be similar to cross validation while identifying what works and does not work on a larger scale with the currently used local regional models an anomaly identified as part of the original study should not be considered because of the potential errors and uncertainties with data or study the intentional inclusion of anomalies intentionally incites constructive arguments within the study based on the argumentative theory predictions and empirical evidence mercier 2016 the fundamental asymmetry between production and evaluation explains the effects of reasoning in different contexts the more debate and conflict between opinions there is the more the argument evaluation prevails over argument production resulting in better outcomes mercier 2016 this approach argumentative hydrology should supplement the importance of having blind tests in studies and rub against the grain of the presented study to potentially present better comparative and contrastive analysis such initiative would generate future questions and ideas to be explored it would also expand the coverage of studies to potentially include non resourceful countries especially nurture interest in such areas however a clearly defined approach is required and will need a deeper discussion on the way forward exploring these anomalies of what goes against normality can be one way of accepting studies that are unordinary hrachowitz et al 2013 3 7 overview studies that focus on developing accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate are dominated by empiricism they are highly effective for water resources management wrm at such scales a prominent advantage of the empirical approach is its versatility especially in operational hydrology unfortunately the versatility causes the approach to be rigid especially when addressing global scale pub which usually requires the spatial interpolation of observed statistics or model parameters blöschl et al 2013 this is further complicated when natural phenomena encounter unexpected changes or non stationary conditions therefore the extrapolation transfer of known results becomes difficult in time and space blöschl et al 2013 müller and thompson 2016 however such studies will remain highly influential in fdc literature due to their effectiveness in addressing wrm needs at local scales the extrapolation transfer of fdc information between catchments based on the theory of hydrologic similarity needs a timing window where gaged and partially gaged sites can transfer information ridolfi et al 2020 this emphasizes the need for timing information to be more incorporated into fdc studies even though the timing is non existent in fdcs for example such approaches could explore better information extraction techniques from the hydrograph and its recessional analysis e g tashie et al 2020 additionally it could explore the dominant processes thoroughly and improve uncertainty with time based model constructions before probability and cumulative distributions can be used to derive empirical fdcs recent studies on identifying fdc controls have increasingly become more process intuitive often stochastically and may have an advantage over purely empirical approaches however studies have shown that combining the two approaches empirical and process based improves performances e g booker and woods 2014 müller and thompson 2016 müller et al 2014 thus implying that a conjoint effort between both approaches will be more beneficial in future studies than as an individual unit there have been many successful attempts made at local and regional scales to reproduce and express empirical fdcs however much of these regional successes are due to the homogenous treatment of catchments in densely gaged countries or hydrologically resourceful regions blöschl et al 2013 therefore the new challenge is replicating these successes e g costa and fernandes 2021 on larger spatial scales especially in non resourceful developing countries 4 improving our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains 4 1 the need for a general conceptual framework in the past two decades several attempts have been made from different perspectives to increase the process knowledge that impacts hydrological behaviors in catchments for example from a chemical analysis perspective shope 2016 investigated the partitioning of hydrologic flow at different elevations and events in south korea for a mountainous mesoscale catchment in scotland soulsby et al 2003 soulsby et al 2004 used the hydrograph separation method informed by tracer behaviors to investigate the interaction between runoff processes and landscape characteristics furthermore sueker et al 2000 explored streamflow generation and acidic decomposition mechanisms during snowmelt for six alpine and subalpine catchments in the us from other viewpoints burlando and rosso 2002 downscaled the general circulation model to investigate the effect of transient climate change on the hydrologic processes norbiato et al 2009 used runoff coefficients as an indicator to assess catchment response in the italian alps jencso et al 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 investigated the hydrologic connectivity from streamflow response to hillslope inputs and landscape properties and bouaziz et al 2020 used satellite analysis for root zone storage estimation performance analyses have been conducted to evaluate the process consistency in hydrological models e g fovet et al 2015 metrics of low flows e g pfannerstill et al 2014 controls on parameter transfer from gaged to ungaged catchments e g singh et al 2014 and hydrologic functioning gallart et al 2008 these studies represent significant improvements in understanding hydrological processes however the successes have not been translated into a collective and fundamental understanding of process controls on fdcs this indicates the existing fragmentation within fdc studies for empirical and process based approaches at any spatio temporal scale ever since the fdc development despite the fragmentation issue in hydrological studies being a core component in establishing the pub initiative in 2003 therefore there is a need for more collaborative effort to chart a common goal in fdc studies to share and develop new ideas and data that are globally tested hrachowitz et al 2013 in developed and developing countries especially in developing island countries which seem to be invisible in process based hydrologic literature process based models are becoming popular among studies that attempt to estimate streamflow in ungaged catchments because they explicitly relate climate and catchment characteristics blum et al 2017 especially when water specialist depends on knowledge to quantify unobservable underground processes sivakumar 2008 however the challenge in process based modeling is to quantify many processes occurring at different spatial and timescales within a catchment beven 2000 sivapalan 2003 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 this is even more challenging when fdc has no timing information embedded in it and the existence of more complexity and heterogeneity than earlier assumed blöschl et al 2013 yaeger et al 2012 therefore following similar calls for a unified hydrologic theory in process based modeling e g harman and troch 2014 harte 2002 hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan 2003 2005 sivapalan et al 2003 wagener et al 2013 there is a need to develop a general conceptual framework for process based modeling of fdc cheng et al 2012 ghotbi et al 2020a b yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the current approaches that improve our process understanding use the stochastic characterization of streamflow time series or physically based process based models to interpret processes and reconstruct fdc across large spatio temporal scales and domains there are two approaches probabilistic approaches and data based models the probabilistic approaches extend existing analytical solutions for probability density functions of streamflow müller et al 2014 however the data based models use conceptual modeling frameworks this approach can be subdivided into two approaches deductive top down approach and inductive bottom up approach deductive approaches rely heavily on a priori assumptions as the basis of the model the findings on the relationship between fdc and the modeled processes are interpreted within the model s assumptions however inductive approaches have considerably less reliance on a priori assumptions this approach has the advantage of being adjustable and flexible to hydrological processes unique to the catchments 4 2 probabilistic approaches 4 2 1 stochastic modeling frameworks the recent introduction of ecohydrological principles in probabilistic modeling of fdc has made more effort to mechanistically connect drivers state and dynamic response of the system by analytically deriving probability functions from basic assumptions of the stochastic structure of rainfall and system response müller and thompson 2016 although these approaches existed in few past literature e g rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 they have been reintroduced and made popular after several studies by botter et al 2007a b c and subsequent related studies the pioneering theoretical framework by botter et al 2007c based on the probabilistic modeling of baseflow resulted in developing an analytical probabilistic model for characterizing streamflow response the model focused on the frequency distribution gamma distribution of slow leaching prone components of the hydrologic response or baseflow the model s functions were derived from three key assumptions based on the dominant process controls in the subsurface drainage system poisson rainfall stochastic rainfall linear evapotranspiration losses and linear baseflow recession the study showed few simple but important parameters related to soil moisture dynamics characteristic residence time or recession time constants and stationary rainfall events could be used to reproduce the base flow component of fdc controlled by the ratio of the runoff frequency and recession time constant of baseflow botter et al 2007b transformed the original framework from spatially lumped to a distributed model to identify the effects of spatial variability of catchment properties e g vegetation soils and complex geomorphology they obtained that wet climate had a significant impact on the heterogeneity of the underlying properties especially at lower runoff affecting the distribution function of the baseflow therefore the subsurface probabilistic structure of baseflow was mainly controlled by climate geomorphology and the distribution of soil and vegetation features the impacts on the probabilistic structure were further analyzed by botter et al 2007a they compared gaged catchment distributions with the original gamma distribution at daily and annual timescales across a wider spatial scale in the continental us botter et al 2008 following the progression of studies noting improvements in model performances surrounding nonlinear storage discharge relationships e g kirchner 2009 instead of linear relationships botter et al 2009 explored these nonlinear relationships in its pioneering theoretical framework the performance improvement in the nonlinear approach was later confirmed by ceola et al 2010 especially for high flows regardless of the hydro climate basso et al 2015 this shows that future process based modeling frameworks will strongly consider nonlinear approaches as opposed to linear storage discharge relationships furthermore given the need for more investigations on how humans impact the water cycle in this generation hrachowitz et al 2013 future studies that can quantify the human and anthropogenic influence on the system will be crucial for fdc modeling frameworks therefore such impacts may need to be considered part of its natural regime and potentially included as a dominant process depending on the catchment if considered the variability in human behavior affecting or altering land use will be challenging for empirical models to quantify such changes at large scales thus stochastic approaches e g botter 2014 botter et al 2010 are suitable for such conditions the approach should investigate the variability of seasonal flow regimes caused by climate and natural catchment characteristics as well as climate and complex landscape changes caused by human activity thus providing insights into probabilistically quantifying unnatural land use changes human induced impacting streamflow regimes 4 2 2 extended developments in the absence of streamflow data in ungaged catchments the framework s ability to extend and develop methods with fewer parameters and low calibration is essential to wrm for example doulatyari et al 2015 derived model parameters from only climate and geomorphologic data and successfully applied them in 38 catchments across the continental us although successful in deriving analytical frameworks that independently model the effects of climate and landscape the original framework botter et al 2007c and its subsequent studies in some way can be highly assumptive about the spatial homogeneity of catchments müller and thompson 2016 for instance the rainfall application as the poisson process or specific assumptions made to predict runoff coefficients and recession time constants are still open to further discussion and interpretation doulatyari et al 2015 the successes of these studies are correlated with empirical limitations in that the analytical framework is applicable only within the regions of development or densely gaged regions nevertheless further investigation of the framework continues to improve the fdc processes knowledge for example muneepeerakul et al 2010 included the fast flow component and interestingly addressed the time scale differences in processes contributing to streamflow pumo et al 2013 2014 addressed the application in ephemeral catchments in 2013 they investigated the impact of vegetation interception in reducing rainfall by introducing a temperature based parameter however they developed an afdc assessment model modaba in their later study to characterize the high and low flows see also croker et al 2003 viola et al 2011 for water resource management botter et al 2010 assessed the impacts of damming rivers they strongly suggested the inclusion of anthropogenic e g agriculture regulation effect on the full hydrologic regime of the river indicating the need to include and quantify such impacts even in process based approaches other related works with more practical relevance include the production optimization and profitability of run of river hydropower plants while considering downstream minimum environmental flow requirements basso and botter 2012 müller et al 2014 addressed the original framework s assumption of using the poisson process and intra annual variation afdc they developed a five parameter model with minimum calibration that captured the inter annual variation of por fdc in seasonally dry climates the new framework developed for seasonally dry climates was successfully analyzed in run of river power plants in nepal such approaches highlight a promising future for developing more versatile process based models with minimum calibration and parameterization furthermore these address the need for fdc studies to connect the developed science to engineering hydrology which is typically lacking in practical hydrology studies castellarin et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 4 2 3 common limitations the collective studies related to the probabilistic dynamic framework botter et al 2007c have made incredible improvements to process based modeling of fdc especially for pub e g doulatyari et al 2015 such probabilistic approaches have significantly improved the process knowledge and understanding between climate and catchment relationships however a significant limitation of the framework and common to similar process based modeling approaches is the dependence on the assumptions of integrated processes blum et al 2017 i e simplifying assumptions about spatial homogeneity of catchments müller and thompson 2016 such assumptions cause models to be less versatile than empirical approaches for instance the poisson rainfall had constant parameters that were only applicable to the season it was assigned to and the carryover of seasonal soil moisture was ignored thus restricting the framework s applicability to seasons different from wet ones cheng et al 2012 ghotbi et al 2020a b this generally resulted in the limited ability to address seasonal changes yaeger et al 2012 therefore affecting the derivation of afdc for catchments with strong seasonality nevertheless with a small number of parameters and calibration of climate and catchment characteristics the framework has the advantage of independently modeling the impacts of climate and landscape müller and thompson 2016 however given that probabilistic approaches are reliant or based on streamflow data and can interpret the probabilistic characteristics it cannot be used to predict fdcs in truly ungaged basins without the empirical relationship between the probabilistic model parameters and fdc shape therefore in the context of deriving model parameters in the absence of streamflow data doulatyari et al 2015 which successfully predicted streamflow with only climate and geomorphologic data which is increasingly available in ungaged basins due to better remote sensing technologies müller and thompson 2016 is a feature example of progressing the stochastic dynamic framework in regions that lack gaged densities e g non resourceful developing countries and streamflow data thus the probabilistic approaches show promising potential for future studies to expand globally and outside the homogenous treatment of catchments 4 3 data based approaches 4 3 1 fdc disaggregation framework a significant study extending the probabilistic dynamic framework botter et al 2007c to substantially improve the understanding of controls of climate and catchment attributes on fdc is the yokoo and sivapalan 2011 fdc framework they conducted numerical analysis deductive approach in hypothetical catchments using a physically based water balance model and varying combinations of climate input e g potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and landscape properties e g soil type and depth they obtained that fdc can predominantly be disaggregated into two components an fdc for fast flows governed by precipitation and an fdc for slow flows governed by catchment seasonality and can be modeled as a function of mean monthly flows mmf furthermore in the context of pub a conceptual framework was proposed by disaggregating fdc into 1 a fast flow component governed by a filtered version of precipitation duration curve 2 a slow flow component governed by the mmf and 3 a correction to slow fdc to capture the effects of high evapotranspiration at low flows yokoo and sivapalan 2011 although the disaggregation framework yokoo and sivapalan 2011 was hypothetically conducted the study has been confirmed in actually gaged catchments e g cheng et al 2012 chouaib et al 2018 2019 leong and yokoo 2017 however it is yet to be tested in ungaged catchments given the framework s ability to determine climate and landscape controls on fdc under hypothetical conditions and the significant progress made by doulatyari et al 2015 in its stochastic dynamic approach in ungaged catchments while using only climate and geomorphologic data combinations of such similar frameworks could potentially reveal interesting developments in pub from process based approaches furthermore the underrepresentation of subsurface processes in hydrologic models could be improved by introducing studies that better connect the underground flow mechanisms e g beckers and alila s 2004 study of preferential flow paths in hillslope hydrology 4 3 2 deductive approaches a four part study cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 yaeger et al 2012 ye et al 2012 extended the work of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 to investigate the regional patterns of process controls in us catchments the empirical approach by cheng et al 2012 could characterize the separated flow components of fdc with a small number of parameters three parameter gamma distribution a few interesting points from the study are the recognition of parameter distribution patterns for the separated components across the large study area of continental us useful for regionalization efforts additionally the parameter changes revealed when climate input transitioned from one component to another questioning the impact of climate and catchment characteristics on the dynamic system where precipitation cascades ye et al 2012 explored the process controls impacting the variation in regional patterns of mmf which represents the seasonal variability of runoff an important finding was identifying distributive patterns of different dominant processes across the us therefore the study could assign different models with different levels of complexity for different regions depending on the dominant process in the region for example snowmelt was the dominant process in snowy regions from northeast to northwest thus the assigned models were snow based generally from east to west process controls were due to seasonality and north to south due to aridity and temperature more complex models were needed as catchments became too dry in the south and southwest or had major human influences e g agriculture in the midwest higher levels of model complexity identified in areas dominated by human activity will be important to future models incorporating such impacts on their structures coopersmith et al 2012 empirically developed a catchment classification system based on the similarity of daily mmf and identified six dominant classifications which were primarily influenced by climate seasonality thus indicating that catchment similarity is still dominantly determined by climate instead of any other hydrological property yaeger et al 2012 analyzed and synthesized the empirical approach process based approach and classification system of the three preceding studies the importance of the four pronged study is its ability to show regional patterns of large scale distribution of dominant controls on fdc from empirical and process based approaches this strongly suggests that larger distribution patterns exist e g global scale and presents a pioneering opportunity to investigate the process controls and flow characteristics on a global scale from a unified empirical and process based approaches however these studies could not conclusively justify anomalies with different catchments having the same dominant processes yaeger et al 2012 chouaib et al 2018 investigated these limitations in terms of flow variability they obtained that in regions with high precipitation variability catchments displayed flatter fdcs this was mainly influenced by low elevation high storage capacity and well drained soils that caused high infiltration to the lower layers thus enhancing the base flow while bypassing the interflow layer the catchments with low precipitation variability displayed steep fdcs influenced by steep elevation low storage capacity and low infiltration rates causing dominant subsurface stormflow and surface flow chouaib et al 2019 further investigated the conditions under which mmf could be used to estimate the fdc shape in perennial eastern us catchments fdcs were divided into three sections high middle and low at 33 and 66 exceedance probability intervals see sawicz et al 2011 the catchments were classified as high or low flow variability depending on the slope of the fdc sfdc the study found that estimating fdc with mmf was only possible for the middle section of catchments with low flow variability flatter sfdc see also leong and yokoo 2017 but not in high and low flow sections where there were varying degrees of climate and landscape process interactions furthermore mmf could not be used to estimate any of the three sections in catchments with high flow variability steep sfdc indicating that the seasonality alone is not enough to explain the controls in such catchments due to the level of complex processes existing within it therefore there is a need to have a collective and updated literature on the boundaries and conditions of the levels of complexity in terms of model development especially with model complexity expected to be higher in drier or human impacted areas cheng et al 2012 ye et al 2012 and the need to introduce new data types hrachowitz et al 2013 forecasting even more complex modeling systems few studies have investigated the relationship between model complexity and fdc process controls for example farmer et al 2003 investigated the cause of water balance differences in temperate and semiarid catchments in australia a simple water balance model based on the top down modeling approach klemeš 1983 was gradually increased in complexity to recognize the water balance signatures over different spatial and time scales supported by related studies e g atkinson et al 2002 zhang et al 2008a the study found that the complexity of model structures depends on the climate and changing timescales it means a combination of high aridity and shorter timescales would expect a more complex model than reversing the conditions this finding is essential because a required model structure could explain the relationship between catchment s adaptation to climate and geology sivapalan 2018 it could also provide a better interpretation of this relationship model structural improvements can be a pathway to improve performance the current hydrological environment dominated by fixed model structure results in high inaccuracies and uncertainties in streamflow predictions blöschl et al 2013 for example son and sivapalan 2007 introduced an extra auxiliary input to represent the unsaturated zone time delay the model performance improved and demonstrated the importance of using timing information and new data types to develop model structures earlier atkinson et al 2002 farmer et al 2003 and jothityangkoon et al 2001 examined minimum levels of model complexities by estimating its parameters using only rainfall and runoff data however using only these datasets has been proven to output unrealistic model structures uhlenbrook et al 1999 as earlier mentioned for the need to introduce more timing information in fdcs to improve performance these studies showed that fdc timing information could be indirectly introduced in model structures studies have stressed the importance of applying efficient and effective modes that better capture natural catchment behavior when implementing strategies regarding timing information for instance choosing exponential or power functions in hydrograph recessional analysis matters tashie et al 2020 additionally identifying recession patterns for individual events instead of merged recessions before fitting the recession exponent is essential müller et al 2014 4 3 3 inductive approaches the patterns of how the fdc shape changes between different components of a disaggregated fdc which is precipitation cascading through the dynamic system as high middle and low flows e g cheng et al 2012 emphasize the importance of understanding the connectivity or reliance between these components on a larger scale ghotbi et al 2020a b proposed a framework that measured the dependency between empirically derived fast and slow flows in humid and arid catchments they obtained in both types of catchments the dependency quantified by kendall s τ was dominantly controlled by precipitation and increased as aridity intensified therefore a higher dependency existed in drier catchments than in humid ones explaining the higher level of model complexities needed in such drier areas e g cheng et al 2012 ye et al 2012 although the framework required statistically fitting empirically derived fast and slow flows the study can significantly improve the future of process based studies from its originality in capturing the dependence between flows further investigation is needed to explore the dependencies not only between high and low flows but also as precipitation cascades in different components of a flexible model structure that better represents the full dynamic system process interactions within the hydrologic system are better interpreted in the form of flexible model structures for example an interpretation of the dominant processes that shaped fdc leong and yokoo 2019b found that wet catchments under humid climate conditions had more dominant processes occurring toward deeper underground layers at slower rates illustrating perennial shapes however dry catchments under arid conditions had ephemeral shaped fdcs because they had fewer dominant processes that occurred faster near the surface similar to ye et al 2012 the study also found that catchments with significant differences in climate do not necessarily have the same model structures thus questioning the approach of using fixed model structures in different environments especially in a global context the model structure leong and yokoo 2019b interpreted the processes within the underground layer it was developed from recession analysis of multiple hydrograph separations e g yokoo et al 2017 characterized by unique characteristic time constants per separation similar approaches on the importance of timescales in developing process based models e g carrillo et al 2011 kavetski et al 2011 muneepeerakul et al 2010 son and sivapalan 2007 have contributed to structural improvements and fdc performances the differences are the level of complexities in the representative equations and theoretical assumptions studies have shown a correlation between aridity and model complexity e g cheng et al 2012 farmer et al 2003 ye et al 2012 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 therefore exploring the dependency measure ghotbi et al 2020a b between the flow components of a model structure could be treated to quantify complexities between flow components thus leading to an overall quantification of model structural complexity and potentially measure uncertainty regardless of the spatio temporal scales or specific goals for reproduction or interpretation of fdc these studies have made significant contributions in expanding the knowledge of process controls impacting the fdc shape from the current literature it is quite certain that the high and middle flow parts of fdc are strongly connected to precipitation and seasonality respectively thus both are impacted dominantly by climate however there are still contrasting arguments regarding the middle especially the low flow part i e fdc tails the literature indicates two arguments studies that argue landscape properties are the dominant factor e g geology and soils whereas others still recognize the climate as the dominant control these contrasting studies highlight fragmentation or disconnection in hydrologic literature related to understanding fdc process controls especially for low flows a quantitative measure of how much control a dominant process has in the middle and low flows is yet to be determined thus such a clearer understanding or an affirmative distinction is needed this may require a small scale collaborative effort that specifically works on developing a generalized process based modeling framework for fdcs 4 3 4 flexible modeling frameworks process based model structural improvements have been shown to improve performance and the interpretation of dominant processes impacting fdc e g chouaib et al 2018 2019 farmer et al 2003 son and sivapalan 2007 leong and yokoo 2019b in the context of global scale applicability future improvements to fdc studies potentially lie in the development of robust flexible modeling frameworks that originate from data based modeling concepts with the least uncertainties however developing such robust frameworks will prove challenging as model uncertainty evaluation and realism studies still need significant breakthroughs in hydrologic literature even though quantifying these has been of interest in these past two decades e g butts et al 2004 euser et al 2013 knoben et al 2020 müller and thompson 2016 2019 van emmerick et al 2015 the need for flexible modeling systems is well documented in hydrologic literature beven 2000 blöschl et al 2013 clark et al 2011 2015 coxon et al 2019 mendoza et al 2015 several flexible modeling frameworks have been presented for example decipher coxon et al 2019 which simulates streamflow across a large spatial scale or fuse clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 summa clark et al 2015 marrmot knoben et al 2019 and raven craig 2020 which allows the manipulation of the structure together with parameters and inputs mai et al 2020 however there is still a need for systems that are adjustable or adaptable to changes within the catchments and can also be applied across larger spatial scales beven and alcock 2012 blair et al 2019 blöschl et al 2013 yet few such models exist coxon et al 2019 the hydrological processes that drive transport processes are non stationary and not that well understood beven and alcock 2012 thus it is essential to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions müller and thompson 2016 compared the performance of statistical models against process based models in nepal for stationary and non stationary situations the uncertainties were caused by parameter interpolation and process assumptions for statistical and process based models respectively however the process based models performed better than statistical models especially for non stationary climate situations which are more naturally occurring and important to pub and global scale applicability therefore the challenge of developing flexible process based model structures is to improve the ability to capture the realism of the natural or human impacted environment in catchments for example how to clearly define dominant processes instead of assuming the processes or using non stationary events and nonlinear relationships in place of conventional stationary and linear relationships respectively the introduction of timing information from hydrograph recessional behaviors e g botter 2010 muneepeerakul et al 2010 yilmaz et al 2008 have added more insights into the development and evaluation of flexible modeling frameworks e g fenicia et al 2011 kavetski et al 2011 catchment processes are unique resulting in a unique illustration of the streamflow time series active at different timescales therefore a catchment requires a unique model representing its processes often referred to as the uniqueness of place approach beven 2000 this presents a model choice dilemma with the one model fits all approach knoben et al 2020 which views hydrological processes as the same everywhere regardless of choice often these have a fixed representation of spatial variability e g a single spatial structure or single model structure mai et al 2020 this partly affects model transfer and applications when dealing with water challenges over wide spatial scales coxon et al 2019 for this reason improvements to large scale transferability and applicability of fdc studies require the development of robust flexible modeling frameworks more importantly it also requires developing those that simultaneously satisfy the uniqueness of place and one model fits all approaches a recent study comparing models 36 lumped conceptual model structures across 559 catchments in the us knoben et al 2020 showed that model suitability was less related to catchment descriptors e g geology soil and vegetation and more determined by streamflow regime generated by the catchment such large scale investigations are necessary if the integration of model structural approaches are to determine a common or transferable indicator across a global scale 5 conclusions and future outlook in this paper we presented a collection of fdc literature 2000 2020 highlighting current studies that attempted to relate climate and catchment attributes to reproduce fdc or explain the process controls on the fdc shape we categorized the studies into two groups 1 studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate and 2 studies that improve our process understanding across large spatio temporal scales and domains we intended to show the current trends in each group point out some advantages and major limitations and identify potential future research directions that will contribute to the global scale application of fdc studies due to the enormous volume of literature available on fdc studies within this time frame we acknowledge that some important aspects of the intended review may have been omitted or only briefly discussed additionally others whose contents are dense and are only generally referred to will warrant a more thorough review the following points present a few highlights taken from this review paper studies that develop accurate and reliable prediction tools targeting specific regions and hydro climate continue to dominate fdc studies due to their versatility in directly addressing immediate local needs thus making such approaches popular among water specialists although few studies have successfully attempted to transfer apply developed models to different areas the success of these studies are generally at smaller or regional scales the developed models are often confined to the regions where they were developed since such approaches have already been deemed successful in those areas the new challenge is developing and improving empirical models that can be successfully transferred and consistently applied on large scales this is important for countries that rely on the expertise and professionalism of hydrologically resourceful nations to improve water resource management and policymaking a small group of studies attempted to investigate the fdc process controls on a larger scale empirically they have suggested emerging patterns which are promising and require more attention thus it may be more worthwhile for large scale applications to develop an empirical understanding of large scale process distribution instead of repeating the general trend of simply developing empirical functions at smaller scales the benefit of using a large pool of catchments is evident if we explore process heterogeneity as a major challenge to fdc studies however only few studies have used large e g continental datasets more effort is required to apply a larger pool of catchments and a larger distribution of catchments the latter may be more important furthermore the current success of small scale or regional studies is often due to the homogenous treatment of catchments producing results that range within a status quo as a small step toward expanding areal coverage better evaluating homogenous results and reducing biases research may need to intentionally introduce anomalies that are disconnected from the study to incite constructive arguments this will expand the study coverage and provide better comparative and contrastive analysis within the study group such initiative would raise new questions test large scale applicability and draw interest to lesser studied areas especially in non resourceful developing countries despite the hydrological community s advocating of readily available and accessible data non resourceful countries still lag in providing such a service if significant progress is to be made these areas require better administrative policies on having their data freely available and accessible online this is clear in the lack of representation in fdc literature for developing island countries where data are usually not freely accessible with further administrative requirements and procedures potentially deflecting interest furthermore innovative and alternative data sources e g citizen data and crowdsourcing which will improve the hydrological agenda in such countries require development and suitable implementation techniques lastly scarce literature exists on islands and there is a need to pay the same level of attention to island hydrology as is given to continental hydrology within the past two decades much has been understood about processes controlling different fdc sections however there are still contrasting arguments on whether fdc low flows i e fdc tail are controlled by climate or landscape properties despite the amount of process knowledge gained on the generating mechanisms of low flows this shows the fragmentation of fdc studies that may require a small collaborative effort by concerned researchers to develop a general framework for process based modeling of fdcs past reviews e g hrachowitz et al 2013 smakhtin 2001 highlighted the need for anthropogenic inclusivity in hydrological modeling however there have been few advancements in fdc studies when quantifying human impact on water resources especially from a process based perspective such impacts are increasingly becoming part of the internal hydrological system if necessary in the future human activities may need to be potentially considered as an artificial dominant surface process and introduced with new data types as part of the hydrological modeling system the development of better flexible modeling frameworks could contribute to the successful transfer and application of fdc studies globally several studies have recently evaluated the performances of empirical and process based approaches and collectively suggested that combining these two approaches improves performances therefore further exploration and strategies of model combinations between the two approaches and the development of new robust flexible modeling frameworks could significantly help progress fdc studies in larger spatial scales especially in non stationary environments the major weakness of fdc is its failure to synchronically capture the timing information of streamflow however recent improvements in indirectly introducing timing information in empirical and process based approaches increase performance for reproduction or interpretation for example process based approaches have used better timing detail as part of the model structural development therefore new innovative approaches are required to include timing information while understanding the intricacies of the choices in the timing details e g timescales
